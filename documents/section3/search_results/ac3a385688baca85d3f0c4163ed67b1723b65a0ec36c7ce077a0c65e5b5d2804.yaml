    Open access 14 November 2019 Introduction The most significant challenges affecting
    a country''s long-term social, economic, and environmental well-being stem from
    natural disasters. This includes extreme hydro-meteorological events like cloudbursts
    and excessive rainfall, which, due to their severe complications and intensity,
    have become a focal point of research, particularly in mountainous areas. The
    exploration of these events is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate their
    impact for mountainous region1. In the Himalayan context, the discernment of topographical
    intricacies assumes paramount importance due to their potential rapid escalation
    into calamitous events2. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of hydrological
    challenges and water resource resilience becomes imperative, as these phenomena
    manifest in diverse catastrophic forms3. To delineate and analyze these hydrological
    challenges and resilience, hydrological modeling emerges as a crucial tool. The
    efficacy of such modeling is contingent upon the utilization of high-resolution
    geospatial data, particularly within the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)
    framework. This integration enhances precision in water resource management, addressing
    the intricacies posed by the challenging Himalayan terrain4. This aligns with
    the study of Patel et al. 20225, who concentrate on the 2013 Uttarakhand flash
    floods, underlining the importance of hydrological assessments and the development
    of disaster preparedness strategies in the region. The catastrophic nature of
    flash floods caused by cloud bursts and landslides in mountainous regions is highlighted
    as the most devastating natural disaster6. Instances of such disasters precipitate
    multifaceted consequences, encompassing loss of life, infrastructural degradation,
    and disruption of financial operations. Mitigating these adversities necessitates
    the systematic monitoring and analysis of flood events. A historical examination
    underscores the pivotal role of floods, emerging as the foremost impactful natural
    calamity, with an annual average impact on over 80 million individuals globally
    over the past few decades. The substantial global impact, as evidenced by floods
    contributing to annual economic losses exceeding US$11 million worldwide7, is
    further underscored by the difficulty in collecting information on land use, topography,
    and hydro-meteorological conditions. Anticipating an increased frequency of precipitation
    extremes and associated flooding in Asia, Africa, and Southeast Asia in the coming
    decades, this challenge has prompted a debate on the necessary adaptations in
    flood management policies to address this evolving reality8. India, facing the
    highest flood-related fatalities among Asian countries9,10, encounters heightened
    vulnerability to disaster threats. This susceptibility is further exacerbated
    by the country''s extensive geographic variability, making the development and
    implementation of a climate response strategy considerably more challenging11.
    The Indian Himalayan Region, being crucial to the national water, energy, and
    food linkage due to its variety of political, economic, social, and environmental
    systems, is uniquely vulnerable to hydro-meteorological catastrophes, including
    floods, cloudbursts, glacier lake eruptions, and landslides12,13,14,15. During
    monsoon season the cloud burst is increasing in the Himalayan region.This phenomenon
    is closely tied to the unique climatic conditions prevalent in the Himalayas during
    this period. Monsoons in this region bring intense and sustained rainfall, characterized
    by the convergence of moisture-laden air masses, especially from the Bay of Bengal,
    attributing to landslides, debris flows, and flash flooding16. These result in
    significant loss of life, property, infrastructure, agriculture, forest cover,
    and communication systems17. In 2013, the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand experienced
    devastating floods and landslides due to multiple heavy rainfall spells17,18.
    On February 7th, 2021, a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier in Uttarakhand''s Chamoli
    district broke off, causing an unanticipated flood19,20,21. During this sudden
    flood, 15 people were killed, and 150 went missing. These disasters have disrupted
    the Himalayan ecology in several states, including Uttarakhand, and the cause
    and magnitude of these disasters have been made worse by human activities, including
    building highways, dams, and deforestation22. When we check the flood record of
    Uttarakhand, Himalaya, the area has experienced catastrophes during 1970, 1986,
    1991, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017,
    2019, 2020, and 2021, making them among the most significant natural disasters
    to have struck Uttarakhand16,21. The rising trend of the synoptic scale of Western
    Disturbance (WD) activity and precipitation extremes over the Western Himalayan
    (WH) region during the last few decades is the result of human-induced climate
    change, and these changes cannot be fully explained by natural forcing alone.
    This phenomenon is observed over the large expanse of the high-elevation eastern
    Tibetan Plateau, where a higher surface warming in response to climate change
    is noted compared to the western side22,23. Since the Industrial Revolution, the
    Himalaya and the Tibetan plateau have warmed at an increased rate of 0.2 degrees
    each decade (1951–2014)24. In the Himalayan region, the mean surface temperature
    has increased by almost 0.5˚C during 2000–2014. This alteration in climate (temperature)
    has resulted in a decrease in the amount of apples produced in low-altitude portions
    of the Himalaya. The warming of the planet is directly responsible for these effects.
    The Himalayan region has experienced a decline in pre-monsoon precipitation towards
    the end of the century, leading to new societal challenges for local farmers due
    to the socioeconomic shifts that have taken place25. Simultaneously, there has
    been an increase in the highest recorded temperature observed throughout the monsoon
    season. In tandem with heightened levels of precipitation, an elevation in the
    maximum attainable temperature has the potential to amplify the occurrence of
    torrential rainfall events during the monsoon season26. This long-term change
    in atmospheric parameters, known as climate change, may affect river hydrology
    and biodiversity. The associated shifts in climate pose a significant risk to
    hydropower plants if certain climate change scenarios materialize. As part of
    this broader context, the dilemma of spring disappearance should be thoroughly
    analyzed to provide scientific, long-term remedies and mitigation strategies for
    potential hydrogeological disasters. This is crucial due to the observed increase
    in the frequency of landslides, avalanches, and flash floods in recent years24.
    El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO)
    play a crucial role in the teleconnection of India''s Monsoon, as well as in determining
    rainfall patterns and the occurrence of flash floods across different regions
    of India. At a regional level, a study was conducted to examine the impact of
    various types of climatic fluctuations on the onset dates of the monsoon. Northern
    India, specifically northern northwest India, referred to as SR15, consistently
    experiences a delayed start to its seasons, regardless of the climatic phase27.
    The occurrence of significant anomalies in sea surface temperatures (SST) in the
    tropical Pacific region, associated with ENSO and EQUINOO, is accompanied by large-scale
    tropical Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies related to the Southern Oscillation
    (SO)28,29. The Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EIO) represents the oscillation
    between these two states, manifested in pressure gradients and wind patterns along
    the equator (EQUINOO). The negative anomaly of the zonal component of surface
    wind in the equatorial Indian Ocean region (60°–90°, 2.5° S—2.5° N) is the foundation
    for the EQUINOO index30. Additionally, they demonstrated that between 1979 and
    2002, any season with excessive rainfall or drought could be \"explained\" in
    terms of the favorable or unfavorable phase of either the EQUINOO, the ENSO, or
    both. For instance, in 1994, EQUINOO was favorable, but ENSO was negative, resulting
    in above-average rainfall in India. Conversely, ENSO was favorable, EQUINOO was
    unfavorable between 1979 and 1985, and India saw below-average rainfall. They,
    therefore, proposed that by combining those two climate indices, it would be possible
    to increase the predictability of rainfall during the Indian monsoon. The quantity
    of rainfall throughout a storm event that might cause a significant discharge
    in a particular river segment is known as a \"rainfall threshold\"31,32. Different
    techniques, indicators, and predictor variables can be used to derive rainfall
    thresholds. There are four categories of methodology: empirical, hydrological/hydrodynamic,
    probabilistic, and compound approaches. Empirical rainfall thresholds are among
    the most popular methods for constructing EWS in local, regional, and national
    areas33,34,35. Empirical methods use historical flood reports and rainfall amounts
    to perform a correlation analysis linking the frequency of event to the amount
    and length of essential precipitation36,37,38. Several empirical rainfall threshold
    curves may be found in literature from various countries32,39,40,41. Although
    this research concentrated on various shallow landslides and mudflows, flash flood
    risk systems can be set using actual rainfall thresholds42. Similarly, the principles
    of the Flood Risk Guideline (FFG) method serve as the foundation for hydrogeological
    precipitation limits30,41,43,44. The fundamental concept of FFG is to use reverse
    hydrologic modelling to identify the precipitation that produces the slightest
    flood flow at the basin outlet. Alerts are sent out whenever the threshold is
    exceeded for a specific time for the real-time actual daily rainfall or the precipitation
    forecast. This method needs data on precipitation collected using radar or real-time
    rainfall sensors45,46. Other threshold approaches for rainfall, however, require
    the same data. The modelling of various synthetic photographs, regionally dispersed
    models, and the prior soil moisture status have all been incorporated into the
    FFG, which is widely used worldwide46. Hydraulic models have been developed recently,
    allowing the threshold to be determined by the canal design, features, and the
    link between the achieved water table and the inundated area47,48. Recent flood
    events underscore the inadequacy of relying solely on structural safeguards for
    comprehensive protection against such catastrophes. The imperative for an effective
    flood management approach becomes paramount to preemptively mitigate these calamities
    and ensure sustainable safety measures. The present study generates rainfall product
    that uses real-time satellite data from Meteosat-8 to summarize the significant
    short-lived localised multiple rainfall events that result flash flooding in the
    Nainital, Uttrakhand, during October 202148. This method was utilized to investigate
    the flood events over J&K 201449. Rajasthan in 201950 and Bihar and Assam in 201951.
    This study introduces a pioneering approach by precisely measuring the peak rainfall
    hours and correlating them with daily rainfall, elucidating their direct correlation
    with flash flooding in the study area. A distinctive feature of this research
    is its integration of time series rainfall data with socioeconomic metrics to
    underscore the significant damage caused by a major flash flood incident. The
    exploration of the role of sheer slope in flooding provides a unique angle to
    flood dynamics. Additionally, the study delves into pre-atmospheric parameters
    specific to the study area that played a pivotal role in initiating flash flooding.
    By shedding light on these intricate details, this study establishes itself as
    a trailblazer in disaster mitigation strategies, emphasizing its pivotal role
    in advancing our understanding of flash flood dynamics and fortifying disaster
    response frameworks. Study area The economic and climatic conditions of India
    are intricately linked to the region of Himalaya, renowned for its delicate ecosystems
    and geological intricacies52. Spanning a vast area, the Indian, Himalaya is among
    the recent mountain ranges on the surface of earth, marked by the study delves
    into the vulnerability of the region of Himalaya, examining the intricate interplay
    of geographical and atmospheric parameters in flash flood occurrences. The area
    has susceptibility to geological hazards, topographical nuances, biodiversity,
    and water resource dynamics53. Geographically positioned between latitudes 28.44°
    to 31.28°N and longitudes 77.35° to 81.01°E, with elevations ranging from 7409
    to 174 m, Uttarakhand, depicted in Fig. 1, covers 53,483 square kilometers. Approximately
    64% of the land is forested, and 93% is mountainous terrain, bordered by Himachal
    Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, China, and Nepal. Serving as the source of major rivers,
    the state encompasses six significant basins: Yamuna, Alaknanda, Ganga, Kali,
    Bhagirathi, and Ramganga. Data analysis utilized Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
    information obtained from Earth Explorer (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov) via
    Arc GIS Version 10.5, as shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1 (a) Showing Uttarakhand North
    western Himalayan state of India (b) Nainital district of Uttarakhand with Digital
    elevation model. Full size image Climate characteristics The climate of study
    area exhibits notable variations, ranging from humid subtropical conditions in
    the Terai region to tundra-like environments in the Greater Himalaya. Substantial
    transformations occur across the landscape, with high altitudes housing glaciers
    and lower elevations supporting subtropical forests. Annual precipitation contributes
    nourishing snowfall to the Himalaya, particularly above 3000 meters54. Temperature
    variations are influenced by elevation, geographical position, slope, and topographical
    factors. In March and April, southern areas experience average maximum temperature
    between 34 °C and 38 °C, with average minimum temperatures ranging from 20 °C
    to 24 °C. Temperatures peak in May and June, reaching up to 42 °C in the lowlands
    and around 30 °C at elevations exceeding two kilometers. A decline in temperatures
    begins in late September, reaching their lowest points in January and early February,
    with January being the coldest month. Southern regions and river valleys witness
    an average maximum temperature of approximately 20 °C and an average minimum temperature
    of about 6 °C, while elevation of 2 km above sea level range from 10 °C to 12
    °C55. Materials and methodology Radar is used to collect the rainfall observation
    remotely. A rain gauge is a conventional method located on the ground for recording
    rainfall depth in millimeters. Radar systems and rain gauges are standard equipment
    for tracking significant rainfall events. If there is a widespread, uniform network
    of rain gauges, it is possible to monitor rainfall accurately unfortunately, there
    is no such system in Nainital, Uttarakhand, or other parts of India. With the
    diverse topography of Nainital, Uttrakhand, it is challenging to observe accuracy
    for extreme rainfall events using radar and rain gauge stations. Satellite observation
    is the only tool available for monitoring these events. The extreme rainfall event
    over Nainital, Uttarakhand, was tracked in this study using hourly measurements
    of rainfall from Meteosat-8 geostationary satellite data. Hourly rainfall measurement
    was estimated at five kilometres by integrating observation from the Meteosat-8
    satellite with space-borne precipitation Radar (PR) from the tropical rainfall
    measuring mission (TRMM). To estimate rainfall using Meteosat-8 IR and water vapour
    (WV) channels at 5 km resolution, we have employed the rain index-based technique
    created by Mishra, 201248. The techniques use TRMM (Tropical rainfall Measuring
    Mission), space-borne precipitation radar (PR), and Meteosat-8 multispectral satellite
    data to create the rain analysis. The technique uses Infrared and water vapour
    observation from Meteosat-8 on 17, 18 and 19 October 2021 to estimate the amount
    of rainfall over the Nainital, Uttarakhand. By using the infrared (IR) and water
    vapour (WV) channel observations from Meteosat-8, a new rain index (RI) was computed.
    The procedure for calculating the rain index is as follows. Non-rainy clouds are
    filtered out using spatial and temporal gradient approach and brightness temperature
    from thermal Infrared (TIR) and WV are collocated against rainfall from precipitation
    radar (PR) to derive non-rainy thresholds of brightness temperature from TIR and
    WV channels. Now TIR and WV rain coefficient is computed by dividing the brightness
    temperature from TIR and WV channels with non-rainy thresholds. The TIR ad WV,
    rain coefficient product, is defined as the rain index (RI). RI is collocated
    against rainfall from PR to develop a relationship between rainfall and RI using
    large data sets of heavy rainfall events during the monsoon season of multiple
    years. The following equation is developed between rain rate (RR) and RI: $${\\text{RR
    }} = a + \\, \\left( {b \\times {\\text{ RI}}^{c} } \\right).$$ (1) Finally, the
    rainfall rate (RR) is calculated using Eq. (1). For the Indian subcontinent, a,
    b, and c are calculated as a = 8.4969, b = 2.7362, and c = 4.27. Using RI generated
    from Meteosat-8 measurements, this model may be used to estimate hourly rainfall.
    The current equation (I) was verified using observations from a strong network
    of ground-based rain gauges. Hourly rain gauge readings over India during the
    south-west monsoon season were observed to have a correlation coefficient of 0.70,
    a bias of 1.37 mm/h, a root mean square error of 3.98 mm/h, a chance of detection
    of 0.87, a false alarm ratio of 0.13, and a skill score of 0.2248. The method
    used by Mishra48 outperformed other methods for examining the diurnal aspects
    of heavy rain over India compared to currently available worldwide rainfall statistics.
    If both satellite spectral responses to the channels used to produce the rain
    signatures are similar, the equation developed to estimate rainfall using the
    rain signature from one satellite can also be used to estimate rainfall using
    the rain signature from another satellite. Within the framework of this investigation,
    Meteosat-8 Second Generation (MSG) measurements were harnessed to scrutinize rainfall
    characteristics with a heightened focus on fine geographical and temporal scales.
    Employing the mentioned technique facilitated the calculation of spatial rainfall
    distribution, as well as the meticulous quantification of hourly and daily rainfall.
    Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis of cumulative rainfall was conducted, unraveling
    nuanced patterns and trends within the meteorological data. Following an in-depth
    examination of intense rainfall episodes, the atmospheric datasets, incorporating
    cloud optical thickness, total precipitable water vapor, and aerosol optical depth,
    were procured from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications,
    the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and the National Centre
    for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). These datasets underwent meticulous scrutiny
    to unravel the intricate interconnections between atmospheric parameters and heavy
    rainfall, specifically flash flooding, across the study area. The central objective
    was to decipher the meteorological conditions catalyzing the genesis of a low-pressure
    system, subsequently triggering heightened convective activities. To comprehend
    the dynamics of aerosols within the study domain, trajectory analysis through
    HYSPLIT was implemented, elucidating trajectories and dispersion patterns of aerosols
    for comprehensive insights. To comprehensively comprehend episodes of heavy rainfall
    in the Nainital region of Uttarakhand, particularly during the flash flooding
    events of October 2021, this study systematically delves into pre-flood parameters.
    The investigation focuses on Nainital and systematically analyzes time series
    rainfall data (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications)
    spanning from 2000 to 2021. Monthly rainfall for each year and the long-term mean
    (accumulated rainfall) were meticulously calculated. Robust statistical tests
    applied to the time series data unveiled trends, indicating a non-significant
    increase overall, except for a notable decrease in July. The study further integrates
    Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) topographic data and the total number
    of cloud burst events (https://dehradun.nic.in/) to elucidate the role of elevation
    in cloud burst occurrences. Exploring the relationship between elevation, annual
    rainfall, and maximum temperature, the research establishes critical links between
    heavy rainfall episodes, flash flooding, and associated loss of lives from 2010
    to 2022. The study strategically correlates these aspects with time-series data,
    presenting instances of heavy rainfall and rapid-onset flooding. Utilizing Meteosat-8
    data and remote sensing, our research pioneers dynamic flash flood analysis, shedding
    light on the pivotal roles played by atmospheric and geographic parameters. The
    time series precipitation data, spanning from 2001 to 2021, underwent rigorous
    trend analysis employing statistical methodologies, including Autocorrelation
    function (ACF), Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Modified Mann–Kendall test, and Sen''s
    slope (q) estimator. These analyses were conducted to elucidate and characterize
    the prevailing trends within the rainfall dataset over the specified temporal
    interval. Autocorrelation function (ACF) Autocorrelation or serial dependency
    is one of the severe drawbacks for analyzing and detecting trends of time series
    data. The existence of autocorrelation in the time series data may affect MK test
    statistic variance (S)56,57. Hence, the ACF at lag-1 was calculated using the
    following equation. $$r_{k} = \\frac{{\\sum _{{k = 1}}^{{N - K}} \\left( {x_{p}
    - \\overline{{x_{p} }} } \\right)\\left( {x_{{p + k}} - \\overline{{x_{{p + k}}
    }} } \\right)}}{{\\left[ {\\sum\\limits_{{k = 1}}^{{n - k}} {\\left( {x_{p} -
    \\overline{{x_{p} }} } \\right)^{2} \\left( {x_{{t + k}} - \\overline{{x_{{p +
    k}} }} } \\right)^{2} } } \\right]^{{0.5}} }},$$ (2) where, \\({r}_{k}\\) denotes
    the ACF (autocorrelation function) at lag k, \\({x}_{t}\\) and \\({x}_{p}\\) is
    the utilized rainfall data, \\(\\overline{x}\\) denotes the mean of utilized data
    \\(\\left({x}_{p}\\right)\\),\\(N\\) signify the total length of the time-series
    (\\({x}_{p})\\), k refers to the maximum lag. Mann–Kendall (MK) test In hydroclimatic
    investigations, the MK test is extensively employed for evaluating trends58,59,60.
    The-MK test61,62 was conferred by the World-Meteorological-Organization (WMO),
    which has a number of benefits63. The following equations can be used to construct
    MK test-statistic $$S=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\cdot \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} {\\text{sign}}\\left({x}_{p}-{x}_{q}\\right)$$
    (3) In Eq. (5), n denotes the size of the sample, whereas \\({x}_{p}\\) and-\\({x}_{q}\\)
    denote consecutive data within a series. $${\\text{sign}}\\left({x}_{p}-{x}_{q}\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}+1&
    \\text{ when }\\left({x}_{p}-{x}_{q}\\right)>0\\\\ 0& \\text{ when }\\left({x}_{p}-{x}_{q}\\right)=0\\\\
    -1& \\text{ when }\\left({x}_{p}-{x}_{q}\\right)<0\\end{array}\\right.$$ (4) The
    variance of \\(S\\) is assessed in the following way $${\\text{Var}}\\left(S\\right)=s\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(2n+5\\right)-\\sum_{p-1}^{q}{t}_{p}\\left({t}_{p}-1\\right)\\left(2{t}_{p}+5\\right)/18$$

    and discussion The Himalaya, renowned for their massive size and elevated altitude,
    possess distinctive geological characteristics that render them vulnerable to
    sudden and intense floods67. These rapid floods are the outcome of a combination
    of natural and human factors, including geological movements, glacial lakes, steep
    topography, deforestation, alterations in land usage, and the monsoon season68.
    In the Himalayan region, the primary trigger for these abrupt floods is often
    linked to instances of cloud bursts accompanied by heavy rainfall episodes69.
    This study aims to provide insight into historical and recent instances of significant
    rainfall that have resulted in flash floods, while also examining the relationship
    between these events with atmospheric and other relevant factors. The study also
    elaborates on the discussion on flash flooding on the 17th, 18 and 19 October
    2021. In Fig. 2 we have illustrated the elevation and cloud burst events that
    occurred between 2020 and 2021 across different districts in Uttarakhand, Himalaya.
    The elevation map (Fig. 2), was generated by Arc GIS 10.5. Using cloud burst data
    from (https://dehradun.nic.in/). After statistical analyses, the same data was
    imported to Arc GIS 10.5 and was shown in the form of Fig. 2. The figure underscores
    that the northern areas, located within the central portion of Uttarakhand, witnessed
    a higher frequency of cloud bursts compared to the southern areas. The observed
    divergence, attributed to steeper slopes in the northern region as opposed to
    the southern region, is further complemented by an intriguing revelation in our
    study70. Specifically, we noted significantly fewer cloud burst events in the
    areas of both lower and sharply higher elevations during the period of 2020–2021,
    particularly when compared with the occurrences at medium elevations from (1000
    to 2500)m illustrated in Fig. 2. Thus, emphasizing a noteworthy and substantiated
    relationship between cloud bursts and elevation70. Figure 2 Location map of cloudbursts
    hit area from 2020 to 2021 over Uttrakhand. Full size image Within the specified
    timeframe, a total of 30 significant cloudburst incidents were documented during
    2020–2021, with 17 of these incidents transpiring in 2021. Among the districts,
    Uttarkashi recorded the highest number of cloudburst occurrences (07), trailed
    by Chamoli with 05 incidents, while Dehradun and Pithoragarh each registered 04
    instances. Rudraprayag accounted for 03 incidents, whereas Tehri, Almora, and
    Bageshwar each reported 01 cloudburst occurrence, according to reports from the
    Dehradun District Administration and the India Meteorological Department in 2021.
    Due to high topography, the area has faced many flash flood events in history.
    Figure 3 presents a graphical representation of the total monthly rainfall data
    for the Nainital district in Uttarakhand from 2000 to 2021. The graph reveals
    the amount of rainfall received each month throughout this period. A noteworthy
    observation from the graph is that most of the years between 2000 and 2021 experienced
    substantial rainfall, with the majority surpassing 300 mm. However, 2010 is an
    exceptional case of rainfall in the Nainital area. The region received an astounding
    500 mm monthly rainfall during this particular year. This extraordinary amount
    of rainfall was unprecedented and broke the records of the last few decades. Such
    a significant monthly rainfall level had not been observed in the region for quite
    some time. The spike in rainfall during 2010 might have considerably impacted
    the local environment, water bodies, and overall hydrological conditions in the
    area. Given the intensity of the rainfall, It could have caused flooding, landslides,
    and other related hazards. The data presented in Fig. 3 is crucial for understanding
    the long-term trends and patterns of rainfall in Nainital over the past two decades.
    In Fig. 3, another intriguing aspect emerges, shedding light on the fact that
    the South-west monsoon exhibits its peak rainfall during the months of June, July,
    August, and September across the study area.(https://mausam.imd.gov.in/Forecast/mcmarq/mcmarq_data/SW_MONS
    OON_2022_UK.pdf).The region could be subject to recurring heavy rainfall episodes,
    potentially resulting in flash flooding over specific temporal intervals. Figure

    a visual representation of the long-term average of monthly recorded rainfall
    data in the study area from 2000 to 2021 to gain insight into the average rainfall
    during the same timeframe. The graph illustrates a significant rise in the average
    long-term rainfall within the study area. This increase is particularly notable
    during the months spanning from June to September. Notably, the figure underscores
    that during the years 2000 to 2021, the months of July and August in the area
    witnessed multiple heavy rainfall episodes due to monsoon. For these two months,
    the long-term average surpasses the 300 mm mark. In our results and discussion,
    we unravel the ramifications of persistent and substantial rainfall throughout
    these crucial months. The enduring deluge sets in motion a series of impactful
    consequences, ranging from escalated surface runoff and heightened river discharge
    to the looming specter of rapid flooding and landslides. This intricate web of
    effects intricately influences the stability of the soil, the vitality of vegetation,
    and the delicate balance within local ecosystems71. The findings highlighted in
    Fig. (3 and 4) underscore the critical significance of examining monthly rainfall
    data to comprehend the relationship with average monthly rainfall trends from
    (2000–2021) in the Himalayan region. The figure specifically draws attention to
    the months characterized by substantial rainfall, which may have result in disasters
    such as flash flooding and landslides. So we have concluded the study area may
    have received flash flooding by heavy rainfall during June to September (2000–2021).The
    daily rainfall data from 2001 to 2021 was allowed for non parametric trend analyses
    using Mann–Kendall test, Sen’s slope analysis. Modified Mann–Kendall and autocorrelation
    function for trend analysis. Figure 4 Accumulated rainfall (Long-term mean) over
    the Study area. Full size image Our analysis delved into daily rainfall data,
    downloaded from (ww.nasa.giovanni.com). We aimed to discern trends in key parameters,
    including monthly rainfall during the monsoon season (June to September), monsoon
    season data, annual rainfall, heavy rainfall events (> 50 mm/Day), and the number
    of wet days (> 2.5 mm/Day). Table 1 provides a comprehensive analysis of rainfall
    trends and extreme rainfall events from 2000 to 2021. In June, a negative autocorrelation
    was observed, and the findings are statistically significant at a 95% confidence
    level, so we considered modified MK test instead of original MK test. Employing
    the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test (MK/mMK) for trend analysis, our findings
    revealed a general non-significant increasing trend, with the exception of July,
    which exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend. Noteworthy was the significant
    increase in the number of wet days at a 0.05% significance level. Sen’s slope
    analysis further emphasized an annual increase in rainfall at a rate of 4.558
    mm. These results provide valuable insights into the evolving rainfall patterns
    in the studied region, with implications for understanding climate variations.

    Topographic influence on rainfall and temperature over the study area Exploring
    the realm of abundant rainfall at lofty Himalayan elevations delves into the captivating
    interplay between topography and the dynamic shifts in atmospheric parameters.
    Our investigation ventures beyond the surface, intricately analyzing the elevations
    across diverse districts within our study area. Figure 5 serves as a visual gateway,
    unraveling the fascinating discourse on how these elevational nuances weave a
    compelling narrative of change, orchestrating the dance between rainfall patterns
    and temperature shifts across our meticulously examined landscape. Using Fig.
    5, we can correlate the significant relationship between the amount of rainfall
    and the topography over the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand. The figure distinctly
    delineates various districts of Uttarakhand, such as Bageshwar, Chamoli, Nainital,
    Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag, and Tehri Garhwal, positioned at elevations surpassing
    7000 m. The presented data establishes a conspicuous correlation between the received
    rainfall and the elevated nature of these districts, showcasing those areas above
    7000 m experience substantial annual rainfall exceeding 1500 mm. This correlation
    underscores the notable influence of elevation on the precipitation patterns in
    the Himalayan region. Higher elevations tend to attract more moisture from the
    atmosphere, leading to increased rainfall72. Figure 5 Topographic influence on
    the atmospheric parameter (Temperature and rainfall). Full size image Figure 5,
    in conjunction with the citation of Rafiq et al. 201673, emphasizes the significant
    connection between mean maximum temperature and elevation within the Himalayan
    region. The figure illustrates that as elevation increases, there is a corresponding
    decline in mean maximum temperature. This well-known phenomenon is called the
    \"lapse rate,\" which describes the temperature decrease with rising altitude.
    Areas above 7000 m experience notably lower temperatures than those at lower elevations.
    The lapse rate is a fundamental climatic characteristic particularly relevant
    in mountainous terrains like the Himalaya. As air ascends along the slopes, it
    cools down due to decreasing atmospheric pressure, forming clouds through condensation.
    These clouds subsequently contribute to rainfall, as discussed in the study by
    Wang Keyi et al.72. Higher elevations experience a more pronounced temperature
    decrease, resulting in elevated rainfall levels. The steep slopes in the Himalayan
    region significantly correlate with the number of casualties resulting from cloud
    bursts, landslides, and flash floods caused by heavy rainfall events. The presence
    of steep gradients exacerbates the impact of sudden and intense rainfall, leading
    to flash floods and landslides. Topography is crucial in disasters, particularly
    flash flooding and landslides, commonly observed in the Himalayan region2. These
    natural disasters have resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood, as
    depicted in Fig. 6. Over 300 casualties were reported due to landslides, flash
    flooding, and cloud bursts in Uttarakhand during 2021. From 2010 and 2013, the
    loss was restricted to nearly 230 causalities each year. The Himalayan steep gradients
    are especially vulnerable to the effects of rainfall and climate change74. Figure
    6 Number of human lives lost during heavy rainfall episodes in Uttrakhand. Full
    size image Moreover, these mountainous regions'' ecological and socioeconomic
    systems are becoming increasingly vulnerable due to the rising human population2.
    These disasters cause severe damage to infrastructure, properties, human lives,
    and the environment. Furthermore, they can exacerbate other hardships, including
    the spread of diseases, financial instability, environmental degradation, and
    social conflicts74. In summary, the steep slopes in the Himalayan region play
    a critical role in the occurrence and severity of disasters such as flash floods
    and landslides. The susceptibility of these areas to heavy rainfall and climate
    impacts poses significant challenges for ecological and socioeconomic systems,
    particularly with the increasing human population. The aftermath of these disasters
    is far-reaching and extends beyond the immediate loss of life and property, affecting
    various aspects of human life and the environment in the region. Flash flood event
    during October 2021 As delineated in Fig. 7, our investigation reveals a distinctive
    pattern in precipitation dynamics. Traditionally, the region encounters heightened
    rainfall exclusively from June to September, aligning with the monsoon season.
    Flash flooding, consequently, primarily manifests during this period. However,
    the anomalous occurrence in October 2021 is unprecedented in our dataset. For
    the first time, our analysis, depicted in Fig. 7, captures the manifestation of
    intense rainfall episodes leading to flash flooding in the Nainital region, Uttarakhand.
    As this was the rare case the study area has received heavy raifnall during month
    of october 2021. This may be due to western distribuance that area very rarely
    is receiving. The infrequency of such events in the area may be attributed to
    the rarity of western disturbances impacting the region. Utilizing the technique
    developed by Mishra48, we conducted the study to map daily monthly and spatial
    distribution of rainfall amount using Meteosat-8 data. The study employs real-time
    monitoring to track and analyze flash flooding, shedding light on the atmospheric
    parameters that contributed to the occurrence of this unique episode. During October
    2021, the region of Nainital, Uttarakhand experienced a series of rainfall events.
    From 12 to 15 September 2021, the area witnessed the development of low-pressure
    systems from the Bay of Bengal, as documented in the IMD Report 2021. This convergence
    of low-pressure systems led to several episodes of heavy rainfall over the Himalayan
    region74. Unfortunately, the consequences of these multiple rainfall episodes
    were severe, causing flash flooding and triggering landslides in various parts
    of the Indian Himalaya. Over the past few decades, there has been a noticeable
    upward trend in flash flooding incidents, particularly in the Himalayan region,
    which can be attributed to the effects of climate change75. As global temperatures
    rise and weather patterns become more erratic, the delicate balance of the Himalayan
    ecosystem is being disrupted, leading to intensified rainfall events and a higher
    risk of natural disasters like flash floods and landslides. These alarming changes
    underscore the urgent need for climate action and measures to address the impacts
    of climate change on vulnerable regions like the Himalaya. In October 2021, Nainital,
    Uttarakhand experienced an unusual and devastating flood event, an occurrence
    that is typically rare during this particular month. The torrential floodwaters
    swept away numerous homes and disrupted transportation networks, leaving the region
    in turmoil. In response to this calamity, various defence groups, such as the
    army and national defense forces, were promptly deployed to the Himalayan state
    to conduct rescue operations for residents and tourists. The impact of the flood
    was further exacerbated by landslides, which severed many districts from the rest
    of the region, as roads were blocked by mud and debris. The region''s vulnerability
    to such natural disasters can be traced back to historical records, as it has
    been experiencing substantial rainfall since as early as 185776. During 17th,
    18th, and 19th of October 2021 a series of heavy rainfall episodes in Nainital,
    Uttarakhand, leading to flash flooding and landslides. The dire consequences resulted
    in widespread destruction of both lives and livelihoods2. Figure 7 highlights
    the visual representation of rainfall distribution over three days. The illustration
    provides valuable insights into the amount and pattern of rainfall that occurred
    during this critical period. Notably, the data reveals a remarkable occurrence
    on the 18th and 19th of October, where the study area experienced an abrupt 270
    mm of rainfall. This substantial rainfall in just two days is an alarming and
    unprecedented event, signifying the intensity and severity of the weather system
    that hit the region. Moreover, it is essential to note that the 270 mm rainfall
    figure is not solely confined to those two days but is the cumulative result of
    heavy rainfall from multiple rainy spells that persisted during the specified
    period. The confluence of these rain events led to an overwhelming deluge, which
    became a primary driver of the extreme flooding that engulfed Nainital, Uttarakhand.
    Figure 7 Time series heavy rainfall episodes over the Study area. Full size image
    The analysis of near real-time monitoring of flash flooding in the area involved
    examining pre-flood atmospheric data related to aerosol optical depth, cloud optical
    thickness and total perceptible water vapour over the study area, as depicted
    in Fig. 8b,c,d. The study revealed a significant correlation between the pre-flood
    atmospheric data and the occurrence of extreme and multiple rainfall episodes
    in the region. This indicates that cloud formation and the presence of moisture
    are closely linked to the presence of aerosol particles77. The analysis of aerosol
    data in the study area revealed a significant presence of aerosol content in the
    atmosphere before the flood. This observation was particularly evident from the
    data recorded between the 5th and 8th of October 2021, as depicted in Fig. 8.
    The aerosol optical depth during this period was measured to be around 0.8, a
    noteworthy value for its potential impact in inducing heavy rainfall and flash
    flooding78,79. Aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the air, which can have
    important implications for weather and climate patterns80. High aerosol optical
    depth, as indicated by the measurement of 0.8, suggests a relatively dense concentration
    of aerosol particles in the atmosphere during the specified timeframe. Such high
    aerosol levels can act as cloud condensation nuclei, providing necessary sites
    for water vapour to condense and form cloud droplets. This phenomenon is crucial
    for cloud formation and rainfall processes81. The significance of aerosols in
    cloud formation lies in their ability to serve as nuclei for the aggregation of
    water vapour, leading to the development of clouds. This thick cloud cover resulted
    in considerable precipitable water vapour from the 17th to 19th of October, as
    shown in Fig. 882,83. These atmospheric parameters resulted in favorable conditions
    for extreme with multiple rainfall episodes over the study area from 17 to 19th
    October 2021,finally, the extreme rainfall episodes attributed to flash flooding
    over the Nainital, Uttarakhand. Figure 8 (a) Cumulative rainfall over the Nanital
    Utrankhand, (b) Aerosol optical depth over the Nanital Utrankhand, (c) Cloud optical
    thickness over the Nanital Utrankhand, (d) Total Perceptible water Vapor over
    the Nanital Utrankhand. Full size image When moisture condenses around aerosol
    particles, it contributes to the formation of larger cloud droplets. These larger
    droplets can result in more intense rainfall events, potentially leading to flash
    flooding under certain conditions82,83. Furthermore, the HYSPLIT trajectory analysis
    revealed a profound influence of air masses originating or passing through western
    regions on the Himalayan radiation budget. This suggests that atmospheric dynamics
    from these areas significantly impact the weather patterns and climate in the
    Himalayan region. To gain deeper insights into the role of aerosols in the Himalayan
    radiation budget, the study also examined the Atmospheric Radiative Forcing (ARF)14.
    In the investigation of aerosol data, a backward trajectory analysis was conducted
    depicted in Fig. 9, focusing on the 17th and 18th of October 2021. The analysis
    aimed to trace the movement and direction of aerosols in the atmosphere 48 h before
    reaching the target area encircled in Fig. 9. The findings of figure demonstrated
    journey of aerosol during these days, shedding light on their movement and behavior
    in the study area. Specifically, on the 17th of October, the source of aerosols
    was observed at an altitude of 3500 m above Mean Sea Level (MSL). The tracked
    trajectory of aerosols reveals a gradual descent from an initial altitude of 3500
    m above Mean Sea Level (MSL), ultimately reaching the research target at 1096
    m MSL. This horizontal movement of aerosols suggests a potential influential role
    in the occurrence of heavy rainfall that result flash flooding over the study
    area by providing the favorable atmospheric conditions. Figure 9 Backward trajectory
    of Aerosol during 17th, 18th and 19th October 2021 over the study area source
    encircled. Full size image The comprehensive analysis conducted in this study
    has significantly advanced our understanding of the intricate interactions between
    various atmospheric parameters, aerosols, and rainfall patterns, all of which
    collectively contribute to heavy with multiple rainfall episodes that resulted
    flash flooding event in the Nainital region of Uttarakhand. The severity of such
    flash floods is starkly evident from the tragic loss of fifty lives and the extensive
    damage to property and infrastructure. A key highlight of this study is the application
    of remote sensing data, including total aerosol optical depth, cloud cover thickness,
    total precipitable water vapour, and rainfall product (Meteosat-8), for real-time
    monitoring of flash floods. The use of cutting-edge satellite technology and geospatial
    data has proven to be pivotal in closely monitoring and tracking flash floods,
    enabling timely and efficient responses to mitigate the impact of these disasters.
    The findings of this research underscore the vital importance of leveraging advanced
    technology and scientific research to address the challenges posed by flash flooding
    in the Himalayan region. To effectively combat these challenges, a comprehensive
    and multi-faceted approach is imperative. This may encompass implementing measures
    to counteract the impact of climate change on weather patterns, advocating for
    sustainable land use practices to reduce vulnerability, and bolstering the resilience
    of critical infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather events
    like flash floods. Furthermore, the study presents a unique occurrence in the
    Nainital region of Uttarakhand, Himalaya, wherein heavy rainfall, marked by multiple
    episodes, led to flash flooding during October 2021, an unusual event when compared
    to the time series precipitation analyzed in the study. The investigation emphasizes
    the significant role of elevation in influencing rainfall and temperature variations
    in the region. The study emphasizes the significance of continuous scientific
    research and monitoring efforts to gain invaluable insights into the underlying
    patterns and drivers of flash flooding in the Himalaya. Armed with this knowledge,
    authorities can formulate robust strategies and policies to minimize the impact
    of future flash floods and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of the communities
    residing in the region. This study reaffirms the crucial role that satellite data
    and geospatial technology play in effective disaster management. It underscores
    the urgency of adopting proactive measures to address the mounting risks of flash
    floods in vulnerable regions like Nainital, Uttarakhand. By synergizing scientific
    research, advanced monitoring techniques, and community engagement, authorities
    can work towards building a more resilient future, better equipped to respond
    to and mitigate the repercussions of flash flooding events. Conclusion With their
    immense size and unique geological features, the Himalaya are prone to flash flooding
    incidents that pose significant risks to human life and infrastructure. Natural
    factors, such as tectonic activities and glacial lakes, and human-induced changes,
    including deforestation and land use alterations, influence these flash floods.
    In the Nainital region of Uttarakhand, the primary cause of flash floods is often
    attributed to cloud bursts accompanied by heavy rainfall episodes. The study highlights
    the crucial role of rainfall product and remote sensing data including total aerosol
    optical depth, cloud cover thickness and total precipitable water vapour, in real-time
    short-lived flash flood monitoring. The study emphasizes the significant role
    of elevation in influencing rainfall and temperature variations in the region.
    The application of satellite technology and geospatial data has proven to be instrumental
    in promptly tracking and responding to flash flood events. A comprehensive approach
    is necessary to address the challenges of flash flooding in the Himalaya. This
    may involve implementing measures to mitigate the impact of climate change, promoting
    sustainable land use practices, and enhancing infrastructure resilience. The study
    highlights a significant shift in precipitation patterns of Nainital, with usual
    heightened rainfall and flash floods. The rarity of such events in the region
    may be linked to infrequent western disturbances. The research contributes valuable
    historical data and insights into the patterns of heavy rainfall and flash floods
    in the region. It underscores the alteration in precipitation patterns attributed
    to variations in atmospheric parameters over the study area. The findings demonstrate
    continuous monitoring and scientific research are critical for developing effective
    strategies to mitigate the impact of flash floods and safeguard communities in
    vulnerable regions like Nainital Uttarakhand. Overall, this study emphasizes the
    urgent need for climate action and proactive measures to address the rising risks
    of flash floods. By integrating advanced technology, scientific research, and
    community engagement, authorities can work towards building a more resilient future
    and better preparedness to tackle extreme weather events (Supplementary Information).

    crop model Article Open access 14 February 2024 Introduction Climate change, drought,
    and the overexploitation of water resources have led to declines in freshwater
    storage in many vital agricultural regions1, raising concerns surrounding the
    future of food and water security2,3. Irrigation constitutes the largest use of
    freshwater globally4,5, and many regions will need to decrease their agricultural
    water use while maintaining high levels of production to ensure a sustainable
    food and water supply as the population grows6. Proposed options for reducing
    water use include leaving lands fallow, switching to less water-intensive crops,
    adopting water-saving farming practices such as deficit irrigation, and improving
    irrigation efficiency7,8. However, any approach to reducing agricultural water
    use depends on the challenging task of characterizing the amount of water crops
    consume9. While it is possible to monitor volumes of water withdrawn for irrigation,
    this is a poor proxy for the amount of water crops consume through evapotranspiration
    (ET)10. Only some irrigation water results in ET: the rest remains in the system
    as runoff or recharge, though this proportion can vary widely depending on topography,
    climate, soil type, and farming practices11. Agricultural ET, or the increase
    in ET that irrigated agriculture brings, is therefore a critical measure in that
    it represents the amount of water that is actually “consumed” by agriculture.
    This water leaves the watershed entirely as it is evaporated from the soil and
    transpired by crops4. Since agricultural ET represents agricultural water consumption,
    it is key for gauging the potential of fallowing, crop switching, or other farming
    practices to save water12. When compared to total irrigation amounts, agricultural
    ET can also be used to highlight the fraction of irrigation withdrawals that do
    not effectively result in consumptive use13. While this water stays in the system
    and therefore may continue to provide beneficial uses14, it also does not achieve
    its original purpose of contributing to crop growth. Therefore, agricultural ET
    can help calculate irrigation efficiency and identify unnecessary irrigation water
    withdrawals from surface or groundwater reservoirs13. Two methodological challenges
    prevent agricultural ET from being monitored at scale. First, simply measuring
    total ET at scale is a challenge. Second, even when measures of ET are available,
    it is difficult to separate agricultural ET from the total10,15. To measure total
    ET, eddy covariance flux towers are highly accurate for monitoring ET at a single
    location16. However, they are expensive and thus sparse, and they are designed
    to measure ET over uniform vegetation, which is not reflective of complex agricultural
    landscapes17. In the absence of ET measurements, theoretical water demand can
    be simulated based on climate and crop type18,19. Although such tools are helpful
    for water demand planning20, theoretical water demand represents the ET of a crop
    whose water demands are fully met. Therefore, these are likely to overestimate
    actual ET. Additionally, these simulated estimates exclusively reflect variations
    in water demand influenced by factors incorporated into the model, which are often
    limited to crop type and climate21. Therefore, analyses based on these models
    are constrained to examining these specific factors, neglecting other critical
    drivers of ET such as farming practices. Given the scarcity of in situ data and
    the inherent constraints of simulated estimates, accurately gauging total ET at
    scale remains a significant challenge. Addressing the second challenge, even when
    accurate ET measurements are available, isolating agricultural ET from total ET
    is difficult. This step is key for water management, since the resulting metric
    represents the increase in ET attributable to agriculture. To do so, one must
    estimate the naturally-occurring ET that would occur in the absence of irrigated
    agriculture (for example, if the land were left fallow). Most often, this naturally-occurring
    ET is assumed to be equal to precipitation19,22. However, there may be temporal
    lags between precipitation and resulting ET, some precipitation may not result
    in ET at all, and ET may also be supplemented by other sources of water, such
    as near surface groundwater. Together, these challenges leave us with limited
    measurements of ET and no empirical estimates of agricultural ET at large scales,
    inhibiting our ability to form evidence-based water management policies that accurately
    reflect crop water use and potential water savings in agriculture. Recent advances
    in the remote sensing of ET unlock new avenues for research into agricultural
    water consumption. Numerous algorithms for estimating ET using land surface temperature
    and other remote sensing inputs have been validated specifically for use in agricultural
    settings23,24. These advancements have allowed researchers to empirically study
    total ET in agricultural settings25,26. However, despite high-resolution maps
    of ET in agricultural landscapes25,27, the challenge of isolating agricultural
    ET from total ET has been limited to studies in extremely arid regions where irrigation
    is the only source of water available to plants28. Here, we develop a framework
    for measuring agricultural ET at sub-field scales. We use remote sensing to determine
    total ET and combine it with machine learning to estimate naturally-occurring
    ET. First, we retrieve satellite-based remotely sensed total ET estimates from
    the 30m, monthly OpenET ensemble data24 available in the western United States
    starting in 2016. Second, since we can use these same OpenET estimates to directly
    observe naturally-occurring ET over fallow lands, we train a gradient boosting
    algorithm to predict ET over fallow lands. We use information on topography, soil
    quality, climate, and spatial and temporal coordinates as predictors. We then
    use the model to retrieve naturally-occurring ET over all active agricultural
    fields, which we subtract from the remotely-sensed ET to calculate agricultural
    ET. We apply this methodology to calculate agricultural ET across California’s
    Central Valley, one of the world’s most water-stressed and agriculturally productive
    regions29. We use these maps of agricultural ET to calculate the water consumption
    of different crop types, as well as to calculate variability in agricultural ET
    within crop types. These insights allow us to evaluate different strategies that
    have been proposed to save water under the Sustainable Groundwater Management
    Act (SGMA)7, which mandates that all water basins in California reduce groundwater
    pumping to sustainable levels by 204030. Specifically, we compare the ability
    of fallowing, crop switching, and other farming practices to save water by reducing
    agricultural ET. Additionally, we calculate irrigation efficiency to assess the
    potential to reduce irrigation withdrawals without decreasing agricultural ET.
    In the wake of groundwater pumping cutbacks of 20–50% under SGMA7, this work will
    guide water managers in enacting water savings and help predict which land use
    changes are likely to ensue. Results Estimating agricultural ET We calculate agricultural
    ET by retrieving the total ET observed over agricultural areas and subtracting
    naturally-occurring ET (Fig. 1). While total ET estimates are retrieved directly
    from OpenET, we simulate naturally-occurring ET by training a gradient boosting
    regressor to predict the ET observed by OpenET over fallow lands. Our model simulating
    naturally-occurring ET achieves an R2 of .87 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of
    35.5 mm per year (Supplementary Fig. 1). We use a test set made up of 2 km2 held-out
    areas (about four times the area of a large agricultural field in the Central
    Valley). We do not find that error is structured across either space (Supplementary
    Figs. 2 and 3) or time (Supplementary Fig. 4). Fig. 1: Estimates of annual agricultural
    evapotranspiration (ET) over active agricultural lands in California’s Central
    Valley. a Total ET is remotely sensed and is retrieved from OpenET. b Naturally-occurring
    ET is an estimate of the ET that would be present if the agricultural lands were
    fallow, and is predicted using machine learning. c Agricultural ET is the difference
    between total and naturally-occurring ET, and represents our estimate of the ET
    caused by agriculture, and therefore the water that would be conserved if the
    land were fallow instead of cropped. The variations in agricultural ET across
    the landscape suggest that different fields can have vastly different abilities
    to conserve water. OpenET provides ET data at the scale of 30 m; all figure panels
    here show ET resampled to 70 m resolution for computational efficiency and to
    better match average field size. Full size image Variation in agricultural ET
    within and across crop types We leverage the significant variability in agricultural
    ET observed across the Central Valley (Fig. 1) to analyze the factors driving
    these variations. Crop type, which is commonly cited as an important variable
    explaining differences in agricultural ET19, explains 34% of the variation in
    estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (4), Supplementary Fig. 5). In Fig. 2, we show
    the water intensity of different crop groups (Supplementary Note 7). Deciduous
    fruits and nuts are some of the highest consumers at 625 mm per year (582–668
    95% CI) (Fig. 2), particularly almonds at 715 mm per year (651–778 95% CI) (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Conversely, grain and hay crops consume only 141 mm per year (111–171
    95% CI). These broad variations in the water consumption of different crop types
    align with previous work estimating crop water demands (Supplementary Note 1,
    Supplementary Fig. 6) and suggest that substantial water savings may be possible
    with crop switching. Fig. 2: Variations in annual agricultural evapotranspiration
    (ET) across and within crop groups. Mean agricultural ET by crop group (blue fill
    and 95% CI) is the average difference between total ET (black outline) and naturally-occurring
    ET (cream fill). All measures are summed across the year, leading to naturally-occurring
    and total ET estimates that include water consumption occurring outside of the
    growing season. While we find significant differences in mean agricultural ET
    across crop groups, the gray box plots also show a broad spread in agricultural
    ET within crop groups (box plots show 0.5, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles).
    Full size image However, the majority of the variation remains unexplained by
    crop type (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 5). This within-crop variability is not
    uniform for different crops: crops such as deciduous fruits and nuts tend to have
    large variances, whereas rice has a very small variance. For example, pistachios
    have the most variability with an interquartile range (IQR) of 664 mm per year
    over the whole state. Conversely, rice has an IQR of only 122 mm per year (Supplementary
    Fig. 5). Part of the large variability in agricultural ET for deciduous fruits
    and nuts can be explained by orchard age: young orchards consume significantly
    less water than more mature ones (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7).
    Climate, topography, and soil quality explain an additional 6% of within-crop
    variation. However, substantial within-crop variation remains, indicating that
    some of these differences may be due to variations in farming practices. This
    would suggest that reducing water consumption without switching crops may be feasible,
    which we explore in the next section. The water-saving potential of different
    management strategies The variability of agricultural ET both within and between
    crops allows us to evaluate the water saving-potential of different management
    strategies. Here, we compare the effect of three scenarios on reducing agricultural
    ET in groundwater sub-basins across the Central Valley: 1. Crop switching: Substitute
    high-ET crops for the median water-consuming crop (Eq. (6)). 2. Farming practices:
    Keep the same spatial allocation of crops, but reduce agricultural ET of high
    consumers to the median, crop-specific, consumption level (Eq. (7)). 3. Fallowing:
    Fallow the 5% of lands with the highest estimated agricultural ET (Eq. (8)). Because
    it would not be realistic to prescribe farmers in different contexts to consume
    similar amounts of water, we calculate crop-specific agricultural ET and within-crop
    variation at the level of groundwater sub-basins. We additionally control for
    differences in climate, topography, and soil type before conducting the scenarios.
    To account for the effects of orchard age, we remove orchards that have been bearing
    fruit for 5 years or less or that are in their last year of production (Supplementary
    Fig. 7). We find that each of these scenarios return similar reductions in overall
    water consumption of around 10% (Fig. 3). Since crops with high agricultural ET
    are heavily favored in most sub-basins and therefore the median crop usually has
    a high agricultural ET, crop switching only results in a 9.9% reduction in agricultural
    ET. In order to achieve greater water savings, crops would need to be switched
    to less popular crops with lesser water demands: switching all crops to the lowest
    consuming crop in a sub-basin results in a 93.8% reduction in agricultural ET.
    While strategies that do not require a change in land cover type are less commonly
    cited as a water management approach, we find that reducing high consumers to
    their crops’s median consumption level yields similar water savings of up to 11.3%.
    Fallowing does, however, remain the most effective way to reduce agricultural
    ET. We find that leaving a mere 5% of land fallow results in a 9.3% consumption
    reduction, comparable to the savings afforded by crop switching and within-crop
    scenarios which by definition affect up to 50% of lands. Fig. 3: The percent reduction
    in agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) driven by various management scenarios.
    a Savings accrued by substituting high-ET crops for the median water-consuming
    crop in a sub-basin. b Water savings without changing land cover by reducing agricultural
    ET of high consumers to the median, crop- and sub-basin-specific, consumption
    level. c Water savings from fallowing the 5% of lands with the highest estimated
    agricultural ET. Full size image Irrigation efficiency While fallowing, crop switching,
    and other farming practices highlight opportunities to decrease agricultural ET,
    we also find opportunities to diminish runoff and deep percolation during conveyance,
    on-farm management, or application (Fig. 4). On average, we find that irrigation
    in the Central Valley is 61.8% (54.0–69.7%) efficient, similar in magnitude to
    what theoretical estimates predict (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. 8).
    The large disparity in efficiency between northern and southern counties is, however,
    more pronounced than theoretical estimates (Supplementary Fig. 8). As a result,
    there may be limited potential to decrease water withdrawn for irrigation in the
    south which achieves efficiencies as high as 80%. The particularly low efficiencies
    in the northern counties, however, suggest a large potential to decrease irrigation
    water withdrawals without affecting agricultural ET. Fig. 4: Irrigation efficiency
    across the counties of the Central Valley. a Irrigation efficiency is calculated
    by dividing agricultural evapotranspiration (ET) (gridded data) by USGS county-level
    reports of irrigation amounts (blue polygons). For the calculation, agricultural
    ET is averaged to the county level to match the spatial scale of the irrigation
    data. Additionally, irrigation is displayed in volumetric units (teragrams), but
    is divided by county-level cropland area to be in units consistent with agricultural
    ET prior to the calculation. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted
    at the point of use, rather than the water’s point of origin. b The resulting
    county-level irrigation efficiency estimates vary widely across the Central Valley,
    with particularly low efficiencies in the northern counties. Full size image Discussion
    By empirically quantifying crop water consumption at sub-field scales, we contribute
    to characterizing agriculture’s hydrological effects and evaluate the ability
    of different management strategies to mitigate this impact. To overcome the methodological
    challenges associated with estimating agricultural ET, we leverage recent advances
    in remotely sensed ET and use machine learning to generate a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual. The fine scale variability in agricultural ET we uncover allows
    us to analyze the drivers of these differences and simulate the potential for
    different management practices to save water, including under-explored ones like
    adjusting farming practices. Additionally, when comparing agricultural ET to total
    water withdrawn for irrigation, we find substantial opportunities for improvements
    in irrigation efficiency in the northern counties of the Central Valley. High-resolution
    maps of agricultural ET can therefore guide our understanding of how agriculture
    and management can affect water resources in California and other water stressed
    agricultural regions globally. Accurate agricultural ET measures are crucial to
    characterize anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological cycle31 and enact effective
    water management18,32. Previously, agricultural ET has been estimated by (i) simulating
    crop water demand based on crop type and climate and (ii) removing naturally available
    water by subtracting precipitation19,22. However, both of these steps embed assumptions
    that can lead to significant biases. For (i), simulated crop water demand may
    not adequately represent the field characteristics or farming practices of a given
    location13. For example, water demands are not necessarily always met, meaning
    water consumption may be overestimated33,34,35. In line with this, while we generally
    find good agreement with crop water demand simulated by the CalSIMETAW model21,
    we do find that agricultural ET estimates are significantly smaller (Supplementary
    Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 6). For (ii), using precipitation to proxy for naturally-occurring
    ET fails to account for precipitation being lost as runoff, temporal lags in when
    precipitation is transpired, and alternative natural sources of water such as
    shallow groundwater. We find that the bias between our estimates and CalSIMETAW
    estimates increases when precipitation, rather than naturally-occurring ET, is
    used to represent baseline amounts of available water. This can be explained by
    the seasonal mismatch between precipitation and naturally-occurring ET: although
    annually there is more precipitation than naturally-occurring ET, precipitation
    mainly occurs in the winter when it is unavailable to most crops. Because using
    precipitation as a proxy for naturally-occurring ET does not account for moisture
    that remains in the soil by the time the growing season begins, this inflates
    simulated estimates of crop water demand. Our use of remotely sensed ET estimates
    and our ability to estimate naturally-occurring ET therefore allows us to more
    accurately characterize agricultural ET. High-resolution, empirical estimates
    of agricultural ET additionally open up the possibility to investigate differences
    in agricultural ET beyond what is attributable to crop type, which we find only
    accounts for 34% of the variation. These within-crop variations can be substantial
    for many crops: the difference in agricultural ET of a pistachio field from the
    75th to the 25th percentile is the same as the water that could be saved from
    fallowing an alfalfa field. Such broad variability is consistent with findings
    from studies comparing total ET across crops during the growing season25,26. Even
    after adjusting for variability attributable to field characteristics, orchard
    age, and climate, we find that these variations could translate to substantial
    water savings without requiring a change in crop type. Unfortunately, a lack of
    high-resolution data on field-scale farming practices and yields inhibits further
    analysis of specific practices driving agricultural ET variation and their economic
    implications. However, prior literature from experimental plots or particular
    locations suggests that mulching36, conservation tillage37, deficit irrigation33,34,35,
    and improved irrigation scheduling and technologies38 all have potential to limit
    agricultural ET. These practices may prove advantageous relative to costly strategies
    like crop-switching or fallowing, though more detailed cost-benefit analyses are
    necessary to determine the suitability of various interventions in specific contexts39.
    Such water saving farming practices are not mentioned in the plans drafted by
    SGMA water managers7. This is possibly due to a lack of conclusive research on
    the potential of such strategies to effectively decrease agricultural ET without
    significant effects on yield or operation cost. Spatial data on the use of these
    different practices would allow researchers to take full advantage of our high-resolution
    agricultural ET estimates and study their water-saving and economic benefits.
    In situ assessments of crop-specific water consumption and other variations in
    agricultural ET enable us to model potential water savings across diverse management
    scenarios. In addition to previously mentioned scenarios based on farming practices,
    we also investigate more traditionally studied strategies, such as crop switching
    and fallowing. Consistent with prior studies relying on crop water demand simulations,
    our research suggests that transitioning to crops with lower water requirements
    is an effective conservation strategy. However, accruing substantial water savings
    requires embracing less popular crops like grains and hay20. The feasibility of
    increasing production of these crops in the Central Valley is uncertain due to
    high labor and operational costs20. Furthermore, any form of crop switching entails
    expenses related to the adoption of new knowledge, technologies, and market adjustments40,41.
    Consequently, the viability of a significant shift towards less water-demanding
    crops, and its alignment with market expansion, remains uncertain20. Therefore,
    our findings support the notion that extensive fallowing or land retirement may
    be essential to achieve substantial reduction targets in areas with severe overdrafts42,43.
    Considering the risk of increased dust from unused land, repurposing such areas
    for habitat restoration, flood water capture for groundwater replenishment44,
    solar energy production, or sustainable industrial development45 could mitigate
    the economic impacts of land retirement for both farmers and local communities.
    Detailed agricultural ET maps like the ones generated for this study can help
    determine the scale of land repurposing needed and identify priority areas for
    such initiatives under different constraints, including existing water rights46.
    Finally, we find a significant opportunity to improve irrigation efficiency, especially
    in the northern part of the Central Valley where we find lower irrigation efficiency
    than previously expected (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7). This implies
    that farmers in these areas could potentially reduce their irrigation water usage
    without negatively impacting agricultural ET and, consequently, crop growth. Although
    this finding is consistent with management strategies that focus on boosting irrigation
    efficiency7, it is important to recognize that such improvements may not automatically
    lead to water savings at the watershed level14. This is because water not consumed
    in irrigation processes does not always exit the watershed but can instead be
    reabsorbed into groundwater reservoirs or surface water bodies for later reuse.
    Conversely, water that is evapotranspired, which constitutes the ‘efficient’ part
    of irrigation, is completely removed from the watershed14. Hence, paradoxically,
    increasing irrigation efficiency could reduce water availability if it is not
    matched by a decrease in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation. To prevent
    an unintended increase in water consumption, managers could use agricultural ET
    maps to monitor and control water use as improvements in irrigation efficiency
    are implemented. This study has some important limitations. Most notably, due
    to a lack of data on farming practices, it is difficult to ascertain whether the
    variation in within-crop agricultural ET that we estimate is indeed due to farming
    practices. When conducting our management scenarios, we account for the effects
    of climate, soil quality, topography, and orchard age. We additionally conduct
    the scenarios at the level of small groundwater sub-basins rather than across
    the entire valley to account for any additional regional environmental differences
    we are unable to otherwise account for. However, variance stemming from error
    in our agricultural ET estimates or from mislabeled crop types could contribute
    to observed within-crop variation in agricultural ET. We minimize error from mislabeled
    crop types by using the most accurate crop data available in California which
    boasts an accuracy of 97.6%47. Additionally, the OpenET ensemble model has been
    extensively validated24,48, and our machine learning model has an R2 of .87. We
    estimate that these sources of error are responsible for only 11% of the variance
    in our yearly agricultural ET estimates (Supplementary Note 4). Nevertheless,
    the water-saving potentials we calculate for both the fallowing and farmers practice
    scenarios should be interpreted as upper bound estimates. Another important limitation
    of this study stems from the limited data available on water withdrawn for irrigation
    which is needed to calculate irrigation efficiency. Since irrigation data are
    not available over the same years as agricultural ET, we use the average of the
    two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, a drought year and non-drought year, to
    calculate irrigation efficiency. To ensure that our results are robust to year-to-year
    variations in agricultural ET and irrigation use, we calculate irrigation efficiency
    using all the possible combinations of years (Supplementary Fig. 9). Though we
    do find significant variations based on the irrigation year used in some counties,
    we consistently find low irrigation efficiencies in the north and higher ones
    in the south. Irrigation data with better spatial and temporal resolution would
    improve estimates of irrigation efficiency calculated using this method. We have
    shown how highly resolved agricultural ET estimates can improve our understanding
    of anthropogenic impacts on the hydrologic cycle and guide water management by
    quantifying the potential of different water-saving strategies. In California,
    our findings suggest that irrigated agriculture increases ET less than previously
    estimated, and we find that managers may not need to rely as heavily on changes
    in land cover as currently proposed to achieve significant water savings. Because
    our method for estimating agricultural ET is based entirely on remote sensing
    and machine learning, it remains cost effective and has the potential to be used
    globally, especially as global ET datasets become increasingly available49. This
    work can help refine our understanding of agriculture’s effect on water resources
    and help managers achieve water-saving goals in water-stressed agricultural landscapes
    across the globe. Methods Agricultural ET We define agricultural ET as the difference
    between total ET over an agricultural parcel and the ET that would have been,
    had that parcel been fallow land instead (Eq. (1)). This definition recognizes
    that not all ET over agricultural lands, during the growing season or otherwise,
    can necessarily be attributed to agriculture. Such a definition is particularly
    useful from a management perspective, since it denotes the decrease in ET, or
    water savings, that one might expect if agriculture were to cease. $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{tot}}}}}}}}}-{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{nat}}}}}}}}}\\end{array}$$
    (1) where ETag is agricultural ET, ETtot is the total ET over an agricultural
    parcel, and ETnat is the counterfactual ET that would occur naturally, were the
    same land fallow. We note that another, theoretically distinct counterfactual
    could be constructed to represent ETnat: ET if the land were undisturbed, natural
    land rather than fallow. We elect to simulate ET over fallow lands since it allows
    us to predict the potential water savings from fallowing, which has a management
    relevant interpretation. Total ET estimates We construct ETtot from OpenET ensemble
    data, available at a monthly time step from 2016-2021. This data is calculated
    as the average output of six different ET models estimated using Landsat data24.
    The data have been corrected for biases in ET resulting from data only being available
    during cloudless overpasses and have been extensively evaluated over a broad variety
    of land covers48. While they are published at a 30m scale, we resample to 70m
    to improve computational efficiency since this is well below the average size
    of an agricultural field in the Central Valley. Calculation of a naturally-occurring
    ET counterfactual using machine learning We estimate naturally-occurring ET for
    all agricultural pixels using a gradient boosting regressor trained on data from
    fallow lands. We choose a gradient boosting regressor due to its high flexibility
    in learning non-linear relationships and proven performance on tabular datasets
    relative to other regressors50. We retrieve the locations of fallow fields in
    the Central Valley from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) statewide crop
    mapping dataset over available years: 2016, 2018, and 2019. Pixels that are within
    the top 5% ET during July-September are removed due to some implausibly high numbers
    during these months that suggest mislabeling of an active agricultural pixel as
    fallow. While we believe that this data cleaning step is important to ensure an
    unbiased training set, omitting this step does not significantly change our main
    findings (Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Figs. 10–12). We additionally find
    that our findings do not change when training our model on data that are marked
    fallow by both the DWR dataset and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) (Supplementary
    Note 6, Supplementary Figs. 13–15). We predict naturally-occurring ET based on
    latitude and longitude, the month and year, as well as a broad set of additional
    variables describing topography (elevation, aspect, slope, topographic wetness
    index), soil quality (California Storie Index), and climate (Potential ET). The
    latitude, longitude, and month and year indicators are included to capture the
    spatial and temporal patterns in ET underlying the densely distributed fallow
    fields in our dataset. However, the inclusion of an indicator variable for each
    year in our model limits our analysis to 2016, 2018, and 2019, as these are the
    only years for which we have available land cover data. Nevertheless, given that
    ‘year’ contributes a mere 3% to our model’s predictive capability (see Supplementary
    Fig. 17), it may be considered non-essential for future research in this area.
    Including additional predictors in our model presents two benefits. First, they
    can improve the model’s predictive power. For example, we find that Potential
    ET contributes greatly to the model’s final predictions (Supplementary Fig. 17).
    Other variables are important to include because they can help correct for systematic
    differences between the fallow lands used to train our model and the active agricultural
    lands we apply the model to. Such differences could arise from farmers selecting
    lands to be fallowed due to their inherently lower productivity, which would negatively
    bias our estimates of counterfactual naturally-occurring ET in locations actively
    being cropped today. To assemble these predictor variables, we retrieve topographic
    information from the USGS National Elevations Database, soil quality information
    from the California Storie Index in the the USDA’s gSSURGO and STATSGO2 datasets,
    and Potential ET from the hPET global dataset51. To validate our naturally-occurring
    ET model, we split our dataset, reserving 60% for training, 10% for validation,
    and 30% for testing. In order to ensure that nearby and therefore very similar
    pixels are not present across multiple splits, we group our splits by 2 km2 squares,
    four times the size of a large agricultural field in the Central Valley. The entire
    dataset is made up of over 16 million pixels populating 8180 distinct 2 km2 regions.
    We set aside 4908 of these 2 km2 clusters for training, amounting to nearly 10
    million pixels. The testing split is composed of 2454 clusters. We tune hyperparameters
    using 100 iterations of a threefold randomized search cross-validation on an unclustered
    subset of our dataset. Randomized search cross-validation is similar to grid search
    cross-validation, but only reaches a random subset of the possible hyperparameter
    combinations to improve computational efficiency. We manually set the minimum
    number of samples required to split a node to 200 and the minimum number of samples
    required at each leaf node to 100 to account for the large size and spatial clustering
    of the dataset. Because we carry out our analyses using yearly estimates of agricultural
    ET, we validate our model on yearly estimates of naturally-occurring ET. Only
    fallow lands from the test data split are used in any subsequent analyses on fallow
    lands. Analysis After computing agricultural ET for all fields across the Central
    Valley following Eq. (1), we report a variety of statistical summaries and conduct
    scenarios manipulating the spatial distribution of agricultural ET. In order to
    ensure our analyses only capture variations across space, we aggregate our observations
    of agricultural ET to a yearly timestep and control for variation across years
    before beginning this analysis. To do so, we calculate an “adjusted” agricultural
    ET for each pixel by removing the difference between the mean agricultural ET
    for that year and the overall sample mean agricultural ET from the original agricultural
    ET calculation, as follows: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}-(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}-\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}})$$
    (2) where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) is the agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, ETp,y is the original
    agricultural ET, \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{y}}\\) is the mean agricultural
    ET in year y across all pixels and \\(\\overline{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}\\) is
    the mean agricultural ET across all pixels and years. Regressions To calculate
    point estimates and confidence intervals for the overall mean agricultural ET
    (Eq. (3)), the mean agricultural ET by crop group or crop type (Supplementary
    Note 7), or the mean agricultural ET by county (used to calculate irrigation efficiency)
    (Eq. (4)), we conduct a series of regressions with the following format: $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\epsilon
    }_{p,y}$$ (3) $${{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}={\\beta }_{p,y}\\times
    {{{{{{{{\\rm{Group}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{p,y}}}}}}}}}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}$$ (4)
    where \\({{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}\\) represents agricultural ET
    for pixel p in year y with the year-specific variation removed, α is a coefficient
    indicating the mean agricultural ET across all samples, Groupp,y represents a
    vector of dummy variables indicating which crop (for crop comparisons shown in
    Figs. 2 and S5) or county (for irrigation efficiency calculations shown in Fig.
    4; county does not vary by year) observation p, y falls into, βp,y is a corresponding
    vector of coefficients indicating the average agricultural ETs for each crop or
    county group, and ϵp,y is an error term. Standard errors are calculated using
    75 km clusters, as determined by plotting a variogram of the spatial autocorrelation
    in agricultural ET (Supplementary Fig. 16). The aggregate crop group (Fig. 2)
    and detailed crop type (Supplementary Fig. 5) are each assigned using the same
    DWR land cover data used to determine fallow status. In addition to using regression
    to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals, regression allows us to
    calculate the proportion of variation that is explained by a set of variables.
    This is because the R2 corresponds to the fraction of variation explained by the
    regression. We use this to assess the % variation explained by crop type, using
    Eq. (4), as well as that explained by climate, topography, and soil quality: $$\\begin{array}{r}{{{{{{{{\\rm{AdjustedET}}}}}}}}}_{p,y}=\\alpha+{\\beta
    }_{p,y}\\times {X}_{p,y}+{\\epsilon }_{p,y}\\end{array}$$ (5) where α is the intercept,
    Xp,y is a vector of variables including PET, elevation, aspect, slope, TWI, and
    soil quality, βp,y is a vector of coefficients for each variable in Xp,y, and
    ϵp,y is an error term. Management scenarios We conduct three scenarios in which
    we manipulate agricultural ET to mimic land management changes and report the
    decrease in overall agricultural ET within groundwater sub-basins across the Central
    Valley. Eq. (6) is a crop switching scenario (cs) where pixels with agricultural
    ET values above those of the median crop in a given sub-basin are replaced with
    that median crop. Eq. (7) is a farming practice scenario (fp) where pixels with
    agricultural ET values above crop and sub-basin-specific mean values are replaced
    with that crop and sub-basin mean. Finally, Eq. (8) is a fallowing scenario (fal)
    which replaces all pixels with agricultural ET values above the sub-basin-specific
    95th percentile with a value of zero agricultural ET. $${{{{{{{{\\rm{Savings}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{cs}}}}}}}}}=1-\\frac{\\mathop{\\sum
    }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}\\min ({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b},{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b})\\left.\\right)}{\\mathop{\\sum

    0,\\quad &\\,{{\\mbox{otherwise}}}\\,\\end{array}\\right.}{\\mathop{\\sum }\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{i}}$$
    (8) where ETi is the adjusted agricultural ET for observation i, ETc,b is the
    average agricultural ET for crop type c in groundwater sub-basin \\(b,{{{{{{{\\rm{Median}}}}}}}}{({{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{c,b})}_{b}\\)
    is the median ETc,b in sub-basin b, and ET.95,b is the 95th percentile of agricultural
    ET in sub-basin b. To ensure that the water savings identified in our scenarios
    result from factors that can be influenced by management interventions, we account
    for orchard age, climate, and other physical characteristics of the land. To account
    for orchard age, we remove young orchards that are have been bearing fruit for
    5 or less years, or old orchards that are going to be removed within the next
    year (Supplementary Note 2). Because we are only able to label orchard age in
    this way for all orchards in year 2019 (the DWR crop type data we use are only
    available starting 2014), we exclusively use 2019 for this part of the analysis.
    Since we are only using one year, we do not adjust the water use according to
    the year like we do for the other analyses. To account for differences in climate
    and other characteristics inherent to the land, we control for potential ET, soil
    quality, topographic wetness index, elevation, aspect and slope using linear regression
    (Eq. (5)). Irrigation efficiency We define irrigation efficiency as the proportion
    of irrigation water that results in agricultural ET, and is thus consumed by agriculture
    (Eq. (9)). To determine amounts of water withdrawn for irrigation, we retrieve
    county level irrigation water use data from the USGS National Water Information
    System. We note that these irrigation amounts are counted at the point of use,
    rather than the water’s point of origin. These data are gathered every five years
    with the most recently available data from 2015. Because there is no match for
    the years of available irrigation data and our agricultural ET estimates from
    2016, 2018, and 2019, we use the two most recent years, 2010 and 2015, which represent
    a non-drought year and a drought year, respectively. $${{{{{{{\\rm{IRRIGATION}}}}}}}}\\,{{{{{{{\\rm{EFFICIENCY}}}}}}}}=\\frac{{{{{{{{{\\rm{ET}}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\rm{ag}}}}}}}}}}{{{{{{{{\\rm{Irrigation}}}}}}}}}$$
    (9) where ETag is agricultural ET (Eq. (1)) and Irrigation is the water withdrawn
    for irrigation. ETag and Irrigation must be in matching units, either volumetric
    or depth. We calculate both in mm per year. We assume all active agricultural
    lands in the Central Valley are irrigated and calculate the average agricultural
    ET in mm per year over active agricultural lands in each county. To also retrieve
    average irrigation amount across irrigated lands in a county in mm per year, we
    divide the volume of irrigation water by the average area of irrigated land in
    each county. Because some counties are not fully encompassed within the Central
    Valley, we assume that irrigation in a given county is evenly distributed over
    irrigated lands within and outside of the Central Valley. Data availability The

    significantly affects rice growth and development. Real-time monitoring of rice
    leaf water status is essential to obtain high yield and water use efficiency of

    the performance of spectral technology for monitoring rice LWC. The findings may
    be helpful to the water status diagnosis and accurate irrigation management of
    rice plants. Introduction Rice is an important staple food worldwide. Rice is
    the largest water-consuming crop in the central rice production regions in the
    world, and water scarcity is bound to threaten rice production [1]. Additionally,
    the water consumption in paddy fields would increase significantly due to global
    climate change in the future. The unfavorable factors must aggravate the water
    crisis in rice fields [2, 3]. Leaf water content (LWC) is an important evaluation
    index for crop water demand status [4]. Monitoring LWC effectively achieves precise
    irrigation, improves water utilization, and alleviates the water crisis. Hyperspectral
    remote sensing technology has recently been widely used in agricultural production
    due to its rapid, nondestructive, and real-time monitoring of crop physiological
    and biochemical characteristics [5,6,7]. Early LWC spectral modeling studies improved
    prediction accuracy by constructing various types of vegetation indices from sensitive
    spectral bands, such as the moisture stress index (MSI) and water index (WI) [8,
    9]. Previous spectral monitoring studies have initially focused on vegetation
    indices derived from spectral bands. Researchers construct different vegetation
    indices by spectrally sensitive bands to improve the prediction accuracy of LWC
    [10, 11]. Vegetation indices are frequently screened by selecting spectral information
    and have a good correlation with LWC at multiple points over many years [12, 13],
    but the established models usually ignore the effects of the growing environment
    and growth characteristics on LWC of the crops. Climate characteristics and physiological
    status of the plants are important factors affecting LWC [14, 15]. The neglected
    information could be the primary reason for the poor generalizability of existing
    vegetation index models in practical applications. Therefore, integrating the
    actors into the spectral monitoring models of LWC would be more high precision
    due to considering the potential effects of the growing environment and growth
    characteristics on LWC [16, 17]. Qin et al. [18] have recently improved crop nitrogen
    content prediction accuracy using a spectral model that combines image feature
    parameters and fluorescence parameters. These results supported our inferences
    that introducing multi-source data may be important means to improve the monitoring
    accuracy of LWC spectral modeling in rice plants. Choosing modeling methods are
    one of key steps in building monitoring models. Vegetation index monitoring models
    have been usually established using linear and nonlinear functions [19, 20]. These
    traditional monitoring models do not represent the complex relationship between
    various indicators. Machine learning algorithms with sophisticated functionality
    and the ability to handle complex relationships between predictors and target
    variables can be a good solution to this problem [21, 22]. The accuracy and stability
    of models have significantly improved with the rapid development of machine learning
    algorithms, and these are widely adopted when establishing rice nitrogen nutrition
    monitoring models [23,24,25]. Moreover, machine learning algorithms allow the
    use of different classes of sample data as input variables, allowing multiple
    sources of data (physiological and ecological indicators and spectral information)
    to be effectively coupled and can effectively discriminate between differences
    in the contributions of the input variables, allowing the model’s parameters can
    be fully utilized. Therefore, we speculated that the monitoring capacities of
    vegetation index models integrating with multi-source data would also have significant
    advantages using machine learning algorithms when predicting the LWC of rice plants
    based on the results previous studies [16, 26]. Three irrigation regimes and four
    varieties with different drought tolerance capacities were established LWC difference
    populations in field experiments. This study’s objectives are to (1) select spectrally
    sensitive bands with high correlation with LWC at multiple growth stages; (2)
    build a new vegetation index model of LWC integrating multi-source data parameters
    after selecting key physiological and ecological indicators; and (3) use a machine
    learning algorithm to optimize the coupling model and select the optimal algorithm
    to monitor the LWC. Materials and methods Site and treatment description Three
    irrigation regimes, including two water-saving irrigation regimes named mild alternate
    dry and wet irrigation (MADW), severe alternate dry and wet irrigation (SADW)
    and traditional irrigation regime (CK), were conducted with four rice cultivars
    in Anhui province of China in 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 1). The planting and sampling
    plan details and soil characteristics are presented in Table 1. The climate conditions
    are displayed in Fig. 2. The irrigation regimes were conducted when rice seedlings
    were planted in plots. The irrigation criterion referenced the classical definition
    for the MADW and SADW treatments [27]. The supplementary irrigation with 2–3 cm
    water layer was carried out when the soil water potential at 20 cm soil layer
    reached − 15 KPa and − 30 KPa in the MADW and SADW treatments during whole growth
    stages of rice plants, respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. The
    soil water potential of each plot was monitored by a tensiometer (Watermark, Irrometer
    Company Riverside, CA, USA). Moreover, 2–3 cm water later was always maintained
    for the CK treatment during whole growth stages. Generally, 9–14, 5–8, and 18–24
    times irrigated practices were applied for the MADW, SADW, and CK treatments,
    respectively, across cultivars, years, and locations. Fig. 1 Sketch of field experiments

    divided into three applications for each treatment: 40% as a basal fertilizer,
    30% at the early tiller stage, and 30% at the panicle differentiation stage. The
    nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the rate of 240 kg ha−1. Phosphorus and potassium
    fertilizers (P2O5 75 kg ha−1 and K2O 225 kg ha−1) were also applied as basal fertilizers.
    Plot sizes for each experiment were 12 m2 and 40 m2 in Hefei and Fuyang, respectively.
    All experimental rows were spaced 30.0 cm apart, and plants in a row were spaced
    13.3 cm apart. Measurements Hyperspectral and vegetation index Canopy reflectance
    spectra of rice plants were collected for the booting, flowering, initial grain
    filling, and middle grain filling stages using spectral scanning equipment (ASD
    Field Spec 4, Boulder, CO, USA). The band amplitude of the device ranged from
    350 to 2500 nm. The measurements were conducted under clear and cloudless sky
    conditions between 10:00 and 14:00 [16]. After measuring 10 times for each sample,
    the average value was calculated, and the reference plate was used to correct
    the instrument every 15 min. The representative hills were monitored in each plot
    for all treatments at each observed time. Numerous vegetation indices have been
    applied to monitoring crop water content. The normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) has been widely utilized in monitoring plant water using remote sensing
    methods due to its simple construction and effective improvement of spectral monitoring
    accuracy with multi-band analysis compared with other vegetation indices. Thus,
    this study used canopy spectral data to construct the normalized difference index
    (ND) and five traditional vegetation indices. The calculation equations were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2 List of vegetation indices used in this study Full size table
    SPAD value and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters SPAD value of rice leaves was
    monitored using a chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Company, SPAD-520 plus, Japan).
    The average value of the top three fully expanded leaves was defined as the SPAD
    value of the whole plant. The five independent plants were measured in each plot
    across cultivars, water treatments, and observed periods. The leaves used to measure
    SPAD value were chosen, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of rice leaves
    were determined using a portable pulse-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (WALZ
    Company, PAM-2500, Germany). These leaves were used to determine the minimum fluorescence
    level (Fo) and the maximum fluorescence level (Fm) of dark-adapted leaves at dawn
    for all cultivars and treatments. The steady-state Fo was measured using far-red
    light with illumination less than 1 mol m−2 s−1. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse
    with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was supplied to determine the Fm. Moreover, the steady-state
    fluorescence yield (Fs) was recorded at the forenoon with clear and cloudless
    sky conditions. Then, a 0.80-s saturating pulse with 8000 mol m−2 s−1 PAR was
    stimulated to obtain the maximal fluorescence level (Fm''). Finally, the maximum
    photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and actual photochemical efficiency (Y(II)) were
    calculated: (1) (2) Leaf water content (LWC) The fresh leaf mass (FW) was determined
    by weighing the top three fully expanded leaves immediately. Five hills were sampled
    in each plot for four cultivars and three water treatments during each observed
    period. Fresh leaves were weighed and dried at 80 ℃ to constant weight at each
    sampling. The weight was marked as dry mass (DW). The LWC was calculated as follows:
    (3) Crop water stress index (CWSI) CWSI was calculated as follows [31, 32]: (4)
    (5) (6) (7) where Tc is the crop canopy temperature (℃), and Ta is the air temperature
    (℃). Tmin is the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃),
    Tmax is the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature difference (℃), and
    VPD is the air saturation water vapor pressure deficit (KPa). VPG is the difference
    between the air saturation water vapor pressure and VPD when the air temperature
    is Ta and (Ta + A), respectively. A and B are linear regression coefficients.
    RH is the relative humidity of air (%). In this study, a HOBO UX100-003 temperature
    and humidity recorder (Onset, USA) was placed in each plot to automatically record
    rice canopy temperature and humidity every 1 h interval throughout the day. Leaf
    area index (LAI), above-ground biomass (Biomass), and Grain yield Five representative
    hills, which plants in the hills had uniform growth capacities, were randomly
    selected from each plot at each sampling time across all cultivars and irrigation
    treatments. The hills with excessively vigorous or weak plants were not sampled
    to minimize sampling error. All green leaves per hill were scanned using a portable
    leaf area meter (CI-203, CID Inc., USA). The averaged leaf area in a each plot
    was then calculated from the five hills and marked with D (cm2). Finally, the
    scanned green leaf, remaining yellow leaves, stem, and panicle organs were dried
    at 80 ℃ to constant weight to assess the biomass of each plot. (8) where ρ is
    the planting density per square meter (hill m−2). Plants from a 2 m2 area were
    harvested at maturity to calculate the actual grain yield with 13.5% moisture
    content in each plot across cultivars and water treatments. Regression models
    Some common and classic machine learning algorithms were preliminary assessed
    to select elite algorithms with high monitoring abilities to LWC of rice plants.
    Finally, the four machine learning algorithms named decision tree regression (DT),
    random forest regression (RF), K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), and gradient
    boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) were adopted in this study. The four
    selected methods were successfully applied on estimating various ecological parameters
    such as water content of wheat plants and soil moisture of wheat fields [16, 33].
    In addition, the scikit-learn packages of the four algorithms were from Python
    3.8 software (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) MLR is the most basic and commonly used method for combining two or more
    independent variables that jointly predict or estimate the dependent variable
    [34]. The y is the dependent variable. The x1, x2… xk are the independent variables.
    The multiple linear regression was calculated as follows: (9) where b0 is the
    constant term, e is the error term, and b1, b2… bk are the regression coefficients.
    When x1, x2…, and xk are fixed, b1(k) represents the effect of increase or decrease
    in x1(k) on y for each unit or named the partial regression coefficient of x1(k)
    on y. Decision tree regression (DT) DT is a way to infer classification rules
    as a decision tree from a set of unordered and irregular data, using a top-down
    recursive approach to compare attribute values of nodes inside the decision tree
    [35]. Each internal node is a splitting problem in a decision tree. A test for
    some instance attribute is specified, and it splits the samples arriving at that
    node according to a particular attribute. Each subsequent branch of the node corresponds
    to one of the possible values of that attribute. The prediction results are the
    average values of the output variables in the samples contained in the leaf nodes
    of the regression tree. In this study, the maximum depth of the tree was set as
    10, and the number of trees was 100. Random forest regression (RF) RF resulted
    from random sampling from sample observations and feature variables of the modeled
    data among many decision trees; each sampling result is a tree [36]. Meanwhile,
    each tree generated rules and judgment values that match its properties. Finally,
    the forest algorithm integrated the rules and judgment values of all decision
    trees to achieve random forest regression. K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN)
    KNN was predicted by computing the spatial similarity relationship between the
    k nearest neighbors and the predictor. The algorithm was frequently used for classification
    problems in the early stage and gradually applied to parameter estimation [37].
    The primary principle of the KNN algorithm is that a prediction sample has K nearest
    neighbors in the feature space. Then, the class of the prediction sample was usually
    determined by the majority class of the K nearest neighbors. The K data set value
    was chosen appropriately according to the samples. The model was simplified, and
    useful information was lost if the data set was too large. Oppositely, the model
    would be over-fitted if the data set is too small. The K data set was defined
    as 3 in this study. Gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDT) GBDT is
    an improved algorithm based on the booting algorithm [38]. The booting algorithm
    assigned the same weight to each training sample in the initial training and then
    increased the weights of the error points after each training session to generate
    multiple base learners. Finally, these base learners were combined, and the model
    was formed using weighting or voting approaches. The difference between gradient
    boosting tree regression and classification algorithms was that the input training
    data was residual. The previous prediction was incorporated into the residual
    to find the training data for the current round instead of the gradient of the
    loss function. Data analysis and model verification The Pearson correlation coefficient
    (PCC) helps to measure the linear correlation between variables [39]. In this
    study, PCC was simply regarded as supplementary means to eliminate unimportant
    indicators with low correlation coefficient and to obtain eigenvalues with high
    correlation coefficient. This meant that indicators closely related to LWC were
    used to build models to improve performance. After removing invalid samples from
    the two-year experiments from 2021 to 2022, 91 sample data for each growth stage
    were obtained. In multiple linear regression (MLR), 2022 data were used for modeling
    (55), whereas 2021 data were used for validation (36). The measured data were
    randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets in the machine learning
    regression algorithm. The regression model''s accuracy was evaluated using the
    determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The overall
    model was evaluated in the graph, including linear regression and a 1:1 dash-line,
    to determine the relationship between the predicted and measured values. The calculation
    equations are presented in (9)–(10): (10) (11) where is the measured value of
    LWC, is the measured mean value of LWC, is the predicted value of the model, and
    n is the sample size. The larger the R2 value, the better the accuracy of the
    model. The RMSE reflects the degree of dispersion and deviation between the model’s
    predicted and true values. The smaller the value, the better the prediction of
    the model. The workflow of the LWC prediction procedures is illustrated in Fig.
    3. Data preprocessing included the following processes: (1) normal distribution
    test and scatter plots were performed for the original data such as vegetation
    index parameters, leaf water content, and physiological and ecological indexes
    (Additional file 1: Fig. S1–S4). (2) Outliers detection of all parameters were
    shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. (3) The multicollinearity test between ND
    and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI at whole observed stages were
    also adopted by variance inflation factor and tolerance values (Additional file
    1: Table S2). Fig. 3 Flow chart of this study Full size image Results The classical
    and new vegetation index for monitoring LWC The sensitive bands of LWC were analyzed
    and tested using the normalized difference vegetation index formula at the booting,
    flowering, initial grain filling, and middle grain filling stages to improve the
    accuracy of the hyperspectral monitoring model for LWC. The classical vegetation
    indices, such as NDII and MSI, had a significant positive correlation with LWC
    and high predictive abilities (Table 3). The vegetation index ND constructed by
    the screened sensitive bands (1287 and 1673 mm) also had a significant positive
    correlation with LWC (Fig. 4). The R2 in the ND(1287,1673) model was higher than
    that in NDII and MSI vegetation indices at each growth stage. These results indicated
    that vegetation index ND was an optimal predicted model at each growth stage of
    rice plants. The R2 of the linear equation between LWC (y) and ND(1287,1673) (x)
    was 0.48, 0.64, 0.57, and 0.53, and the corresponding prediction R2 was 0.36,
    0.67, 0.64, and 0.52 at the booting, flowering, initial grain filling, and middle
    grain filling stages, respectively (Fig. 5). Table 3 Coefficient of determination

    image The relationship between physiological-ecological indicators and LWC The
    physiological-ecological indicators had obvious effects on LWC at each growth
    stage and yield (Fig. 6). The LWC had the highest correlation with grain yield
    at the booting, flowering, and initial grain filling stages. The LWC is the most
    important parameter that regulates grain yield, especially for different irrigation
    treatments. CWSI had the highest correlation coefficient with LWC (− 0.60 to − 0.85)
    at each observed stage, followed by the Fv/Fm (0.56–0.71) and SPAD (0.53–0.67).
    Therefore, CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD can be considered reliable multi-source data
    to improve the detection accuracy of LWC using the vegetation index model. Fig.

    functions between LWC and ND(1287,1673) at different growth stages (Fig. 5) were
    systematically analyzed using multi-source data, such as SPAD, Fv/Fm, and CWSI
    (Fig. 7). Both a and b have significantly quadratic curve relations with CWSI,
    SPAD, and Fv/Fm. For a parameter, the determination coefficient (R2) of the curves
    reached the highest for the CWSI (R2 = 0.92), followed by the SPAD and Fv/Fm.
    In contrast, Fv/Fm had the greatest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.99), while CWSI
    had the lowest R2 with parameter b (R2 = 0.37). The results illustrate that SPAD,
    Fv/Fm, and CWSI can be regarded as useful multi-source data to improve the prediction
    capacities of LWC. Fig. 7 The SPAD value (a), Fv/Fm (b), and CWSI (c) at different
    growth stages merged cultivars, water treatments, and years. The quadratic function

    ND(1287,1673) model in Fig. 4a with SPAD d, Fv/Fm (e), and CWSI (f). Booting:

    middle grain filling; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 indicate significant correlation at
    5% and 1% probability level, respectively Full size image Improving the prediction
    performance of LWC by coupling multi-source data There were no multicollinearity
    between ND and SPAD, between ND and Fv/Fm, between ND and CWSI based on the tolerance
    and variance inflation factor values (Additional file 1: Table S2). Also, Durbin
    Watson test indicated that the established multivariate linear regressed models
    in this study were basically meet the requirements of linear model (Additional
    file 1: Table S2). The indicators CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD were introduced into the
    ND(1287,1673) model to improve the prediction model accuracy of LWC further (Table
    4). The results demonstrated that the ND(1287,1673) model integrating with multi-source
    data enhanced predictive power than the conventional ND(1287,1673) model (Fig.
    5 and Table 4). The coupled models of ND(1287,1673) and CWSI had the best monitoring
    capacity to LWC at the booting and flowering stages (Fig. 8). The R2 improved
    from 0.48–0.64 in conventional ND(1287,1673) models to 0.69–0.75 in the coupled
    models. Prediction R2 also improved from 0.36–0.67 in conventional ND(1287,1673)
    models to 0.65–0.69 in the coupled models at the booting and flowering stages.
    Moreover, the coupling models of ND(1287,1673) and Fv/Fm were optimal at the initial
    and middle grain filling. The R2 and the corresponding prediction R2 improved
    in the coupling models than in conventional ND(1287,1673) models at the initial

    Full size image Discussion Relationship between multi-source data and LWC A suitable
    vegetation index is important to construct an LWC spectral monitoring model in
    smart agriculture. The first important step is to screen the sensitive band. However,
    there are some differences on the selected water-sensitive bands for different
    crops. Thomas et al. [40] discovered a significant correlation between the relative
    water content of cotton leaves and the reflectance values in the near-infrared
    (NIR) bands (1450 and 1930 nm). Yang et al. [41] suggest that the sensitive band
    range of LWC in wheat plants is located in the visible (400–780 nm) and NIR bands
    (1400–2500 nm). This study selected different spectral indices from previous studies
    to establish relationships with rice LWC. However, the correlation was not optimal.
    The ND constructed by the NIR band at 1287 and 1673 nm was instead optimal (Table
    3). This study’s results were inconsistent with those of previous studies. One
    of the important reasons could be that vegetation index models for monitoring
    LWC in our study considered the multiple growth stages of rice plants, rather
    than focusing on a specific growth stage in previous studies. Additionally, the
    spectral data obtained from different ecological sites, climates, and varieties.
    In this study, the varieties were selected for their commonality bands, considering
    the universality of the varieties from which the four rice varieties with a large
    span of validation years and large differences in drought resistance were selected.
    Recently, multi-source data related to environmental factors coupled with the
    spectral monitoring model of LWC has been successfully established in wheat plants
    to reduce the errors caused by environmental and physiological factors during
    the spectral monitoring process [16]. This study used the Pearson correlation
    coefficient method to analyze the physiological and ecological indicators related
    to LWC. Our results displayed that CWSI, Fv/Fm and SPAD would be considered as
    optimized multi-source data because the parameters had a higher correlation with
    LWC compared to other physiological and agronomic indices during whole observed
    periods (Fig. 6). These findings were also consistent with the basic physiological
    laws of plants that the three parameters would be changed with the change of LWC.
    First, the transpiration rate quickly reduces with declining LWC in rice plants
    [42, 43]. A low transpiration rate increases canopy temperature for a short time
    and then fleetly regulates CWSI in the canopy of plants [44, 45]. Second, H2O
    is insufficient to maintain its physiological activities when LWC is low in rice
    plants; the phenomenon quickly downregulates photosynthetic performance, such
    as declining Fv/Fm [46,47,48]. Third, SPAD biosynthesis would be hindered, and
    decomposition could be accelerated if LWC remains low for a long time, resulting
    in the yellowing of leaves [49]. Finally, the fluctuant sensitive parameters lead
    to significant changes in population characteristics, such as leaf area, biomass,
    and yield, presenting different degrees of decline [50]. Therefore, we deduce
    that CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD should be introduced into the spectral monitoring model
    to improve the R2 for monitoring LWC in whole growth stages of rice plants. Coupling
    multi-source data for monitoring rice LWC The canopy structure and growth environment
    of rice have been changing throughout the whole growth period, resulting in different
    spectral reflectance data, making it difficult to accurately build a water prediction
    model for the whole growth period with a single vegetation index model [51]. A
    good relationship between physiological and ecological indicators and spectral
    information is the key to rapid and non-destructive monitoring of coupled multi-source
    data. The relationships between CWSI, Fv/Fm, and SPAD and the slope (a) and intercept
    (b) of the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models were systematically analyzed
    at each observed period to achieve accurate prediction of LWC (Fig. 7). The parameter
    a had the closest relationship with CWSI with R2 of 0.92. However, the parameter
    b had the closest relationship with Fv/Fm with R2 of 0.99. These results indicate
    that the conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models could be largely influenced
    by physiological and ecological factors when LWC was monitored using spectroscopic
    equipment. Therefore, slope and intercept could be defined as ecological and physiological
    factors in conventional linear ND(1287,1673) models, especially for monitoring
    LWC in rice plants. This evidence confirms the necessity of incorporating physiological
    parameters into the conventional ND(1287,1673) model to improve LWC monitoring
    accuracy in rice plants. Currently, multi-source data are widely used in hyperspectral
    monitoring. However, most studies have utilized a single type of multi-source
    numbers to construct models independently or in combination, and few studies have
    discussed the effect of coupled multi-source data on the monitoring performance
    of rice LWC models. This study uses a commonly used multiple linear regression
    algorithm to estimate rice LWC based on coupled multi-source data and compare
    its monitoring performance. The results revealed that the monitoring capacities
    in ND(1287,1673) models coupled with physiological and ecological factors were
    significantly increased than conventional ND(1287,1673) models across all observed
    stages (Tables 3 and 4). The coupled model of ND + CWSI and ND + Fv/Fm had the
    best monitoring capacities at the booting to flowering and initial to middle grain
    filling stages, respectively. The different coupled parameters at different growth
    stages may related to the differences in rice growth characteristics. Previous
    studies have demonstrated that the canopy structure is unstable and that leaf
    area and biomass are in a state of constant growth during the booting and flowering
    stages in rice plants [52]. Irrigation regimes directly regulate canopy growth
    and development [53]. Therefore, the canopy micro-ecological factors, such as
    photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and humidity, constantly fluctuate
    [54], especially for different water treatments. Finally, CWSI is a sensitive
    index at this stage because CWSI is mainly regulated by the micro-ecological factor
    [31, 32]. However, rice plants are in the senescence stage after flowering. Leaf
    photosynthetic capacity significantly declines during the grain-filling stage
    compared to pre-flowering in rice plants [43, 55]. Additionally, photosynthetic
    performances are susceptive to different irrigation regimes during senescence
    processes [56]. Fv/Fm is an important index evaluating photosynthetic performance.
    Therefore, photosynthetic performance could be a better multi-source parameter
    to predict LWC during the rice-filling stage. Comparison of machine learning algorithms
    Machine learning algorithms have recently been widely used in model monitoring
    research and have become popular tools in precision agricultural production research.
    In this study, four machine learning algorithms, DT, RF, KNN, and GBDT were used
    to perform operations based on coupled models using rice flowering data as an
    example (Table 5). The results indicated that the R2 for the simulation and validation
    sets of DT, RF, KNN and GBDT were 0.80–0.93 and 0.75–0.86, respectively, which
    the R2 of machine learning algorithms were 1.16–1.35 times higher for the simulation
    sets and 1.09–1.25 times higher for the validation sets compared with MLR (Fig.
    10). Among them, GBDT has the highest R2 with low and stable RMSE. Therefore,
    the GBDT model would be considered as the best machine learning algorithm for
    monitoring LWC in this study’s simulating and verification data sets. Previous
    research supports our results that the GBDT algorithm has higher prediction accuracy
    for leaf area in maize plants among the aforementioned algorithms [57]. GBDT can
    improve prediction accuracy by constructing a weak learner to correct the original
    model error via residuals and resultant iterations when the sample size is small
    [58]. The same weights are assigned for each input factor for the other algorithms;
    the algorithm would fail to determine the primary contributing factor in the input
    factor if the training data are insufficient [57]. This may be the primary reason
    the GBDT algorithm has significant advantages to improve LWC monitoring capabilities
    in this study because our sample size could not be abundant enough to support
    the data requirements of other algorithms. In summary, machine learning positively
    improves the monitoring abilities of LWC in rice plants. Future perspectives Factors
    such as fertility period and rice LWC changes lead to parameter differences between
    relevant indicators extracted from various data sources. Current crop monitoring
    models are mostly single-factor statistical models that are difficult to consider
    crop growth and development, yield formation and its interactions with climate
    and soil environment, and lack universality and dynamics. Therefore, coupling
    spectral remote sensing information with multivariate data can construct a spectral
    monitoring model with high accuracy and stable reliability of crop growth, moisture
    content, and other indicators, providing an effective solution to the spectral
    monitoring problem. In this study, only four rice cultivars were considered after
    the booting stage, and the early growth of rice has yet to be monitored. Establishing
    a standardized water stress detection and diagnosis system based on water critical
    thresholds at various growth stages of rice will require the accumulation of data
    from multi-year, multi-point, continuous trials based on different rice variety
    types. This can accurately monitor the LWC to ensure high rice yield, improving
    water resource utilization efficiency and providing a basis for implementing precision
    agriculture. Conclusion In this study, the LWC of rice with different cultivars,
    years, and water treatments was monitored based on multi-source data (physiological
    and ecological indicators and spectral information) with machine learning, explored
    the performance of single and combined multi-source data in LWC monitoring, and
    utilized different physiological indicators to establish two monitoring models
    for the growth differences of rice in the initial and middle stages. The results
    displayed that ND + CWSI had better monitoring performance in the early stage
    (booting to flowering stage), while ND + Fv/Fm was better in the late stage (initial
    to middle grain filling stage). Additionally, this study''s newly constructed
    vegetation index ND(1287,1673) also has good monitoring capacities for LWC in
    rice. Meanwhile, the machine learning algorithm (GBDT) further improves the monitoring
    performance of the model. In summary, this study confirms that using multi-source
    data and machine learning can improve the performance of hyperspectral prediction
    of rice LWC. Availability of data and materials The datasets used and/or analyzed

    2024 New water accounting reveals why the Colorado River no longer reaches the
    sea Article Open access 28 March 2024 Background & Summary Accurately representing
    spatial and temporal variability of lake surface water temperatures in numerical
    weather prediction (NWP) systems has been shown (particularly for Earth’s largest
    lakes) to improve short- and long-term forecasts of regional precipitation, air
    temperature, and surface wind velocity1,2,3,4. Thus, realistic representation
    of lake conditions is crucial for the development of the next generation of climate
    and weather forecast models5,6. The database we introduce here was developed to
    support this advancement by providing in situ validation data for a broader project
    sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through
    its Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI). The parallel NOAA JTTI project
    is designed to optimize representation of lake surfaces in the NOAA Unified Forecast
    System (UFS) by exploring the sensitivity of UFS lake models to alternative lake
    bathymetric data sets7. Specifically, the NOAA JTTI project evaluates potential
    impacts of a new global lakes bathymetric dataset (GLOBathy) on simulations of
    lake surface temperature, and temperature depth profiles, in UFS 1-D lake models8.
    It is informative to note that these models are currently operationalized within
    NOAA’s High-Resolution Rapid Refresh model, or HRRR9, which simulates lake physics
    using a 1-D lake model included in the Community Land Model v4.510 with a 3-km
    horizontal resolution, and 10 vertical (depth) layers. Following an iterative
    in situ monitoring platform selection protocol (details below) we obtained near-surface
    and subsurface lake temperature data from 134 sites across 29 lakes which (through
    the parallel NOAA study referenced above) can be used to validate HRRR lake model
    simulations. We solicited and stored temperature data at the highest temporal
    resolution available, which varies from site to site; at some sites, data is available
    at sub-hourly resolution and, at others, at relatively coarse (e.g. semi-annual
    or monthly) resolution. Of the 134 sites in our database, 84 include temperature
    measurements across multiple depths, allowing for comprehensive validation of
    HRRR 1-D lake column model simulations. While the lakes presented here represent
    a subset of all lakes in the HRRR model, we believe that, because they are among
    the model domain’s largest lakes (by surface area; see methods below), they might
    be expected to have the most profound impacts on surrounding terrestrial weather
    and climate dynamics. We note that the Laurentian Great Lakes are not included
    in the NOAA UFS study because they are represented through a separate 3-D modeling
    framework11,12 operated through NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS). In situ data
    for validating Laurentian Great Lakes 3-D models is collected and utilized separately
    and specifically for the NOS modeling initiative, and is therefore not addressed
    here. Ultimately, the goal of our database is to provide an organized, easily-accessible
    aggregation of in situ lake temperature profile data that can be used not only
    to support validation for the NOAA UFS 1-D lake model experiments, but to serve
    as a resource for related lake model validation and empirical data analysis studies
    as well (see Figs. 1 and 2). Fig. 1 Map of the coterminous United States indicating
    the location of all 29 lakes in our study (blue polygons; magnified slightly to
    improve clarity). For 9 representative lakes, we also include an overlay of in
    situ monitoring sites (each represented by a blue ‘x’), lake boundaries, and the
    corresponding 3 km × 3 km HRRR lake model pixels (yellow grids). The 9 representative
    lakes are, from top left advancing clockwise, Lake Washington, Flathead Lake,
    Devils Lake, Red Lake, Oneida Lake, Lake Okeechobee, Lake Tawakoni, Lake Mead,
    and Mono Lake. See Fig. 5 for corresponding details for all 29 lakes in our study.
    Full size image Fig. 2 Representative example (from Oneida Lake, NY) of the relationship
    between in situ station locations (top subfigure; each represented by a blue ‘x’
    and labeled with its site code), HRRR pixels (yellow squares), and corresponding
    temperature data for each station in 2019. Full size image Methods We collected
    lake temperature data from a variety of sources, each requiring a different approach,
    ranging from scraping online federal agency repositories to collaborating with
    and soliciting data from local water quality monitoring organizations. Federal
    agency repositories from which we collected data include the NOAA National Data
    Buoy Center (NDBC)13, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water
    Information System (NWIS)14, and the Water Quality Portal (WQP) - a cooperative
    service maintained and sponsored by USGS and the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency15. The temperature data we collected from local organizations is unlikely
    to be included in the aforementioned federal repositories. It is informative to
    note that any data we have collected for a given lake in our study may be aggregated
    across one or more of these sources (for a summary, see Table 1). It is also informative
    to note that data quality, spatiotemporal resolution, and temporal continuity
    can vary greatly from source to source (see Fig. 3); some sources provide quality-controlled
    data throughout a lake’s depth profile at high temporal resolution, while others
    provide relatively sparse temperature data collected by local ad hoc or citizen-based
    groups with little documentation on quality control methods. Feedback from database
    users has highlighted that direct examination of the data significantly aids in
    understanding its characteristics, especially for individual lakes or sites. Accordingly,
    we’ve included a script within the database repository to facilitate the creation
    of data plots for each site. Table 1 Metadata associated with each lake included
    in the database. Full size table Fig. 3 Representative time series (showing only
    2018 through 2022 for clarity) of temperature data from five surface (or near-surface)
    sensors in our database. This time series underscores differences in temporal
    resolution and continuity across different sensors and lakes; a more comprehensive
    summary of temporal and spatial (i.e. depth) resolution and continuity is included
    in Table 2, and the database repository includes a script to visualize the data
    of each individual sensor. Year labels on x-axis are positioned at the beginning
    of a calendar year. Full size image One of the most important design features
    of the parallel NOAA lake model simulation study made possible by our database
    was a focus on evaluating historical lake temperature simulations in 29 of the
    largest (by surface area) lakes across the continental United States (CONUS).
    A second important design feature of the NOAA lake model study was a focus on
    assessing lake model simulation results from just one calendar year (following
    a model spin-up period) given the relatively high computational expense of running
    the HRRR model at CONUS scale. Therefore, the collective criteria for including
    a monitoring platform in our database is that it comes from one of the largest
    lakes across CONUS for which there is at least one in situ temperature observation
    within a recent calendar year. The selection of a common recent calendar year,
    in turn, is intended to maximize the total number of temperature data points across
    the selected lakes and monitoring platforms. The results of our manual and iterative
    selection process identified 2019 as the calendar year that maximizes the total
    number of in situ observations across the largest CONUS lakes. Based on our analysis
    of federal databases and conversations with individual (i.e. local) database managers,
    it is our understanding that 2019 was (for the purposes of our study) an “optimal”
    year for aggregating lake temperature data because many in situ monitoring platforms
    were discontinued in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. As a result of this selection
    criteria, our database includes data from monitoring platforms for which there
    was at least one measurement (and, typically, many more measurements) in 2019.
    However, in order to support any future related empirical and model validation
    studies we also included any and all data available over a historical period from
    January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2022, although data availability may vary
    greatly for years other than 2019 (see Table 2). Table 2 Select summary statistics
    categorized by data source and then by each lake for which the source has provided
    data. Full size table We used the R Statistical Software (v4.2.116) to extract
    and store variables from each monitoring platform including sample collection
    date and time (UTC), coordinate location, depth (m), and water temperature (C).
    Details on our final data formatting are included in the Data Records section.
    Details on how we extracted data from each source are included in the subsections
    below, with related metadata summarized in Tables 1, 2. National Data Buoy Center
    (NDBC) The NDBC is located within NOAA’s National Weather Service, and is responsible
    for collecting, managing, and distributing meteorological and oceanographic data
    from a network of buoys and coastal stations located in oceans, coastal waters,
    and large lakes (including the Great Lakes, which are not included in this database).
    All data is quality controlled and publicly available here: (https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/).
    National Water Information System (NWIS) The USGS NWIS is a comprehensive database
    containing a wide range of water-related data including streamflow, groundwater
    levels, and water quality data including lake temperatures. Lakes that met our
    study’s criteria were found manually using the online NWIS mapper (https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/),
    and their data was accessed using the dataRetrieval17 package in R by specifying
    site identification numbers, desired date ranges, and the parameter code for water
    temperature. Note that the WQP (described in detail below) includes data from
    the NWIS, but at a much lower temporal resolution. Water Quality Portal (WQP)
    The WQP is a centralized repository maintained by the United States EPA and the
    USGS, integrating data from multiple agencies and organizations18. Data from sites
    in the NWIS are included in the WQP, but typically at a lower resolution. Thus
    data was extracted directly from the NWIS wherever there was overlap with the
    WQP, and the WQP was instead used to extract data aggregated from other sources.
    WQP data can also be accessed in R via the dataRetrieval package, similar to procedures
    used with the NWIS. Due to the immense amount of data provided by the WQP, users
    can search for sites that meet certain criteria before requesting a specific site’s
    data. We used this functionality to search for all sites of type “Lake”, “Reservoir”,
    or “Impoundment” containing any water temperature data in the year 2019. Once
    we had a large list of sites meeting this criteria, we used ArcGIS to filter out
    any sites not located on a lake over 30 km2. This left us with a much shorter
    list of site names which we could then use to query the data of each site individually.
    The format for reporting depths of observations varies across different sites
    within the WQP. Some sites were not given a depth value and were instead reported
    as “near-surface”; we recorded these as a depth of 0.1 m. Other sites report depth
    values to a very high precision (<0.1 m). We rounded these depth values to the
    nearest 1 m for sites containing temperature values throughout a profile of 5 m
    or deeper, and to the nearest 0.5 m for sites with a shallower profile of less
    than 5 m. In either case, values of 0 m were then shifted to 0.1 m as the sensors
    included in the WQP only record bulk temperature. Other sources In addition to
    the well-known and established described in the sections above, we gathered data
    from a multitude of other websites and local sources, including the following:
    Flathead Lake - from the Flathead Lake Bio Station (FLBS) site (https://flbs.umt.edu/apps/weather/)
    which includes surface water temperatures at four sites. All sites have downloadable
    data dating back to 2011, and we omitted periods of data reporting extremely egregious
    lake temperature values ( < −50 C). Lake McConaughy - provided directly by Nate
    Nielsen of the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District (CNPPID).
    While data at Lake McConaughy is available in the WQP, we were able to obtain
    higher spatial and temporal resolution data from the files shared with us directly
    by the CNPPID. Lake Mendota - provided online by the Space Science & Engineering
    Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (https://metobs.ssec.wisc.edu/data_download/).
    We extracted the data at an hourly resolution, though other resolutions are available
    for download as well. Mono Lake - provided directly by Dr. Robert Jellison of
    the University of California (UC) Santa Barbara and the Mono Lake Committee (https://www.monolake.org/).
    Oneida Lake - provided by Dr. Lars Rudstam at the Cornell University Biological
    Field Station19. While Oneida Lake temperature data is also available through
    the Knowledge Network for Biodiversity (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), the
    high resolution temperature profile data provided by Dr. Rudstam is not available
    online. Pyramid Lake - provided by Jennessy Toribio, a fisheries biologist at
    Pyramid Lake Fisheries (PLF). PLF data is sampled monthly, and while there is
    no exact time specified in the raw data, the PLF stated that readings are typically
    taken in the late morning. We therefore assigned a timestamp to each recording
    of 10am local time. Sebago Lake - publicly available through the Portland Water
    District (https://www.pwd.org/sebago-lake-monitoring-buoy). Lake Tahoe - provided
    from two contacts; Dr. Gerardo Rivera at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) provided data from three sites at an extremely
    high temporal resolution, but only for shallow profiles in September 2019. Dr.
    Shohei Watanabe of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center (TERC) provided
    monthly temperature profiles dating back to 2010 throughout the entire depth profile
    of Lake Tahoe, but only at a single site. The original TERC data includes temperature
    measurements at every meter to a depth of 480 m. Our final database includes these
    temperature measurements at meter intervals to a depth of 50 m, and at 10-meter
    intervals from 50 m to 480 m (the original higher resolution data is available
    in the Raw_data section of our database). Lake Washington - provided online by
    King County, WA (https://green2.kingcounty.gov/lake-buoy/Data.aspx). All values
    from March 2009 were omitted due to noticably incongruous data. Lake Winnipesaukee
    - provided online by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (https://www4.des.state.nh.us/rivertraksearch/search.html).
    Data Records Our database is deposited in “Deep Blue Data”, the University of
    Michigan’s institutional data repository20. It can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.7302/7gnd-mj10.
    The database contains sub-directories for each lake. Within the sub-directory
    for each lake is the R script used to extract all data for that lake, a metadata
    table with the latitude/longitude location and depth of each temperature sensor,
    and a directory containing the temperature data for each sensor in csv format
    with two columns for the date/time (in UTC) and the temperature (C). Each sensor’s
    data filename is formatted as ABCXX_YY.csv where ABC is a three letter code for
    the lake, XX is a unique numerical identifier for the latitude/longitude location
    of the site, and YY is a numerical identifier for the depth of that sensor. A
    more detailed explanation of the directory structure is included in a README file
    within the database. Technical Validation The data we collected from federal agency
    repositories (e.g. NDBC, NWIS, and WQP) and some local sources were subjected
    to repository-specific quality control methods, each of which is described in
    detail in the respective repository’s literature and (if available) web-site.
    Regardless, we visually inspected all data at all depths and removed data points
    or time periods periods with egregiously erroneous values for a very small number
    of sites (as described in the Methods section). Additionally, to ensure overall
    data reliability, we validated our in situ temperatures against remote sensed
    surface temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS), which has a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km21. We used MODIS
    Terra and Aqua land surface temperature products, which collectively provide up
    to four surface water temperature observations per day, per 1-km grid cell, to
    validate our in situ observations. We recognize there are challenges to comparing
    gridded remote sensing temperature data to in situ data, especially along lake
    shorelines where there is a potential for land contamination22. To address this
    challenge, we filtered (i.e. removed, prior to validation) in situ sites within
    a 1-km buffer of any lake shoreline, leaving 79 of our total 134 in situ sites
    for validation. Then, because the original intent of our database was to validate
    (in the parallel NOAA study) HRRR lake models for only the calendar year 2019,
    we interrogated surface temperature data for MODIS pixels corresponding to each
    selected in situ site location in calendar year 2019 via NASA’s AppEEARS data
    portal (https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/). Specifically, the products
    obtained via AppEEARS were MOD21A1D.06123, MOD21A1N.06124, MYD21A1D.06125, and
    MYD21A1N.06126. It is informative to note that the MODIS data obtained through
    AppEEARS has quality thresholds of 0 (poor), 1 (marginal), 2 (good), or 3 (excellent)
    for each sensor reading, with each quality threshold corresponding to an error
    of >2.0 K, 1.5–2.0 K, 1.0–1.5 K, or <1.0 K, respectively. We only used MODIS data
    with a quality threshold of 2 or higher (i.e. reported error of <1.5 K) for our
    validation. A visual comparison between our in situ data and data from each corresponding
    MODIS pixel (see Fig. 4 for a representative time series from four sites) suggests
    that the in situ temperatures are generally consistent with MODIS, with minimal
    pronounced visible bias. To supplement this visual comparison, we calculated the
    bias (relative to MODIS) of each in situ data point, along with the root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) of each site and the RMSE across all sites. Specifically, for each
    MODIS data point, we identified the closest in situ value that was collected within
    3 hours of the MODIS observation. If there was no in situ data collected within
    3 hours of the MODIS observation, then that MODIS observation was not used for
    validation. This approach resulted in 1,808 pairs of in situ and MODIS temperatures.
    The RMSE and bias across all validation data pairs was 2.780 K and 0.023 K, respectively
    (with MODIS being slightly warmer on average), and a more detailed assessment
    of RMSE and bias for each monitoring platform (Table 3) indicates that bias is
    generally low, especially at sites for which there is a high number of observations.

    26 March 2024 Introduction Population growth, climate change, and globalization
    are the main factors affecting water resources1. Among the main controlling factors,
    climate changes play a serious role when researchers evaluate both the quality
    and quantity of water resources2,3. Climate change is already affecting water
    access for people around the world, causing more severe droughts and floods. It
    impacts the water cycle by influencing when, where, and how much precipitation
    falls4,5. Climate change also profoundly effects water resources by shifting rainfall
    patterns, enhancing temperatures, and altering the timing of glacier melt and
    snowfall, leading to changes in the seasonality of drainage flows6,7. Therefore,
    identifying various predisposing climatic variables is a crucial issue for determining
    the impacts of climate change on water resources8,9. Meteorological datasets are
    the most common way to monitor the effects of climate change. However, traditional
    mapping based on meteorological stations is labor-intensive, slower, and more
    expensive. Additionally, the problems with sensors placed there can increase the
    error in the obtained data10. In this regard, during the last decades, remote
    sensing technology has been exhibiting high potential for monitoring the impacts
    of climate change at large scales11,12,13. One of the main benefits of remote
    sensing lies in its non-intrusive nature14. Passive sensors capture electromagnetic
    energy without disrupting the object or area under observation. This enables researchers
    to monitor natural phenomena without requiring changes to their methods or behaviors15.
    Remote sensing also offers valuable data on critical climate variables such as
    temperature, precipitation, and vegetation dynamics. By conducting ongoing monitoring,
    scientists can analyze patterns, simulate climate scenarios, and assess the effects
    of climate change on ecosystems and susceptible regions16. In recent decades,
    Lake Urmia (LU) has experienced significant desiccation, primarily due to inadequate
    water management. The construction of numerous upstream dam reservoirs, which
    has led to the expansion of irrigated agriculture, is the main culprit behind
    this imposed disaster. Irrigated agriculture stands out as the largest water user
    in the region17,18. LU has been shrinking at an alarming rate. Between 1996 and
    2016, its water level dropped by approximately 8 m19. This drastic reduction in
    the lake''s size has not only posed a threat to its valuable ecosystem and the
    local economy but has also resulted in severe problems such as dust storms and
    skin and respiratory diseases20,21. Efforts have been made to identify the factors
    contributing to this alarming shrinkage of the LU. During the period of the lake''s
    decline, there has been an increasing trend in temperature and a decreasing trend
    in precipitation within the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB)22,23,24,25. Additionally, agricultural
    land has expanded by 98% from 1987 to 201619, leading to a significant increase
    in water withdrawal from rivers and groundwater resources during the same period22.
    Consequently, the inflow of water into the lake has decreased26. Thus, the alarming
    shrinkage of the lake can be attributed to a combination of climatic extremes
    and anthropogenic activities, along with unsustainable water management27. To
    address the environmental tragedy of the LU, the Lake Urmia Restoration Program
    (ULRP) was initiated in 2013 as a ten-year program. The ULRP is divided into three
    phases: (i) stabilizing the current status (2014–2016), (ii) restoration (2016–2020),
    and (iii) sustainable restoration (2020–2024). Several studies have assessed the
    progress of the ULRP, highlighting various challenges. Danesh-Yazdi and Ataie-Ashtiani28
    have raised concerns about the underestimation of data and the importance of data-driven
    modeling in the ULRP. Sima et al.29 noted that the ecological level set by the
    ULRP (1274.1 m above sea level) falls short of achieving the target salinity of
    240 g/l. Saemian et al.30 concluded that 80% of the increase in the lake''s water
    volume is attributed to increased inflow from rivers and reservoirs, and recovery
    may be compromised during prolonged drought periods. Parsinejad et al.31 argued
    that lake restoration requires a comprehensive approach that considers both human
    and natural components. The impacts of climate oscillations and climate change
    on the occurrence of surface and subsurface water can be calculated and analyzed
    to demonstrate how water resources are affected by natural or human activities32.
    Global datasets indicating water resource locations have been obtained from satellite
    imagery observational data, inventories, and national descriptions. However, investigating
    climate changes at both spatial and temporal scales remains challenging33,34.
    Many studies focus on measuring present or future water resources35,36,37,38 and
    water quality39,40,41,42 using information derived from satellite imagery. These
    studies contribute to the development of sustainable water management approaches
    by evaluating the impacts of climate change and global warming on water resources.
    Global datasets documenting the location and seasonal variations of surface water
    have been generated through inventories, national reports, statistical extrapolation
    from regional data, and satellite imagery. However, accurately measuring long-term
    changes at high resolution remains a challenging task. Although remote sensing-based
    methods and products have employed for mapping water resources in water studies,
    it is important to consider new products such as JRC Global Surface Water Mapping
    Layers, v1.4 with a spatial resolution of 30 m to update these datasets and approaches.
    It furnishes valuable statistics pertaining to the extent and alterations in water
    surfaces36. This product offers comprehensive insights into various aspects of
    water surfaces, including seasonal, temporal, monthly, and permanent reservoir
    information. It distinguishes itself from other Landsat products, most notably
    the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) dataset spanning from 1999 to 202043,
    the global surface water dataset (GSWD) covering the years 1984 to 201536, and
    the landsat dynamic surface water extent (DSWE) dataset developed by44. The literature
    review reveals that several studies have utilized remote sensing datasets in combination
    with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to map and monitor long-term changes
    in water surfaces45,46,47. Several studies48,49,50 have also explored the relationship
    between fundamental climatic variables (such as air temperature (AT), evapotranspiration
    (Eta), and precipitation) and water resources. Previous studies have employed
    the GEE platform to map water surface changes using Sentinel and Landsat series
    images45,47,51. However, limited research has utilized the Landsat high-resolution
    mapping of the global surface water product (JRC Global Surface Water Mapping
    Layers, v1.4) for mapping and monitoring changes in water resources36,52. Therefore,
    the objectives of this study are to: (1) monitor the impacts of climate change
    on water resources in LUB, Iran, (2) estimate the relationship between different
    climatic variables (AT, ETa, and precipitation) and changes in water surfaces,
    and (3) assess the efficiency of the Landsat high-resolution surface water product
    in tracking trends in various water resources. Study area The study area is the
    LUB, located in the northeast of Iran, with a land area of 51,876 km2 (Fig. 1).
    Approximately 10% of this area is occupied by LU. The LUB is fed by a total of
    60 rivers, of which 21 are permanent or seasonal, and 39 are temporary. Notably,
    the Zarineh river, Simineh river, and Aji Chai serve as the main inflows to LU.
    Within this basin, Zarineh river (14%), Simineh river (11%), Godar (8%), Barandoz
    (6%), Shahrchai (2%), and Nazlu Chai (6%) are joined by seven seasonal rivers,
    39 intermittent streams, internal springs, as well as rainfall and snowfall to
    sustain LU. The rivers in this watershed are categorized based on their water
    sources, exhibiting distinct characteristics in the east and west of the lake.
    The rivers to the east and southeast of the lake originate from high-altitude
    sources such as Sahand, Sabalan, and Chehel Cheshme in Kurdistan, following relatively
    longer courses and remaining perennial (e.g., Aji Chai, Zarineh river, Simineh
    river, and Sufi Chai). In contrast, the western, southwestern, and northern rivers
    of the lake, which have shorter distances and carry less water, include Godar
    Chai, Nazlo Chai, and Zola Chai22,53. The region is characterized by a semi-arid
    and dry-cold climate, with an average annual rainfall of 359.1 mm, a minimum temperature
    of 4.3 °C, and a maximum temperature of 17.7 °C54. Evaporation rates range from
    930 to 1513 mm per year55. The Lake receives approximately 25% of its inflow from
    direct precipitation and 75% from 60 permanent or seasonal rivers56. Figure 1

    Full size image There have been significant changes in the water surface area
    of the LU from year to year (Fig. 2), particularly in the southern regions of
    the lake where the lake bed occasionally becomes exposed during summer and fall57.
    From 2014 to 2016, 2015 experienced the minimum lake surface area, while 2016
    experienced the maximum lake surface area. In August, the minimum and maximum
    surface areas were 1550 km2 and 2500 km2 in 2015 and 2016, respectively, clearly
    indicating the rapid shrinkage of the lake in recent years58. Figure 2 Spatio-temporal

    the GEE platform, we mapped and monitored the trends of these climatic variables
    from 2000 to 2021. Additionally, a high-resolution global surface water product,
    available from March 16, 1984, to December 31, 2021, was integrated into the GEE
    platform. In the final stage of the study, the correlation coefficient between
    climatic variables and changes in water resources was estimated. Climatic variables
    The temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method, originally introduced by Nemani
    et al.59 and further developed by Goward et al.60, has been successfully applied
    to estimate near-surface air temperature. It has been successfully applied to
    various satellite temperature datasets, as demonstrated by Czajkowski et al.61
    and Lakshmi et al.62. In this study, we employed MODIS Land Surface Temperature
    (LST) products (MOD11A2.061), meteorological station data, and MODIS Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets to estimate AT using the TVX method
    from 2000 to 2021 (Fig. 3a). This method relies on the underlying assumption that
    a strong negative correlation exists between LST and a vegetation index. For more
    comprehensive information on the TVX method, please consult the following references:59
    and60. The linear relationship between LST and NDVI is expressed by Eq. (1): $$LST={a}_{t,i}+{b}_{t,i}.NDVI$$
    (1) where \\(t\\) and \\(i\\) represent that the regression coefficients \\(a\\)
    and \\(b\\) are time dependent and factor in each moving window \\(i\\). Once
    Eq. (1) established, the AT can be extrapolated for the pixel located at the center
    of the moving window by allowing the linear relationship to intersect with the
    NDVI value associated with full vegetation cover. The estimation equation is as
    follows: $${T}_{t,i}={a}_{t,i}+{b}_{t,i}.{NDVI}_{max}$$ (2) where \\({T}_{t,i}\\)
    represents the AT of the pixel cantered at the moving window \\(i\\) in time \\(t\\),
    and \\({NDVI}_{max}\\) denotes the NDVI value of full vegetation cover. Figure
    3 Various climatic variables for mapping and monitoring the impacts of climate
    change on water resources throughout the LUB, generated in the ArcGIS 10.7.1 software
    (www.esri.com): (a) Air Temperature (AT) (°C), (b) actual evapotranspiration (ETa)
    (mm/d), and (c) total precipitation (mm/h) for the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and
    2021. Full size image We also used the MODIS ETa product [PML_V2 0.1.7: Coupled
    Evapotranspiration and Gross Primary Product (GPP)] based on the GEE platform
    to monitor the impacts of climate change on water resources from 2000 to 2021
    (Fig. 3b). The PML_V2 0.1.7 product (unit = mm/d) provides information about 8-day
    evapotranspiration at a resolution of 500 m. ETa refers to the amount of moisture
    that evaporates from the Earth’s surface and transpires from plants to the atmosphere.
    As we can see in Fig. 3b, ETa rate increased about 0.32 ml over the LUB from 2000
    to 2021. The maximum ETa rates were estimated to be 12.33, 11.81, 12.01, and 12.65
    for the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2021, respectively. Another climatic factor
    used in this study is the GPM: Monthly Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)
    v6 product (Fig. 3c). The global precipitation measurement (GPM) is an international
    satellite mission that provides advanced observations of rain and snow globally
    every three hours. Figure 3c provides insight into the precipitation trend in
    the LUB between 2000 and 2021. As depicted in the figure, there has been a noticeable
    decrease in the precipitation rate during this time period. Specifically, the
    precipitation rates for the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2021 were estimated to
    be 0.094, 0.088, 0.079, and 0.070, respectively. This data underscores a clear
    downward trend in precipitation over the specified years. Water product The JRC
    Global Surface Water Mapping Layers, v1.4, is a comprehensive dataset that provides
    detailed information about water bodies worldwide, including their extent and
    shoreline characteristics36. This dataset covers the period from 1984 to 2021
    and offers maps of surface water location and temporal distribution. It offers
    valuable statistics regarding the extent and changes in water surfaces. Table
    1 presents further details about the notable features of this product. The data
    is generated using 4,716,475 scenes acquired from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 between
    March 16, 1984, and December 31, 2021, with a spatial resolution of 30 m. An expert
    system is employed to classify pixels into water and non-water categories, and
    the results are compiled into historical periods and two epochs (1984–1999, 2000–2021)
    for change detection63,64. This mapping layer product consists of one image containing
    seven bands, which collectively map different aspects of surface water spatial
    and temporal distribution over the last 38 years. To access the JRC code via Google

    This study employed an integrated approach that combined remote sensing techniques
    and the GEE to monitor the effects of climate change on water resources in the
    LUB. Figure 4 provides an overview of the methodology used for mapping and monitoring
    the impacts of climate change on water resources. Figure 4 A brief review of the
    applied methodology for mapping and monitoring the impacts of climate change on
    water resources, generated in the Microsoft Office Word 2023 (https://www.microsoft.com).
    Full size image Google Earth Engine The GEE offers a wide range of geospatial
    datasets and satellite imagery, accompanied by powerful spatial analysis capabilities.
    It is extensively used by researchers, scientists, and industry professionals
    to generate maps that facilitate the detection of surface changes on Earth. In
    the context of this study, various MODIS and Landsat global water surface products
    were employed within the GEE platform. Data retrieval on the GEE platform is straightforward,
    requiring only a few commands without the need to handle data loading manually.
    The platform automatically processes the commands and manages the data retrieval
    process66,67. Since the command takes care of calling the dataset, radiometric
    and geometric correction are not necessary. Users are expected to write code according
    to their specific processing requirements. The implemented code facilitated the
    execution of the following operations. Spatial subset on the interested area;
    Temporal subset on the collection datasets; Selecting the targeted datasets; Exporting
    the selected datasets to perform further analysis. Statistical analysis The Mann–Kendall
    (MK) non-parametric trend test68 was employed to identify statistically significant
    trends (p < 0.05) in the time series data (Eqs. 3 and 4). To address serial correlation
    effect, the modified version of the MK test proposed by69 was applied. Moreover,
    the Spearman partial correlation analysis70 was conducted to determine the most
    influential climate factor contributing to the dynamics of water resources. These
    statistical techniques have been widely employed in previous studies investigating
    climate variability and change in water resources worldwide (e.g.,71). $$S=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{n}sgn({x}_{j}-{x}_{i})$$
    (3) $$sgn\\left({x}_{j}-{x}_{i}\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}+1\\\\ 0\\\\
    -1\\end{array} \\begin{array}{c}{x}_{j}>{x}_{i}\\\\ {x}_{i}={x}_{j}\\\\ {x}_{j}<{x}_{i}\\end{array}\\right.$$
    (4) where \\(n\\) represents the length of the time series, and \\({x}_{i}\\)
    and \\({x}_{j}\\) denote the sequential data amounts, respectively. For \\(n>10\\),
    given that \\({x}_{i}\\) is independent and randomly ordered, the statistic \\(S\\)
    is approximately normally distributed with a mean of zero. Results This study
    applied an integrated approach involving remote sensing datasets and GEE to monitor
    climate change effects on water resources over the LUB, Iran. Figures 5 and 7
    show the results of water surface changes over the study area. Based on Fig. 5a,
    which illustrates the frequency of water presence from 1984 to 2021 (see Table
    2), it is evident that in the central parts of the LU, water has consistently
    been present throughout this period, accounting for 0.99% of the area. This corresponds
    to an approximate area of 0.051 km2 (as shown in Figure 6). In contrast, the surrounding
    areas of the central parts have undergone significant changes in terms of water
    presence. Figure 5b provides insight into the absolute change in water occurrence
    between two epochs: 1984–1999 and 2000–2021 (see Table 2). The findings reveal
    that there has been a significant change in water presence across most of the
    LUB area. With the exception of dams and a small portion of the LU in the northern
    part of the LUB, the entire area has experienced such changes from 1984 to 2021.
    According to Table 2, approximately 73.58% of the study area has undergone an
    absolute change in water presence during the period of 1984–2021. Similarly, apart
    from dams and a small part of the LU in the northern region of the LUB, there
    has been a substantial change in surface water presence from 1984 to 2021, which
    illustrates the normalized occurrence change (see Fig. 5c). Table 3 further supports
    this observation, indicating that approximately 66.29% of the study area within
    the LUB has experienced a change in water presence over the period of 1984–2021.
    Figure 5d provides insights into the number of months during which water was present
    in the study area from 1984 to 2021. The data presented in Fig. 5d and Table 4,
    indicate that January (10.82%) and December (56.08%) have a high level of water
    availability. The high water availability in December and January can be attributed
    to the occurrence of snow, which is common during the winter season in the study
    area. Furthermore, the increase in water surface during the spring months of April,
    May, and June can be attributed to the higher amount of precipitation in the study
    area during this season. Figure 5e in this study displays the frequency of water
    return from year to year between 1984 and 2021. It indicates that the central
    parts of the LU have the highest percentage of water return, suggesting that these
    areas have experienced more consistent recovery of water over time. On the other
    hand, the surrounding areas of the LU, as depicted in Fig. 5e, have not witnessed
    significant water recovery from year to year (Fig. 6). Figure 7 presents a categorical
    classification of the changes that occurred between the first and last years from
    1984 to 2021. According to Fig. 7, the surrounding areas of the LU have undergone
    significant changes in terms of water conditions compared to previous years. Out
    of the total, 38.65% has been identified as permanently water-covered from 1984
    to 2021. Within this permanent water area, 0.34% has been newly classified as
    permanent, as indicated in Fig. 8. Over the study period, a permanent water area
    of 12.78% has been lost. Additionally, 2.74% has been detected as seasonal water
    resources from 1984 to 2021. While 3.98% of the LUB has experienced a loss in
    seasonal water resources, 4.12% has been newly added as seasonal water resources,
    as illustrated in Fig. 8. Figure 8 shows that there has been no change in the
    conversion of seasonal to permanent water resources over the study area from 1984
    to 2021. However, 28.99% of the permanent water has been converted to seasonal
    water in the LUB during this period, as depicted in Fig. 8. Furthermore Fig. 8
    indicates that 0.48% and 7.84% of the water resources have been classified as
    ephemeral permanent and ephemeral seasonal, respectively, over the study area
    from 1984 to 2021. Figure 5 Results of the employed Landsat high-resolution global

    Full size image Our findings indicate correlation coefficients of − 0.55, − 0.59,
    and 0.39 between water area and AT, ETa, and precipitation, respectively (Fig.
    9 and Table 5). According to our research, climate change has affected water resources
    from 1984 to 2021, which is in accordance with the results of22. They observed
    that over the past few decades, a warming trend of approximately 0.18 °C per decade
    has been identified, while precipitation in the basin has been decreasing by about
    9 mm per decade. As a result of this significant warming, ETa from the lake has
    been increasing at a rate of 6.2 mm per decade. The rising AT and increased ETa,
    combined with the decreasing precipitation, indicate that LUB has been experiencing
    meteorological drought conditions. In addition to climate change effects19, discovered
    a roughly 98% increase in agricultural lands and a substantial 180% increase in
    urban areas between 1987 and 2016. Consequently, the lake area experienced a significant
    reduction of around 86%. Their studies also revealed a decline in terrestrial
    water storage in the lake region, with the lake losing water at a faster rate
    than the watershed. Comparing river inflow to the lake, it is evident that human
    water management activities resulted in a reduction in streamflow of approximately
    1.74 km3/year from 1995 to 2010. This reduction accounts for approximately 86%
    of the total decrease in the lake''s volume during the same period72 also indicated
    that the process of change in LU was slow between 1970 and 1997. However, the
    shrinkage accelerated between 1998 and 2018, with approximately 30.00% of the
    lake''s area disappearing. According to their findings, anthropogenic factors,
    such as population growth, extensive dam construction, low irrigation water use
    efficiency, poor water resources management, increased sediment flow into the
    LU, and the absence of political and legal frameworks, had a much greater impact
    on LU than climate change and prolonged drought. The mismanagement of water consumption
    in the agricultural sector and the extraction of surface and groundwater from
    the basin have resulted in a sharp decrease in the lake''s surface area. Figure

    The significance of the trend lines was determined using the Mann–Kendall test.
    The trend line slope is based on Sen''s slope estimator. In cases where a time
    series experienced a significant abrupt shift, identified by Buishand''s test,
    the change year is indicated. For these instances, “mu” denotes the average of
    the sub-series. Full size image Table 5 Spearman correlations and partial correlations
    of the water surface area with climatic variables, including AT and total precipitation,
    throughout the LUB over the period 2000–2021. Full size table In this study, the
    water surface area in the LUB exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.05)
    decline of 2.0% decade−1 over the past two decades. This decline was accompanied
    by a significant downward abrupt shift in 2008, resulting in an average sub-series
    of 9% before the shift and 7% after the shift. Conversely, AT showed a significant
    increase of 1.02 °C decade−1, with an upward abrupt shift identified in 2012.
    The average sub-series after the shift was 1.2 °C higher than the average before
    the shift. On the other hand, annual total precipitation experienced a decline
    of 20 mm decade−1 in the LUB during the period of 2000–2021, but no statistically
    significant trends or variations were observed. In general, there were negative
    correlations observed between water surface and AT, while positive correlations
    were found with total precipitation throughout LUB from 2000 to 2021 (Table 5).
    It was observed that an increase in AT corresponded to a decrease in water surface
    area, highlighting the significant influence of AT and ETa on controlling the
    water surface in the LUB (partial rho of − 0.65 and − 0.68, respectively) (See22).
    A partial correlation coefficient assesses the strength and direction of a relationship
    between two variables while controlling for the influence of other variables.
    In this case, it indicates a moderately strong negative correlation between AT
    and water surface area when considering the effects of other potential influencing
    factors. These findings imply that as AT rises, there is a tendency for water
    surface area to decrease. It is important to note that correlation does not necessarily
    imply causation, and further analysis might be needed to establish the underlying
    mechanisms driving this relationship. In practical terms, these findings could
    have implications for understanding and managing water resources in semi-arid
    and arid regions. High AT might lead to increased ET or changes in hydrological
    patterns, which could impact water availability and ecosystem dynamics. Conversely,
    no significant relationship was found with precipitation and water surface area
    (partial rho of + 0.25). The partial correlation coefficient of + 0.25 suggests
    a weak positive correlation between these two variables when accounting for other
    factors. This means that, in the context of our study, changes in precipitation
    do not seem to have a strong influence on variations in water surface area. This
    finding aligns with the work of54, who also reported a lack of significant correlation
    between water level and precipitation in the case of the LU. In their study, they
    demonstrated a significant negative correlation (rho of − 0.68) between water
    level and temperature, indicating that as temperature increased, the water level
    decreased. However, they found no significant correlation (rho of + 0.10) between
    water level and precipitation. These consistent findings across different studies
    highlight the complex interactions between climatic variables and water bodies.
    While temperature appears to have a more pronounced impact on water surface area
    or water levels, precipitation might not exhibit a clear relationship in certain
    contexts. This could be due to the influence of various other factors, such as
    ET rates, runoff patterns, and local hydrological characteristics. The results
    of the partial correlation analysis, which aimed to identify the most influential
    climate factor contributing to water resource dynamics while considering the effect
    of each studied climatic variable, revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.05)
    correlation of − 0.656 between water surface and AT. However, no significant correlation
    was found between water surface and precipitation, indicating that temperature
    plays a dominant role in controlling water surface in the LUB. Discussion This
    study was applied an integrated approach of remote sensing and GEE for monitoring
    the effects of climate change on water resources. The LUB was selected as the
    case study area, which has experienced significant changes in water resources
    in the last decades. The results of this study provide valuable insights into
    the impact of climate change on water resources in the LUB from 1984 to 2021.
    This study reveals a statistically significant change in the water surface area
    over the past two decades. This suggests that there has been a notable alteration
    in the extent of water bodies in the LUB during this period like previous studies23.
    AT and ETa in the LUB have shown significant increases from 2000 to 2021 aligns
    with the findings of numerous studies on climate change and land use patterns73,74.
    These increases in AT and ETa are indicative of warming in the region, which is
    a common consequence of climate change. In contrast to the rising AT and ETa,
    the study observes a decline in annual total precipitation in the LUB during the
    period from 2000 to 2021. The reduction in precipitation observed over the study
    area, as indicated by previous studies73,75, is consistent with broader climate
    change projections and observations in many regions globally. This suggests that
    the region has been experiencing reduced rainfall or other changes in precipitation
    patterns. The research indicates negative correlations between water surface and
    AT and ETa. This means that as AT and ETa increase, there is a tendency for the
    water surface area to decrease. This relationship aligns with the expectation
    that warmer temperatures can lead to evaporation and reduced water availability.
    Conversely, there are positive correlations between water surface and total precipitation.
    This implies that when there is more precipitation, there tends to be a larger
    water surface area. This relationship underscores the importance of precipitation
    in maintaining water resources. In summary, the research findings suggest that
    climate change has led to increase AT and ETa and reduce annual total precipitation
    in the LUB from 2000 to 2021. These changes have had a noticeable impact on water
    resources, as evidenced by the negative correlation between AT, ETa and water
    surface area. This study also was employed a data-driven approach by utilizing
    the automatic product called JRC-Global surface water mapping layers V1.4 on the
    GEE platform for monitoring water surface area changes. Previous studies (e.g.,48,72)
    have relied on traditional or semi-automatic methods, which typically provide
    an accuracy of around 500 m. However, in the current study, a more accurate approach
    was employed. This approach offers a significantly improved accuracy of 30 m,
    allowing for more precise monitoring and mapping of all water bodies, including
    seasonal and small rivers. By leveraging this higher accuracy, the study was able
    to reveal important findings. The JRC Global Surface Water Mapping Layers, version
    1.4, provides valuable data on the extent and changes of water surfaces. In contrast
    to GLAD, GSWD, and DSWE, this dataset offers comprehensive statistics regarding
    various aspects of water bodies, including seasonal fluctuations, temporal alterations,
    monthly variations, and details on permanent reservoirs. Each of these datasets
    has its unique characteristics and time coverage, but the JRC Global Surface Water
    Mapping Layers, v1.4, is particularly noteworthy for its comprehensive insights
    and up-to-date information on water surfaces. The results of the study indicated
    that over the past 4 decades, only approximately 40% of the water bodies in the
    LUB remained permanent. This suggests a loss of around 30% of the permanent water
    resources, which have transitioned into seasonal water bodies, accounting for
    nearly 13% of the total. These findings highlight the significant changes that
    have occurred in the water resources of the basin and emphasize the importance
    of accurate and detailed monitoring methods in assessing and understanding such
    changes. Water scarcity in the LUB causes several ecological problems. Different
    studies have proven that the shrinking the lake resulted in a 90% decline in the
    Artemia population76. Moreover, the salinity has dramatically increased in recent
    years, reaching a point where the lake water is saturated with salts and salt
    crystals form on the lake surface throughout the year. This has also led to the
    conversion of surrounding land into salt marshes. A recent study by Sima et al.77
    reported that the flamingo population in the lake has decreased to almost zero.
    The loss of water resources in the LUB has resulted in a general decrease in vegetation,
    leading to a dramatic increase in the frequency and intensity of dust storms in
    the region. Dust storms have a detrimental impact on over 7 million residents
    in the region, causing various challenges related to health, socioeconomic conditions,
    soil fertility in agriculture, and vegetation weakening. These issues present
    significant concerns that need to be addressed to safeguard the well-being of
    the affected population and maintain the ecological balance of the region. Furthermore,
    frequent decreases in the volume of water resources would affect food security
    in the study area. It is because agriculture over the LUB is the main source of
    food, and water scarcity would pose a significant threat to this sector78. In
    summary, as the consequence of climate change intensify and the water crisis in
    the basin worsens, the region may face a significant challenge in terms of migration
    from rural areas to suburban areas of metropolitan cities. This migration crisis,
    along with its accompanying socio-economic costs, will pose a major obstacle to
    regional development. Limitation of the study and future perspective The main
    limitation of this study is related to the temporal variation of the JRC Global
    Surface Water Mapping Layers, v1.4 product. Since there is no information related
    to water surface storage for each year separately, having information for each
    year separately that shows all various aspects of water surfaces, including seasonal,
    temporal, monthly, and permanent reservoir information, is of great importance.
    This provides valuable information for monitoring changes in water patterns. Conclusion
    The application of remote sensing in studying the impacts of climate change on
    water scarcity necessitates effective, efficient, and cost-effective technologies
    capable of analyzing large datasets. Therefore, this study was initiated to map
    various influential climatic variables and determine the impacts of climate change
    on water resources. The findings of this study indicate correlation coefficients
    of − 0.55, − 0.59, and 0.39 between water area and AT, ETa, and precipitation,
    respectively. According to the results, climate change has affected water resources
    from 1984 to 2021 in the LUB. The results also demonstrate that a permanent water
    area of 12.78% was lost from 1984 to 2021 in the LUB. Additionally, 2.74% has
    identified as seasonal water resources. While 3.98% of the LUB has experienced
    a decline in seasonal water resources, an additional 4.12% has newly added as
    seasonal water resources. A general monitoring framework was applied to analyze
    climate feature changes across extensive regions at different temporal scales.
    The study further reveals that online-based approaches, such as GEE combined with
    remote sensing datasets, are valuable for monitoring climate change impacts, particularly
    in semi-arid and arid regions, to simulate dynamic climate changes. In summary,
    the results of this study hold great significance for water management planners
    and managers and contribute significantly to the advancement of GIS science through
    the application and identification of effective techniques for mapping climate
    change effects on water resources. Data availability The datasets used and/or

  description: The Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) data set has faced a decline in
    the number of active gauges since the 1980s, leaving only 14% of gauges active

    Article Open access 02 January 2024 Background & Summary The global river network
    covers less than 1% of the Earth’s non-glacial surface and contains less than
    0.01% of the Earth’s freshwater1, yet river water plays a multifaceted role in
    human well-being and natural processes as one of the most accessible sources of
    freshwater2. River discharge, which is the water volume passing a cross-section
    of the river at a given time, has been measured through gauge stations for more
    than a century3. Discharge measurements of global river gauges form the backbone
    of hydrologic science and a baseline for water resource management4. The Global
    Runoff Data Center (GRDC) collects and provides quality-controlled discharge observations
    worldwide through https://www.bafg.de/GRDC, that are extensively utilized by the
    scientific community to investigate the intricate interactions between the water
    cycle, climate, and ecosystems. However, over the last decades, the number of
    active gauges in the GRDC has decreased, resulting in a situation where most of
    the river basins are either poorly gauged, ungauged or have gauges that do not
    follow an open-data policy. Moreover, observations from publicly available gauges
    often come with a delay in accessibility. Consequently, out of the 6015 GRDC stations
    with an average monthly discharge greater than 10 m3/s, only 2217 stations have
    up-to-date measurement records after 2015. The map in Fig. 1 illustrates that
    a significant number of the stations providing up-to-date discharge records are
    concentrated in North America and Western Europe. Moreover, it is of great concern
    that several stations in crucial river basins in Africa and Asia have stopped
    providing discharge data in recent years. The number of active and up-to-date
    GRDC stations has continued to decrease after 2015. This becomes evident from
    Fig. 2, which clearly shows that only about 1000 GRDC stations have provided discharge
    records for the year 2022. Therefore, our understanding of the amount of water
    flowing through the world’s rivers is inaccurate, inhibiting a clear insight into
    the global spatial and temporal dynamics of river water. Fig. 1 Location of the
    GRDC stations with a mean discharge larger than 10 m3/s. The GRDC stations that
    are active in 2015 are presented in black, the inactive stations are in grey.

    Remote sensing (RS)-based discharge estimates can address the lack of a global
    discharge record. A promising approach is to develop empirical models, such as
    rating curves which establish a relationship between the ground-based river discharge
    and space-based measurements of a hydraulic parameter like river water level5,6,7,8,9
    or river width10,11,11 or even a non-hydraulic quantity such as the ratio of surface
    reflectance between water and land pixels12,13. Once the model is developed, discharge
    can be estimated through remote sensing observations alone. Therefore the rating
    curve technique serves as a suitable method for extending or filling the gap in
    discharge records. With such a philosophy, numerous studies have aimed to expand
    the discharge estimation to a global scale. For example, Lin et al.14 estimate
    discharge for more than 3000 river reaches globally using the Bayesian at-many-stations
    hydraulic geometry (AMHG)-Manning (BAM)15 algorithm and the geomorphologically-enhanced
    variant (geoBAM)16. Riggs et al.17 developed a Google Earth Engine application
    and estimate river discharge for 28409 river reaches in North America by developing
    rating curves between Landsat-based river width and modeled discharge time series
    from Global Reach–Level A Priori Discharge Estimates for SWOT (GRADES)18. Riggs
    et al.19 developed river width-discharge rating curve models using Landsat-based
    river width and gauge discharge from various data centers. Using the developed
    model, they can extend (or fill) the river discharge time series of 2168 gauge
    stations (423 stations from GRDC data set). These attempts make it clear that
    a RS-based discharge data set exclusively developed for the GRDC stations is lacking.
    In this study, we present the RS-based Extension for the GRDC (RSEG) data set20,
    delivering monthly discharge estimates accompanied by associated uncertainty.
    It should be noted that in the context of this paper, when we use the term “extend”
    we are referring to the process of utilizing Remote Sensing observations to reconstruct
    or estimate the river discharge at GRDC stations. This extension should not be
    confused with a claim of achieving an equivalence in quality or accuracy with
    gauge records. Relying on high-quality RS-based input data, the RSEG data set
    aims to overcome existing limitations identified in previous studies, thus contributing
    to the advancement of knowledge in this field by: Preserving stations with legacy
    discharge: by developing a discharge estimation algorithm that does not require
    concurrent measurements, we are able to successfully estimate discharge for stations
    with historical records predating the satellite era. Avoiding model dependence
    in favor of a data-driven approach: given the nonparametric nature of the employed
    discharge estimation algorithm, the empirical model’s form is solely determined
    by the observations themselves, allowing the data to directly inform and shape
    the model’s structure. Providing stochastic uncertainty of discharge estimates:
    the discharge estimation model incorporates stochastic uncertainty, which is quantified
    through the Monte Carlo estimations. This stochastic uncertainty represents the
    random error in the model estimates, resulting from both the remaining modeling
    error and the uncertainty associated with the input variables. Implementing several
    stages of supervised quality control: to ensure the accuracy of the final products,
    several quality control checks with and without human interactions were performed.
    This rigorous evaluation led to the exclusion of 1499 RS-based discharge time
    series from the RSEG data set, as shown in Fig. 3. Developing river width- or
    stage-discharge models and extending gauge records for 3377 GRDC stations which
    are significantly higher than the other studies. Fig. 3 Bar graphs showing discharge
    (in km3/month) accumulated over GRDC stations in five discharge classes. Note
    that in the first category, those stations with mean discharge smaller than 10 m3/s
    are excluded. The blue bars depict discharge estimates available in the RSEG data
    sets, the red bars represent discharges that were rejected during the quality
    control steps, and the brown bars indicate cases without suitable remote sensing
    observations. The numbers on top of the bars indicate the discharge volume in
    km3/month, while the numbers on the bar feet represent the amount of stations.
    Full size image In order to evaluate the performance of the data set, we validate
    the data against gauge discharge records over the GRDC stations where gauge- and
    RS-based discharge are available, which leads to the statistics listed in Table
    1. Table 1 Performance metrics of the RSEG data set. Full size table The performance
    metrics presented in Table 1 show that the quality of discharge estimates for
    larger rivers (mean monthly discharge greater than 1000 m3/s) is quite satisfactory,
    with the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) value higher than 0.5 and the relative Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 20%. Due to the limitation of RS techniques for
    obtaining accurate input data for the narrow river reaches, the performance metrics
    significantly dropped for the river reaches with less than 1000 m3/s) mean monthly
    discharge. Despite the less-than-ideal accuracy of data for narrower river reaches,
    RSEG data set holds promise for a variety of research purposes: RSEG discharge
    estimates can be served as prior data for SWOT discharge algorithms. Given that
    most of SWOT discharge algorithms operate within the Bayesian framework, having
    a well-informed prior estimate, coupled with comprehensive uncertainty assessments,
    is of utmost significance. By integrating RSEG data and their associated uncertainties,
    the accuracy of SWOT discharge estimation can be improved. RSEG discharge estimates
    can be integrated into hydrological models to mitigate model uncertainty, particularly
    in regions where gauge data is absent or where ground-based monitoring is inadequate
    or no longer available. The RSEG data set will be an invaluable resource for climate
    change and environmental studies due to its ability to track discharge over an
    extended period. Even when data quality falls short of optimal standards in narrower
    rivers, RSEG data records become indispensable tools for assessing long-term trends
    and understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources. Data and Method
    Data In-situ river discharge from GRDC data set The GRDC has the mandate by the
    World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to collect, manage and distribute long-term
    and high-quality observations of river discharge and water level. It has done
    so for more than 10000 gauge stations in over 160 countries during the last 100
    years. For developing the RS-based discharge estimation model, we only consider
    those GRDC stations with mean monthly discharge larger than 10 m3/s. Obtaining
    accurate RS-based river width or water level time series for the river reaches
    with mean monthly discharge less than 10 m3/s presents a significant challenge.
    These reaches are usually characterized by narrow widths or seasonal flow patterns.
    As a result, our analysis is limited to only 6015 GRDC stations with a mean monthly
    discharge larger than 10 m3/s. Although this limitation does reduce the number
    of gauge stations in the RSEG data set, the contribution of excluded stations
    to the global sum of mean monthly discharge is less than 0.5% (see Fig. 3). The
    map in Fig. 1 shows the location of the remaining GRDC stations that have been
    employed to develop the RS-based discharge models. Out of 6015 GRDC stations with
    a mean monthly discharge larger than 10 m3/s, only 2218 stations have updated
    discharge records after 2015. Note that more than 70% of these active stations
    are in North America or Western Europe. The GRDC discharge time series can be
    downloaded from https://portal.grdc.bafg.de. SWORD The SWOT a priori river database
    (SWORD)21,22 provides reach boundaries, high-resolution river centerlines, and
    also fixed node locations for river networks on a global scale. SWORD offers a
    consistent topological system for rivers wider than 30 m, along with various hydrological
    variables such as average surface water elevation, river reach width, and slope
    at the mean river flow. In this study, the river centerlines and river reach boundaries
    provided by SWORD are used as the base map. To simplify the terminology, we will
    henceforth refer to the SWORD river reach as simply river reach. River water height
    time series Over the past three decades, satellite altimetry has emerged as a
    valuable technique for monitoring inland water surfaces and studying the hydrological
    cycle23,24,25. The availability of satellite altimetry data sets has facilitated
    the development of numerous research initiatives and collaborations, leading to
    the establishment of valuable databases like Hydroweb26, HydroSat9 and Database
    for Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI)27. In this study, river
    water height time series data were collected from the HydroSat (http://hydrosat.gis.uni-stuttgart.de)
    and DAHITI (https://dahiti.dgfi.tum.de) databases. To this end, virtual stations
    (satellite altimetry crossing the river reach) either upstream or downstream of
    the GRDC stations were selected in both databases, resulting in 661 stations from
    DAHITI and 176 stations from HydroSat, with 65 stations from both. River width
    time series The Global Surface Water (GSW) data set (https://global-surface-water.appspot.com)
    is the main source for obtaining river width time series of the river reaches
    corresponding to the GRDC stations. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre
    (JRC) developed in the framework of the Copernicus Program a consistent monthly
    global surface water data set employing the entire archive of Landsat 5, 7, and
    8 imagery28. The monthly water history product of the GSW data set constitutes
    the entire history of spatial dynamics of global surface water from March 1984
    to December 2021 at monthly time steps and with 30 m spatial resolution28. Since
    the GSW data set is based on the Landsat mission image archive, the river extent
    estimates are subject to significant error mainly due to cloud contamination,
    sensor error, and failure in the Landsat 7 sensor after 2003. To obtain the high-quality
    river reach water extent time series, the algorithm introduced by Elmi & Tourian29
    has been applied to the GSW data set. The Elmi & Tourian algorithm aims to enhance
    the accuracy of river extent maps by rectifying contaminated pixels and reducing
    classification errors in the raw GSW data set. The algorithm tackles the problem
    by employing a Maximum A Posteriori estimation of a Markov Random Field model
    (MAP-MRF). This approach integrates both temporal and spatial constraints among
    pixel labels to achieve an enhanced delineation of river water extent30,31. The
    predominant Spearman correlation coefficients exceeding 0.75 between gauge discharge
    records and river width time series in their validation data set affirm the efficacy
    of the method for obtaining global-scale river width time series. To determine
    the effective river width for the reach, the time series of river reach water
    extent is divided by the length of the reach. Note that in the SWORD data set,
    the river reaches have a typical length between 10 and 15 km22. For simplicity
    we use the term river width or simply width instead of effective river width in
    the sequel. The river width time series used to develop RSEG data set are available
    through HydroSat data set (http://hydrosat.gis.uni-stuttgart.de). In order to
    identify the river reach that most accurately captures the dynamics of discharge,
    we develop width-discharge estimation models for four distinct reaches: the reach
    corresponding to the GRDC station, the upstream reach, the downstream reach, as
    well as the average of these three reaches. Method River discharge estimation
    technique Remote sensing of river discharge typically involves developing an empirical
    relationship between coincident measurements of gauge-based discharge and space-based
    river water level or width. Once established, the model enables the determination
    of discharge using only the space-based measurements and the model. Developing
    a single-stage rating curve between the ground- and space-based measurements is
    the most straightforward approach. However, this technique can only be used to
    extend the discharge records of stations where concurrent gauge- and space-based
    measurements are available. Also, using power-law equations to describe a river
    section assumes a regular geometry for the river section, which may lead to significant
    modeling errors. Additionally, rating curves provide imprecise estimates of discharge
    uncertainty due to mismodeling and coarse assumptions about input uncertainty.
    To address the limitations of parametric rating curves, Elmi et al.32 proposed
    a nonparametric approach, based on Monte Carlo simulation, for developing a mapping
    function that transforms remote sensing observations into discharge estimates.
    This method sets itself apart from conventional regression techniques by not requiring
    simultaneous gauge-based and space-based measurements. Instead, by assuming the
    river bathymetry remains constant if there is any temporal gap between gauge and
    remote sensing observations the algorithm makes use of quantile functions of the
    measurements, thus eliminating the need for simultaneity in both data sets. Furthermore,
    this method does not assume any specific mathematical form (like linear, power-law,
    etc.) for the height-discharge or width-discharge model, allowing for greater
    flexibility and accuracy in modeling the relationship between discharge and the
    predictor variable in different percentiles. The flowchart in Fig. 4 describes
    the procedure of their algorithm. To obtain the stochastic quantile mapping function,
    the algorithm performs the following steps: Generating large numbers of river
    discharge and river width or height time series realizations using Monte Carlo
    simulation. Deriving a collection of quantile mapping functions by matching all
    possible permutations of the quantile functions of both variables. Estimating
    the mean quantile mapping function together with the uncertainty for each percentile.
    Evaluating the performance of the derived model by comparing the estimated and
    measured discharge of the evaluation sample performing a 3σ test. If available,
    the evaluation sample consists of simultaneous gauge- and space measurements.
    Otherwise, measurements from both data sets within the same quantile are included
    in the evaluation sample. Updating the measurement uncertainties with respect
    to the result of the 3σ test. Terminating the algorithm if the root mean square
    error (RMSE) from the previous step does not change significantly otherwise, the
    algorithm returns to the first stage. Fig. 4 Flowchart of the stochastic quantile
    mapping function algorithm (adapted from Elmi et al.32). Full size image In the
    initial iteration, the algorithm takes into account a multiplicative uncertainty
    of 10% of the signal for the input time series. As the algorithm progresses, it
    refines its estimates by updating the measurement uncertainties at each iteration.
    This iterative process continues until a termination condition is met. Through
    the procedure, the algorithm generates a stack of quantile mapping functions by
    propagating the input measurements based on their respective uncertainties. The
    distortion observed in the collection of mapping functions illustrates the model’s
    accuracy in estimating discharge at various percentiles. The discharge estimation
    model uncertainties are later exploited to obtain the uncertainty of the RS-based
    discharge estimates. Once the model is developed, the discharge value, along with
    its associated uncertainty, can be estimated using solely the predictor variable.
    Algorithm implementation The procedure of developing river discharge estimation
    models begins with assessing the feasibility of employing remote sensing data
    to extend the GRDC records. The discharge estimation technique is not constrained
    to stations with simultaneous gauge- and space-based data. However, it requires
    an adequate number of measurements in both data sets to sufficiently represent
    the statistical distribution of the variable. Therefore, those GRDC stations with
    less than three years of discharge records or insufficient observations for the
    predictor variable (water height or river width) after 1970 are excluded from
    the analysis. Due to the constraints posed by the inter-track distance of satellite
    altimetry missions, it is unfeasible to obtain water level time series for all
    the GRDC stations. As a result, in this study, we only have altimetric time series
    for 766 out of 6015 GRDC stations. On the other hand, satellite imagery missions
    have global coverage, so theoretically, river width time series for any reach
    can be contained using satellite images. However, due to cloud contamination and
    also the complex shape of the reaches, a total of 4743 GRDC stations were identified
    where width measurements were available for a minimum of three years. Among these,
    639 GRDC stations have both river width and water height time series available.
    After preparing the input data sets, the river discharge algorithm is applied
    to develop the quantile mapping function for each GRDC station. Depending on the
    available remote sensing time series, the discharge estimation model can be developed
    using river width or water level time series, or both. After developing the models,
    the discharge records of each GRDC station are further extended by incorporating
    remote sensing data. Subsequently, a quality assessment procedure (Fig. 5) is
    implemented to ensure the reliability of the estimated discharge records. This
    step involves performing statistical tests and also visual inspection to identify
    and exclude discharge estimates with low quality or potential anomalies. The quality
    assessment starts with calculating KGE33 between the observed and estimated discharge
    values. KGE is a comprehensive statistical metric to assess the performance of
    hydrological models by considering correlation, bias, and variability in the simulated
    data compared to observed data. If we consider the mean flow as a benchmark predictor,
    then any model with a KGE value between −0.4 and 1 has an acceptable performance.
    The closer the KGE value is to 1, the better the model’s performance. A KGE value
    of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between estimated and observed discharge34.
    In order to ensure the quality of the final results, estimated discharges with
    a KGE value lower than −0.4 are removed. This assessment focuses solely on GRDC
    stations where both gauge-based and RS-based observations are available simultaneously.
    For GRDC stations that lack simultaneous gauge and space-based observations, we
    compare the behavior of the monthly mean of gauge and space-based discharge (obtained
    from two different time periods) by calculating the correlation coefficient values.
    Discharge estimates with a negative correlation coefficient are excluded to retain
    only high-quality RS-based discharge estimates. In the next step, to ensure the
    compatibility of the distribution of both estimated and measured discharge values,
    we perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The null hypothesis of this test is
    whether both estimated and measured discharge represent the same statistical distribution
    with a 5% significant level. Finally, we perform a visual inspection to identify
    any possible anomalies, and issues that might not be apparent through quantitative
    methods. In the visual inspection procedure, we consider several key aspects to
    keep the estimated discharge in the data set; unusual long-term patterns (e.g.
    trend or cyclical behavior), any notable variations or anomalies (sudden spikes,
    drops, or erratic fluctuations), the existence of outliers or unusual extreme
    values. In case of possible non-stationarity of estimated and measured discharge,
    the station would probably fail the KS test. However, If non-stationarity only
    appears in the form of a trend, it may pass the KS test but would be detected
    and removed during the visual inspection. Fig. 5 Flowchart of the quality assessment
    procedure for the remote sensing-based discharge estimates. KGE values are calculated
    for simultaneous time series of GRDC and remote sensing-based discharge, while
    the correlation coefficient is calculated for mean monthly values of nonsimultaneous
    time series of gauge and remote sensing-based discharge. Full size image In the
    case of width-based discharge, usually, multiple solutions are available since
    discharge estimation models are developed for upstream and downstream reaches,
    as well as the average of three reaches. During the quality control steps, only
    one set of discharge estimates with the best performance remains in the data set.
    In the case of the availability of height-based discharge estimates obtained from
    the DAHITI and HydroSat altimetric time series, we choose the one with a better
    performance in the quality assessment procedure. Through the quality assessment
    procedure, discharge estimates based on remote sensing approaches for 1499 GRDC
    stations were rejected and subsequently removed from the data set. As illustrated
    in Fig. 3, over 95% of the rejected discharge values belong to GRDC stations with
    a mean discharge of less than 1000 m3/s. This highlights the inherent challenge
    in accurately estimating discharge using space-based methods, particularly for
    narrower rivers. In contrast, the performance of RS-based approaches in estimating
    discharge for GRDC stations with a mean discharge exceeding 1000 m3/s is remarkably
    reliable. Out of the 426 GRDC stations, with an average monthly discharge ranging
    from 1000 to 10000 m3/s, only 19 stations lacked sufficient satellite observations,
    and the RS-based discharge estimates for 69 stations are rejected through the
    quality assessment procedure. Consequently, for 338 GRDC stations, the RS-based
    discharge estimates are accepted and included in the RSEG data set. The significance
    of RS-based estimates becomes even more pronounced for GRDC stations with an average
    monthly discharge greater than 10000 m3/s, with 57 out of 64 stations having available
    RS-based discharge estimates. Notably, approximately 80% of the global river flow,
    equivalent to 7490 km3/month, is represented by the GRDC stations with a mean
    discharge of each exceeding 1000 m3/s. About 88% of this water volume (equivalent
    to 6592 km3/month) is quantified through RS-based discharge estimates within our
    RSEG data set. Figure 6 provides several examples of GRDC discharge time series
    that have been extended through remote sensing observations. In these examples,
    the gauge stations have stopped delivering discharge records. However, we extend
    the discharge time series by merging the RS-based discharge estimates. Since satellite
    images provide global coverage, river width-based discharge estimates are available
    for most of these examples. As mentioned, for 639 GRDC stations, both height-based
    and width-based discharge estimates are available. When both estimates are concurrently
    available at a given time, we prioritize the height-based discharge in the final
    solution, since the discharge estimates obtained through water height measurements
    are generally more accurate than those derived from river width. Fig. 6 Examples
    from the RSEG data set showing width-based and/or height-based discharge time
    series. All values are provided with an error bar. Full size image Time series
    like Fig. 6(b,g,m,h) are some examples of stations where both river width- and
    height-based discharge estimates are available. In addition to extending the gauge
    discharge records, RS-based discharge estimates can fill gaps in gauge records,
    as shown in the time series in Fig. 6(a,c,f). Furthermore, RSEG data set provides
    discharge estimates for periods prior to the establishment of gauges, as demonstrated
    in Fig. 6(d,c). In addition, each time series is associated with a measure of
    uncertainty (shown as an error bar in Fig. 6), which includes both the remaining
    modeling error and the uncertainty associated with the input variables. Figure
    7(a) shows the ratio of uncertainty to discharge plotted against corresponding
    discharge values at different discharge percentiles for the entire RSEG data set.
    So for each station within the RSEG data set, we determine the percentile of each
    discharge value through the empirical distribution of discharge time series specific
    to that station and calculate the ratio of uncertainty to discharge. Putting all
    these ratios for all stations (within RSEG data set) in one graph represented
    against the corresponding discharge percentile leads to Fig. 7(a), where the density
    of points is represented with a gray color. This visual depiction enables us to
    analyze and interpret the estimated uncertainty associated with different discharge
    percentiles. Our uncertainty estimate for lower discharge percentiles exhibits
    substantial variability between 0% to more than 20% of discharge values, with
    a median (the 50% percentile of the cases) value larger than 6%. Such a relatively
    large value (compared to discharge percentile between 20% and 50%) results primarily
    from increased uncertainty in the input data for lower flow situations where river
    channels tend to be narrower, where quantifying width or height from satellite
    imagery or altimeters becomes a difficult task. After the second discharge percentile,
    the ratio of uncertainty to discharge undergoes a reduction, consistently remaining
    within the range of 3–6% until reaching the 70th percentile. Subsequently, the
    ratio significantly increases and reaches 8% at the 90th percentile. This increment
    in the higher discharge percentiles can be attributed to the unavailability of
    sufficient river width measurements during high discharge events, mainly due to
    cloud contamination. In general, our uncertainty estimates are below the multiplicative
    uncertainty of 10% generally accepted in the scientific community. This analysis
    shows that the discharge uncertainty is not strictly multiplicative and also,
    the conventional 10% rule is so conservative. Fig. 7 (a) Entire RSEG data set:
    Ratio of uncertainty to discharge across different discharge percentiles. The
    contour lines indicate the percentile of the ratio within each discharge percentile.
    The thick contour line represents the median of the ratio across each discharge
    percentile. (b) Validation set: histogram of estimated discharge uncertainty (σ)
    versus error (error = estimated discharge minus ground truth) for individual measurements
    across all stations in the validation set. To provide a better representation
    of data, the logarithm of both uncertainty and error are presented. Full size
    image Data Records The Remote Sensing-based Extension for the GRDC (RSEG) data
    set20 is freely available in the form of a NetCDF file on DaRUS, the Data Repository
    of the University of Stuttgart (https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3558). The data
    sets are available under the Creative Commons License: CC BY 4.0. Moreover, the
    discharge time series are also available on http://hydrosat.gis.uni-stuttgart.de.
    The initial release of the RSEG data set comprises a total of 3377 discharge stations.
    Each station entry includes essential information such as the corresponding GRDC
    number and geographic coordinates. Furthermore, the climate classification, based
    on the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification system, is provided for each station,
    offering valuable insights into the prevailing climatic conditions. Additionally,
    the data set incorporates the Pfafstetter code, a unique five-digit identifier
    derived from the HydroBasins data set35, associated with each station. For a comprehensive
    analysis, the RSEG data set presents the discharge time series for each station,
    in units of m3/s, along with corresponding error estimates. The discharges are
    marked by three distinct flags, facilitating data interpretation: 0) In-situ discharge
    measurements, representing direct on-site measurements; 1) Remote sensing discharge
    estimates based on river height (water height time series obtained from DAHITI);
    2) Remote sensing discharge estimates based on river height (water height time
    series obtained from HydroSat) and 3) Remote sensing discharge estimates based
    on river width (initial river mask time series obtained from JRC Global Surface
    Water, further enhanced by applying the Elmi & Tourian algorithm29). These flags
    enable researchers to discern the data’s origin and methodology. Moreover, each
    station has a quality flag representing the performance of the RS-based estimated
    discharge in the quality control procedure. If simultaneous gauge- and RS-based
    discharge data are available, the quality flag is marked as ‘good’ when the KGE
    value exceeds 0. If simultaneous data are unavailable, the quality flag will be
    marked as ‘good’ when the mean monthly correlation surpasses 0.5. The RSEG data
    set spans an extensive temporal range, with the earliest available in-situ measurement
    dating back to January 1806. The inclusion of remote-sensing data extends the
    record up to the end of 2022, offering an extensive data set for comprehensive
    hydrological investigations. Technical Validation For stations where estimated
    discharge and measured discharge are available simultaneously, it is possible
    to validate the results. However, such a simultaneous period should be long enough
    to yield reliable statistics. Therefore, we select those stations with at least
    2 years of concurrent data, resulting in a set of 2168 stations with width-based
    discharge and a set of 219 stations with height-based discharge for validation.
    Figure 8 shows the KGE value of these stations together with their corresponding
    average monthly discharge for different climate classes. Moreover, Fig. 8 depicts
    Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots, which effectively illustrate the
    distribution patterns of KGE, correlations, and relative RMSE across the validation
    sets. These plots serve to quantify the proportion of stations that exceed specific
    threshold values for each metric, providing insights into the performance characteristics.
    In general, about 80% of stations show a positive KGE (Fig. 8(b)), indicating
    that their estimated discharge is much better than the long-term mean. A comparative
    analysis between height-based and width-based approaches in Fig. 8 reveals that
    height-based discharge estimates, primarily associated with equatorial regions,
    outperform width-based ones. Fig. 8 The map shows the location of the gauge stations
    used in the validation. (a) average monthly discharge vs. the Kling-Gupta Efficiency
    (KGE) between discharge records obtained from gauges and remote sensing data.
    (b–d) cumulative probability of three statistical metrics (KGE, correlation, RMSE)
    for the validation data set. The black lines in CDF plots are the validation for
    all gauges. Note that CDF plots are not represented for stations in the polar
    climate region due to the limited data set size. Full size image Upon observing
    the khaki and coral results depicted in Fig. 8, it becomes apparent that the performance
    is comparatively inferior in arid and tropical climates compared with other climate
    classes. This can also be seen in Fig. 8(d), as about 35% of the stations show
    a relative RMSE larger than 30%. Whereas, the average performance of all stations
    in the validation set shows that only about 20% have relative RMSE values larger
    than 30%. The inferior performance in the equatorial region can primarily be attributed
    to the limitations of optical satellite imagery, specifically related to cloud
    contamination within the images. Moreover, our analysis reveals that stations
    in cold climate regions perform marginally superior to stations in other climate
    classes (Fig. 8), in terms of KGE and correlation coefficients. This finding is
    particularly noteworthy due to the inherent difficulties associated with river
    width and height estimation in cold climate conditions, where rivers often experience
    freezing during the winter season and substantial fluctuations in river discharge
    occur during hot summers. The performance of the discharge estimation models depends
    significantly on the quality of input RS data. For larger river reaches, where
    we can obtain high-quality time series data for river width and height, the performance
    of the discharge estimation models is impressive, as indicated by a mean KGE value
    of 0.62 for stations with a mean monthly discharge exceeding 10000 m3/s. As shown
    in Table 1, a decrease in the mean monthly discharge is associated with a corresponding
    decrease in the performance of the discharge estimation models because obtaining
    high-quality time series data for river width and height in narrower river reaches
    is challenging. To evaluate the validity of the uncertainty estimates and their
    applicability to the associated errors, we examine the relationship between uncertainty
    and error for all estimated discharges, as depicted in Fig. 7(b). To provide an
    overall assessment for all stations, we plot the logarithm of both values. The
    diagonal line in the histogram represents discharge estimates for which the provided
    uncertainty aligns with the outcome error. Moreover, two lines are shown below
    and above the diagonal line, signifying instances where the error is three times
    larger or smaller than our estimated uncertainty, respectively. The majority of
    the discharge estimates (83%) lie above the lower line, indicating that their
    error can be represented by estimated uncertainty with a confidence level of 99%
    (corresponding to 3σ). Nevertheless, in numerous instances (22%), our uncertainty
    estimates tend to become overly conservative. This is evident as certain measurements
    align with the upper line, where the error is three times smaller than the corresponding
    uncertainty. The validation of our estimated discharge values and the associated
    uncertainty substantiates the adequacy of the RSEG data set in providing a fair
    estimate of discharge for 83% of worldwide river systems, as monitored by GRDC
    stations. The outcomes of our study will yield significant contributions to the
    understanding of Earth’s river networks as well as contributing to broader Earth
    system studies. Code availability The algorithm for developing the nonparametric
    quantile mapping function has been explained in detail in the original study32.

  description: As a result of climate change, the pan-Arctic region has seen greater
    temperature increases than other geographical regions on the Earth’s surface.
    This has led to substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystems and the hydrological
    cycle, which have affected the distribution of vegetation and the patterns of
    water flow and accumulation. Various remote sensing techniques, including optical
    and microwave satellite observations, are useful for monitoring these terrestrial
    water and vegetation dynamics. In the present study, satellite and reanalysis
    datasets were used to produce water and vegetation maps with a high temporal resolution
    (daily) and moderate spatial resolution (500 m) at a continental scale over Siberia
    in the period 2003–2017. The multiple data sources were integrated by pixel-based
    machine learning (random forest), which generated a normalized difference water
    index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and water fraction
    without any gaps, even for areas where optical data were missing (e.g., cloud
    cover). For the convenience of users handling the data, an aggregated product
    is provided, formatted using a 0.1° grid in latitude/longitude projection. When
    validated using the original optical images, the NDWI and NDVI images showed small
    systematic biases, with a root mean squared error of approximately 0.1 over the
    study area. The product was used for both time-series trend analysis of the indices
    from 2003 to 2017 and phenological feature extraction based on seasonal NDVI patterns.
    The former analysis was used to identify areas where the NDVI is decreasing and
    the NDWI is increasing, and hotspots where the NDWI at lakesides and coastal regions
    is decreasing. The latter analysis, which employed double-sigmoid fitting to assess
    changes in five phenological parameters (i.e., start and end of spring and fall,
    and peak NDVI values) at two larch forest sites, highlighted a tendency for recent
    lengthening of the growing period. Further applications, including model integration
    and contribution to land cover mapping, will be developed in the future. (Figure

    525 Accesses 2 Altmetric Metrics Abstract As a result of climate change, the pan-Arctic
    region has seen greater temperature increases than other geographical regions
    on the Earth’s surface. This has led to substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystems
    and the hydrological cycle, which have affected the distribution of vegetation
    and the patterns of water flow and accumulation. Various remote sensing techniques,
    including optical and microwave satellite observations, are useful for monitoring
    these terrestrial water and vegetation dynamics. In the present study, satellite
    and reanalysis datasets were used to produce water and vegetation maps with a
    high temporal resolution (daily) and moderate spatial resolution (500 m) at a
    continental scale over Siberia in the period 2003–2017. The multiple data sources
    were integrated by pixel-based machine learning (random forest), which generated
    a normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI), and water fraction without any gaps, even for areas where optical data
    were missing (e.g., cloud cover). For the convenience of users handling the data,
    an aggregated product is provided, formatted using a 0.1° grid in latitude/longitude
    projection. When validated using the original optical images, the NDWI and NDVI
    images showed small systematic biases, with a root mean squared error of approximately
    0.1 over the study area. The product was used for both time-series trend analysis
    of the indices from 2003 to 2017 and phenological feature extraction based on
    seasonal NDVI patterns. The former analysis was used to identify areas where the
    NDVI is decreasing and the NDWI is increasing, and hotspots where the NDWI at
    lakesides and coastal regions is decreasing. The latter analysis, which employed
    double-sigmoid fitting to assess changes in five phenological parameters (i.e.,
    start and end of spring and fall, and peak NDVI values) at two larch forest sites,
    highlighted a tendency for recent lengthening of the growing period. Further applications,
    including model integration and contribution to land cover mapping, will be developed
    in the future. 1 Introduction The pan-Arctic region, which includes Siberia, is
    known for its extremely cold climate. However, it has recently been experiencing
    a higher rate of temperature increase than other regions of the Earth’s surface,
    mainly as a result of global climate change (Hantemirov et al. 2022, Arctic Monitoring
    and Assessment Programme (AMAP) 2021). The higher temperatures increase the risk
    of climatic extremes and disasters, such as heatwave-induced wildfires (Witze
    2020), thawing permafrost that promotes the release of greenhouse emissions from
    these areas (Yokohata et al. 2020), and river ice jams and consequent flooding
    (Madaeni et al. 2020; Sakai et al. 2015). In order to evaluate the impact of climate
    change on the pan-Arctic region, detailed monitoring of specific environmental
    parameters is essential. This has been accomplished using remote sensing techniques.
    Water-related parameters (Suzuki and Matsuo 2019) such as total water storage,
    snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and surface water coverage (Velicogna
    et al. 2012; Suzuki et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2007; Bartsch et al. 2009; Watts
    et al. 2012; Mizuochi et al. 2021a) have been used to investigate local and global
    hydrological cycles. Another focus is vegetation parameters (Nagai et al. 2019)
    such as plant functional type (i.e., land cover) map, aboveground biomass, leaf
    area index, and growing season duration (Leroy et al. 2006; Myneni et al. 2001;
    Kushida et al. 2007; Buitenwerf et al. 2015), which are important for ecological
    monitoring and carbon cycle research. Water and vegetation parameters are closely
    interlinked via energy budgets and meteorological and ecological schemes in relation
    to evapotranspiration, albedo, vegetation growth, canopy interception of precipitation,
    and surface aerodynamic properties (e.g., Mizuochi et al. 2021b). Optical remote
    sensing has been traditionally used in such environmental studies to monitor changes
    in surface water and vegetation. Band indices, such as the (modified) normalized
    difference water index (NDWI: Xu 2006) and the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI: Hatfield et al. 1984; Perry and Lautenschlager 1984), are widely
    used to characterize spectral reflectance features and enhance the appearance
    of water and vegetation bodies in satellite imagery, respectively. Another promising
    approach is microwave remote sensing using either active radar or passive radiometers,
    which has the advantage of being less sensitive to cloud cover than optical sensors.
    Backscatter signals observed by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to
    extract open water and forest areas and to estimate surface soil moisture content
    (Twele et al. 2016; Zakharov et al. 2020; Reiche et al. 2018). Microwave radiometers
    also can estimate the surface water fraction, soil moisture content and vegetation
    optical depth (Fily et al. 2003; Owe et al. 2008; Moesinger et al. 2020). When
    using satellite data to retrieve physical parameters, the divergent characteristics
    of the data and the technical difficulty in data handling often result in trade-offs
    between the spatial and temporal resolutions of the resulting product. For example,
    previous broad-scale water maps (e.g., open water and wetland distribution, water
    fraction within pixels) have resolution ranging from tens to hundreds of meters
    (Lehner and Döll 2004; Fluet-Chouinard et al. et al. 2015; Yamazaki et al. 2015;
    Pekel et al. 2016). While they offer detailed spatial information, they often
    provide no temporal information, or if such information is provided, the time
    intervals are long. Conversely, maps with high temporal resolutions (i.e., daily
    to monthly) typically provide relatively coarse spatial information (e.g., several
    tens of kilometers) (Papa et al. 2010; Schroeder et al. 2015). To overcome such
    trade-offs, researchers have used multiple datasets in a synergistic manner (i.e.,
    data fusion; Belgiu and Stein 2019). There has been particular interest in combining
    image data obtained by optical and microwave sensors (Suzuki and Matsuo 2019;
    Beamish et al. 2020). This is because information that is missing from optical
    sensor observations due to cloud cover or insufficient solar illumination can
    be compensated for using data obtained by microwave sensors. Many applications
    of such data fusion approaches have been reported for wetland mapping (Chasmer
    et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021; Mizuochi et al. 2021a), snow and thawing detection
    (Armstrong and Brodzik 2001; Kim et al. 2012) and vegetation and ecosystem monitoring
    (Kimball et al. 2009; Mavrovic et al. 2023). These studies involved intercomparison
    of different data sources and/or complementary inputs for process-based models
    or machine learning (ML). However, there have been few studies on simultaneous
    mapping of areas of water and vegetation that are interlinked. In addition, the
    creation and handling of broad-scale datasets that combine both high temporal
    resolution (e.g., daily) and moderate spatial resolution (e.g., sub-kilometer
    scale) are challenging, although there has been one report on the creation of
    daily maps of soil moisture content with a spatial resolution of 1 km (Zhu et
    al. 2023). The goal of the present study was to produce simultaneous continental-scale
    inundation and vegetation maps for Siberia. By integrating optical and microwave
    satellite data with other ancillary data, maps were obtained with a daily temporal
    resolution and a moderate spatial resolution of 500 m. In this paper, the map
    generation process and the characteristics and utility of the created products
    are described in detail. It is expected that this data will provide fundamental
    information that can be used to analyze the impacts of climate change on the risk
    of disasters, and also to clarify changes in water and carbon cycles in the pan-Arctic
    region. As example applications, we performed a time-series analysis of the NDWI
    and NDVI on a continental scale and extracted phenological features at two experimental
    sites. 2 Methods 2.1 Target area and product specifications The target is a wide
    area of Siberia, approximately corresponding to 50–70° N and 31–180° E at maximum
    (Fig. 1). Considering potential applications (i.e., large-scale monitoring and
    model integration), computational resources and the spatial coverage of permafrost
    over Siberia (Shestakova et al. 2021), the specifications of our product are shown
    in Table 1. Fig. 1 MODIS tiles used in this study. The tiles (h20–h25, v02–v03)
    were superimposed on a sinusoidal map projection of the study area Full size image
    Table 1 Specifications of developed product Full size table To meet these requirements,
    we relied mainly on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    to identify vegetation and water distributions at optimal spatiotemporal resolutions.
    In this way, the spatiotemporal resolution of our target product is consistent
    with those of MODIS: the original spatial resolution was 500 m, and the temporal
    resolution was daily. The product duration (2003–2017) was determined after considering
    the temporal characteristics of all of the data sources (see Sect. 2.2.1). In
    polar regions in particular, commonly used geographic projections (i.e., latitude/longitude)
    exaggerate distances along the longitude direction, so distorting the shape of
    objects on the map and increasing pixel-based computational costs. Consequently,
    in the present study, data fusion processing was conducted using a MODIS sinusoidal
    projection (Fig. 1), which is originally provided at a resolution of 500 m. For
    convenience, an aggregated product using a latitude/longitude projection with
    a 0.1° grid resolution is also provided as a postprocessing output (see Sect.
    2.2.5). 2.2 Algorithm and data sources The basic algorithm used for map generation
    was previously developed by us for use in a limited study area (Mizuochi et al.
    2021a). In the ML-based algorithm used in this study, a pixel-based random forest
    (RF; Breiman 2001) approach is used to fill observation gaps in MODIS data (explained
    variable) by referring to other matching data sources (explanatory variable).
    Subsequently, bias correction is applied using a conditional generative adversarial
    network (pix2pix; Mirza and Osindero 2014; Isola et al. 2017). This study expands
    the previous study area to a pan-Arctic scale and includes an update to the NDVI
    map, the details of which are summarized in Table 1. To conserve computational
    resources, no pix2pix bias correction was used, as the procedure only improved
    the RMSE accuracy by ~ 1% (Mizuochi et al. 2021a). The overall procedure involves
    (1) data download, (2) preprocessing including extraction of feature variables,
    map translation and coregistration, (3) ML training and prediction, and (4) postprocessing
    including validation, visualization, creation of the water fraction maps, and
    product format conversion. Freely available optical and microwave satellite data,
    together with reanalysis data, were downloaded from the relevant websites (see
    the ‘Availability of data and materials’ section). Preprocessing and postprocessing
    treatments that include geospatial analysis were implemented mainly using GRASS
    GIS (ver. 7.8.2) and QGIS (3.10.4). ML processing was implemented using Python
    3.8.10 with PyCaret 2.3.10 for preliminary model selection and hyperparameter
    tuning, scikit-learn 1.2.1 was used for ML training and prediction, and ray 2.2.0
    was used for multiprocessing. Detailed explanations of each step are provided
    in the following subsections. 2.2.1 Data preparation The data sources and physical
    parameters were similar to those used by Mizuochi et al. (2021a); however, vegetation
    optical depth (VOD) data (Moesinger et al. 2020) were newly added since they may
    be useful for NDVI prediction. The data sources and retrieved physical parameters
    are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Data source and physical parameters for data
    fusion Full size table Surface reflectance data obtained by the MODIS instrument
    on the Aqua satellite (MYD09GA, collection 6.1) were used to calculate the NDWI
    and NDVI as follows: (1) (2) where G, R, NIR, SWIR are the green, red, near infrared,
    and short-wave infrared surface reflectance, which correspond to MODIS band 4
    (545–565 nm), band 1 (620–670 nm), band 2 (841–876 nm), and band 7 (2105–2155
    nm), respectively. Cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and cloud-adjacent pixels were screened
    out (i.e., treated as missing data to be filled by ML) by referring to accompanying
    quality assurance data (“state_1km” subset with bitmask that indicates cloud and
    snow states). Also, pixels recorded during shadow time in the high-latitude winter
    were also treated as missing data to be filled using ML. The quality controlled
    NDWI and NDVI were the explained variables to be predicted from the following
    low-resolution explanatory variables. Level-3 brightness temperature data, obtained
    by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) on the Aqua satellite
    and AMSR-2 on the Global Change Observation Mission-Water (GCOM-W) satellite,
    were used to calculate the polarization index (e.g., Moradizadeh and Srivastava
    2021; Sawada et al. 2017) and surface water fraction. These indices are sensitive
    to soil moisture and/or abundance of surface water. The calculation method employed
    for the indices was the same as that in Mizuochi et al. (2021a). In addition,
    the SWE product retrieved from the AMSR series was used to determine snow masks.
    To maintain consistency with the AMSR series (on the Aqua satellite or a satellite
    with a similar overpass time), the other MODIS product on the Terra satellite
    platform (MOD09GA) was not used. Sixteen meteorological parameters provided by
    ERA5-land (ECMWF 2023) along with the VOD product (Moesinger et al. 2020) estimated
    from multiple microwave satellite data sources (i.e., SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR2
    and WindSat), were also used. These were selected because they were likely to
    be sensitive to the water and vegetation conditions on the surface. In addition,
    day of year (DOY) information was used to represent the season. To ensure continuity
    between the end of one year and the beginning of the next, DOY was calculated
    in cosine and sine forms as follows: (3) In total, 23 low-resolution maps (derived
    from AMSR series, ERA5-Land, VOD and DOY) were assumed to be the common explanatory
    variables to predict the two explained variables (MODIS NDWI and NDVI), since
    the NDWI (water) and NDVI (vegetation) are likely to be closely interlinked. 2.2.2
    Preprocessing Preprocessing consisted of calculating the abovementioned variables,
    converting map projections, coregistering maps, and performing climatology calculations.
    All of the processes were managed on individual MODIS sinusoidal tiles, which
    encompassed 12 tiles in total (vertical tile numbers 02–03 and horizontal tile
    numbers 20–25). First, the MODIS HDF files were converted into raw binary images
    containing 2400 × 2400 pixels using a sinusoidal projection with the HDF-EOS-to-GeoTIFF-conversion
    tool (HDF-EOS Tools and Information Center 2023). Using GIS software, data from
    other data sources (i.e., explanatory variables) were processed to align them
    with the MODIS sinusoidal image. This involved resampling, cropping (i.e., cutting
    out the region of interest), and converting different data formats and on different
    projections into raw binary images with matching locations and dimensions (i.e.,
    coregistration). Importantly, the process employed nearest-neighbor resampling,
    which involves oversampling (i.e., dividing a coarse pixel into multiple pixels
    while retaining the same pixel value). This step was necessary as the other data
    sources have lower resolution than MODIS. After coregistration, daily climatology
    maps were prepared for the explanatory variables by averaging the maps for the
    same DOY over the period 2003–2017. These daily climatology maps were assumed
    to represent typical values of the variables on a given DOY and were used to fill
    any missing pixels in the explanatory maps for ML prediction (see Sect. 2.2.3).
    2.2.3 ML processing In our data fusion scheme, pixel-based ML was used to train
    matching pairs of explanatory and explained variables, allowing the prediction
    of explained maps without any gaps (Mizuochi et al. 2018; 2021a). Before initiating
    ML processing, a preliminary study was conducted to select the ML model and to
    tune the hyperparameters using a limited number of sampling pixels (100 pixels)
    from several tiles. In total, 25 ML algorithms (different types of regression
    models) were compared based on tenfold cross validation using PyCaret. RF was
    chosen as a robust regressor, with the following hyperparameters: maximum tree
    depth 5, minimum impurity decrease 0.005, minimum samples at leaf node 2, minimum
    samples for internal node splitting 7 and number of trees 60. Strictly speaking,
    the rank of the models fluctuated depending on the tile, the presence of absence
    of snow, the NDWI or NDVI (detailed below), and the referred accuracy criteria.
    However, ensemble models of decision trees (RF and extremely randomized trees)
    usually showed top scores. For simplicity, we decided to use RF for all the tiles,
    since it is widely used in remote sensing (Zhao et al. 2022) and is also consistent
    with our previous research (Mizuochi et al. 2021a). The spectral features of snow
    are characterized by a continuous decrease in reflectance from the visible to
    the infrared region (Petty 2006), a pattern that resembles that for water bodies
    in NDWI and NDVI maps. To consider the sensitivity of the snow pixels to the NDWI
    and NDVI, RF models with and without snow were created separately by checking
    if the SWE retrieved by AMSR-E/AMSR2 was positive or zero. Four original images
    taken in May, August, November, and February of a randomly picked year during
    the study period were selected for validation of each season. Each variable was
    then normalized by subtracting the spatiotemporal mean from the original values
    and dividing by the spatiotemporal standard deviation for the RF training. For
    each pixel, historical match-up pairs were searched during the period 2003–2017,
    where all the explained and explanatory variables existed altogether. In other
    words, one matching pair containing a full set of 23 explanatory and 2 explained
    variables was used as one training sample for each the pixel. SWE and ERA5-Land
    included permanently missing pixels for water and ocean masks. To avoid wasting
    information for the other variables and to make a wall-to-wall product, ML was
    performed on these pixels by filling zero for SWE and the spatially averaged values
    of climatology maps for ERA5-Land. After RF training, RF prediction was performed
    for each pixel: explanatory maps were again input to the trained RF model to predict
    the explained maps (i.e., MODIS NDWI and NDVI) without gaps. To this end, it was
    ensured that the explanatory maps at this stage had no missing values. Temporary
    gaps (much fewer than in the explained maps but still non-negligible) were filled
    by daily climatology maps. It should be noted that this treatment was applied
    only during the prediction process, not during the training process, to avoid
    overfitting to the average map. Ancillary flag maps indicating the absence/presence
    of this treatment (0: original explanatory variables, 1: explanatory variables
    filled by climatology data) and maps showing the presence of snow were also produced.
    Table 3 summarizes the tile-averaged rate of missing pixels filled by climatology
    data in each explanatory map, and the number of available explanatory variables.
    AMSR-related parameters (no. 3, 4) were approximately 60% available, and ERA-related
    parameters (no. 5 to 21) were 100% available, both of which were insensitive to
    the tile location. VOD (no. 22) was sensitive to the tile location, fluctuating
    in the range 66–90%. In all cases, 21–22 of a total of 23 parameters were available
    in the spatiotemporal average for all tiles. 18 parameters were obtained even
    in the worst case, which is understandable because ERA5-Land and DOY are at least
    available at any time. Therefore, if some variables were missed and filled by
    climatology data, the remaining variables are expected to offer realistic input
    data to some extent. Table 3 Rate of missing pixels in each explanatory variable
    (parameter numbers 3–22) and number of available explanatory variables Full size
    table 2.2.4 Postprocessing: creating water maps by NDWI thresholding Inundation
    pixels were extracted as physically intuitive information by thresholding the
    NDWI created by ML. Through visual interpretation of NDWI maps and high-resolution
    satellite imagery from Google Earth, ground references were established for three
    typical land cover categories (barren land, vegetation and water). Three hundred
    samples for each category were then used to produce category-dependent NDWI histograms
    (Fig. 2). A Gaussian distribution was fitted to each histogram, and the intersection
    between the Gaussian curve representing water and those representing the other
    categories was extracted as the tentative NDWI threshold for the data (i.e., the
    maximum likelihood approach). Fig. 2 Scheme of NDWI thresholding. (Top) Visual
    interpretation of three land cover categories (red: barren ground, green: vegetation,
    and blue: water); (bottom left) Summary table of extracted thresholds for different
    seasons; (bottom right) Example of maximum likelihood approach using data obtained
    in August 2017 Full size image The tentative thresholds between vegetation and
    water, derived from 12 (snow-free) monthly averaged maps for a particular tile
    (h24v02), showed a limited fluctuation range (Table 4). Consequently, the average
    value (NDWI =  − 0.043) with a standard error of 0.003 (N = 12) was assumed as
    the fixed threshold for all seasons. Utilizing this threshold, binary maps were
    generated to show 0 (non-water) and 1 (water). Table 4 Summary of estimated NDWI
    thresholds in different seasons Full size table To assess the uncertainty in the
    water map, a sensitivity analysis of the threshold setting was conducted. In the
    average map derived from the 12 monthly NDWI scenes, the threshold was slightly
    adjusted from the average value (NDWI =  − 0.043) within one standard deviation
    (0.012) using Gaussian noise. This process was repeated 12 times to calculate
    variations in the water fraction across the entire tile (h24v02). The mean water
    fraction and the standard error (N = 12) were 0.032 ± 0.001, corresponding to
    3% uncertainty in water fraction estimation. This study also considered fluctuating
    wetlands, i.e., areas where the extent of inundation changes seasonally, rather
    than permanent open water bodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers and reservoirs,
    which often attract special interest in estimating methane emissions, a key process
    affecting climate change (Zhang et al. 2021). Thus, the mode value for the summer
    season was subtracted from the original water maps to create what we refer to
    as “floating water maps”, which likely represent areas that are intermittently
    inundated, and which exclude permanent open water. 2.2.5 Postprocessing: creation
    of analysis-ready data (ARD) In addition to the raw binary maps based on MODIS
    tiles, which cover the wall-to-wall NDVI, NDWI, water, and quality flags at the
    original spatial resolution of 500 m, a merged product was also created using
    a commonly used latitude/longitude projection. The product was resampled using
    the nearest neighbor method and stored in GeoTiff format. To reduce the cost of
    data handling on a continental scale, the original resolution was aggregated into
    a 0.1° pixel spacing. Within these pixels, the average NDVI and NDWI values were
    stored, along with the fractional coverage of both permanent and intermittent
    wet areas. 2.3 Validation The ML result was validated for each tile over four
    seasons (Table 5), by comparing the generated MODIS NDVI and NDWI images with
    the original images that were not used in the ML training process (i.e., by employing
    a hold-out approach). Spatial patterns and statistical criteria were evaluated,
    with the latter including the mean error, root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation
    coefficient ®, slope and offset of the regression line between the original and
    created images. These values were summarized for each MODIS tile and image acquisition
    season. Table 5 Acquisition date of original MODIS images used for validation
    in each tile Full size table Spatiotemporal patterns were also checked for the
    0.1° ARD product. In addition to visualizing the NDVI and NDWI, spatially averaged
    time series and temporally averaged spatial patterns of the original and floating
    water maps were compared with a previous wetland map (WAD2M; Zhang et al. 2021).
    WAD2M primarily draws upon water fraction maps derived from multiple microwave
    satellite data sources (SWAMPS; Jensen and McDonald 2019), supplemented with ancillary
    satellite data and static maps for snow and permanent water masking, plus bias
    correction. The recent product, which emerged from the integration of multiple
    data sources through different schemes and at varying spatiotemporal resolutions
    (0.25°, monthly), seems useful for assessing the advantages and potential disadvantages
    of our product. The terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomaly is also useful for
    time-series comparisons with surface water (Suzuki et al. 2018). Gravity Recovery
    and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly water mass datasets were prepared (Swenson
    2012; Landerer and Swenson 2012), with contributions from the Center for Space
    Research (CSR), GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ), and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    (JPL), culminating in the calculation of the ensemble mean of the three datasets
    (Sakumura et al. 2014). In addition, as in Suzuki et al. (2018), reanalysis data
    from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) version 2 (Li et al. 2019) were
    also compared for the other TWS data source. The TWS includes snowpack, river
    runoff and groundwater and is not directly comparable to the NDWI and NDVI. However,
    it is helpful for interpreting time-series NDWI (and derived surface water area)
    data in relation to the water budget. 2.4 Application: trend analysis and phenological
    feature extraction The first application of the product developed in this study
    involved trend analysis at a continental scale. Time-series of snow-masked NDVI
    and NDWI maps were used to calculate the 15-year trend (i.e., Theil Sen’s regression
    slope) for each 0.1° pixel. The statistical significance of the trends was calculated
    using the Mann–Kendall test. The results were compared with previous reports for
    15-year trends in vegetation and water in polar regions. The second application
    involved the extraction of phenological features at two study sites covered by
    larch forest (Spasskaya Pad: 62°15′ 17’’N, 129°37′ 10’’E; Elgeeii: 60°01′ 01’’
    N, 133°49′ 53’’ E), utilizing the high observation frequency of our product (Fig.
    3); detailed descriptions of each study site can be found in Nagano et al. (2022).
    As a useful approach for phenological monitoring in terrestrial ecosystems, a
    moving average (window size = 5 days) of snow-masked NDVI time series data was
    fitted using a double sigmoid function (e.g., Ide and Oguma 2013; Myers et al.
    2019; Yan et al. 2019) as follows: (4) where NDVIb is the baseline value, NDVIa
    is the amplitude, Di is the day of year when the NDVI increases most rapidly,
    Dd is the day of year when the NDVI decreases most rapidly, and p and q determine
    the rate of increase and decrease of the NDVI, respectively. The initial parameter
    values were set to NDVIb = 0.4, NDVIa = 0.2, Di = 150, Dd = 250, and p = q = 0.001,
    based on a preliminary investigation of interannual phenology patterns over the
    sites. These parameters were then precisely fitted to the actual NDVI time-series
    data during the growing season (assumed to be from DOY = 100 to DOY = 280), employing
    the curve_fit function of the Python SciPy library. Fig. 3 Examples of double
    sigmoid fitting for seasonal NDVI. The NDVI with a 5-day moving average, sigmoid
    fitting and second derivative plots for sites at Spasskaya Pad (left) and Elgeeii
    (right) during 2017 are shown Full size image Then, local maximum and minimum
    values of the second derivative in the fitted function were identified, allowing
    for the determination of four commonly used phenological features (i.e., D1, D2,
    D3, and D4), which correspond to the start of spring (SOS), end of spring (EOS),
    start of fall (SOF), and end of fall (EOF), respectively. The date of the peak
    NDVI (D5) was also extracted, and the 15-year trends in these five parameters
    were investigated. A summary of the individual definitions of these phenological
    features is given in Table 6. Table 6 Definition of five phenological parameters
    Full size table 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Created data and validation Data
    fusion using RF produced wall-to-wall MODIS-like NDWI and NDVI maps for the period
    2003–2017 with enhanced the spatiotemporal extent compared to the existing data
    fusion product (Mizuochi et al. 2021a). Examples of comparisons between the original
    and newly created maps in a tile are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The examples show
    that the cloud gaps present in the original images were completely filled in the
    images created by RF regression, closely resembling the original spatial patterns
    and values of the NDWI and NDVI. The scatterplots show that images in the fall
    season deviated from the 1:1 (i.e., unity) lines, and that spatially discontinuous
    patterns were observed in the southwest area. Fig. 4 Comparison between original
    and created MODIS NDVI maps for tile h23v03. Spring image: 2007/05/03, summer
    image: 2003/08/01, fall image: 2015/11/21, winter image: 2010/02/26. Color scale
    of the scatterplot was configured by kernel density estimation (KDE) Full size
    image Fig. 5 Same as Fig. 4, but for MODIS NDWI Full size image The discrepancy
    in the scatterplot analysis was quantified by Theil-Sen’s regression slope for
    each tile and season (Table 7). While the regression slope was close to unity
    for both the NDWI and NDVI in summer, large deviations representing uncertainties
    in the values were observed in the seasons affected by snow or soil freezing.
    Since the RF models were trained separately for snow and no-snow pixels, the mixture
    of these pixels within a scene resulted in discontinuous spatial patterns and
    poor regression among multiple clusters in the scatterplots (Fig. 6, h22v03).
    The other reason for the poor regression may have been that the limited variable
    range of the NDWI and NDVI in the snow-covered winter season creates a featureless
    spectral pattern over the entire scene (Fig. 6, h23v02). Different tiles likely
    had different snow or soil freezing event distributions, resulting in varying
    accuracies among tiles (Table 7). Table 7 Accuracy of RF prediction averaged for
    each tile, for each season with standard deviation Full size table Fig. 6 Snow-affected
    images. Images showing regressions adversely affected by a mixture of snow and
    no-snow areas (h22v03), and areas with fewer spectral features due to snow cover
    (h23v02) Full size image Table 7 also shows the small mean error for all tiles
    (-0.01 ± 0.04 for NDWI, and 0.02 ± 0.02 for NDVI), indicating minimal biases in
    the reproduced images. The RMSE for all tiles was approximately 0.1 for both the
    NDWI and NDVI. Seasonal changes were clearly observed in the snow-masked NDWI
    and NDVI time-series data, averaged over the entire study region (Fig. 7A). The
    NDVI oscillated between being high in the growing season and low in the winter
    season, while the NDWI was high in the winter season and low in the growing season.
    A high local NDWI peak was observed in the spring season, possibly due to spring
    soil thawing and/or snow melting which rapidly supplied water to rivers and wetlands.
    Given the high ratio of null pixels in the winter season (~ 1.0), the low NDVI
    and the high NDWI observed at this time were attributed to the limited number
    of pixels affected by snow, even after the application of snow masking, which
    produced spectral patterns that differed from the original land cover. In addition,
    the low solar incidence angle in the winter season could reduce the signal-to-noise
    ratio for the measured radiance as well as the reliability of atmospheric correction
    for the optical data, potentially resulting in poor quality of the original MODIS
    products. As a result, studies on vegetation and surface water using our ARD product
    should focus on spring through fall, with special consideration given to snow
    masking. Fig. 7 Time series of 0.1° ARD product spatially averaged over the entire
    Siberian region. A Snow-masked NDVI and NDWI time-series with ratio of null cells
    averaged over entire study region. B Comparison between original (blue line) and
    floating (red line) water fraction extracted from our product, WAD2M wetland maps
    (Zhang et al. 2021), and time-series anomaly of terrestrial water storage (TWS)
    volumes (mm) from GRACE monthly water mass dataset (Swenson 2012; Landerer and
    Swenson 2012) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) version 2 (Li et
    al. 2019). For comparison with our floating water fraction, the minimum value
    of the WAD2M time-series data was subtracted from the original WAD2M to adjust
    the baseline to zero Full size image Gap-filling by the climatology maps (i.e.,
    an average value for the same date over 15 years) can potentially lead to bias
    in the prediction. This is particularly the case when predicting recent climatic
    extremes away from the 15-year average. In fact, slight differences in patterns
    around the beginning of 2012 were likely caused by a gap in the microwave data
    (AMSR-E terminated on 2011/10/03 and AMSR2 started on 2012/07/02), which was filled
    by the daily climatology maps for ML prediction. Time-series data for the original
    and floating water fraction (Fig. 7B) showed consistent seasonal variability,
    with high values recorded in the summer season (~ 0.07) and the spring local peak,
    and low values recorded in the winter season. The baseline for the original water
    fraction was adjusted to zero in the floating water fraction. Comparison with
    a previous wetland map (i.e., WAD2M; Zhang et al. 2021) showed similar seasonal
    changes during the spring to fall seasons, although large discrepancies were observed
    in the winter season. The water fraction obtained in the present study for the
    winter season was lower than that for WAD2M, in both the original and floating
    cases. This difference was likely due to differences in the definitions used for
    snow masking. Specifically, our product strictly masked pixels where the microwave
    SWE was positive. This screened almost all of the pixels in the winter season
    and resulted in the water fraction being nearly zero. Conversely, the water fraction
    data from SWAMPS version 3.2 (Jensen and McDonald 2019), mainly used in WAD2M,
    applied a more relaxed approach to snow masking, which resulted in a substantial
    water fraction even in the winter season. In the spring to fall seasons, the original
    WAD2M values were close to the lower limit of our original water fraction. In
    contrast, those for the offset-corrected WAD2M (adjusted to make the minimum values
    zero) were close to the upper limit of our floating water fraction. The WAD2M
    did not sense the strong peaks in the water fraction associated with soil thawing
    or snow melting in spring, probably due to its lower observation frequency (monthly)
    and coarser spatial resolution (0.25°) compared to our product (daily, 0.1° in
    the ARD product and 500 m in the original product). Furthermore, differences in
    the variable range of the water fraction between the ARD product and WAD2M also
    seemed to be linked to differences in their data sources. Unlike WAD2M, our optical
    sensor-based output observes the tree canopy in densely vegetated areas, but cannot
    explicitly delineate inundation under the vegetation. However, our product does
    implicitly utilize sources such as microwave data (i.e., AMSR series) and other
    data sources (i.e., ERA5-Land, VOD, DOY) that may be sensitive to inundation under
    the vegetation to some extent. The interpretations above are also supported by
    TWS from GRACE and GLDAS, both of which account for snowpacks and show large values
    in winter. Snowmelt from snowpacks increases river runoff in the spring (Suzuki
    et al. 2018), which is consistent with the peak observed in our water fraction
    data. The lowest TWS during the summer–fall period also likely reflected our water
    fraction, as seen in the local minimum in the summer season. Figure 8 shows temporally
    averaged NDWI and NDVI maps, which are useful for visualizing the overall distribution
    of surface water and vegetation (Fig. 8A, B). The original water fraction map
    largely contained permanent water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and coastal areas
    (Fig. 8C), which were mostly excluded in the floating water fraction map (Fig.
    8D). The difference between the original and floating water maps exposes the intermittent
    wetlands. Comparisons with WAD2M showed a substantial underestimation of the water
    fraction on the west Siberian plain (Fig. 9E, F). High-resolution satellite images
    (Google Earth) confirmed the existence of abundant small-scale wetlands, which
    may not be detected by our moderate-resolution product (i.e., 500 m). Different
    effects of topography and vegetation cover on optical and microwave data may also
    cause discrepancies between WAD2M and our product. However, apart from this area,
    the exclusion of permanent water bodies from the original water map improved the
    consistency of the water fraction data between our product and WAD2M (Fig. 8F).

    8 Full size image 3.2 Application: trend analysis and phenological feature extraction
    Our wall-to-wall products enable us to perform time-series trend analyses for
    vegetation and surface water (Fig. 9). Specifically, the NDVI slope map showed
    an overall decreasing trend especially in the southwest area, with sporadic hotspots
    in western to central Siberian wetlands and water bodies such as Lake Baikal.
    Several studies have reported an overall greening trend (i.e., increasing NDVI)
    in the Arctic region in recent decades, which they have attributed to increased
    temperatures and a longer growing season (May et al. 2020). However, there have
    been also reports of browning (i.e., decreasing NDVI) (Myers-Smith et al. 2020),
    with the distribution varying depending on the data sources and methodologies
    used. The browning patterns (i.e., negative NDVI values) shown in Fig. 9 are closely
    aligned with the spatial distribution of the annual maximum NDVI trend (Fig. 1
    in Myers-Smith et al. 2020) based on the GIMMS3g AVHRR dataset (2000–2015) (Tucker
    et al. 2005; Pinzon and Tucker 2014), which supports the validity of our NDVI
    product. Extensive greening is expected over the northernmost Arctic Tundra region,
    but this could not be investigated as this region is not covered by our product.
    Consequently, expanding the map coverage area will be undertaken in future research.
    Expanding the study duration with similar data sources with a longer period is
    also important future work to monitor recent climate extremes after 2017 and to
    track the historical record before 2003. The NDWI slope map showed an overall
    increasing trend across the study area. Given that the NDWI and NDVI are based
    on the inverse differences between visible and infrared reflectance, their overall
    contrasting spatial trends are expected. Exceptions were found in small hotspots
    around Lake Baikal, the lake around the Zeya Nature Reserve, and coastal areas
    facing the Sea of Okhotsk, where decreasing trends were observed even in NDWI
    slope maps. These hotspots were also observed in the water fraction map for WAD2M,
    although WAD2M showed an overall decreasing trend across the study area. Rather,
    our results were more consistent with previous findings of significant increasing
    trends in the water fraction from 2003 to 2010 (Watts et al. 2012). The dense
    time series (i.e., daily) nature of our product is well suited to extracting phenological
    parameters in the spring and the fall seasons through double-sigmoid fitting (Tables
    8 and 9, Fig. 10). In both Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii, D1 showed a negative trend
    (i.e., SOS occurring earlier), whereas D3 and D4 showed positive trends (i.e.,
    SOF and EOF occurring later), although only the D3 in Spasskaya Pad was statistically
    significant. Therefore, the duration of the growing season at the two larch forest
    sites increased from 2003 to 2017. Table 8 Phenological parameters estimated by
    double sigmoid fitting of NDVI over Spasskaya Pad Full size table Table 9 Phenological

    Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii experimental sites. The parameters are described in
    Table 6. The black dashed line indicates the zero reference line Full size image
    Nagai et al. (2020) determined the start of the growing season (SGS) and the end
    of the growing season (EGS) for the Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii sites, based on
    in-situ observations and a degree-day model. Although the parameters that they
    used differed from those used in this study, the SGS was significantly correlated
    with our D1 (SOS) (r = 0.55 with p < 0.05 for Spasskaya Pad; r = 0.93 with p < 0.01
    for Elgeeii). These findings show that our SOS extraction is potentially well
    suited for use as a proxy for SGS. Conversely, unlike SGS, EGS showed a weaker
    correlation with our D4 (EOF) (r = 0.34 with p = 0.21 for Spasskaya Pad; r = 0.54
    with p = 0.17 for Elgeeii). The D1 time series data for Spasskaya Pad seem to
    have changed at around 2005–2007, with the SOS occurring earlier thereafter (Fig.
    10). This change was likely associated with waterlogging events and changes in
    the composition of the understory/overstory vegetation from 2005 to 2008 at the
    site (Kotani et al. 2014; 2019; Ohta et al. 2014; Nagano et al. 2022). The DOY
    of the Peak NDVI (D5) showed larger interannual variability than the other parameters,
    and the temporal changes in D5 were similar between Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii.
    Similarly, D1 and D2 showed time-series similarity between Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii,
    suggesting that these parameters were sensitive to large-scale meteorological
    factors such as temperature. Nagano et al. (2022) also observed a strong correlation
    between temperature anomalies and precipitation between Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii,
    supporting the importance of temperature as a large-scale phenological driver.
    Nagai et al. (2020) also stressed the complexity of the sensitivity of leaf senescence
    to air temperature, noting that various internal (hormones and timing of spring
    budburst) and external (precipitation, photoperiod, drought, and heat stress)
    factors need to be considered in order to better understand leaf senescence, as
    doing so will improve predictions of the EOF and/or EGS. In this study, our original
    and ARD products are considered to be valuable for monitoring water and vegetation
    distributions, and for performing trend analysis and phenological research. Further
    potential applications may include contributions to land surface modeling (Guimberteau
    et al. 2018) as input and/or reference data. In addition, enhancing time-series
    land cover maps (Brown et al. 2022) to explicitly quantify temporal changes in
    vegetation and water distributions could also be undertaken in the future. 4 Conclusions
    This research provided 15-years water and vegetation maps with daily frequency
    and a 500-m spatial resolution over the Siberia region on a continental scale,
    integrating optical and microwave satellite data, and meteorological data. A systematic
    treatment based on pixel-based RF techniques and further postprocessing produced
    maps of the NDWI, NDVI, and water fraction (original and floating), without any
    gaps for the period from 2003 to 2017. In addition to the original sinusoidal
    maps with 500-m resolution, an analysis-ready product that merges all of the sinusoidal
    maps on a latitude/longitude projection was also rescaled to a resolution of 0.1°
    pixel spacing. The treated NDWI and NDVI images showed no overall systematic biases,
    with a RMSE of approximately 0.1 for all tiles. Based on the products, trend analysis
    showed the distribution of NDVI browning and increasing NDWI hotspots for the
    period from 2003 to 2017. Phenological features were extracted for each year at
    two larch forest sites (Spasskaya Pad and Elgeeii) based on double-sigmoid fitting
    of NDVI time-series data. The findings revealed a recent lengthening tendency
    in the growing period at the sites and confirmed that waterlogging caused an earlier
    start to spring at the Spasskaya Pad site. Our product can potentially be applied
    to spatiotemporal monitoring of water and vegetation, including trend analysis,
    phenological research, model integration and contribution to land cover mapping.

    access 01 February 2024 Introduction Cancer is a major health concern in the United
    States, with approximately 1.9 million new cases projected in 2022, including
    50,000 new cases within the Veteran’s Healthcare Administration1. Chemotherapy
    is a commonly used cancer treatment strategy, but its cytotoxic agents can have
    cancer-therapy related toxicity (CRT) side effects, such as fatigue, pain, nausea,
    neuropathy, anxiety, depression, or insomnia, which are estimated to affect approximately
    86 to 88% of cancer patients2,3. Severe chemotherapy-induced toxicities may result
    in dose delay or dose reduction, chemotherapy discontinuation4, and unplanned
    healthcare service to manage these side effects5; some may even result in premature
    death, if left unmanaged6,7. Resilience, often envisioned as the human capacity
    to maintain or regain relative stability in both psychological and physical realms
    amidst life''s adversities, emerges as an integral concept within the sphere of
    cancer care8,9. The capability to assess and prognosticate this resilience in
    response to therapy-induced toxicity holds profound implications9,10,11. It directs
    both clinicians and patients through the maze of treatment decisions, offering
    an essential tool for customizing treatment plans to patient-specific responses.
    By anticipating potential adverse events, we may refine care strategies and explore
    alternative treatments, advancing personalized medicine. This predictive ability
    not only has clinical implications; it directly impacts patients'' quality of
    life. By forecasting the heavy toll of side effects associated with cancer therapies,
    we may better navigate a path that manages these events, aiming to improve patient
    experiences. The early detection of toxicity offers a window for timely intervention,
    curtailing side effects and fostering improved outcomes12. The financial implications
    are also evident, as preparing for potential side effects can avert costly hospital
    readmissions and additional treatments13. Focusing on early stages of toxicity
    exposure is pivotal, allowing swift interventions that enhance patient outcomes
    and sustain quality of life9. In the routine clinical practice of predicting therapy-related
    toxicity resilience, the performance status (PS) scales—Eastern Cooperative Oncology
    Group (ECOG) PS14 and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)15—stand as the current
    gold standards. These tools provide critical navigation through the complex decision-making
    process inherent in cancer treatment. While ECOG-PS exhibits strong correlations
    with patient quality of life and survival in clinical trials16 potential inaccuracies
    in broader PS assessments could unintentionally elevate treatment toxicity risk,
    leading to adverse clinical outcomes. The ECOG and KPS scales, drawing on self-reported
    patient data about daily activity levels and independence in performing essential
    tasks, are not devoid of inherent biases. Patient recall, preferred treatments
    of patients or providers, and inter-observer variability17 can skew evaluations.
    Furthermore, time constraints can impede the thoroughness of these assessments.
    Providers may not routinely revisit performance status post-initial consultation
    unless significant functional changes occur, or might opt for an \"eyeball test,\"
    relying on observed patient movements instead of a comprehensive performance status
    history. Consequently, to discern patients with the highest likelihood of resilience
    to chemotherapy, it becomes imperative to investigate alternative, objective measures
    of functional status that can predict treatment-related toxicity and healthcare
    utilization. With the emerging need for remote monitoring of digital biomarkers
    to predict therapy adverse events, this approach presents a timely and practical
    patient monitoring solution, which may potentially help enhancing therapy safety,
    and potentially reducing health disparities, particularly in rural settings where
    hospital access may be limited. Technological advances, especially in physical
    activity monitors, offer innovative avenues for functional status assessment.
    The value of remote monitoring using digital health tools was underscored during
    the COVID-19 pandemic18,19,20. These monitors can persistently gather objective
    digital biomarkers of mobility, such as lying or sitting position, daily steps,
    and gait speed, outside the clinical environment21,22,23,24,25,26,27. Given the
    relevance of ambulation and time spent in a sitting or lying position to ECOG-PS
    scoring, these mobility digital biomarkers could enrich PS assessment. Research
    has suggested the efficacy of physical activity monitors in gauging chemotherapy-induced
    peripheral neuropathy, cancer-related fatigue, and the level of fall concerns
    among older cancer survivors28,29,30. Wearable activity sensors also demonstrated
    good potential for tracking mobility performance in chemotherapy patients31 and
    showed significant correlation with ECOG-PS-collected performance status32. In
    this study, we strive to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and proof-of-concept
    validity of a pendant physical activity monitor (PAMSys™, BioSensics LLC, MA,
    USA), a device with clinical validation for its ability to monitor cumulative
    postures such as sitting, standing, lying, and walking, along with tracking walking
    patterns, cadence, and postural transitions33,34,35,36. Our primary objective
    is to use this device to monitor patients'' daily physical activities continuously
    throughout the first two weeks of therapy initiation, aiming to predict non-resilience
    to cancer toxicity-based therapy. This non-resilience is identified by events
    such as therapy discontinuation or dose reduction, cancer-related hospitalization
    within the first four weeks of therapy initiation, or death up to six months post-therapy.
    We hypothesize that real-time tracking of mobility-related digital frailty biomarkers,
    including slowness, weakness, fatigue, and inactivity24, from treatment onset
    could provide a more accurate prediction of adverse events compared to traditional
    assessments like the ECOG-PS. This research represents an important step in enhancing
    our understanding and application of wearable technology in oncology, with the
    potential to improve patient outcomes and personalize cancer treatment strategies.
    Methods Participants We recruited Veterans with a recent diagnosis of stage IV
    lung or gastrointestinal cancer during their first chemotherapy infusion at the
    Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MDVAMC), Houston, Texas. All
    Veterans were > 18 years of age and were able to walk at least 15 feet independently,
    with or without an assistive device. We excluded Veterans who were not ambulatory,
    had no metastatic cancer, or refused to participate. All participants signed written
    informed consent forms. The Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board
    and the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center Research and Development
    Committee approved this study (IRB # H-48118) and all methods were performed in
    accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Demographic, medical
    history, baseline ECOG-PS, cancer diagnosis and treatment regimen of the participants
    were collected through chart review by a trained research coordinator. ECOG-PS
    was classified as dichotomous (0 or 1–2) for analysis (provided in Supplementary
    File). Hospital admissions and chemotherapy delays or dose reductions were also
    recorded. Participants completed psychosocial surveys for evaluation of their
    emotional, functional, and cognitive states before and after the intervention.
    For this purpose, we used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
    (CES-D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), and the Mini-Mental
    State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Assessing frailty through mobility-driven
    digital biomarkers via a pendant sensor Participants were instructed to continuously
    wear a water-resistant pendant sensor (PAMSys™, BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA, USA)
    around their neck for 14 days immediately following their first day of chemotherapy
    session, ensuring 24/7 wear. The monitoring period began with the onset of their
    initial chemotherapy and concluded at their next session. Additionally, participants
    were provided with a pre-stamped, pre-paid envelope and given clear instructions
    to return the sensor using this envelope at the end of the monitoring period.
    The PAMSys™ (Fig. 1) is compact (3.5 cm × 3.5 cm × 1.5 cm) and lightweight (24g),
    equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer. It samples accelerometer data at a rate
    of 50Hz. Through validated algorithms and biomechanical models, it extracts various
    physical activity metrics25,34,35,36,37,38,39,40. These include cumulative postures
    (sitting, standing, lying, walking) with a time resolution of every second, locomotion
    metrics (e.g., cadence, step count, longest walking bout), postural transitions
    (e.g., number of sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit movements), and energy expenditure.
    In this study, we used the 2019 model of the PAMSys, which is water-resistant,
    has a battery life exceeding one month, and includes built-in data storage to
    ensure uninterrupted monitoring. We limited the recording to a minimum of 14 days
    of continuous monitoring and advised participants to return the sensor to the
    clinic. Alternatively, the sensor was collected when they came for their next
    cycle of chemotherapy. If a subject used the device for more than 14 days, our
    data analysis was confined to the first 14 days of recorded data. We selected
    a 14-day duration as it aligns with the bi-weekly chemotherapy cycle, allowing
    us to stop recording before the next cycle begins. This approach enables the tracking
    of changes in physical activity patterns immediately following the initiation
    of the first chemotherapy cycle and prior to the start of the subsequent cycle.
    Figure 1 A patient wearing the PAMsys pedant sensor. Using validated algorithms
    different digital biomarkers of mobility including locomotion, cumulative postures,
    postural transitions, energy expenditure were extracted from the pendant sensor
    during a 2-week remote monitoring period (24h/7days) during chemotherapy. Full
    size image This study focuses on tracking changes in physical activity patterns
    from a defined baseline to a subsequent endpoint, using these patterns as surrogate
    markers for physical frailty phenotypes. Drawing upon previous research24, we
    selected nine frailty-associated digital biomarker features, as detailed in Table
    1, to encapsulate these phenotypes. These features encompass dimensions such as
    slowness (indicated by cadence), inactivity (denoted by daily walking steps),
    weakness (depicted by postural transitions), and exhaustion (represented by factors
    like the duration of the longest walk, standing posture, and energy expenditure).
    Each of these biomarker features was assessed every 24 h, and their variations
    were tracked throughout the 14-day monitoring period. Table 1 Sensor-derived digital
    frailty biomarkers. Full size table In terms of defining our time points, the
    baseline is considered as the first day of chemotherapy cycle. The endpoint is
    determined as final day of sensor monitoring (14th day). To capture the trajectory
    of each frailty biomarker, we calculated the ratio of the difference between the
    endpoint and baseline to the baseline itself. This computation provides a holistic
    depiction of the alterations in frailty over the course of the treatment period.
    Determination of chemotherapy resilience and chemotherapy resilience index The
    recording of prospective adverse events was carried out via comprehensive reviews
    of medical charts, consultations with administering oncologists, and/or through
    interviews conducted either with the chemotherapy administering oncologists or
    directly with the participants themselves. The medical charts were collected through
    the electronic health record (EHR) within the Veterans Affairs (VA). This process
    led to the categorization of participants into one of two distinct groups for
    further analysis: resilient or non-resilient. The non-resilient classification
    was assigned based on the occurrence of certain prospective events related to
    cancer therapy. These included the discontinuation or dose reduction of therapy,
    cancer-related hospitalizations within the initial four weeks following therapy
    initiation, or mortality within a period of six months post-therapy. Conversely,
    resilient participants were defined as those who did not meet these criteria.
    A two-sample t-test was used to compare categorical variables between the resilient
    and non-resilient groups. Cohen''s d was used to calculate the effect size (small
    effect size (d = 0.2), medium effect size (d = 0.5), and large effect size (d = 0.8))41.
    Three different models using Logistic Regression were tested to assess their ability
    to differentiate between resilient and non-resilient participants. The models
    included: (1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), (2) Mobility derived
    digital biomarkers of frailty (MBF), and (3) a combination of ECOG and MBF. The
    parameters for MBF were chosen based on their significant differences and larger
    effect sizes between the resilient and non-resilient groups. Models incorporating
    MBF aimed to determine the optimal number of days needed to distinguish non-resilient
    cases from resilient ones as early as possible in post-chemotherapy initiation,
    while achieving an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.80. The Chemotherapy
    Resilience Index (CRI) was calculated using fitted probabilities from a logistic
    regression model, featuring a scale from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate
    poorer resilience to chemotherapy. This model, derived using the maximum likelihood
    estimation (MLE) method42, was designed to optimally differentiate between resilient
    and non-resilient participants. To construct the model, we employed MBE metrics
    gathered during the shortest post-chemotherapy initiation time window that could
    effectively distinguish non-resilient cases from resilient ones with an AUC of
    0.80 or greater. The aim was to develop a singular score reflecting the likelihood
    of poor resilience to chemotherapy as early as possible after the initiation of
    treatment. In assessing the predictive performance of CRI, in addition to sensitivity
    and specificity, we calculated the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) as shown in
    Eq. (1), using the optimal cut-point threshold determined by AUC. $${\\text{PPV}}=
    \\frac{{\\text{TP}}}{{\\text{TP}}+{\\text{FP}}}$$ (1) To prevent an overestimation
    of the PPV, we computed the adjusted PPV using Eq. (2)43. $$Adjusted PPV= \\frac{Sensitivity
    \\times Prevalence}{\\left(Sensitivity \\times Prevalence\\right) + \\{(1-Specificity)\\times
    (1-Prevalence)\\}}$$ (2) The prevalence rate is derived from our dataset and represents
    the proportion of patients who experienced adverse reactions to chemotherapy (non-resilient)
    within our study sample. All statistical analyses and machine learning models,
    including data extraction, plotting, and model fitting, were performed using MATLAB.
    (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Results All Veterans admitted to the MDVAMC
    oncology clinic for chemotherapy treatment were considered as potential participants.
    The data were collected during two-time intervals: the first cohort between September
    9, 2019, and October 16, 2019, and the second cohort from April 7, 2021, to April
    12, 2022. However, recruitment for the second cohort experienced a pause of approximately
    six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, both cohorts followed the
    same protocol. Of these, thirty-nine Veterans [Age = 65.9 ± 13.9, BMI = 25.9 ± 5.4,
    67% male, ECOG-PS: ECOG(0) = 33%, ECOG(1) = 41%, ECOG(2) = 18%] met the study''s
    specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and consented to participate in the
    study. Among them, only one refused to wear the pendant sensor for 14 continuous
    days after giving consent, resulting in a 97% protocol feasibility rate for the
    use of the pendant sensor. The remaining thirty-eight participants completed the
    14-day period and self-reported wearing the sensor continuously without removal.
    However, due to technical issues such as corrupted sensor memory and sensor battery
    failure that resulted in data not being recorded during the first two weeks, data
    from 11 participants had to be excluded. This resulted in a total of 27 valid
    samples. Among these, 14 participants (52%) completed a four-week chemotherapy
    cycle without encountering any adverse events during the cycle and survived up
    to six months post initiation, leading to their classification as resilient. The
    remaining thirteen participants (48%) were classified as non-resilient, having
    experienced one or more adverse events such as dose reduction or treatment discontinuation
    (n = 7, 54%), unplanned hospitalization (n = 8, 62%) within 4 weeks, or death
    within the first six months of therapy (n = 11, 85%). Baseline demographics and
    clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Upon comparison, no significant
    differences were observed between the resilient and non-resilient groups in terms
    of demographics and comorbidities except the BMI and depression. Table 2 Overall
    baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and motor capacity information
    of the resilient and non-resilient group. Full size table Figure 2 illustrates
    the patterns of physical activity immediately following the initiation of the
    first chemotherapy cycle, over a duration of 14 days leading up to the subsequent
    cycle. Generally, visual observation of these patterns shows a decline in functional
    performance for both groups, with the most noticeable decline observed on either
    day 2 or 3 post-chemotherapy. However, the resilient group begins to recover from
    day 3 and reaches stable values for most parameters by around day 6. In line with
    our hypotheses, changes in frailty phenotypes like slowness (cadence) and weakness
    (postural transition) significantly predicted chemotherapy non-resilience cases,
    exhibiting large effect sizes (d = 0.86–0.88, p < 0.03). However, variations in
    inactivity and exhaustion, despite being observed in both groups, did not predict
    non-resilience in our sample (also shown in Supplemetary Table 1). Figure 2 Sensor
    output metrics for a resilient (blue) and non-resilient (red) participants. The
    mean physical activity parameters between the groups are shown with error bar
    (standard error) for 2 weeks of recorded activity. The asterisk (*) sign is used
    to represent significant difference in parameters for the corresponding day between
    resilient and non-resilient participants. Full size image Based on regression
    analysis, we determined that the earliest day post-chemotherapy initiation capable
    of distinguishing between groups with an AUC greater than 0.80 is day 6. On this
    day, the model incorporating digital biomarkers of frailty achieved an AUC of
    0.86, a notably superior performance compared to the model using only ECOG, which
    reached an AUC of 0.75. Additionally, the combination of ECOG with digital biomarkers
    of frailty slightly improved the model''s performance, yielding an AUC of 0.88
    in predicting the non-resilient group, as illustrated in Fig. 3 and Supplementary
    Figure 1. Figure 3 Area under curve (AUC) of the fitted logistic regression model
    for 3 different models shows the model that uses both ECOG and MBF can distinguish
    the resilient vs non-resilient group better than other models. Full size image
    The Chemotherapy Resilience Index (CRI) was calculated using a model that combines
    digital biomarkers of frailty, including cadence and postural transitions, measured
    on Day 6 post-chemotherapy initiation, along with ECOG values. This index is normalized
    on a scale from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater severity in the
    lack of resilience to chemotherapy. Using this index, we successfully distinguished
    between groups with a very large effect size, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 (CRI = 0.2 ± 0.27
    in the resilient group vs. 0.7 ± 0.26 in the non-resilient group, p < 0.001, Cohen’s
    d = 1.67). The optimal cut-off point for the CRI was established at 0.54. At this
    threshold, we achieved a sensitivity of 77%, a specificity of 86%, and an adjusted
    PPV of 83% for distinguishing non-resilient cases from resilient ones on day 6
    post-chemotherapy initiation. Figure 4 Chemotherapy resilience index (CRI ≥ 0.54)
    calculated from the MBF and ECOG can distinguish the patient with resilience significantly
    (p = 0.0007, effect size = 1.67). Full size image Discussion In this observational
    study, we investigated whether frailty phenotypes derived from physical activity
    were associated with chemotherapy resilience among cancer patients. Our results
    support the hypothesis that analyzing the phenotypes of frailty can help differentiate
    individuals who are resilient and who are not resilient. Specifically, slowness
    and weakness phenotypes achieved large effect size range in distinguishing the
    two groups; however, variations in inactivity and exhaustion, despite being observed
    in both groups, did not distinguish non-resilience in our sample. Additionally,
    our study indicates that the earliest day post-chemotherapy initiation for effectively
    predicting the non-resilient group with an AUC greater than 0.80 is day 6 post-therapy.
    On this day, our model, utilizing digital biomarkers of frailty measured via a
    pendant sensor combining with ECOG, predicts non-resilience with an AUC of 0.88.
    This timing could offer a sufficient window for timely interventions or decision-making
    prior to the next therapy cycle, which is typically scheduled on a bi-weekly basis.
    Interestingly, the patterns of physical activity following the initiation of chemotherapy
    indicate a decline in most functional metrics for both groups, particularly in
    cadence, with the largest decrease observed on days 2 or 3 post-therapy initiation.
    The functional performance metrics in the resilient group begin to rebound from
    day 3 and almost return to pre-therapy levels by day 6. In contrast, the non-resilient
    group either fails to recover in some metrics, recovers over a longer time period,
    or in some cases, further deteriorates after day 6. This pattern may explain why
    our model, which distinguishes between the groups, shows its strongest performance
    on days 6 and 7, with less stable results thereafter. The link between frailty
    and non-resilience to chemotherapy in older adults is a critical area of research,
    with multiple established methods such as the Liver Frailty Index and Fried Frailty
    Index (FFI) being used to predict a patient’s capacity to cope with treatment44,45,46,47,48,49.
    Traditional screening methods for detecting frailty, while informative, are often
    subjective, necessitate in-person administration, and demand considerable resources—posing
    substantial barriers for those who are frail and may find it challenging to visit
    clinics regularly. Additionally, traditional methods often rely on a single snapshot
    assessment of functional capacity, typically conducted in a clinical setting prior
    to the initiation of chemotherapy. This approach, however, lacks the temporal
    resolution necessary to track potential functional deterioration due to chemotherapy
    and subsequent recovery patterns. As defined by Hale et al.50, resilience is the
    capacity to recover quickly from difficulties or adapt effectively in the face
    of stress or trauma. In our study, we propose that continuous monitoring of digital
    biomarkers of frailty, such as a decrease in cadence (a surrogate for slowness24)
    and a reduction in the total daily number of postural transitions (a surrogate
    for weakness24), derived from daily physical activity, may aid in determining
    and quantifying resilience to chemotherapy. This method evaluates the extent of
    functional performance deterioration in response to chemotherapy and the speed
    of returning to baseline levels established prior to chemotherapy initiation.
    Our study may also pave the way for deploying remote patient monitoring solutions
    as a practical and objective tool for remotely screening resilience to chemotherapy
    and potentially assessing the level of toxicity accumulation post-therapy. This
    offers significant benefits over conventional techniques that rely on assessments
    under supervised conditions, often in oncology clinics. This approach not only
    mitigates the logistical and resource-intensive aspects of traditional screenings
    but also introduces a critical element of temporal resolution to the monitoring
    process. With this added time resolution, our study reveals that remote monitoring
    of physical activities and metrics, such as a decline in cadence and a reduction
    in postural transition numbers (daily number of sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit
    movements), can identify individuals with reduced resilience to chemotherapy as
    early as 6 days after treatment commencement. This method has an adjusted 83%
    PPV in predicting those who develop major adverse events up to 6 months post-chemotherapy
    initiation. Further research is necessary to determine if this timeframe allows
    for timely intervention. Nonetheless, we believe this information can significantly
    enhance personalized decision-making for subsequent chemotherapy cycles, potentially
    guiding oncologists to adjust treatment strategies. This may include altering
    chemotherapy agents, reducing doses, or discontinuing therapy early to prevent
    severe adverse events like unplanned hospitalizations or death. The prominence
    of the decline in cadence and the parameters related to postural transitions within
    this context can be attributed to their status as indicative markers of slowness
    and weakness which are recognized hallmarks of frailty51. These findings are consistent
    with studies which evaluated the association between specific components of FFI
    and chemotherapy toxicity and found slowness (gait speed) and weakness (grip strength)
    to be significantly associated with toxicity45,52. Another study demonstrated
    the significant association between prolonged Timed Up and Go with chemotherapy
    toxicity as well which adds value to the role of physical activity parameters
    as predictors of chemotherapy-induced toxicity53 and it is also comprehensively
    discussed in a systematic review and meta-analysis that physical activity decreases
    the severity of side effects of cancer treatment besides reduction in risk of
    cancer recurrence and death54. This alignment with prior research further strengthens
    the premise that our observations are rooted in a well-established framework.
    One of the exploratory objectives of this study was to determine the earliest
    post-chemotherapy time point at which poor resilience can be predicted. Early
    identification of poor resilience to chemotherapy could inform decisions about
    subsequent treatment cycles. While chemotherapy cycles vary significantly depending
    on cancer type, specific drugs used, treatment goals (curative, control, or palliative),
    and the individual patient’s health and response to therapy, a common schedule
    is bi-weekly55. In our study, all participants followed a bi-weekly schedule,
    and we tracked changes in physical activity patterns during the 14 days leading
    up to the next cycle. To identify the earliest post-chemotherapy time point, we
    applied regression model analysis to our time series data, seeking the earliest
    time point where groups could be distinguished with an AUC greater than 0.80.
    We found that as early as 6 days post-chemotherapy, we could differentiate between
    groups with an AUC greater than 0.80. Initially, both groups, regardless of resilience
    level, showed a decline in functional capacity, making the first few days less
    ideal for distinguishing those with poor resilience. However, we observed that
    the resilient group’s functional capacity quickly returned to baseline values
    before the initiation of chemotherapy, whereas the recovery in the non-resilient
    group required more days. Therefore, around the mid-point of the cycle (days 6
    or 7), appears to be the optimal time to distinguish recovery patterns between
    the two groups. While extending the observation period beyond the midpoint may
    increase the detection accuracy for some functional capacity metrics, the reliability
    of the results could be compromised. This is because individuals in the non-resilient
    group may exhibit some level of recovery over a longer time window, thus diminishing
    the differences between groups over extended intervals. This phenomenon might
    explain the high variation in estimated AUC values observed after day 6. However,
    these speculations need to be validated in future studies with larger sample sizes.
    A significant limitation of our study in determining the optimal time point for
    detecting non-resilience was the necessity of using the entire dataset for model
    fitting, due to the small sample size, which may lead to inaccuracies. Future
    studies should remedy this by dividing the dataset into separate portions for
    model fitting and testing. Nevertheless, with the assumption that 6 days post-chemotherapy
    is an optimum point to identify non-resilient cases, we introduced the concept
    of a Chemotherapy Resilience Index (CRI). This index, ranging from 0 to 1, where
    higher values indicate an increased likelihood of experiencing major adverse events,
    was calculated 6 days after the initiation of therapy. The CRI demonstrated a
    remarkable ability to distinguish between non-resilient and resilient groups,
    indicating a very large effect size (d = 1.67). These results highlight the potential
    of leveraging digital biomarkers from remote monitoring systems to enhance predictions
    of treatment resilience in cancer patients. Our study revealed that there were
    no significant demographic or comorbidity differences between the resilient and
    non-resilient patient groups except BMI and depression, highlighting the significant
    role of frailty biomarkers in assessing chemotherapy-induced resilience. BMI has
    positive correlation with resilience (higher BMI is linked to a lower risk of
    non-resilience which is align with similar studies that patients with higher BMI
    experienced less severe chemotherapy-induced toxicity in particular hematologic
    and gastrointestinal events and hospital admissions56,57,58). One possible reason
    could be the different pharmacokinetics of antineoplastic drugs in the bodies
    of overweight individuals. There is published evidence showing that some drugs
    may lead to reduced levels in obese individuals59. It has also been illustrated
    that lower BMI and specifically sarcopenia, as a characteristic syndrome of progressive
    and generalized skeletal loss60, is significantly associated with frailty61 and
    pre-therapeutic sarcopenia is found to have a predictive value for chemotherapy-induced
    toxicity62. So, considering lower BMI as an alien with frailty for predicting
    non-resiliency is well demonstrated in our study and is consistent with the aforementioned
    investigations. The unexpected finding that the rate of depression was significantly
    higher in the resilient group (35.7%) compared to the non-resilient group (0%)
    challenges prevailing assumptions about the interplay of mental health and resilience
    in cancer patients9. This could imply that physical frailty may be a more significant
    predictor of resilience to chemotherapy than the presence of depression. However,
    given the small sample size of our study, we must consider the possibility that
    our results may not sufficiently capture the role of depression. Consequently,
    these preliminary findings are speculative, and further investigation with a larger
    cohort is essential to substantiate the relationship between depression and chemotherapy
    resilience. Our predictive model built on the combination of these physical activity
    patterns could identify the non-resilient group with an AUC of 0.86, which surpassed
    the predictive capacity of the ECOG-PS assessment (AUC = 0.75). The integration
    of physical activity digital biomarkers and the ECOG-PS assessment slightly improved
    the AUC to 0.88 which was an indicator of better efficacy of combining these items
    instead of using them separately. Additionally, our results indicate that the
    model combining physical activity and ECOG outperforms in terms of differentiation
    capability, surpassing the clinically accepted threshold of 0.80 AUC63. In contrast,
    the ECOG alone does not meet this benchmark. This lends credence to our hypothesis
    that integrating digital metrics with in-clinic evaluations enhances the accuracy
    in identifying individuals who experienced chemotherapy-related adverse events
    from those who did not. In our study, we employed a pendant sensor to remotely
    monitor physical activities and indicators of frailty such as slowness and weakness.
    The choice of a pendant sensor likely contributed to the high adherence and acceptability
    observed in our target population. Acceptability is critical, as the design and
    ergonomics of wearable devices significantly influence their potential for continuous
    health monitoring and early prediction of resilience to cancer treatment toxicity.
    The integration success of monitoring technology relies on the patients'' comfort
    and their willingness to wear the devices consistently, particularly during the
    vital initial therapy phase. Cumbersome sensors that interfere with daily life
    are less likely to be accepted34,64. Wrist-worn sensors are effective for logging
    daily steps and periods of inactivity, yet they may lack the sensitivity needed
    to capture intricate physical activity patterns crucial for an in-depth evaluation
    of functional performance64,65. These details include cadence and postural transitions,
    which have been identified as more indicative of chemotherapy resilience than
    mere step count. Thus, the strategic placement of the sensor is as important as
    its function. Moreover, the discretion offered by a sensor that can be concealed
    during daily activities likely enhances its acceptance, as individuals may prefer
    to keep wrist space available for personal accessories rather than medical devices.
    Our study''s findings support the feasibility and high acceptability of the pendant
    sensor-based system for remote patient monitoring, with an acceptance rate of
    97%, surpassing that of similar studies (83%)66. This success may be attributed
    to the sensor''s unobtrusive and practical design, underlining the importance
    of considering patient convenience in wearable health technology. This pilot study,
    while insightful, comes with several limitations. Being a single-center feasibility
    study, our sample was both small and homogenous. This homogeneity might account
    for the lack of significant differences in demographics and comorbidities between
    resilience groups. Furthermore, the majority of our sample was white and male,
    which represent the demographics of Veterans. Additionally, due to the small sample
    size, we used the entire dataset for our model fitting process, instead of partitioning
    it into separate portions for fitting and testing the models. Given these factors,
    there''s a pressing need to validate our findings using a larger, more diverse
    sample that truly represents the demographic spread of individuals undergoing
    chemotherapy. It''s important to note that Veterans receiving chemotherapy have
    distinct characteristics; their comorbidities, health behaviors, and access to
    healthcare might differ from the broader population. By pinpointing specific challenges
    and opportunities related to predicting and addressing cancer-related toxicity
    adverse events in this group, beyond just ECOG and physical activity metrics,
    we can tailor and enhance care for Veterans diagnosed with cancer. Future research
    should prioritize the development of remote patient monitoring systems capable
    of utilizing digital biomarkers and predictive analytics to anticipate the occurrence
    or likelihood of adverse events. Furthermore, it is imperative to examine the
    perspectives of clinicians and patients regarding the trade-off involved in integrating
    physical activity monitoring into such systems, preferably through a comprehensive
    investigation involving a larger sample size. Conclusion This study establishes
    a proof of concept for the remote monitoring of daily physical activities for
    the continuous monitoring of chemotherapy resilience in cancer patients. Our observations
    suggest that by continuously monitoring physical activity, as the digital biomarkers
    of frailty phenotypes, over a 14-day period using a pendant sensor and combining
    this data with in-clinic ECOG assessments, we can identify patients who might
    be at risk of poor response to chemotherapy. This knowledge has the potential
    to equip both oncologists and patients with essential information, enabling them
    to make informed decisions regarding chemotherapy treatment adjustments. Moreover,
    this insight can pave the way for potential interventions like structured exercise
    programs or nutritional management strategies, aiming to bolster patient resilience
    and minimize adverse events related to treatment. It''s noteworthy to emphasize
    that digital biomarkers linked to slowness and weakness appear to be potent predictors
    of adverse events in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. These findings underscore
    the importance of a more in-depth exploration into the realm of digital biomarkers.
    However, it''s essential to acknowledge that this study''s limited sample size
    means that the observations need validation in broader and more diverse patient
    cohorts. As we pivot towards practical implementation, capturing the perspectives
    of both patients and physicians regarding the integration of wearable technology
    into routine clinical practices becomes imperative. Ultimately, the introduction
    of these digital frailty biomarkers promises to revolutionize physical performance
    evaluations, seamlessly blending traditional clinical assessments with precise,
    objective digital data. The research confirms the effectiveness of a remote monitoring
    system that combines a pendant sensor with ECOG assessments. This has the potential
    to enhance patient monitoring and improve chemotherapy safety, pending validation
    in larger study samples. Data availability The raw data supporting the conclusions
    of this study are not publicly accessible due to privacy concerns. However, processed
    de-identified data that do not compromise participant anonymity are available

  description: Discerning vulnerability differences among different aged trees to
    drought-driven growth decline or to mortality is critical to implement age-specific
    countermeasures for forest management in water-limited areas. An important species
    for afforestation in dry environments of northern China, Mongolian pine (Pinus
    sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) has recently exhibited growth decline and dieback
    on many sites, particularly pronounced in old-growth plantations. However, changes
    in response to drought stress by this species with age as well as the underlying
    mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, tree-ring data and remotely sensed
    vegetation data were combined to investigate variations in growth at individual
    tree and stand scales for young (9 − 13 years) and aging (35 − 52 years) plantations
    of Mongolian pine in a water-limited area of northern China. A recent decline
    in tree-ring width in the older plantation also had lower values in satellited-derived
    normalized difference vegetation indices and normalized difference water indices
    relative to the younger plantations. In addition, all measured growth-related
    metrics were strongly correlated with the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity
    index during the growing season in the older plantation. Sensitivity of growth
    to drought of the older plantation might be attributed to more severe hydraulic
    limitations, as reflected by their lower sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic
    conductivities. Our study presents a comprehensive view on changes of growth with
    age by integrating multiple methods and provides an explanation from the perspective
    of plant hydraulics for growth decline with age. The results indicate that old-growth
    Mongolian pine plantations in water-limited environments may face increased growth
    declines under the context of climate warming and drying.

    Abstract Discerning vulnerability differences among different aged trees to drought-driven
    growth decline or to mortality is critical to implement age-specific countermeasures
    for forest management in water-limited areas. An important species for afforestation
    in dry environments of northern China, Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica
    Litv.) has recently exhibited growth decline and dieback on many sites, particularly
    pronounced in old-growth plantations. However, changes in response to drought
    stress by this species with age as well as the underlying mechanisms are poorly
    understood. In this study, tree-ring data and remotely sensed vegetation data
    were combined to investigate variations in growth at individual tree and stand
    scales for young (9 − 13 years) and aging (35 − 52 years) plantations of Mongolian
    pine in a water-limited area of northern China. A recent decline in tree-ring
    width in the older plantation also had lower values in satellited-derived normalized
    difference vegetation indices and normalized difference water indices relative
    to the younger plantations. In addition, all measured growth-related metrics were
    strongly correlated with the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index during
    the growing season in the older plantation. Sensitivity of growth to drought of
    the older plantation might be attributed to more severe hydraulic limitations,
    as reflected by their lower sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivities.
    Our study presents a comprehensive view on changes of growth with age by integrating
    multiple methods and provides an explanation from the perspective of plant hydraulics
    for growth decline with age. The results indicate that old-growth Mongolian pine
    plantations in water-limited environments may face increased growth declines under
    the context of climate warming and drying. Similar content being viewed by others

    Plateau Article 26 September 2023 Introduction Tree growth decline and mortality
    have recently occurred across numerous ecosystems globally which are likely associated
    with increases in intensity and frequency of droughts (Allen et al. 2010; IPCC
    2013, 2021). Drought negatively affects growth and carbon sequestration capacity
    of forest ecosystems and hence can have a significant effect on the global carbon
    cycle (Ciais et al. 2005; Sippel et al. 2018). Endogenous processes related to
    age have been suggested as an important factor affecting variability of tree growth
    and its response to water availability (McMahon et al. 2010; Luo and Chen 2013;
    Chen et al. 2016). In the process of development, trees initially grow slowly,
    then have a period of increasing growth, followed by decreasing growth, all associated
    with changes of biological processes with aging (Fritts 1976). A number of studies
    have reported that the growth behavior of different aged trees reflected hydroclimate
    variability and this was linked to the changes in tree physiology with increasing
    age (Carrer and Urbinati 2004; Rozas et al. 2009; McDowell and Allen 2015). For
    example, evidence from natural forests in some high latitude areas indicated that
    old trees were more vulnerable to growth decline and mortality under drought stress
    than younger ones (Chen et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2021). In contrast, several dendroclimatological
    studies have shown that radial growth of younger trees is more likely to be affected
    by climate change relative to that of older trees (Carrer and Urbinati 2004; Rozas
    et al. 2009). A study investigating performance of a natural white spruce forest
    in western Canada found that recent climate drying led to growth decreases in
    both old and young trees (Hogg et al. 2017). However, few studies have examined
    changes in growth response to water availability across different ages in shelterbelts
    that are usually established in water deficit areas. Determining whether young
    or old trees are more susceptible to drought-related growth decline and underlying
    mechanisms is crucial to the construction and management of shelterbelts, as it
    can provide important information for making age-specific adaptation strategies.
    Variations of tree growth performances under drought are closely associated with
    changes of xylem hydraulic behavior (Tyree 2003; Choat et al. 2018). For example,
    canopy conductance decreases under climate warming and drying through increasing
    vapour pressure deficits which would adversely affect photosynthesis and growth
    (Whitehead and Jarvis 1981; McDowell and Allen 2015). In addition, taller old-growth
    trees enduring greater resistance in water transport because of longer hydraulic
    paths faced higher risks of growth decline or mortality, compared with shorter,
    younger trees (Enquist 2003; Petit et al. 2011; McDowell and Allen 2015). Older,
    taller trees are thus considered more subject to growth decline or even mortality
    associated with severe hydraulic limitations, particularly given a drier future
    climate (Bennett et al. 2015). An increasing number of studies have reported growth
    decline and death linked to drought across different biomes. Large, old individuals
    were the main victims that influenced the sustainable development of forests as
    well as their capacity for carbon sequestration (Allen et al. 2010; Ryan 2015;
    Gora and Esquivel-Muelbert 2021). As for different aged shelterbelts in water-limited
    areas, investigating temporal changes of growth performance with age and clarifying
    underlying mechanisms from the perspective of plant hydraulics will provide important
    information for the management of mature forests vulnerable to water stress. Tree-ring
    analysis provides an ideal approach to explore long-term variations in radial
    growth on an annual time scale in their response to environmental factors (Fritts
    1976). Using dendroclimatology, the temporal variability of tree growth covering
    the entire life cycle can be revealed, which will be beneficial for characterizing
    differences of growth performances at various ages and identifying underlying
    causes (Fritts 1976; Schweingruber 1988). However, this method focuses on growth
    performance in the transverse direction of the trunk for individual trees and
    is often restricted to tree growth behavior in a limited number of sites (Schweingruber
    1988; Cook and Kairiukstis 1990). Compared with tree-ring data, time series remote-sensing
    vegetation indices (VIs) based on spectral reflectance measurements of satellite
    images can be used to monitor temporal changes and spatial patterns of canopy
    conditions at the stand level as well as aboveground productivity at regional
    and even global levels (West et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2021). Among the VIs, the
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is most commonly used for examining
    the vegetation greenness at a canopy scale under environmental stress (Tucker
    1979). In recent decades, NDVI has been used successfully to monitor drought impacts
    on vegetation growth at regional, continental, and global scales (Kogan 1990;
    Karnieli et al. 2010; Vicente-Serrano et al. 2013; Ukkola et al. 2021). The normalized
    difference water index (NDWI), another vegetation index, is sensitive to fluctuations
    of vegetation moisture condition and commonly serves as a surrogate of canopy
    water content (Gao 1996; Chen et al. 2005; Ji et al. 2011). The combination of
    NDVI and NDWI makes it possible to examine the relationship between vegetation
    growth status and water content that would help to reveal the underlying mechanisms
    behind the fluctuations of canopy vitality. Both tree-ring parameters and time
    series VIs have been widely used for investigating long-term growth and their
    response to climate variability, with focus respectively on individual tree and
    forest canopy scales. However, little research has attempted to combine these
    two methods (Kannenberg et al. 2019). Examining tree growth from different spatial
    scales by integrating multiple methods, i.e., tree-ring and remote-sensing analyses,
    would help to detect signs of tree growth decline and comprehensively assess forest
    dynamics for shelterbelts established in water-deficit areas. Mongolian pine (Pinus
    sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) is widely used for establishing shelterbelts
    in water-deficit areas of northern China (Zhang et al. 2005a). However, in these
    areas, the species is vulnerable to growth decline and mortality when it reaches
    30 − 35 years old (below its lifespan of 150 − 200 years in its natural areas),
    a phenomenon called “premature aging” (Song et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2016). A recent
    study attributed the decrease in radial growth in introduced areas to increasing
    water stress with aging and explained the mechanisms behind this phenomenon from
    the view of xylem hydraulics (Liu et al. 2018). However, less is known about the
    responses of growth to water availability at the stand level, as well as the response
    across different ages for this species, hindering a more comprehensive understanding
    on forest response to water stress with increasing stand age. In this study, both
    dendroclimatological analysis and remotely sensed Vis were used to investigate
    growth changes to drought in relation to changes in xylem hydraulics in two age
    groups (9 − 13 years and 35 − 52 years) of Mongolian pine plantations in a water-limited
    area of northern China. It was hypothesized that: (1) interannual variations in
    tree-rings and of remotely sensed VIs were coupled in both older and younger plantations;
    (2) both tree-ring values and remotely sensed VIs were more sensitive to drought
    in older plantations; and, (3) xylem hydraulic conductivities decreased in the
    older Mongolian pine trees. Materials and methods Description of study area and
    tree species The study area is located in the southern part of the Horqin Sandy
    Land in northern China. This region has a temperate continental monsoon climate
    with a May to September growing season receiving 85% of the annual precipitation
    (Fig. S1 in Online Appendix). Annual total precipitation was 512 mm and mean temperature
    7.6 °C during 1953 − 2020 according to climate records from the Zhangwu meteorological
    station (42.42°N, 122.53°E) from the China Meteorological Administration. The
    forest vegetation is composed of a number species used for afforestation such
    as Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv., Pinus tabulaeformis Carr., Pinus densiflora
    Siebold & Zucc. var. zhangwuensis Zhang and Yuan, Populus simonii Carr., Populus
    alba ''Berolinensis'' L., and several native species (e.g., Ulmus pumila L., Phellodendron
    amurense Rupr.) that are naturally distributed. Historically, this region has
    been alternately occupied by forest-steppes and deserts under the influences of
    both climate fluctuations and human activities (Feng and Jiang 1996). Under increasing
    drought, grazing and aggressive land reclamation, native forests and grasslands
    were gradually transformed into desert lands from the late nineteenth century
    to the early twentieth century (Tao 1987). Massive reforestation programs organized
    by the government since the 1950s have returned parts of the desert lands back
    to forest that effectively curtailed further extension of deserts and protected
    the ecological environment of urban settlements in surrounding areas (Zhu et al.
    2016). Mongolian pine is a variety of Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in eastern
    Asia. Because of its ability in resisting drought and adapting to sandy soils,
    Mongolian pine was introduced from its native areas in Honghuaerji, Hulunbuir,
    China for afforestation to the region since the 1950s (Zhu et al. 2006). This
    species has also been widely used for afforestation programs in other areas of
    northern China over the past decades and have reached more than northern 300 counties
    (Zhu et al. 2005b), playing important roles in increasing vegetation cover and
    improving ecological services. Data collection Acquiring tree-ring data During
    August 2020, two different age plantations of this species (9 − 13 years and 35 − 52
    years) in the southern Horqin sandy lands in northern China. Age was obtained
    by counting the number of annual rings at breast height. Two plots of each age
    group were selected (42.71434 − 42.71479°N, 122.49038 − 122.49099°E; 42.66875 − 42.66920°N,
    122.57166 − 122.57227°E), with one plot per plantation for annual ring sampling.
    Tree heights in the younger and older plantations were approximately 2.5 − 3 m
    and 13 − 14 m, respectively. Thirty-seven and 33 increment cores were taken from
    20 to 21 trees, respectively, with one or two cores per tree at breast height
    using an increment borer. The increment cores were processed to obtain ring width
    data as well as their cross-dated results following the standard procedure of
    tree-ring analysis (Cook and Kairiukstis 1990). To extract the variances linked
    to climate while removing those related to biological trends, the tree-ring width
    measurements of each core for the older plantation were detrended using a cubic
    spline with a 50% frequency–response cutoff equal to two-thirds of the series
    length, which was performed by the program ARSTAN (Cook 1985). All detrended series
    were averaged to obtain a ring width chronology for the older plantation using
    the method of bi-weight robust means (Cook and Kairiukstis 1990; Fig. 1). For
    the younger plantation, the undetrended ring width series of all cores were averaged
    to obtain a raw chronology through the way of bi-weight robust means (Fig. 1a).
    We derived tree-ring raw chronology rather than the standard detrended chronology
    because the period of tree-ring data availability was relatively short (2008 − 2019).
    This is because there could be some possible drawbacks on detrending tree-ring
    data of short periods using the current detrending methods (Fritts 1976; Cook
    1985). However, the raw tree-ring width (RRW) data of the younger plantation could
    represent those being detrended, since trends of biology related to age might
    have limited impacts on annual ring data covering a relatively short period (Cook
    and Kairiukstis 1990). Chronology statistics include mean sensitivity (MS), standard
    deviation (SD), inter-series correlation (Rbar) and expressed population signal
    (EPS; Fritts 1976; Table 1). For each chronology, the reliable period is determined
    when EPS surpasses 0.85 (Wigley et al. 1984). Accordingly, the reliable periods
    for the chronologies of the younger and older plantations were 2010 − 2019 and
    1983 − 2019, respectively (Fig. 1a, b). Tree-ring chronologies covering these
    periods were used for growth-climate correlation analysis. Fig. 1 a Variability

    (PS1) and b older age groups (PS2) as well as changes of sample depth over time

    var. mongolica Full size table To better reflect radial growth of different aged
    Mongolian pine, annual basal area increment (BAI) was also calculated using non-detrended
    tree-ring data through the formula of Biondi and Qeadan (2008): $${BAI}_{t}=\\pi
    \\times ({RW}_{t}^{2} -{RW}_{t-1}^{2})$$ (1) where BAIt is BAI in year t; RWt
    and RWt-1 are cumulative undetrended ring widths from the pith to year t and t-1,
    respectively. Tree ages denote the cambium ages of the trees in 2020 when the
    tree-ring cores were sampled; the end of the chronology extension for both groups
    was determined in 2019, as the complete rings for the trees in 2020 had not formed
    when they were sampled in early August of that year. MS is mean sensitivity; SD
    is standard deviation; Rbar is inter-series correlation; EPS is expressed population
    signal. The unit of tree-ring width raw series was mm, which was used for calculating
    chronology statistics for PS1. Acquiring remotely sensed vegetation index data
    Six cloud-free sentinel-2A Level-1C MSI images (tile number T51TVH) covering the
    same region (including our study area) were acquired between late July and late
    August during 2016 − 2021, with one image per year (Table S1 in Online Appendix).
    The sentinel-2A satellite was launched by the European Space Agency 23rd June
    2015 to provide high spatial resolution multispectral data covering the globe
    with a 5-day revisit frequency (Drusch et al. 2012). The Level-1C images used
    in this study were derived from the Sentinels Scientific Data Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)
    which had already been orthorectified and geometrically corrected (Korhonen et
    al. 2017). Therefore, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction for the
    images were further carried out utilizing the Sen2cor 2.9.0 program (Gascon et
    al. 2017), through which Level-1C data were converted into Level-2A data. All
    13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution between 10 and 60 m for each image
    were combined and converted into the spatial resolution of 10 m using the ArcGIS
    10.2 software. The analyzed images were further extracted from the combined images
    using the vector boundary of the study area in the ERDAS 2010 software (ERDAS
    1999). After the above preprocessing, the spectral reflectance values from band
    4 (red region), band 8 (near infrared region) and band 12 (short wave infrared
    region) of the images were employed using formulas (2) and (3) for obtaining NDVI
    and NDWI data, respectively, which were performed with the ERDAS 2010 software.
    NDVI was calculated using the following formula (Tucker 1979): $$NDVI = \\frac{{\\rho_{NIR}
    - \\rho_{{{\\text{Re}} d}} }}{{\\rho_{NIR} + \\rho_{{{\\text{Re}} d}} }}$$ (2)
    where \\(\\rho_{{{\\text{NIR}}}}\\) and \\(\\rho_{{{\\text{Re}} d}}\\) are spectral
    reflectance values in near infrared (NIR) and red regions, respectively. NDWI
    was calculated using the formula (Chen et al. 2005): $$NDWI = \\frac{{\\rho_{NIR}
    - \\rho_{SWIR} }}{{\\rho_{NIR} + \\rho_{SWIR} }}$$ (3) where \\(\\rho_{SWIR}\\)
    is the value of spectral reflectance in the short wave infrared region (SWIR).
    NDVI and NDWI data for the younger and older Mongolian pine plantations were obtained
    through the following steps. Five square plots in each of the two plantations
    were established according to the layouts of pixels in the sentinel-2A Level-1C
    MSI image, with one covering the tree-ring sampling plot as described previously
    and surrounded by the other four for remotely sensed analysis. Each plot covered
    5 pixels × 5 pixels of the image corresponding to 50 m × 50 m in the field. The
    NDVI and NDWI data of each square plot were extracted from the data layers of
    these two indicators. The data for the five plots within each plantation were
    averaged and further used for analyzing canopy vegetation conditions at the stand
    scale. Acquiring xylem hydraulic data On early mornings during August 2020, four
    branches facing the sun, with per branch from each tree, were collected at the
    tree-ring sampling plot within each of the plantations for hydraulic conductivity
    measurements. During the sampling process, the cut ends of the four branches were
    recut immediately under water to eliminate potentially embolized tracheids. In
    the laboratory, 10-cm stem segments were extracted from the branches under water.
    The ends of each segment were then connected to a tubing apparatus filled with
    a degassed and filtered 20 mM KCl solution and a graduated glass pipette for measuring
    native hydraulic conductivity (Kh-native; Sperry and Tyree 1988). The solution
    flowed through the segment under a hydrostatic pressure developed by a hydraulic
    head of 50 cm. Native hydraulic conductivity (Kh-native, kg m s−1 MPa−1) was calculated
    using the following formula (Tyree and Ewers 1991): $$K_{{\\text{h-native}}} =
    \\frac{{J_{v} }}{\\Delta P/\\Delta L}$$ (4) where Jv denotes the flow rate through
    the stem segments (kg s−1); ΔP/ΔL is the pressure gradient across the stem segment
    (MPa m−1). Sapwood-specific (Ks, kgm−1 s−1 MPa−1) and leaf-specific (Kl, kg m−1
    s−1 MPa−1) hydraulic conductivities were obtained by Kh-native divided by the
    sapwood area (SA) of the transverse section and the total area of the needles
    terminal to the segment (LA), respectively. Both SA and LA were calculated using
    the software ImageJ 1.48v (US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
    The measurements of the two variables provided LA to SA ratio (LA/SA). Statistical
    analysis To investigate long-term growth responses to drought at both individual
    tree and stand scales, Pearson correlation analyses between the tree-ring metrics
    (e.g., RRW and tree-ring width index—RWI), BAI, NDVI and NDWI of the younger and
    older plantations and monthly self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI;
    Wells et al. 2004) were carried out during their overlapping period. Monthly scPDSI
    data were obtained by averaging the corresponding gridded data within the geographical
    range 42.5 − 43.0 N, 122 − 123 E from the CRU scPDSI Global 4.05early datasets
    with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° (van der Schrier et al. 2013; Barichivich
    et al. 2020). This range covered all the sampling plots. The available data of
    scPDSI included the period from January 1901 to December 2020. The scPDSI data
    during January through October were used. To test differences in the traits of
    xylem hydraulics and the remotely sensed vegetation indices between the younger
    and older age groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using
    the software SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc. 1997). Results Differences in growth patterns
    between younger and older age groups There were large differences in radial growth
    patterns between the two age groups. The RRW of the younger group (PS1) showed
    an overall increase before 2012 but decreased afterwards (Fig. 1a), which may
    partly be attributed to the effects of biological trends. Inconsistently, RWI
    of the older group (PS2) exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) period of decline,
    i.e., 2004 − 2019, while there was no significant trend over the earlier period
    (Fig. 1b). Both Rbar and EPS for the RRW of PS1 and the RWI of PS2 were relatively
    high (Table 1), indicating that the radial growth of the two age groups might
    be sensitive to climate variability. During the common period (2008–2019) of the
    two age groups, the values of BAI for PS1 showed an obvious increase but PS2 remained
    relatively stable (Fig. 1c). Consistent with the patterns of individual radial
    tree growth, vegetation greenness and water content at the stand level were poorest
    in the older plantations than in the younger ones. NDVI values of PS2 were lower
    than those of PS1 during the common period 2016 − 2021, with significant disparities
    between both groups in 2017, 2019 and 2021 (P < 0.1; Fig. 2a). Lower NDWI values
    were also observed for PS2 than in PS1 over the same years, with a significant
    difference in 2021 (P < 0.05; Fig. 2b). Fig. 2 Variability in remote sensing-based

    August) over the period of 2016 − 2021. Bar above/below each solid circle denotes
    1 standard error (n = 5); * and ** respectively denote statistically significant

    There did not appear to be any close relationships between the metrics of radial
    growth at a single tree level and those at a stand level. Correlations of tree-ring
    metrics (RRW and RWI) and BAI with NDVI and NDWI during the common period 2016 − 2019
    were all insignificant (P > 0.1) in each of the age groups (results not shown).
    However, it should be noted that there may be large uncertainties on the correlation
    results between these two kinds of indicators because the period of correlation
    analysis was relatively short, and hence their relationships may need to be further
    verified using longer time series data in future studies. There were strong associations
    between individual radial growth at the tree level and at the stand level in the
    same age group. Specifically, RWI was significantly (P < 0.01) and positively
    correlated with BAI in PS2, although there was no significant correlation in PS1
    (Fig. 3a). Moreover, NDVI was significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with NDWI in
    both age groups (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3 Scatter plots showing the relationships of annual
    basal area increment (BAI) with tree-ring metrics and of normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) with normalized difference water index (NDWI) over their
    common periods (2008 − 2019, 2016 − 2021, respectively), for the younger (PS1)
    and older (PS2) groups of P. sylvestris var. mongolica. The tree-ring metrics
    used for PS1 and PS2 are raw tree-ring width and tree-ring width index, respectively.
    The solid and dashed oblique lines respectively show significant (P < 0.05) and
    insignificant trends for the linear regression lines Full size image Contrasts
    in growth response to drought between age groups The radial growth of the older
    trees was more likely to be negatively affected by drought during the growing
    season. There was a significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation between RWI of
    the trees in PS2 and June scPDSI over 2010 − 2019 as well as first-order differences
    over 2011 − 2019 (Fig. 4a). In addition, although no significant correlation occurred
    between the RWIs of PS2 and scPDSI during the declining period of 2004 − 2019
    (correlation results not shown), the first-order differences of the two variables
    were significantly (P < 0.01) positively correlated over 2005 − 2019 (Fig. 4b),

    relationship between RRW and monthly scPDSI from January to October during 2010–2019
    (Fig. 4a). To further determine the growth-drought relationship over the early
    period of tree development, a correlation analysis was carried out between RWI
    and scPDSI during a much longer period 1983–2012 for PS2, a period when the age
    of most trees was < 30 years (Fig. 1b); with age < 30 years, drought-related growth
    decline has been rarely observed. There was no significant correlation between
    these two variables (Fig. S2 in Online Appendix). In addition, there was a significant
    (P < 0.05) positive correlation between the first-order differences of BAI for
    PS2 and of June scPDSI (Fig. 4d), but it did not occur for PS1 over the same period

    declines in aging Mongolian pine under drought Older, mature trees are more vulnerable
    to growth decline or to mortality than younger ones, which might be attributed
    to greater impacts of drought (Lindenmayer et al. 2012; Bennett et al. 2015).
    Our results show that older Mongolian pines experienced an obvious decline in
    radial growth and concurrently showed a greater sensitivity to drought during
    the growing season, as reflected by higher correlations of RWIs and BAI with June
    scPDSI. This concurs with a tree-ring investigation that found more obvious decrease
    of radial growth in older trees than younger ones of Qinghai spruce in Qilian
    Mountains in northwestern China under the influence of climate change (Wang et
    al. 2021). In addition, using plot-based measurements, several studies have also
    indicated that aboveground biomass of old forests in western Canada were more
    strongly affected by climate change relative to younger forests and were particularly
    vulnerable to growth decline caused by increasing drought associated with climate
    warming (Chen and Luo 2015; Chen et al. 2016). A synthesized analysis of diameter
    growth data revealed that, on a global scale, drought played a more detrimental
    role in radial growth and mortality of larger old-growth trees than smaller ones
    (Bennett et al. 2015). As large trees play a key role in forest ecosystems and
    radial growth is closely associated with biomass accumulation (Lamsal et al. 2012;
    Lindenmayer et al. 2012; Bennett et al. 2015), greater vulnerability in the radial
    growth to drought indicates that the dynamics of forest carbon sequestration would
    be largely affected by climate extremes and water availability changes related
    to climate fluctuations. The larger old-growth trees in Mongolian pine plantations
    tend to suffer from drought-driven radial growth decline, especially in water-limited
    environments as in our study area, which could substantially influence the capacity
    of carbon fixation and other benefits they provide. Consistent with increasing
    vulnerability of radial growth with age to drought, canopy greenness and water
    content at the stand level for older trees were more likely to be negatively affected
    by drought than younger ones. This is shown by stronger correlations of NDVI and
    NDWI with the growing season scPDSI in the older plantation. This agrees with
    a recent finding that old-growth forests at the southern edge of the taiga have
    low resilience at the canopy level in coping with water stress (Liu et al. 2021).
    Studies have shown a significant positive correlation between radial growth (i.e.,
    RWIs) and satellite-derived vegetation indices (i.e., NDVI) under similar climatic
    conditions, especially for the relationships with vegetation indices on seasonal
    and longer time scales (Leavitt et al. 2008; Bunn et al. 2013; Vicente-Serrano
    et al. 2016). As there are associations between the variables of the two aspects,
    they may exhibit synchronized changes in sensitivity to drought with stand age.
    There is, however, no close linkage between individual tree radial growth and
    vegetation greenness and water content at the stand level in relatively short
    time scales for the plantations analyzed. This is indicated by the lack of correlation
    of RWIs and BAI with the daily NDVI and NDWI for the same age group. This is consistent
    with the findings of studies showing no relationship between radial growth and
    satellite-based measurements at biweekly or daily scales (Beck and Goetz 2011;
    Berner et al. 2013; Brehaut and Danby 2018). That there were no statistically
    significant correlations between the metrics of these two aspects might be due
    to the long-term dynamics of carbon stored in woody parts of trees. This is reflected
    by radial growth and does not fully depend on recently synthesized carbohydrates
    from photosynthesis and is hence possibly decoupled from the short-term carbon
    gain of leaves at the canopy level (Huston and Wolverton 2009; Vicente-Serrano
    et al. 2016). Consequently, different responses to climate could occur between
    radial growth and the condition of the canopy vegetation. The annually-resolved
    RWIs and BAI were particularly sensitive to June scPDSI, while daily NDVI and
    NDWI during late July to late August were vulnerable to July scPDSI. However,
    this study also indicated that, in water-limited environments of our study area,
    both short-term canopy vegetation dynamics at the stand level (i.e., daily NDVI
    and NDWI) and relatively long-term radial growth at a tree scale (i.e., RWIs and
    BAI) were more susceptible to drought during the growing season in older Mongolian
    pines. This result is in accordance with recent reports that growth at both individual
    tree and stand levels consistently showed declines when the climate became drier
    in the Sierra Nevada (southwest USA), a water-deficit area (Wong et al. 2021).
    In regions with water shortages, trees are particularly vulnerable to drought
    and the negative impacts were probably expressed in growths at different scales
    (Beck et al. 2011; Subedi et al. 2021). Unlike several studies that relied on
    a single method (e.g., Carrer and Urbinati 2004; Liu et al. 2018, 2021), this
    study examined tree performance by combining tree-ring analysis and remotely sensed
    VIs that provided a more comprehensive understanding on response of tree growth
    to water stress with increasing age. Water-related mechanisms on growth decline
    of aging Mongolian pine Greater vulnerability of larger old-growth trees to drought-induced
    growth decline relative to younger trees may be attributed to greater restrictions
    on water transport. Trees become more susceptible to drought and suffer more severe
    hydraulic limitations with height increase, as deduced by Darcy’s law of permeability
    (McDowell and Allen 2015). Compared with smaller, younger trees, larger ones must
    overcome greater resistance for lifting water from roots to crowns because of
    increased length in water transport pathways, resulting in more challenging xylem
    hydraulics (Ryan and Yoder 1997; Ryan et al. 2006; Bennett et al. 2015). Furthermore,
    old trees having larger crowns and leaf areas relative to younger trees endure
    greater water loss from elevated transpiration that exacerbates soil moisture
    deficits and reduce water availability (Duan et al. 2021). As water stress and
    hydraulic limitations become stronger with age, trees become more sensitive to
    hydroclimatic conditions leading to more prominent climate signals expressed in
    measurements of radial growth at individual tree level (i.e., RWIs and BAI) and
    of vegetation canopy condition at stand level (i.e., NDVI and NDWI) for older
    individuals (Travis et al. 1990; Carrer and Urbinati 2004). Larger old-growth
    Mongolian pines in water-deficit environments susceptible to severe xylem hydraulic
    limitations under increasing water stress. Decreases in the groundwater table
    in the study area because of the dramatic expansion of water-consuming agricultural
    land since the 1950s most likely have led to increased water stress in plants
    (Zheng et al. 2012). The larger, older Mongolian pines might have more potential
    to avoid water stress than the smaller, younger trees because their larger root
    systems allow them access to deeper soil water. However, larger old-growth trees
    having greater root length and mass are commonly accompanied by increase leaf
    transpiration (Poorter et al. 2012), which exacerbates water loss through elevated
    transpiration. These causes make it is less likely to convert the merits in extensive
    root systems into hydraulic advantages for larger old-growth trees under water
    deficits (Bennett et al. 2015). Conversely, larger, older trees might suffer more
    from increasingly severe water stress compared to smaller, younger ones as the
    former depend more on groundwater that has continuously decreased over recent
    decades (Zheng et al. 2012; Song et al. 2015, 2016). Furthermore, larger old-growth
    trees may also experience greater hydraulic dysfunction due to the effects of
    height-related water transport resistance (Ryan and Yoder 1997; Midgley 2003).
    Such deduction is confirmed by our results that lower Ks and Kl occurred in larger
    old-growth Mongolian pines relative to the smaller, younger ones. This agrees
    with Liu et al. (2018) who found increasing hydraulic constraints with tree size
    for Mongolian pine trees in the vicinity of our study area. Because of greater
    hydraulic constraints, larger and older Mongolian pines have probably undergone
    more severe growth decline at both individual tree and stand levels, as indicated
    by the results of our tree-ring metrics and remotely sensed vegetation indices
    investigation. Under a future drier climate, we speculate that aging Mongolian
    pine plantations would be more vulnerable to drought-driven forest die-back. Conclusions
    By integrating tree-ring analysis and remotely sensed vegetation indices, our
    study suggests that recent decreases in RWIs (radial width indices) at individual
    tree level was echoed by consistently lower multi-year values of satellite-derived
    normalized difference vegetation and water indices at the stand level in plantations.
    In addition, all growth-related metrics were more sensitive to drought stress
    during the growing season, reflected by strong correlations between these metrics
    and the June/July scPDSI as well as their first-order differences, in older stands.
    Consistently lower sapwood-specific and leaf-specific hydraulics occurred in the
    older trees, indicating that changes of xylem hydraulics played an important role
    in mediating growth performances to drought. By integrating multiple approaches
    for quantifying tree growth performance, our study provides a comprehensive understanding
    of the differences in growth between older and younger Mongolian pine plantations
    and reveals the underlying causes from xylem hydraulics. Under climate warming,
    old-growth Mongolian pine plantations will exhibit more pronounced growth decline
    associated with increased water stress. Therefore, renewing old-growth plantations
    and taking action to alleviate competitions for water through thinning might be
    required for the sustainable management of Mongolian pine plantations. References

    During 2022, extreme rainfall occurred across southeast Australia, making it the
    wettest year on record. The oceanic impact of extreme rainfall events in normally
    ‘dry’ regions is not well understood, as their effects are challenging to observe.
    Here, we use unique multi-platform timeseries and spatial data from 36 autonomous
    ocean glider missions over 13 years, and we define an extreme salinity threshold
    inshore of the East Australian Current. We show that the freshwater plume extended
    fivefold further than previously thought. The compound effect of multiple large
    rainfall events resulted in a newly observed stratification (‘double-stacking’)
    dynamic, with the stratification being largely controlled by salinity. Extreme
    salinity events are known to be important for species composition of local fisheries
    as well as detrimental for coastal water quality. Such events and their impacts
    may become more common as extreme rainfall events are projected to become more

    2021 Introduction Unprecedented La Niña conditions began in September 2020 and
    continued through to late 2022, resulting in the first ‘triple-dip’ La Niña in
    the 21st century1. Over southeastern Australia, La Niña conditions are typically
    associated with above average rainfall conditions2,3 due to increased supply of
    evaporative moisture available for precipitation3. In 2022, extreme rainfall resulted
    in severe, unprecedented, widespread and repeated flooding throughout coastal
    areas of southeastern Australia, with damage estimated at over a billion Australian
    dollars. The effect of La Niña on rainfall in southeastern Australia is expected
    to intensify under future conditions, in line with the expected global increase
    in extreme events associated with climate change4,5 meaning that extreme wet years
    may become more common. While there is a vast literature on the effect of extreme
    rainfall events on land, less is known about the impact of extreme rainfall in
    the coastal ocean. This is despite 80% of global surface freshwater fluxes taking
    place over the ocean6. Our lack of knowledge of freshwater’s impact on coastal
    circulation is even more marked outside the well known large river plumes of the
    world such as the Amazon7, Mississippi8, Changjiang9 or Columbia10. Exploration
    of the subsurface extent and 3-dimensional structure of low-salinity plumes associated
    with continental freshwater runoff is limited by a global lack of in-situ observations
    in shelf seas (waters shallower than 1000 m). The observational problem is exacerbated
    inshore of the powerful poleward-flowing western boundary currents such as the
    East Australian Current (EAC), where strong advection from offshore currents increases
    the variability in flow regimes on the continental shelf, making it challenging
    to observe. Compared to other regions, rainfall in southeastern Australia is generally
    low and the large estuaries such as the Hawkesbury River are tidally-influenced
    drowned river valleys11 with low freshwater discharge. Knowledge of river plume
    spreading and freshwater dynamics in shelf waters is limited to a single idealised
    modelling study12 and freshwater impacts have typically been assumed negligible
    in studies of the ocean dynamics of the region13,14,15. With the recent emphasis
    on marine extremes, particularly the growing interest in marine heatwaves16,17,18,19,20,
    a framework has been established for the development of climatologies that facilitate
    the ready identification of extreme events using percentile outliers. This framework
    is now frequently applied to temperature, but has not been broadly used to identify
    salinity extremes and thus enable the quantification of their impacts, due to
    lack of appropriate data in most regions. Since 2008, a comprehensive ocean observing
    system has been under development around Australia through their Integrated Marine
    Observing System (IMOS). Consequently, the productive Hawkesbury shelf region
    (32.5–34∘S)21, inshore of the East Australian Current, is one of the best observed
    western boundary current shelves globally. In this region routine monitoring by
    in-situ moorings and autonomous underwater gliders provides a full-depth picture
    of temperature, salinity and optical properties at a high spatial and temporal
    resolution over the continental shelf22,23. Gliders have the advantage that they
    can sample autonomously even during extreme ocean weather events24 or under ice25,
    and provide 3-D spatial coverage of the coastal ocean. When combined with moored
    timeseries data they provide comprehensive data coverage in both time and space.
    With over a decade of sustained observations of salinity off southeastern Australia
    we can develop a daily climatology and therefore systematically identify and characterise
    extreme low salinity (or freshwater) events in coastal waters. Studies such as
    these are important for understanding the physical and ecological impacts of marine
    extremes in a changing climate. In this study, we use a multi-platform approach,
    leveraging satellite data, long timeseries from an coastal oceanographic mooring,
    estuarine loggers, and data from 36 ocean glider missions obtained over a decade
    to identify and quantify the impact of extreme freshwater discharge events over
    the continental shelf. The study region lies inshore of an energetic western boundary
    current, the East Australian Current, and offshore from the most densely populated
    areas of the southeastern Australia coast. We observe the impact of sustained
    extreme rainfall on the coastal ocean during 2022, the wettest year on record,
    and we contrast it with a large rainfall event during 2015, a year of average
    rainfall. We also contrast the impact of large rainfall events on the coastal
    ocean with drier conditions that usually prevail in this region. Our approach
    is readily applicable to other well observed regions globally and provides a framework
    for identification of extreme freshwater events in shelf waters. Results Defining
    extreme salinity events We define extreme low salinity events as those below the
    daily varying 5th percentile at the PH100 coastal mooring (Fig. 2c) using an approach
    analogous to the framework used to define marine heatwaves26. The 5th percentile
    was chosen as the best threshold for extreme events as it separates the long ‘tail’
    of extreme events from the expected variability, when considering the distribution
    of salinity in the dataset (Fig. 2c). The use of a seasonally varying percentile
    threshold, rather than a fixed one, as well as the use of the observed salinity
    distribution to guide the choice of that percentile threshold, is important in
    choosing appropriate extreme salinity values for the region. In a region of low
    salinity variability, a relatively small change in salinity could be considered
    extreme, while in a region of high salinity variability a larger drop in salinity
    would be needed to be categorised as extreme. As suggested by26, we ignore intermittent
    periods of 2 days or less when salinity is less anomalous and followed by another
    extreme low salinity event, considering the whole period to be part of the same
    event. For more information on the salinity climatology and extreme categorisation,
    refer to the methods section. Relationship between rainfall, estuarine, and coastal
    salinity In order to infer the impact of extreme rainfall on the coastal ocean,
    we first explore whether extreme rainfall events over land indeed coincide with
    low salinity in the coastal ocean, via the increased flow of freshwater out of
    estuaries and rivers. In the Hawkesbury shelf region, data from 2022 shows a significant
    correlation (r = 0.73 at a 1-day lag) between the salinity at the mouth of the
    Hawkesbury River (the largest river in the region) and salinity at the PH100 mooring
    site, approximately 65 km away. During 2022 periods of low estuarine salinity
    (Fig. 3a) coincide with low coastal salinity (Fig. 3b) and occur after large rainfall
    events, which take place in March, April, and July (Fig. 3c). Case studies 2022
    was the wettest year on record for much of the southeast coast of Australia, with
    cumulative rainfall at Sydney Airport of more than 2 m being recorded (almost
    double the annual average, Fig. 2a), with intense and widespread flooding resulting
    in the large discharge of freshwater into the coastal ocean (Fig. 1b). The period
    from late February to early May featured particularly heavy rainfall with almost
    a metre of accumulated rainfall in that period alone. In contrast to 2022, there
    was below-average rainfall in 2018, after an El Niño period preceded large bushfires
    in eastern Australia27. The contrasting oceanic conditions between these two years,
    2022 (large rainfall, flooding) and 2018 (below average rainfall, bushfires),
    can be seen in the salinity timeseries from the PH100 mooring (Fig. 2b). Near-surface
    salinity at PH100 during January to May 2018 was consistently above average, while
    salinity during the same period in 2022 was below average most of the time with
    an almost unbroken period of extreme low salinity from the beginning of March
    to the end of April. Fig. 1: Summary of the study region and location of glider

    (location shown in Fig. 1a), shows the large rainfall events that occurred in
    the first half of 2020, 2021 and 2022. Each of these (as well as an earlier large
    rainfall event in April 2015) have been sampled by the regular IMOS glider missions
    over the Hawkesbury shelf. Hence, from all 36 available glider missions (see Fig.
    2d for their temporal distribution), we categorise 4 missions as having captured
    data during ‘wet’ periods, defined by having consistent extreme (using the daily
    climatology at the PH100 mooring) low salinity in the top 50 m of the water column.
    Figure 1a shows the tracks and timing of these 4 missions in the context of all
    historical missions. The glider mission measuring the all-time lowest salinity
    took place in April 2022, immediately after a very large rainfall event (Fig.
    2a,d, Fig. 3c). Fig. 3: A comparison on estuarine and offshore salinity timeseries

    glider sampled salinity below the daily-varying 5th percentile for April (35.16
    psu) during every profile of its 400 km long transect along the Hawkesbury shelf
    (Fig. 4a), with extreme salinity (below 5th percentile) encountered offshore of
    the 200 m isobath, more than 70 km from the coast. The water column was even fresher
    further south, with a minimum salinity of 32.9 psu recorded at 34∘S. An across-shelf
    section at 33.5∘S (Fig. 4b) shows that the stratification of salinity in the water
    column is relatively consistent in the cross-shelf direction. An initial lower
    salinity (<34.7 psu) layer of water occupies the top 20 m of the water column.
    Below this, salinity increases, but remains below the 35.16 psu extreme salinity
    threshold until a depth of 50 m where the normal shelf water mass is present,
    marked by salinity above 35.4 psu. Temperature is well-mixed down to a depth of
    50 m (Fig. 4c). The buoyancy frequency (N2, Fig. 4d) reveals a mostly stable water
    column (N2 > 0), with two distinct levels of strong buoyancy gradients, at 20
    m depth associated with the first freshwater layer, and at 50 m depth, associated
    with both the temperature stratification and the halocline caused by the second
    freshwater layer. Fig. 4: Case study of April 2022 extreme wet event. a Glider

    We use coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as measured by the glider as a
    marker for the location of river plumes. A spatial view of the distribution of
    CDOM (Fig. 4f) reveals that, similarly to salinity, CDOM increases as the glider
    travels polewards, but is patchier than other parameters with higher CDOM associated
    with proximity to estuaries. The cross-shelf section at 33.5∘S (Fig. 4e) is located
    near the mouth of the Hawkesbury River, one of the largest estuaries in the region.
    The high (>1.2 mg m−3) CDOM extends throughout the upper 20 m of the water column
    out to 20 km of the glider’s track offshore (Fig. 4e), whereupon it subducts beneath
    warmer less dense offshore water. We contrast the large rainfall event during
    the wettest year on record (April 2022) with a case study of a large rainfall
    event during an average rainfall year 2015 (Fig. 2a). In both cases rainfall in
    the two weeks preceding the glider mission is similar (255 mm in 2015 and 311
    mm in 2022), but the rainfall in the 3 months preceding is vastly different (479
    mm in 2015 and 1125 mm in 2022). In April 2015, glider data showed extreme low
    salinity poleward of approximately 32.75∘S (Fig. 5a), with only a single layer
    of low salinity water extending across the shelf (Fig. 5b), which has far more
    cross-shelf variability in stratification than the previous April 2022 case study.
    The extreme low salinity layer extends to a depth of 40 m for the first 10 km
    from the coast, but then shallows to 10 m approximately 50 km offshore. At the
    shelf break the low salinity layer is subducted, resulting in a subsurface 20
    m thick layer of fresher water at 50 m depth below the warm (Fig. 5c) salty EAC
    water offshore. Unlike the 2022 case study, the April 2015 glider did not observe
    the double layering of density gradients in N2 (Fig. 5d), whilst CDOM follows
    the same pattern of cross-shelf variability as seen in salinity (Fig. 5e, f).

    distance is in the across-shelf direction. Full size image The mesoscale context
    of these two wet event case studies is shown using surface maps of satellite geostrophic
    velocities and ocean colour (Figs. 4g and 5g). Both case studies show locally
    elevated ocean colour close to the coast in the so-called ‘green ribbon’28,29
    and a strong (>1 m.s−1) southwestward EAC jet offshore. Both case studies also
    show a strong front between the warm, salty EAC waters offshore, and the cooler
    shelf water, which has been freshened by the large rainfall events. This front
    is well represented in the ocean colour images of chlorophyll, dividing the shelf
    waters (high chlorophyll) from the offshore EAC water (low chlorophyll). In the
    case of April 2015 this front is associated with a streamer of fresher water (the
    glider crosses it some 60 km offshore, Fig. 5b,g) that is high in both CDOM and
    chlorophyll. Remarkably, this streamer extends polewards from 33 to 34.5∘S, and
    eastwards from 152 to 152.7∘E (Fig. 5g). Effect of freshwater outflows on coastal
    circulation To quantify the impact of estuarine freshwater discharge on the coastal
    circulation, we calculate the buoyancy-driven flow caused by the freshwater plume
    observed by the glider during the April 2022 case study. Using the horizontal
    density gradients in the top 50 m of the water column observed from the glider
    section, from near the coast to the 200 m isobath, (Fig. 4g) and a logger deployed
    in the mouth of the Hawkesbury River, the buoyancy-driven flow can be estimated
    using the Heaps formulation of the momentum equations30,31. These theoretical
    buoyancy-driven flows are then compared to the surface and depth-integrated velocities
    measured directly by the glider (Fig. 6a). Inshore of the 100 m isobath, there
    is strong agreement in direction and to a lesser extent magnitude between the
    buoyancy-driven and observed velocities, which both flow northeastward at up to
    0.5 m s−1. At the 100 m isobath (15 km offshore), there is a surface velocity
    front which coincides with a sharp increase in temperature (Fig. 4c) and decrease
    in CDOM (Fig. 4e). This points toward this front marking the boundary between
    the freshwater plume (cool water flowing northeastward) and water entrained by
    the EAC (warmer water flowing southwestward along the shelf edge). Full-depth
    geostrophic velocities (Fig. 6b), are also calculated from the glider density
    field (Fig. 6c) to show the vertical structure. Although the utility of geostrophy
    can be limited this close to the coast, we see that the northeastward inshore
    flow associated with the freshwater plume, while surface-intensified, extends
    to a near-bottom depth of 50 m. The northeastward plume flow shallows and weakens
    in the offshore direction. The effect of the poleward flowing EAC can be seen
    at the very offshore end of the transect (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6: The effect of estuarine
    discharge on coastal circulation. a Depth-averaged (black vectors) and surface
    (red vectors) velocities observed by the glider during the offshore transect on

    low salinity impact The offshore extent of low salinity conditions associated
    with the 2015 and 2022 case studies can also be observed using the monthly SMOS
    satellite sea surface salinity product (Fig. 7). In April 2022 (Fig. 7a), low
    salinity water (<35 psu) extends southwestward along the offshore edge of the
    shelf break from 33∘S to 36∘S. In contrast, in April 2015, a plume of lower salinity
    water extends in the opposite direction, northeastwards along the shelf edge from
    33∘S to 31∘S (Fig. 7b). It should be noted that salinity offshore of the shelf
    break is generally fresher than the time-mean (Fig. 7c) in 2022 and saltier than
    the mean in 2015. This interannual variability is clear in a timeseries of satellite
    salinity extracted from a box along the shelf edge of the Hawkesbury shelf (Fig.
    7d). We see that 2015 has the highest salinity in the 7-year record, while the
    salinity in 2022 is anomalously low (>0.6 psu below the time-mean), although the
    uncertainty associated with this dataset must be acknowledged (Fig. 7d). The difference
    in salinity between 2015 and 2022 is consistent with the amount of rainfall received
    in the first 3 months of each year, with accumulated rainfall from January to
    March being 4 times greater in 2022 compared to 2015 (Fig. 2a). Fig. 7: Maps of
    monthly satellite salinity from the SMOS satellite product for. a) April 2022,
    b) April 2015, and c) the time-mean for 2015-2021. Dashed lines show the position
    of the 1000 m isobath. The red box in panel c) shows the area averaged over for
    the timeseries shown in d), with shading showing the uncertainty in the satellite
    salinity measurement. Full size image Contribution of extreme low salinity water
    to vertical stratification Our results show that the discharge of freshwater into
    the coastal ocean as a result of extreme rainfall events has impacted both the
    water mass properties and circulation of the coastal ocean in the Hawkesbury shelf
    region. In addition, the dynamics of the vertical stratification of the water
    column has also been affected by the extreme low salinity events in 2022 and 2015.
    We quantify this effect using the Stratification Control Index32, which compares
    the role of temperature and salinity in the overall stratification of the water
    column. Usually the Hawkesbury shelf (and greater EAC) region is assumed to be
    temperature stratified, which we confirm by a mean section of glider transects
    previously collected at 33.5∘S (Fig. 8a). However, in the 2022 case study (13
    April glider transect, Fig. 8b) the upper 30-50 m of the water column are dominantly
    stratified by salinity, with a temperature stratified layer below at 40-70 m.
    These layers extend across the width of the shelf. In the April 2015 case study
    (Fig. 8c), the boundary between temperature and salinity stratified water was
    not as stark and the vertical layering not as consistent when compared with 2022,
    with more salinity stratified water close to the coast, and temperature stratified
    water offshore. Although, in both cases the extreme low salinity waters resulting
    from heavy rainfall had altered the stratification of the shelf water mass. Fig.

    negative values show salinity stratified waters) for. a) a mean section at 33.5∘S

    image Comparison with dry years The April 2022 and April 2015 case studies presented
    above give insight into the way in which large rainfall events impact the Hawkesbury
    shelf during high and average rainfall years, respectively. However, it is also
    valuable to compare composite means of the 4 ‘wet’ missions, which take place
    during large rainfall events to the other 36 glider missions, which take place
    during the ‘dry’ conditions of low freshwater discharge more common in southeast
    Australia (Fig. 9). As the effects of freshwater discharge on shelf waters appear
    to operate over long length scales (~30–100 km, Figs. 4a and 5a), we take the
    mean of each glider mission during the time that it is in the region of interest
    (32.5–34.5∘S and inshore of the 200 m isobath). Fig. 9: Composite mean vertical
    profiles of. a) salinity, b) temperature, c) potential density, d) spice, e) coloured
    dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and f) chlorophyll-a fluorescence, from glider
    missions between 32.5∘S and 34∘S and inshore of the 200 m isobath. Thick blue
    lines show the mean of extreme freshwater `wet'' glider missions, while the thick
    black line shows the mean of all other missions. Thin blue and grey lines show
    the mean-profiles of individual `wet'' and `dry'' missions respectively. Full
    size image The impact of the large rainfall event associated with the ‘wet’ missions
    is immediately apparent in the composite mean of salinity, with surface salinity
    during ‘wet` missions being an average 0.75 psu fresher. The difference is highest
    at the surface, but is detectable in the composite mean down to a depth of 100
    m (Fig. 9a). Temperatures during ‘wet’ missions are also warmer (Fig. 9b), leading
    to the water column being less dense (Fig. 9c), particularly in the upper 60 m.
    The effect of fresher water being mixed downwards in the water column during the
    ‘wet’ missions is visible in increased spiciness (the variation of temperature
    and salinity along a constant density surface) in the top 80 m (Fig. 9d). The
    strong stratification set up by the homogeneous layer of freshwater observed in
    both of our previous case studies is clearly represented in the composite mean
    by the peak in N2 at approximately 15 m. The difference between ‘wet’ and ‘dry’
    glider missions is less clear when considering chlorophyll-a fluorescence, where
    ‘wet’ missions show lower chlorophyll and a shallower chlorophyll maximum when
    compared to ‘dry missions’. Discussion Sustained ocean observing with complementary
    platforms has allowed us to identify extreme salinity events in a complex continental
    shelf system. This is made possible by data from quarterly glider missions that
    provide unprecedented spatial (horizontal and vertical) resolution through the
    water column, and a 13-year-long mooring timeseries of salinity, which allows
    us to categorise periods where salinity in shelf waters falls below the daily-varying
    5th percentile as extreme low salinity events. Establishing this extreme threshold
    allows us to quantify the impact of the large freshwater flows into the coastal
    ocean during 2022, the wettest year on record in southeast Australia. In April
    2022, extreme low salinity is widespread over the continental shelf between 32.5∘S
    and 34∘S. This extreme low salinity for the region is found as far as 70 km offshore,
    near the 1000 m isobath and persists almost unbroken for 2 months. This is more
    than five times greater than the offshore extent previously simulated in idealised
    modelling of an extreme event (12 km12). We also observe a previously unseen dynamic
    for the region during April 2022: a ‘double-stacked’ stratification, with two
    layers of fresher water in the upper 50 m of the water column resulting in one
    salinity stratified layer, and another, deeper, temperature-stratified layer.
    Prior to the high rainfall accumulated during 2022, this ‘double-stacking’ had
    not been observed in this region, but appears to persist throughout 2022. We hypothesise
    that this is due to a newer layer of freshwater being added to the water column
    before the freshwater input from previous rainfall events has fully dissipated,
    resulting in persistent low salinity layers, as seen in the PH100 mooring timeseries
    (Fig. 2b). The ‘double-stacking’ of freshwater layers is not observed in the April
    2015 case study, or in the composite mean of previous glider missions associated
    with heavy rainfall (Fig. 9). This could be as a result of the previous glider
    trajectories simply not having passed through areas of ‘double-stacking’, but
    due to the large amount of glider data that we have available and the spatial
    extent of the extreme low salinity conditions observed, we consider this unlikely.
    During ‘wet’ events prior to 2022 the freshwater layer is approximately 15 m thick,
    which is consistent with previous idealised modelling results of the region12.
    However, signs of ‘double-stacked’ stratification are visible in data during both
    the April case study and a subsequent glider mission in October 2022 (Supplementary
    information Fig. S1), despite freshwater plumes not being widespread enough for
    us to classify it as a ‘wet’ mission. If the double-stacked stratification is
    indeed due to a build up of low salinity water from multiple large rainfall events,
    we would expect to see an increase in the residence times of extreme low salinity
    events in 2022. From the PH100 moored salinity timeseries we see that in 2022
    there are extreme low salinity events up to 44 days long, while in the 12 years
    prior, the longest event was 8 days. Cumulatively, there were 116 extreme low
    salinity days in 2022. This points to an increase in the residence time of extreme
    low salinity shelf water in 2022. Therefore, it appears that, within the 13 years
    for which data is available, the ‘double-stacking’ phenomena is unique to 2022.
    This begs the question whether we could see more ‘double-stacked’ freshwater layers
    in future if large rainfall events become more extreme, as is projected for the
    future5. The differing propagation directions of the plumes of low salinity water
    (Fig. 7) observed by satellite in April 2015 and April 2022 is also consistent
    with idealised modelling results12, who found that the presence of a cyclonic
    eddy at the shelf edge (as there is in our 2015 case study) results in northward
    plume propagation, whilst an extended EAC jet (as in our 2022 case study) results
    in southwestward plume propagation. Our results show that this mechanism, whereby
    the offshore mesoscale flow controls the direction of plume propagation, is robust,
    even though the observed low salinity plumes are larger than those previously
    modelled. Impacts of persistent extreme rainfall events on shelf ecosystems in
    this typically dry region are many. In addition to the direct impact on water
    quality from the dispersion of organic material from river mouths, there is evidence
    of mass kelp mortality caused by low salinity events33. Other impacts include
    a significant loss of optical depth, reducing light availability for primary production
    in an oligotrophic western boundary current system. Indeed, during the observed
    low salinity periods, the subsurface chlorophyll maximum common to the region34
    appears to be suppressed. Low salinity events also impact habitat availability
    for ecosystems, with evidence of extreme rainfall affecting fisheries catches
    by shifting the species composition35,36 and the distribution of larval fish37.
    Increases in the intensity of cross-shelf exchange, important for biological productivity
    in this region29, have also been recorded in other western boundary currents affected
    by large freshwater discharges9. Thus, in a future climate, an increase in the
    frequency of very large amounts of accumulated rainfall could disrupt fisheries
    catches and so impact food security. Before 2022, extreme low salinity events
    at the PH100 mooring tended to be short-lived with an average duration of 6 days
    (showing remarkable agreement with previous modelling results). However, in 2022
    the duration increased, with the 4 longest extreme salinity events in the mooring
    record all occurring in 2022. Thus a period of unprecedented rainfall led to extreme
    low salinity conditions of long persistence, giving ecosystems little time to
    recover. Increased stratification can lead to a reduced ocean-atmosphere heat
    flux and a shallower mixed layer depth, which has been shown to result in more
    surface-intensified marine heatwaves38. This appears to be the case off southeast
    Australia in 2022, where anecdotally the coast was affected by multiple marine
    heatwaves in the first half of the year. Thus, while at the basin scale, rainfall
    during La Niña years is driven by the transfer of heat and moisture from ocean
    to the atmosphere, at the shelf scale, a reduced ocean-atmosphere flux could lead
    to compound extremes in both salinity and temperature. Salinity extremes often
    co-occur with ocean temperature extremes39 and these compound events deserve attention
    and investigation in the face of rapid environmental change. More subtle impacts
    include the effect of freshwater discharge on surface frontogenesis and submesoscale
    variability on the shelf waters40,41 by increasing both the lateral and vertical
    buoyancy gradients. Increased frontogenesis can impact the convergence of biological
    matter and pollutants. Both the 2022 and 2015 case studies feature sharp fronts
    between the shelf and offshore waters (see Figs. 4g and 5g), particularly the
    2015 case where freshwater is subducted beneath the EAC forming a surface front,
    which exports potentially sediment-laden river water more than 100 km offshore.
    In the absence of any background flow, we would expect buoyant river plumes to
    flow equatorwards, as is the case for buoyant coastal currents such as the Norwegian
    Coastal Current42. In the Hawkesbury shelf case considered here, the equatorward
    flow tendency of the buoyant freshwater plume interacts with the background flow
    of the fast-flowing western boundary current. The interaction between the plume
    and EAC jet enhances the cross-shelf velocity gradient, therefore increasing frontogenesis
    between the shelf and offshore waters. In a region where temperature is the dominant
    control on stratification, salinity has become an important control on stratification
    due to extreme rainfall. As rainfall extremes are predicted to increase, so could
    the importance and impacts of freshwater input on the productive shelf waters
    of this region. Currently, much of the world’s coastal ocean does not have an
    ocean observing system capable of categorising and predicting extreme low salinity
    events. For example, in April 2022, concurrent with the floods in eastern Australia,
    extreme rainfall occurred in eastern South Africa43, another region where it has
    previously been assumed that freshwater has little impact on continental shelf
    waters. However, without sustained subsurface salinity observations e.g. those
    provided by ocean gliders, the effects of extreme rainfall on the ocean cannot
    be quantified. These results show the advantage of a multi-platform approach to
    sustained ocean observing for identifying and characterising new dynamics and
    impacts of extreme events. The use of sustained glider and mooring observations
    in shelf regions globally would fill a crucial gap in our global ocean observing
    system6 and allow the effects of extreme events in these crucial regions to be
    quantified as we adapt to life under a changing climate. Methods Rainfall data
    Rainfall observations are taken from the Sydney Airport weather station (Bureau
    of Meteorology station ID:066037). This site is located at 33.95∘S, 151.17∘E at
    an elevation of 6 m above sea level. It is chosen because of its proximity to
    the Port Hacking 100 m oceanographic mooring site (PH100) used in this study to
    define extreme low salinity thresholds. Ocean gliders Regular (nominally quarterly)
    ocean glider missions have been carried out along the inshore edge of the EAC
    (29.5-35∘S) since 2008 as part of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)22.
    The gliders typically sample between the coast and the 200 m isobath from the
    surface to bottom, with 4-5 missions undertaken each year. Each mission lasts
    three to four weeks. This deployment strategy allows quasi-synoptic sampling of
    the shelf waters inshore of the EAC22,44,45,46. In this paper we use vertical
    hydrographic profiles taken during 36 glider missions over the shelf between 32.5∘S
    to 34∘S. Each mission provides between 3000-6000 quasi-synoptic individual hydrographic
    profiles from surface to near bottom, with the average distance between the glider
    surfacing being approximately 200 m. For more information on glider instrumentation
    and processing please see the supplementary information text. Satellite remote
    sensing Visible colour images from Sentinel-2 were processed using tools from
    Digital Earth Australia47. Daily chlorophyll-a ocean colour estimates are obtained
    from the IMOS MODIS 1 day product at 4 km resolution, using the OC3 algorithm48.
    In coastal waters, chlorophyll concentrations derived from satellite ocean colour
    products are unreliable due to the complex interplay of chlorophyll, turbidity
    and coloured organic matter, hence we used ocean colour qualitatively to spatially
    examine front formation, rather than focusing on absolute values. Near-realtime
    surface geostrophic velocities (spatial resolution 0. 2∘) are obtained from an
    OceanCurrent product distributed by IMOS that merges satellite altimetry with
    sea level elevation measurements from coastal tide gauges49 to improve accuracy
    in coastal regions. Port Hacking 100 mooring site The Port Hacking mooring (PH100,50)
    is an oceanographic mooring site located in approximately 100 m of water at 34.12∘S,
    151.23∘E (Fig. 1). It has measured salinity at a nominal depth of 15-24 m since
    4th May 2010. The mooring provides a consistent, ~13-year long record of salinity
    at a fixed location, which makes it ideal for the determination of a salinity
    threshold for extreme freshwater events on the Hawkesbury shelf. Hawkesbury river
    estuary logger A HOBO U26 CT data logger measuring near-surface temperature and
    salinity at a nominal depth of 1 m was placed at the mouth of the Hawkesbury River
    estuary (33.5523∘S, 151.3124∘S) from January to August 2022. Tidal variability
    is removed with a 48-hour lowpass filter. Creating a daily salinity climatology
    Salinity measured at the Port Hacking 100 m site between 2009 and 2023 (~13 years)
    was used to create a daily climatology for identifying extreme low salinity events.
    We use the salinity mooring aggregated Long Time Series Product developed by the
    Australian National Mooring Network (ANMN) and the Australian Ocean Data Network
    (AODN)51, that concatenates all deployment salinity files between 2009 and 2023
    into one aggregated NetCDF file per site. Additionally, we use the IMOS CTD profiles
    collected since 200952. We follow the method used by50,53 to produce a daily salinity
    climatology at the Port Hacking 100 m site. Data were first quality controlled
    using standardised IMOS procedures54,55,56, followed by additional quality control
    procedures as described by50,53. Considering data availability, and so to not
    bias the climatology statistics, we also exclude a small portion of data when
    salinity is extremely fresh (as identified in this study). Climatology statistics
    for each day were calculated at a depth of 16 ± 3 m (where most measurements are
    available) using data within a 11-day moving window, and as a final step were
    smoothed using a 31-day window, as suggested by26. Estimating the duration of
    extreme freshwater events We use the Port Hacking mooring salinity daily-varying
    5th percentile at a depth of 16 m to identify days of extreme freshwater. We group
    consecutive days of extreme freshwater together as single events, and if two extreme
    freshwater events lasting ≥ 5 days are separated by a less anomalous period of
    ≤ 2 days, we combine these two freshwater events together, analogous to marine
    heatwave methodologies26. We then calculate duration as the total number of days
    in each extreme freshwater event. Estimation of density-driven currents Density-driven
    currents are computed following31 using a simple model allowing for the effects
    of rotation and friction30. This assumes that flow is forced by a depth uniform
    horizontal gradient in the across-shore direction and that there is no variation
    in the alongshore direction. Frictional stresses are controlled by eddy viscosity,
    giving equations of motion as $$\\begin{array}{ll}f{{{{{{{\\bf{v}}}}}}}}-\\frac{1}{{\\rho
    }_{0}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial {\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\bf{x}}}}}}}}}}{\\partial
    z}\\right)&=f{{{{{{{\\bf{v}}}}}}}}-g\\frac{\\partial \\eta }{\\partial x}+gz\\frac{1}{{\\rho
    }_{0}}\\frac{\\partial \\rho }{\\partial x}+{N}_{z}\\frac{{\\partial }^{2}{{{{{{{\\bf{u}}}}}}}}}{\\partial

    {\\tau }_{{{{{{{{\\bf{y}}}}}}}}}}{\\partial z}&=-f{{{{{{{\\bf{u}}}}}}}}+{N}_{z}\\frac{{\\partial
    }^{2}{{{{{{{\\bf{u}}}}}}}}}{\\partial {z}^{2}}=0.\\hfill\\end{array}$$ (1) We
    solve these numerically using routines supplied with31. The density gradient is
    taken from a straight line fitted to the vertically averaged upper 50 m density
    observed by the glider. The parameters used are shown in Table 1. Note that the
    density gradient used at the start of the transect is taken as the gradient between
    the Hawkesbury River estuary logger, and the beginning of the glider transect.
    Table 1 Inputs used for estimating density-driven surface currents Full size table
    Full-depth absolute geostrophic currents for the April 2022 glider section were
    also computed and are shown in Fig. 6b. The dynamic height anomaly was first calculated
    using binned conservative temperature and absolute salinity measured by the glider
    and smoothed using a 40 dbar moving window over depth and a 0.2∘ moving window
    over longitude. Geostrophic velocities relative to the surface were then estimated
    from the dynamic height, and the absolute geostrophic velocities were calculated
    by referencing the glider dive-averaged currents (depth-average current derived
    from the glider dead reckoning navigation and GPS fixes at the surface). The dynamic
    height and geostrophic velocity calculations were performed using the Gibbs Seawater
    Oceanographic toolbox57. Temperature and salinity contributions to stratification
    In order to quantify the contribution of extreme low salinity water to the stratification
    of the water column we use the stratification control index (SCI,32). $$SCI=\\frac{{N}_{\\theta
    }^{2}-{N}_{S}^{2}}{{N}_{\\theta }^{2}+{N}_{\\theta }^{2}},$$ (2) $${N}^{2}=-\\frac{g}{{\\rho
    }_{0}}\\frac{\\partial {\\rho }_{\\theta }}{\\partial z}={N}_{\\theta }^{2}+{N}_{S}^{2},$$
    (3) $${N}_{\\theta }^{2}=g\\alpha \\frac{\\partial \\theta }{\\partial z},$$ (4)
    $${N}_{S}^{2}=g\\beta \\frac{\\partial {S}_{A}}{\\partial z}$$ (5) With g being
    the gravitational acceleration as a function of latitude and pressure, α the thermal
    expansion coefficient of seawater and β the saline contraction coefficient of
    seawater (all calculating following57). Where SCI > = 1, the ocean is temperature
    stratified, where SCI < = −1, the ocean is salinity stratified. If -1 < SCI < 1,
    the ocean is stratified by both temperature and salinity, known as transition.
    We expect the mid-latitude waters considered here in to be transitional waters,
    but the strength and sign of SCI provides an indication of whether the water column
    is dominantly stratified by temperature or salinity. To quantify the SCI in the
    study region during normal conditions, we calculated a time-depth binned mean
    salinity transect using 8 glider missions. These 8 glider missions when combined
    consist of measurements mostly in September, November, and May in the years 2009,
    2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. These glider measurements were confined between 33.25
    and 33.75 ∘ S within waters shallower than 200 m at times when salinity was not
    extreme. Time-depth bin averages based on 75 data points or more were used for
    the transect. Data availability All data used in this study are freely available.

    Lakes and reservoirs are of critical importance to society, directly providing
    drinking water and supporting food production, sanitation, and transportation.
    Millions of people worldwide face intermittent clean water availability due to
    climatic and anthropogenic stressors1. Current literature suggests that changes
    in surface water quantity and quality are highly heterogeneous, and trends globally
    suggest that factors such as ice cover, air temperature, humidity, and lake surface
    area are likely interacting regionally to affect freshwater ecosystems in synergistic
    ways2,3,4,5,6,7. To gain a better understanding of the potential threats to freshwater
    ecosystems, new technologies must be engaged. Satellite-based Earth observations
    (hereafter “remote sensing”) are particularly useful as they can provide information
    at spatial and temporal scales that are currently impossible to replicate via
    ground-based observations. Although remote sensing’s usefulness to track changes
    in water quantity has enabled analyses of water availability from local-to-global
    scales8,9,10,11, investigations of water quality have historically been more limited
    in scale and scope. However, remote sensing now offers powerful approaches to
    assessing patterns and trends in water quality2,12,13,14,15, and data harmonization
    efforts allow for greater interoperability between in situ collections and remote
    sensing imagery16,17. Among studies of remotely sensed metrics of water quality,
    the majority have centered around specific constituents, such as secchi disk depth,
    chlorophyll, or suspended sediment, without necessarily offering holistic metrics
    of ecosystem productivity. Lake trophic state (LTS) is an example of a metric
    intended to provide holistic assessments of a lake’s aggregate physical (e.g.,
    light attenuation), chemical (e.g., nutrient concentrations), and biological processes
    (e.g., productivity). Broadly speaking, LTS is a property closely associated with
    a lake’s characteristic autochthonous and allochthonous productivity as well as
    water color18. Eutrophic lakes are green, oligotrophic lakes are blue, and dystrophic
    lakes are brown (Fig. 1). From color-trophic state connections, fundamental limnological
    principles center around linking trophic states to characteristic properties (Fig.
    1). For example, oligotrophic lakes are usually characterized by having lower
    phosphorus concentrations, low offshore but comparably higher nearshore productivity,
    and low colored dissolved organic matter (Fig. 1). In contrast, eutrophic lakes
    have higher phosphorus concentrations and higher phytoplankton biomass (Fig. 1).
    Fig. 1 Nutrient-Color Paradigm (NCP) scheme for classifying oligotrophic, eutrophic,
    dystrophic, and mixotrophic lakes. Schematic is adapted from Williamson et al.22
    and Webster et al.23, and characteristic lake descriptions broadly stem from results
    presented in Leech et al.24 and Oleksy et al.92 Within each NCP-quadrant, there
    are a suite of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that distinguish
    each type of lake: colored Dissolved Organic Matter (cDOM), primary production,
    cyanobacterial abundance, and higher order production. Lower cDOM concentrations
    (blue water drops) are characteristic in oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes. When
    cDOM is low, light can transmit through the water column more deeply, allowing
    for primary producers to undergo photosynthesis and zooplankton to consume primary
    producers (oligotrophic). When nutrients, such as phosphorus, are at higher concentrations
    and cDOM is low (eutrophic), primary production, cyanobacterial abundance, and
    higher order production can all increase, resulting in increased biomass. When
    cDOM concentrations are high (brown water drop) and nutrient concentrations are
    low (dystrophic), the increased light attenuation can result in decreased primary
    production, which can reciprocally cause decreased higher order production. Lastly,
    when nutrient and cDOM concentrations are both high (mixotrophic), primary production,
    cyanobacterial abundance, and higher order production can exceed values observed
    when solely cDOM or nutrient concentrations alone are higher. Phytoplankton and
    filled-in zooplankton cartoons were downloaded from the University of Maryland

    image In a management context, the language of LTS has historically been used
    to describe conditions relative to nutrient enrichment. For example, following
    the 1971 announcement of US Federal efforts to limit the use of phosphorus in
    detergents, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and state water
    resource management agencies launched a National Eutrophication Survey19. The
    survey assessed trophic state, defined as nutrient enrichment, of lakes influenced
    by wastewater treatment plants. In this case, LTS language was used to focus on
    and communicate about eutrophication, whereas dystrophication aspects of the framework
    were not as prominent. These language patterns likely carry over to contemporary
    uses. Because discussions may have focused on eutrophication in the past, modern
    tools and frameworks could be enhanced by remotely sensed water quality data that
    capture aspects of both eutrophication and dystrophication. For example, as climate
    changes, drinking water utility managers will increasingly face compounding hazards
    that could negatively impact lakes and reservoirs that supply hundreds of millions
    of people with drinking water20. Data and tools that provide remotely sensed information
    on LTS could improve the ability to observe multidecadal changes in water quality
    and save resources by better targeting field monitoring. Although LTS is often
    employed as a classification system for characterizing autotrophic production21,
    the Nutrient-Color Paradigm (NCP) is an empirically tested framework for discriminating
    LTS based off two variables: (1) phosphorus concentrations, a proxy for nutrient
    availability and primary productivity; and (2) colored dissolved organic matter
    or turbidity measured in platinum-cobalt units, both proxies for water transparency22,23,24.
    By combining characteristic metrics of a lake’s primary productivity and optical
    properties, the NCP presents a powerful system for discriminating LTS, where both
    autochthonous and allochthonous processes are considered. Leveraging the relationship
    between LTS, nutrient concentrations, and water clarity, it is possible to transform
    remotely sensed lake surface reflectance observations into meaningful limnological
    and ecosystem properties. Here, we present the first national-scale compendium
    of LTS that has been built from remotely sensed lake color (i.e., red, green,
    blue, and near-infrared surface reflectances). The dataset, referred to as LTS-US,
    is derived from (1) coordinated, continental-scale in situ measurements, where
    LTS has been documented for select lakes and years, and (2) characteristic Landsat
    surface reflectance values for each lake’s Chebyshev center (the point in a polygon
    furthest from the edge). Using in situ LTS, we can build predictive models to
    associate LTS with characteristic reflectance values, and then apply predictive
    models to lakes with unknown trophic states. Together, the dataset contains predictions
    for 55,662 lakes of at least 10 ha in area with annual estimates of LTS from 1984
    through 2020. By coupling satellite-based remote sensing with fundamental limnological
    principles, the LTS-US dataset provides the means to apply the NCP at the national
    scale to identify macroscale patterns and trends in LTS. Further, this approach
    moves beyond remote sensing of individual parameters to provide insights into
    lakes’ physical, chemical, biological, and ecosystem properties. Methods The LTS-US
    dataset is constructed using a four-part pipeline, as shown in Fig. 2: (1) aggregate
    training data, (2) create classification models, (3) apply predictions to lakes
    outside of the training data, and (4) assess model performance and prediction
    validity. Individual steps within the pipeline are described below. Fig. 2 Flowchart
    for data harmonization, modeling, and prediction steps of the LTS-US dataset pipeline.
    Steps shaped as a file-folder correspond to an intermediary data product, and
    rectangles correspond to an intermediary model. Data aggregation combines data
    from the U.S. EPA’s National Lakes Assessment, HydroLAKES, and LimnoSat-US to
    create a single, harmonized dataset of in situ lake trophic states with paired
    remotely sensed surface reflectances. Model training steps create multinomial
    logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and extreme gradient boosted regression
    tree models. Each fitted model is then applied to the entire LimnoSat-US data,
    where national-scale predictions are made for each modeling method. Probabilistic
    predictions are then averaged to create ensemble predictions of lake trophic state.
    Quality control steps (described in “Technical Validation”) use both the ensemble
    and individual model predictions to assess model performance. Each of these four
    components correspond to a piece of the overall data production pipeline: data
    aggregation functions are described in “1_aggregate”; model training functions
    are described in “2_train”; national-scale prediction functions are described
    in “3_predict”; quality control procedures are described in “4_qc”. Flowchart
    was designed with the “DiagrammeR” package93. Full size image Step 1: Identify
    Parent Datasets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Lakes Assessment
    In situ measurements of total phosphorus and true color were compiled from the
    U.S. EPA’s National Lakes Assessment (NLA)25,26,27,28,29, a synoptic sampling
    campaign of lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, hereafter collectively referred to as
    “lakes”, conducted in the contiguous U.S. every five years. Lakes used in this
    analysis were sampled in the summer (June-September) of 2007 (n = 1,028), 2012
    (n = 1,038), or 2017 (n = 1,005). Lakes were selected from the National Hydrography
    Dataset (NHD, https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset)
    using a randomized design stratified on aggregated Omernik level III ecoregion30
    and lake surface area. The minimum surface area for inclusion in the 2007 assessment
    was 4 ha but owing to increasing resolution in the NHD was reduced to 1 ha for
    the 2012 and 2017 assessments. Natural lakes and reservoirs were treated equally
    in the site selection process. To inform internal quality assurance within a campaign,
    10% of the lakes were sampled twice within a field season. Approximately 25% of
    lakes were targeted for resampling in multiple years to examine temporal change.
    State, Tribal, Federal, and contractor field crews evaluated lakes on site to
    ensure that selected lakes met criteria for inclusion in the field campaign (e.g.,
    lake ≥1 m deep). A wide set of measurements were collected at each sampled lake,
    but we only provide details on the variables used in this analysis. Additional
    details, protocols, and data are available online (https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/nla).
    Total phosphorus and true color were collected and processed in the 2007, 2012,
    and 2017 field campaigns25,26,28. In natural lakes, field crews sampled in a deep
    area of the lake regardless of whether the sample location was in the geometric
    center of the system. In reservoirs, field crews were asked to find a midpoint
    in the reservoir that was reasonably lentic, deep, and away from a dam. In lakes
    and reservoirs deeper than 50 m, field crews sampled from a location with a maximum
    depth of 50 m. Water was collected from 0–2 m using a vertical integrated water
    sampler. In lakes where the photic zone (2x Secchi depth) was <2 m, sampling was
    limited to the photic zone to prevent sampling of hypolimnetic water. All water
    samples were placed on ice and shipped overnight to the Willamette Research Station
    in Corvallis, Oregon for analysis. True color was estimated by visual comparison
    of filtered water samples to a calibrated glass color disk31. Total phosphorus
    concentrations were measured with manual alkaline persulfate digestion, followed
    by automated colorimetric analysis (ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium
    tartrate under acidic conditions, with absorbance at 880 nm) using a flow injection
    analyzer following standard method 4500-P-E32. Detailed descriptions of all water
    quality analyses are available in the NLA Laboratory Operations Manuals25,27,29.
    HydroLAKES HydroLAKES (v1.0)33 is a compendium of more than 1.4 million lake and
    reservoir shapefiles globally, with surface area of at least 10 ha. For an individual
    waterbody, HydroLAKES contains its spatial extent and location (using georeferenced
    polygons), a unique identifier (ranging from 1 to 1,427,688), and its morphological
    (area, mean depth, elevation, shoreline length etc.), hydrological (e.g., residence
    time, discharge, and watershed area), and geographical (e.g., name, country, continent)
    properties. HydroLAKES is a compilation of existing lake databases, with sources
    from government agencies (e.g., Natural Resources Canada, U.S. Geological Survey,
    European Environment Agency) and from remote sensing studies (for example, Shuttle
    Radar Topographic Mission Water Body Data, Global Lakes and Wetlands Database,
    and Global Reservoir and Dam Database). Most of the lake polygons are sourced
    from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Water Body Data for regions between
    60°S and 60°N34, supplemented by other datasets for higher latitudes and for underrepresented
    regions. More detailed information on the creation and validation of the HydroLAKES
    dataset can be found in Messager et al.33. LimnoSat The LimnoSat-US35 dataset
    comprises over 22 million remotely sensed observations of lake surface reflectance
    from 1984 to 2020. Observations cover 55,662 lakes greater than 10 ha33 aggregated
    from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 Collection 1 imagery. Each observation was calculated
    by taking the median surface reflectance within 120 meters of each lake’s Chebyshev
    center, defined as the point farthest from shore and usually located at the lake’s
    deepest point36. While many valid choices of buffer distance exist, LimnoSat-US
    employed a 120 m buffer to capture reflectances from a maximum of 64 Landsat pixels,
    which should prevent the values of a few pixels from influencing the mean. Further,
    extracting reflectance values from the Chebyshev center minimizes signals due
    to bottom reflectance and adjacent land pixels. For each Landsat observation,
    non-high confidence water pixels were masked using the Dynamic Surface Water Extent
    algorithm37. Observations were removed if the scene cloud cover was greater than
    75%, any snow, ice, cloud, cloud shadow38, or hillshadow was detected over the
    lake’s Chebyshev center, or if there were fewer than eight high confidence water
    pixels within the 120 meter buffer of the lake’s Chebyshev center. For certain
    lakes, these filters lead to extended periods (i.e., months to years) with limited
    observations (see Fig. 2 in Topp et al.2). Data in LimnoSat-US are presented in
    a tabular format, where each row reflects a Landsat overpass for a given waterbody,
    and columns include median Collection 1 surface reflectance values by band extracted
    from pixels within 120 m of the Chebyshev center, scene-wide cloud cover, date
    of imagery acquisition, and number of water pixels within 120 m of the Chebyshev
    center. Step 2: Define lake trophic state Many lakes across the United States
    are experiencing simultaneous changes in their water clarity, with some lakes
    getting greener due to eutrophication, and others getting browner from increasing
    terrestrially-derived organic matter, and some are simultaneously ‘greening’ and
    ‘browning’24. Given the need to discriminate between lakes that may be browning
    and/or greening, the Nutrient Color Paradigm (NCP) is a useful tool to assign
    LTS based on a lake’s characteristic color. The NCP was initially proposed in
    the early 20th century, emphasizing that both autochthonous and allochthonous
    processes are important to understanding LTS39,40,41. Specifically, water color
    often affects algal biomass and light transparency independent of nutrient availability.
    Rodhe42 first assembled the four quadrants of the NCP, placing autochthony on
    the horizontal axis and allochthony on the vertical axis. This second dimension
    distinguishes “oligotrophic” (low nutrient, low color) and “eutrophic” (high nutrient,
    low color) lakes from “dystrophic” (low nutrient, high color) and “mixotrophic”
    (high nutrient, high color) lakes. Although metrics such as Trophic State Index21
    gained popularity for providing instantaneous assessments of a lake’s autotrophic
    production, Williamson et al.22 encouraged a focus on NCP for lake classification
    given the importance of both nutrients and colored dissolved organic matter to
    lake structure and function. The NCP’s implementation is empirically supported
    by studies like Webster et al.23, where an analysis of ~1,600 temperate lakes
    in North America demonstrated that within lakes grouped by total phosphorus concentration
    (i.e., oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic), those with ‘browner’ color (indicative
    of dissolved organic matter) had higher volumetric chlorophyll-a concentrations
    and shallower Secchi disk depths. A similar pattern was observed by Nürnberg and
    Shaw43, which analyzed 600 lakes spanning a latitude of 39°S to 82°N. Here, we
    used the thresholds published in Webster et al.23 to classify lakes in the NLA
    dataset. Lakes were described as oligotrophic or ‘blue’ if total phosphorus concentration
    was less than 30 μg/L and true color was less than 20 platinum cobalt units (PCU),
    eutrophic or ‘green’ if total phosphorus was greater than 30 μg/L and true color
    was less than 20 PCU, dystrophic or ‘brown’ if total phosphorus was less than
    30 μg/L and true color was greater than 20 PCU, and mixotrophic or ‘murky’ if
    total phosphorus was greater than 30 μg/L and true color was greater than 20 PCU
    (Fig. 1). Thresholds for total phosphorus are based on long established and widely
    accepted ranges affecting primary productivity18. True color thresholds are derived
    from Nürnberg and Shaw43. Eutrophic and mixotrophic classifications were combined
    into a single grouping due to similar spectral characteristics (see Step 3). Notably,
    the NCP assumes that phosphorus is the limiting factor for primary production.
    While there are instances where nitrogen can be the limiting nutrient44,45, ecosystems
    with low concentrations of total phosphorus also tend to have low total nitrogen
    concentrations46. Step 3: Create a training dataset First, to create a dataset
    of lakes with in situ LTS measurements, we aggregated all total phosphorus and
    true color measurements from the U.S. EPA NLA 2007, 2012, and 2017 data (Figs.
    S1–3, Table S1). Although the NLA includes lakes smaller than 10 ha, we only used
    lakes of at least 10 ha in area for consistency with the HydroLAKES database.
    We then assessed the extent to which seasonal shifts in total phosphorus concentrations
    and true color values may alter interpretation of trophic state for a given lake
    using the subset of lakes that were sampled intra-annually. For lakes that were
    sampled multiple times within a U.S. EPA NLA campaign, we calculated the percentage
    of lakes that transitioned between trophic states within a single year and found
    that lakes broadly remained in the same NCP trophic state throughout a given summer
    (85.1% of lakes). Of the lakes that changed trophic state during a sampling season
    (14.9%), the majority transitioned from oligotrophic (61.5% of changing lakes;
    8.7% of all lakes) or dystrophic (15.4% of changing lakes; 2.2% of all lakes)
    to eutrophic/mixotrophic. Few lakes transitioned from oligotrophic to dystrophic
    (15.4% of changing lakes; 2.2% of all lakes), and even fewer transitioned to oligotrophic
    from either dystrophic (3.9% of changing lakes; 0.5% of all lakes) or eutrophic/mixotrophic
    (3.9% of changing lakes; 0.5% of all lakes). No lakes transitioned from eutrophic/mixotrophic
    to dystrophic across all three NLA campaigns. Broadly, lakes transitioned between
    trophic states when lakes were located near a threshold for trophic state delineation
    (15–45 μg/L total phosphorus or 11–29 PCU). These results mirror those in Leech
    et al.24 and suggest that despite some lakes changing trophic states within a
    summer, the majority of lakes do not transition and those that do transition usually
    fall along an edge of a NCP-determined trophic state. Thus, for lakes sampled
    twice in one sampling campaign, we averaged total phosphorus and true color estimates.
    Second, to match the in situ trophic states with remotely sensed imagery, we merged
    the complete 2007, 2012, and 2017 NLA dataset with the LimnoSat-US dataset35,
    where each NLA lake-year had corresponding Landsat spectral data. Because the
    NLA is designed to describe lakes’ summertime conditions, we filtered LimnoSat-US
    observances for those only occurring in June, July, and August, which we a priori
    defined as the summertime season for the contiguous U.S.; then, to create a characteristic
    reflectance for a given lake-year, we computed each lake-year’s median summertime
    reflectance for red, blue, green, and near-infrared bands. Because LimnoSat-US
    compiles reflectance values from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, there are differences in
    the number of images per lake and year. In particular, images from 1984 through
    1998 were solely collected from Landsat 5, when lakes averaged 3.04 images per
    summer (minimum average images: 2.43 images; maximum average images: 3.64 images).
    From 1999 through 2012, summertime imagery was gathered from Landsat 5 and 7,
    when lakes averaged 5.64 images per summer (minimum average images: 3.37 images;
    maximum average images: 6.42 images). From 2013 through 2019, summertime imagery
    was collected from Landsat 7 and 8, when lakes averaged 5.42 images per summer
    (minimum average images: 4.87 images; maximum average images: 5.87 images). Third,
    to better characterize spectral bands’ relative reflectance, we normalized each
    lake’s median summertime reflectance for the red, green, blue, and near-infrared
    band by the sum of the summertime reflectance values of all four bands. This normalization
    allowed us to differentiate lakes by trophic state based on their most prominent
    reflectances. For example, we anticipated that oligotrophic lakes would be dominated
    by high blue and green reflectances relative to the red and near-infrared bands.
    In contrast, dystrophic lakes would be dominated by the near-infrared band relative
    to green and red bands, because dystrophic lakes tend to have exceptionally low
    primary productivity and elevated dissolved organic matter. When assessing mixotrophic
    and eutrophic lakes, spectral characteristics were nearly identical, and to be
    conservative, we combined mixotrophic and eutrophic lakes into one category ‘eutrophic/mixotrophic’.
    These relative reflectances for all three lake trophic states were ultimately
    intended to discriminate among lakes that were optically similar in the visible
    spectrum (i.e., oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes). Notably, the decision to use
    median summertime relative reflectances differed from previous work2 that focused
    on the dominant wavelength, which is an aggregation of wavelengths detected in
    the visible spectrum and has been used to discriminate autotrophic production
    (i.e., blue vs green lakes), but not dystrophic states. Thus, our methods are
    better suited towards discriminating between oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes,
    because the dominant wavelength approach would consider both of these lake types
    to be “blue”. Step 4: Create classification models To find an optimal performing
    classifier for lakes with unknown LTS, we employed three classification methods
    to predict trophic state: multinomial logistic regression47, extreme gradient
    boosting regression48, and a neural network using multilayer perceptrons49. Logistic
    regression is a parametric classification method, whereas gradient boosted regression
    and multilayer perceptrons are machine learning methods. The methods differ in
    how they make classifications. Using trophic state as a categorical response variable,
    logistic regression applies a linear regression of log-odds ratios to model the
    probability of a given trophic state for each lake. In contrast, gradient boosted
    regression applies decision trees to iteratively improve its predictions. Multilayer
    perceptrons apply a type of feedforward artificial neural network in which a backpropagation
    algorithm is used to subsequently update the individual weights of each neuron
    unit by comparing modeled predictions to the training data. For each modeling
    method, we used z-scored, relative red, green, blue, and near-infrared reflectances
    as predictors. Model performance and potential for overfitting were assessed using
    a 90:10 train:test data split with spatial-holdout cross-validation. Initial hyperparameters
    for the gradient boosted regression and multilayer perceptron models were tuned
    by holding out 20% of each trophic class from the training observations to use
    for validation and conducting a coarse grid-search across the hyperparameter space.
    For each combination of hyperparameters, models were trained until validation
    performance did not increase for 20 consecutive epochs using categorical cross
    entropy as the objective function. During the multilayer perceptron hyperparameter
    tuning, we iterated through model fits using all combinations of 5, 10, and 20
    hidden layers as well as a learning rate of 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0005. Multilayer
    perceptron hyperparameter tuning metrics were optimal for models with 20 hidden
    units and a learning rate of 0.001. During the gradient boosted regression hyperparameter
    tuning, we iterated through model fits using all combinations of 2, 3, and 4 maximum
    tree depths, subsample as well as column samples of 0.5 and 0.8, step sizes of
    0.01 and 0.1, as well as a minimum child weight of 1 and 3. Gradient boosted regression
    hyperparameter tuning metrics were optimal for models with a max depth of 4, subsample
    of 0.5, column sample of 0.5, step size of 0.01, and minimum child weight of 1.
    For both multilayer perceptron and gradient boosted regression models, best performing
    hyperparameter tuning metrics were assessed by having lowest validation loss values.
    These hyperparameters were then used in a spatial cross-validation routine50,
    where a given lake was held out as test data if it was included in the training
    data. During the spatial cross-validation routine, training data were divided
    into five folds, such that lakes within each test partition were not present in
    remaining training partitions (i.e., test metrics represent performance on unseen
    lakes). Training data within each fold were then partitioned into a 90:10 split
    with 10% of each trophic class set aside for an inner-loop fold validation. Models
    within each fold were trained using an early stopping criterion of 20 epochs to
    avoid overfitting on the training data. This inner-fold validation was additionally
    used to hypertune the best number of epochs for the final models. Finally, overall
    error metrics were calculated based on the mean prediction accuracy of the test
    partitions withheld from the inner-loop training of each fold. All reported metrics
    are based on the test partitions from the spatial cross-validation routine while
    final models were trained on the full dataset using the hyperparameters identified
    from the grid-search and inner-loop validation routines. We applied the final
    models to make predictions for all 55,662 lakes in the LimnoSat-US dataset. Step
    5: Assess and compare model performance To evaluate the final fitted models, we
    used test data predictions from the spatial-holdout routine to calculate each
    model’s overall and balanced accuracy, receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC)
    curves, as well as the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve. Overall accuracy
    was calculated as the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the
    total number of LTS predictions. Balanced accuracy was calculated as the sum of
    a true positive and true negative results for a single lake trophic state. Whereas
    overall accuracy can be biased towards more prevalent trophic states (i.e., eutrophic
    and oligotrophic lakes), balanced accuracy is useful to assess a model’s capacity
    to predict more rare trophic states (i.e., dystrophic lakes). As an additional
    metric of model performance, we calculated the AUC of each model’s ROC curve.
    The ROC curve visually graphs the relationship between the rate of a correct classification
    with the rate of a false classification. An AUC of 0.5 indicates a false prediction
    rate increases 1:1 with the rate of a correct prediction. AUCs greater than 0.5
    imply a model performing better than random, even when a false positive rate is
    artificially inflated. Thus, comparing overall and balanced accuracy as well as
    ROC curves and AUCs allowed us to assess how models performed broadly as well
    as how robustly models predicted trophic state correctly. Beyond model performance,
    we also evaluated whether model coefficients and variable importance for trophic
    state discrimination reflected NCP groupings. For increased interpretability across
    all three models, we employed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) analysis51,52,53
    to better understand individual feature importance and influence in model predictions.
    SHAP analysis yields insight into the marginal contribution of a given feature
    (e.g., near-infrared spectra) on model output - in this case trophic state - and
    helps decode ‘black box’ results. Understanding the relative contribution of individual
    features in trophic state prediction not only helps explain feature roles in model
    accuracy and misclassification but also quantitatively connects features, such
    as remotely sensed data, to the biophysical parameters in which LTS prediction
    is grounded. SHAP feature contribution was calculated for blue, green, red, and
    near-infrared Landsat spectra. SHAP feature contribution was scored for oligotrophic,
    dystrophic, and eutrophic/mixotrophic classifications and across each of the three
    models. This scoring illuminates the relationship among feature values and SHAP
    contribution for a given trophic state classification and for a given model. Specifically,
    for classification problems, a positive SHAP value indicates that a given input
    contributed to a positive classification and a negative value indicates the input
    contributed to a low probability for a given classification. Data Records The
    LTS-US dataset54 is available at the Environmental Data Initiative (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/212a3172ac36e8dc6e1862f9c2522fa4)
    and is structured in a tabular format, where each row is a lake-year combination.
    The main dataset is contained in “ensemble_predictions.csv” and is structured
    in a way that provides both categorical LTS predictions as well as probabilities
    for each LTS prediction. The probabilities reported in “ensemble_predictions.csv”
    are averaged probabilities generated from each of the three modeling methodologies.
    An additional tabular dataset (“individual_predictions.csv”) contains probabilities
    generated for each of the three modeling methodologies and can be merged with
    “ensemble_predictions.csv” by the “Hylak_id” and “year” columns. We provide raw
    and average predicted LTS probabilities as well as variance among models for a
    given LTS prediction to allow future users to filter predictions of a certain
    threshold for their particular analysis. Although many thresholds may exist, reporting
    probability thresholds used in subsequent analyses will help maintain reproducibility
    and synthesis across studies. Below, we detail column names and metadata for each

    Technical Validation Model performance diagnostics To assess how each model correctly
    classified training data, we compared the model accuracies, balanced accuracies,
    and AUC of ROC curves. Overall and balanced model accuracies were similar, where
    all models had accuracies ranging from 72.4 to 72.9% and balanced accuracies ranging
    from 69.9 to 71.5%. AUCs of ROCs were likewise similar across all three model
    techniques, ranging from 0.88 to 0.90 (Figure S4). These combined metrics suggest
    that all three modeling approaches performed similarly, when assessing model performance
    with global metrics. Although models performed similarly at high levels, they
    varied more in their robustness to classify dystrophic lakes (Fig. 3). Machine
    learning-based methods, such as multilayer perceptron (60%) and gradient boosted
    regression (58%), had higher balanced accuracies, whereas distribution-based methods,
    such as logistic regression (55%), had lower balanced accuracies. These differences
    were largely driven by deviations in true positive rates (47.5–50.6%), whereas
    true negative rates were higher (91.8–92.7%). This difference in true negative
    and true positive rates is likely due to spectral similarities between oligotrophic
    and dystrophic lakes, where both are characterized by low primary production in
    comparison to eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes. Although these differences only span
    5%, they may be important, given that dystrophic lakes tend to be uncommon relative
    to oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes23. Such differences imply variation in each
    model’s robustness to predict rarer trophic states, but our overall metrics of
    model performance highlight exceptional congruence across all three modeling techniques.

    generated using the test partitions for each spatial-holdout cross-validation.
    Circle size is scaled by the number of lakes falling within each category. Trophic
    states for model predictions and reference data correspond to the acronyms “dys”
    for “dystrophic”, “eu/mixo” for “eutrophic/mixotrophic”, and “oligo” for “oligotrophic”.
    Model acronyms are located as the title for each confusion matrix, where “MLP”
    signifies “Multilayer Perceptron”, “XGB” signifies “Gradient Boosted Regression”,
    and “Logit” signifies “Multinomial Logistic Regression”. Full size image Spatial
    patterns in lake classification To evaluate spatio-temporal patterns in trophic
    state classification, we created spatial confusion matrices, where predictions
    and reference sites were plotted across the entire United States. We a priori
    hypothesized that when misclassifications result from lake-specific deviations,
    misclassifications should be distributed throughout the United States without
    any clear spatial patterns. In the event that spatial clustering of misclassified
    lakes occurred, these patterns should be more pronounced where high densities
    of a given lake trophic state are located. In cases when lake clustering appears
    in an unexpected area, these patterns should be more attributed to place-based
    irregularities in spectral data. Confusion between oligotrophic and eutrophic/mixotrophic
    lakes were spatially distributed throughout the entire continental United States,
    with no evidence of spatial clustering (Figures S5–S7). In contrast, dystrophic
    misclassifications were broadly isolated to the Upper Midwest and Upper Northeast
    regions. Consistent with our hypotheses, these regions are associated with increased
    densities of dystrophic lakes, suggesting that optical similarities between oligotrophic
    and dystrophic lakes in these regions may lead to increased misclassification.
    Notably, dystrophic lakes tended to be misclassified as oligotrophic, whereas
    oligotrophic lakes tended to not be misclassified as dystrophic, meaning that
    our predictions should be conservative with assigning an individual lake as dystrophic.
    Assessing patterns in lake classification Given that lake trophic state classifications
    may be a product of a lake’s limnological, morphological, and geographic properties,
    we performed a series of analyses of variance (ANOVA) to test for significant
    differences (i.e., p-value < 0.05) in lake classification accuracy. For each ANOVA,
    a lake property was the response variable, and predictors were lake trophic state,
    model correctness (i.e., correct or incorrect classification), and model type.
    All response variables were log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution.
    Because each analysis had an unbalanced sample size, we calculated Type II Sum-of-Squares55.
    Residuals for each model were assessed for normality and homogeneity of variance.
    The main goal of each ANOVA was to assess whether variation in a lake parameter
    could be associated with variation in model methodologies, model correctness,
    or trophic states themselves. Consequently, our ANOVAs do not include interaction
    terms, as most interactions would not be helpful for understanding patterns in
    how our classification models performed. NCP patterns in lake classification To
    assess how a lake’s misclassification may be related to its position in the NCP,
    we assessed where correctly and incorrectly classified lakes were located in the
    NCP. Lakes that were incorrectly classified tended to be located near total phosphorus
    (30 ± 15 μg/L) and color (20 ± 9 PCU) thresholds, with a large portion at the
    nexus of the total phosphorus and color thresholds (Fig. 4). Across all modeling
    techniques, correctly classified lakes spanned a wider range across both axes,
    especially total phosphorus. Median total phosphorus concentration for misclassified
    lakes was 24 μg/L (range: 1–4,772 μg/L), whereas median total phosphorus concentration
    for correctly classified lakes was 36 μg/L (range: 0.24–4,144 μg/L). Similarly,
    median PCU for correctly (14 PCU; range: 0–724 PCU) and incorrectly (16 PCU; range:
    0–350 PCU) classified lakes were along the edge of the color threshold of 20 PCU.
    When assessing total phosphorus and color independently, ANOVA suggested that
    total phosphorus concentrations were significantly different for correctly and
    incorrectly classified lakes, whereas differences in color were not significantly
    different across correctly and incorrectly classified lakes (Table 1; Fig. 5).
    Fig. 4 True and false classifications from testing data displayed on the NCP axes.
    Hexbins are colored by the number of lakes they contain. Labels reflect the percentage
    of lakes correctly or incorrectly predicted within a given modeling technique.
    Incorrect LTS predictions tend to be located at the nexus of trophic state groupings.
    Correct predictions tend to more accurately reflect the breadth of ranges that
    can be observed within each of the LTS groupings. Full size image Table 1 ANOVA

    total phosphorus (a) and true color (b) values as well as absolute differences
    from NCP thresholds for total phosphorus (c) and true color (d) among correctly
    (i.e., True; orange) and incorrectly (i.e., False; purple) classified trophic
    states. Because misclassifications appeared to increase in frequency near threshold
    values for trophic state classification, we also assessed classification accuracies
    across absolute differences for each variable and threshold value. Across all
    models, we noticed that misclassifications tended to be highest near NCP thresholds
    for total phosphorus and color. Total phosphorus concentrations of 15–45 μg/L
    tended to be associated with false classifications. True color concentrations
    of 11–29 PCU tended to be associated with a false classification. Full size image
    Beyond total phosphorus and color patterns influencing lake classification, our
    analyses of lakes that transitioned trophic states within a summer suggest that
    lakes along a NCP boundary (i.e., near total phosphorus or color threshold) are
    more prone to misclassification. Among lakes that transitioned within a summer,
    the most frequent change in lake trophic state was among lakes switching from
    oligotrophic to eutrophic (61.5% of NLA lakes that changed in a summer; 8.7% of
    all NLA lakes). Considering that both total phosphorus concentrations as well
    as summertime lake phenologies are associated with algal production and can cause
    a lake to transition categories within a summer, our results of NCP patterns are
    not surprising. Rather, confusion along the total phosphorus axis of the NCP,
    an axis that corresponds with autotrophic productivity, is concordant with the
    idea that a lake can experience moments of eutrophy - e.g., a pulse of nutrients
    or algal growth - while otherwise being oligotrophic for the majority of the summer.
    Therefore, classifications made for lakes at the boundary of trophic states can
    be challenging, and our validation analyses describe total phosphorus and color
    conditions where misclassifications may be more common. Morphological and locational
    patterns in lake classification At the spatial resolution of Landsat’s sensors,
    there is a risk of “mixed pixels”, where a pixel includes water with fractions
    of adjacent bare land or vegetation. Given the difference in optical contrast
    between water and other features, even minor differences can lead to large errors
    in estimating surface reflectance. A major source of uncertainty in lake optical
    water quality estimation is the separation of water and atmospheric effects56.
    The latter increases in severity near land, and this adjacency effect can extend
    several kilometers, depending on the state of the atmosphere. Before assessing
    how edge and lakebed effects may influence model classifications, we first ensured
    that spectral differences between each trophic state in our dataset were greater
    than differences within a trophic state when accounting for lake area, depth,
    and shape. To evaluate how edge and lakebed effects may be present within our
    training and test data, we used lake area, average depth, and shoreline development
    (a metric of how closely a lake’s shape resembles a circle) data from HydroLAKES33
    as well as maximum depth from the GLOBathy dataset57. While evaluating lake area,
    we noticed that smaller lakes tended to have higher near-infrared relative reflectance
    values, and relative near-infrared reflectance generally decreased with increasing
    lake area (Figures S8–S10). Because LimnoSat-US aggregates reflectance data at
    the lake’s Chebyshev center, the point in the lake farthest away from shore, smaller
    lakes would likely have Chebyshev centers that are closer to the shoreline. As
    terrestrial near-infrared reflectances tend to be higher than aquatic near-infrared
    reflectances, smaller lakes with Chebyshev centers closer to the shoreline may
    be associated with increased near-infrared signatures. Similarly, relative blue
    reflectance increased with increasing lake surface area, which would likewise
    be expected, as larger lakes likely have a Chebyshev center that is farther from
    shore, and therefore, less influenced by shoreline effects. With respect to lakebed
    effects, the shallowest lakes tended to have slightly elevated relative green
    reflectance, which would be consistent with increased primary production. Across
    all trophic states, lakes with average depths of 1–10 m were also associated with
    increased relative near-infrared reflectance, suggesting that these lakes may
    have the highest near-infrared reflectance due to reflectance signatures of lakebed
    substrate or increased benthic algal production. To evaluate how models might
    misclassify lakes in response to morphological, geographic, and biological characteristics,
    we examined how lake depth, elevation, surface area, shoreline development, and
    mean chlorophyll concentration may correspond to correct and incorrect classifications.
    Average and maximum lake depth can be used to evaluate a lake’s potential for
    lakebed effects, where reflectance from benthic algae, emergent vegetation, or
    sediment may confound signals for the actual surface of the lake. Assessing classification
    differences across elevation ranges can be important for understanding atmospheric
    effects on reflectance data, where higher elevations may have fewer aerosols,
    and therefore contain fewer misclassifications. Examining misclassifications across
    lake sizes can reveal potential for adjacency effects, where surrounding geologies
    or vegetation may obscure surface reflectances observed over the lake. Shoreline
    development can likewise reveal adjacency effects, where lakes with more complex
    shapes but with large areas may be prone to misclassification. Lastly, chlorophyll
    a concentrations can inform that our models are capturing patterns expected through
    how we operationally defined LTS, where higher chlorophyll concentrations should
    be observed in eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes relative to dystrophic and oligotrophic
    lakes. ANOVA results suggested that average depth, chlorophyll a, maximum depth,
    shoreline development, and elevation differed significantly across correct and
    incorrect misclassifications (Table 2), although differences based on average
    and maximum depth as well as chlorophyll a were more visually apparent than those
    observed for elevation and shoreline development (Fig. 6). In contrast, lake area
    did not differ significantly across correct and incorrect classifications (Table
    2). Table 2 ANOVA table for lake morphological and locational properties in response
    to model type, model correctness, and trophic state. Full size table Fig. 6 Density
    distributions for each lake’s average depth, mean summertime chlorophyll a concentration,
    elevation, area, maximum depth, and shoreline development values across true (orange)
    and false (purple) classifications. Values are log-transformed to show characteristic
    density distributions over a wide range in value magnitudes. In general, patterns
    across true and false classifications were consistent across all three types of
    models. Depth was a primary characteristic for misclassified oligotrophic and
    eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes, where shallower oligotrophic and deeper eutrophic/mixotrophic
    lakes tended to be misclassified. Full size image Together, these analyses suggest
    that lakebed reflectance may lead to lake trophic state misclassification, whereas
    edge effects are likely less consequential for inaccurate lake trophic state classifications.
    In particular, shallower oligotrophic lakes (i.e., average depth <5 m and maximum
    depth <15 m; Fig. 6) and deeper eutrophic lakes (i.e., average depth >5 m and
    maximum depth >15 m; Fig. 6) tended to be misclassified. We speculate that these
    differences may stem from shallower, oligotrophic lakes having pronounced benthic
    algal growth58 or emergent macrophytes that can produce a strong green signal.
    Conversely, deeper eutrophic lakes may have less concentrated algal growth in
    the water column, thereby creating a stronger blue reflectance relative to green
    reflectance and increasing chances for misclassification (see Optical patterns
    in lake classification). These differences may also be related to chlorophyll
    a concentration, where oligotrophic lakes with higher concentrations tended to
    be classified as eutrophic/mixotrophic, and eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes with lower
    concentrations tended to be misclassified as oligotrophic (Fig. 6). Overall, these
    results correspond with our NCP validation analyses, where total phosphorus concentrations
    were associated with greater misclassifications of oligotrophic lakes as eutrophic.
    Given the potential for lakes to be misclassified because of issues with lakebed
    reflectance, considering whether depth could alter results and building analytical
    workflows to assess sensitivity to interference from lakebed reflectance (see
    SHAP Analysis for more detail) could improve model lake classifications. Optical
    patterns in lake classification To evaluate how models might misclassify lakes
    based on reflectance values, we assessed how z-scored relative red, green, blue,
    and near-infrared reflectance values differed between correctly and incorrectly
    predicted lake trophic state. Because we used relative reflectances that are inherently
    interdependent, and thus violate ANOVA assumptions, we elected to forgo significance
    tests for whether band ranges differed across modeling methods. For dystrophic
    lakes, incorrectly classified lakes, compared to correctly classified lakes, tended
    to have lower z-scored near-infrared and blue band values as well as higher green
    and red values (Fig. 7). For eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes, misclassified lakes
    tended to have lower values for red and green bands as well as higher values for
    blue bands (Fig. 7). For oligotrophic lakes, incorrectly classified lakes tended
    to have higher red and lower blue band values (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Density distributions
    for each Landsat band’s z-scored, relative reflectance value across true (orange)
    and false (purple) classifications. In general, patterns across true and false
    classifications were consistent across all three types of models. Oligotrophic
    lakes tended to be misclassified when red bands were high and blue bands were
    low. Conversely, eutrophic/mixotrophic lakes tended to be misclassified when blue
    bands were high, and red bands were low. Dystrophic lakes tended to be misclassified
    when near infra-red bands were low and when green bands were high. Full size image
    These inconsistencies in LTS classification correspond with variation that can
    be present in natural systems. Dystrophic lakes are generally characterized as
    having low primary productivity and high dissolved organic matter, which should
    result in low green band values as well as higher near-infrared values, yet misclassified
    dystrophic lakes tended to have low near-infrared as well as high red and green
    bands. Eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes are generally characterized as having high
    productivity, which should result in high green values, yet misclassified eutrophic
    and mixotrophic lakes tended to have low green and red as well as high blue bands.
    Oligotrophic lakes should be characterized as having high blue bands, yet misclassified
    lakes tended to have low blue and high red bands, which may be a product of bottom
    reflectance. Together, these misclassifications likely represent lakes that are
    not characteristic of LTS classifications. For example, a more productive oligotrophic
    lake could produce a stronger red and green signature and, therefore, be classified
    as eutrophic. Likewise, less productive eutrophic lakes may be optically more
    similar to oligotrophic lakes and, therefore, be characterized by lower red and
    green bands. SHAP Analysis To evaluate the influence of remote sensing reflectance
    inputs on final predictions, we assessed the distribution of SHAP values calculated
    for each predictor and for each trophic state. In general, SHAP values can be
    useful for decoding how machine learning and parametric methods may assign relative
    importance to a given predictor, thereby increasing interpretability of a model.
    In an instance where models are classifying lakes based on a priori hypothesized
    relationships, SHAP values across predictors should correspond to the a priori
    hypothesized relationships. For example, oligotrophic lakes are generally characterized
    as having high blue reflectance relative to red and green, and in a case where
    models reflect this understanding, SHAP values should attribute an oligotrophic
    classification to high values in the relative blue reflectance. Consistently high
    attributions for blue reflectances should subsequently result in high overall
    feature importance when discriminating oligotrophic lakes. When evaluating feature
    importance across trophic states, measured as the mean absolute SHAP value of
    a given feature, all models agreed on the most influential features for classification
    (Figure S11). Furthermore, the distribution of SHAP values reflected limnological
    understanding of each trophic state’s inherent properties. For dystrophic lakes,
    SHAP values indicate that models relied on low green and high near-infrared and
    red band values, corroborating the idea that dystrophic lakes should have lower
    primary production and increased cDOM22,59 (Figure S11). Predictions for eutrophic
    and mixotrophic lakes were attributed to high red and low blue band values, corresponding
    with the idea that eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes should have higher algal production24
    (Figure S11). Conversely, SHAP values for oligotrophic lakes attributed predictions
    to low red and high blue band values, agreeing with the idea that oligotrophic
    lakes should have lower algal production24 (Figure S11). Beyond each individual
    trophic state’s most important predictors, our SHAP analysis mirrored the logic
    of NCP analyses, where lakes with lower true color values (i.e., oligotrophic
    and eutrophic) were discriminated more effectively by bands associated with autotrophic
    capacity, whereas lakes with higher true color values (i.e., dystrophic) were
    discriminated more effectively by bands suggesting decreased autotrophic production
    and increased colored dissolved organic matter. SHAP values can also provide insight
    on what drives models to misclassify certain lakes. Specifically, when examining
    smaller, shallower oligotrophic lakes that could potentially be influenced by
    bottom reflectance or adjacency effects, we observed that some misclassifications
    were attributable to models relying on low relative blue reflectance and high
    relative near-infrared reflectance (Figures S12–S23). These patterns indicate
    that in certain lakes, the models were unable to distinguish the spectral signatures
    that are potentially attributable to sediment or benthic algae as well as shoreline
    vegetation and soil. The spectral similarity between shallow oligotrophic and
    deep eutrophic lakes is relevant to active research trajectories in limnology,
    particularly those examining the relatively high contributions of benthic algal
    communities to whole lake productivity in oligotrophic lakes58,60,61,62,63,64.
    Given the potential for lakebed effects to alter classifications, research questions
    could consider the influence of depth-related misclassifications. Comparing predicted
    and NLA spatial patterns To independently validate the LTS-US dataset’s robustness
    in capturing macroscale and multi-year changes in lake trophic state, we replicated
    analyses similar to Leech et al.24 and compared statistics from the NLA with those
    from the LTS-US dataset. We first merged the lake trophic state classifications
    from the 2007, 2012, and 2017 NLA campaigns as well as the LTS-US dataset with
    the U.S. EPA Level I Ecoregions30. We then calculated the proportion of each trophic
    state occurring within each ecoregion in a given year. To compare the NLA and
    the LTS-US dataset, we calculated the absolute difference between predicted and
    estimated proportions for each trophic state within each year and ecoregion. Predicted
    and measured proportions were broadly consistent across all three years. Visually,
    all three years and trophic states followed consistent trends across all ecoregions
    (Fig. 8). For example, our models generally captured increasing dystrophic and
    decreasing oligotrophic lakes in northern forested regions, a pattern consistent
    with Leech et al.24. Absolute differences between estimated and predicted proportions
    across ecoregions were likewise congruent across all three years. Eutrophic/mixotrophic
    lakes tended to have the smallest differences (mean = −5.3%, sd = 19%), indicating
    that our models may overestimate relative abundance of eutrophic and mixotrophic
    lakes (Figure S24). In contrast, dystrophic (mean = 7.0%, sd = 6.7%) and oligotrophic
    (mean = 7.6%, sd = 22.4%) relative abundance tended to be underestimated (Figure
    S24). Larger standard deviation values were caused by some ecoregions having few
    lakes overall, thereby increasing proportions of a given trophic state within
    an ecoregion. When filtering for ecoregions that contained at least 10 lakes,
    we noticed similar patterns of eutrophic and mixotrophic lakes being slightly
    overestimated (mean = −7.9%, sd = 11.3%), as well as dystrophic (mean = 9.1%,
    sd = 6.7%) and oligotrophic (mean = 4.6%, sd = 13.8%) lakes being underestimated;
    yet the standard deviation in absolute differences decreased. Fig. 8 National-scale
    maps of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Level I Ecoregions colored by proportion
    of lakes occurring in that ecoregion. For each trophic state, we compare estimated
    trophic state relative abundance from the NLA with predicted proportions from
    the ensemble LTS-US dataset. Full size image Together, these analyses demonstrate
    that though the LTS-US dataset does contain biases towards eutrophic/mixotrophic
    classification, its overall congruence with the NLA highlights its robustness.
    These biases may stem from our models attempting to classify lake ecosystem properties
    based on optically visible (i.e., color) and optically invisible (i.e., phosphorus)
    properties, where the exceptionally oligotrophic, dystrophic, and eutrophic/mixotrophic
    lakes are more consistently discriminated. In contrast, the NLA may likewise contain
    biases due to site selection, whereas our methods select for all lakes of at least
    10 ha in area. Regardless of the biases in the LTS-US and NLA datasets, the congruence
    between the two is even more notable considering that our modeling approaches
    and the NLA use independent methods for classifying lake trophic state. The NLA
    uses in situ total phosphorus and true color measurements, whereas our methods
    use lake red, green, blue, and near-infrared reflectance. Furthermore, despite
    not including temporal or spatial predictors, our models reproduce NLA spatial
    and temporal trends in lake trophic state at larger spatial and temporal scales.
    Given both the potential biases and robustness of the LTS-US data product, cross-referencing
    the LTS-US dataset with known trends in an area of interest, especially in areas
    where lakes may be less abundant, could enhance regional and local analyses. In
    instances where the LTS-US dataset may be more biased, reproducing the LTS-US
    dataset using both our existing code and particular predictors of interest for
    a region, such as average depth, lake area, or watershed area could offer particular
    insights into why a given region may be more prone to misclassifications. Creating
    tailored versions of the core LTS-US dataset can promote further understanding
    of features that may be important for assessing lake trophic state with remotely
    sensed surface reflectance data. Manual quality control To ensure integrity of
    lake classifications across all steps of our pipeline, we randomly subsampled
    250 lakes from the final dataset and manually cross-referenced their predicted
    trophic state with independent sources. The random subsample only included lakes
    that had associated names in the HydroLAKES dataset and was stratified by lake
    surface area, where surface areas were binned by orders of magnitude (i.e., <1 km2,
    (1, 10] km2, (10, 100] km2, (100, 1,000] km2, (1,000, 10,000] km2, >10,000 km2).
    We filtered specifically for lakes with names because we assumed that named lakes
    within the HydroLAKES database would likely have more publicly available information
    about their water quality and would likely be easier to find within managerial
    reports and scientific publications. To minimize bias, persons engaged in manual
    checking only received lake latitude and longitude, name, and the U.S. state where
    the lake was located. All persons engaged in manual checking were not involved
    in model and prediction development and were, therefore, blind to individual lake
    predictions. When possible, persons identified trophic states for multiple years,
    although many sources only referenced a lake’s trophic state in an individual
    year or broadly across multiple years. In either case, LTS was reported for the
    lake and years that independent sources reported. Of the 250 target lakes, we
    were able to find verified trophic state data on 93 lakes (38%). For the 93 lakes
    that had independent lake trophic state data, our models corroborated independent,
    in situ observations 74% of the time, which is consistent with our models’ overall
    accuracy against testing data from the U.S. EPA NLA. We did not observe any apparent
    spatial patterns with model misclassification, which complements our spatial confusion
    validation (Figure S25). Together, these results demonstrate that our manual checking
    procedure returned similar results as our evaluation procedures against our testing
    data, giving confidence that our modeling pipeline and evaluation procedures are
    both robust and able to capture natural processes occurring in lakes. Effects
    of processor heterogeneity When recreating lake trophic state predictions de novo,
    care should be taken to ensure that effects from heterogeneous processors are
    minimized. When creating the LTS-US dataset from the original LimnoSat-US dataset35,
    we specified seeds for each modeling framework, which enabled us to reproduce
    results between model runs. Final dataset production occurred on one machine using
    an Intel(R) Xeon(R) W-10885M processor with eight cores, however, slight differences
    may arise due to differences in a user’s hardware float precision. If users recreate
    or update LimnoSat-US prior to recreation of the LTS-US predictions, care should
    be taken as Google Earth Engine65 uses a heterogeneous processor framework, where
    individual processors cannot currently be specified. Meyer et al.9 quantified
    the effect of Google Earth Engine’s processor heterogeneity on various lake surface
    area and basin-level climatological estimations, and effects of processor heterogeneity
    were likely inconsequential (e.g., differences of 10−12), although these differences
    may result in slightly different trophic state predictions. The extent to which
    these values would influence results or conclusions of other studies will depend
    on the level of precision required and scope of research question. Usage Notes
    The LTS-US dataset was constructed to be an accessible and interoperable product
    for a range of basic and applied research questions related to water quality and
    ecological integrity at national scales. Here, we detail several options for application
    of the LTS-US dataset and associated pipeline. First, the LTS-US dataset can be
    joined with water quantity and quality datasets to assess how changes in LTS,
    and therefore ecosystem integrity, may be influenced by watershed processes, climate,
    and human population. At the local scale, the LTS-US dataset can be merged with
    in situ sampling data or modeled data from individual lakes to assess how hydrodynamic,
    climatic, physicochemical, and biological processes may be associated with interannual
    variation in LTS. As demonstrated here, local in situ observations are important
    for providing validation of the LTS data, and potentially, refinement of methods
    for deriving LTS predictions. Similarly, the LTS-US dataset can be merged with
    data from research coordination networks, such as the National Ecological Observatory
    Network (www.neonscience.org) or the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network66,
    to enable upscaling highly localized processes to regional and national scales.
    Beyond watershed-specific processes, the LTS-US dataset can likewise be useful
    for synthetic questions focused on macroscale water quality trends. For example,
    in cases where users may wish to synthesize changes in lake ecosystem metabolism
    with trends in lake water quantity, climate, and human population, the LTS-US
    dataset can be merged with the GLCP (Global Lake area, Climate, and Population)9
    or LakeATLAS67, thereby enabling users to assess how changes in seasonal and permanent
    lake surface area may correlate with changes in lake trophic state. The LTS-US
    dataset offers a valuable resource for addressing a broad spectrum of basic and
    applied research questions from local and regional to continental scales. Second,
    the LTS-US dataset provides a tool for using remote sensing products with the
    NCP, a framework increasingly used by limnologists, to understand lake water quality
    at macroscales. Although previous studies have remotely sensed lake trophic state
    index68, our data product is the first to incorporate NCP with remote sensing
    reflectance data. Where TSI focuses exclusively on eutrophication patterns (also
    known as greening) associated with nutrient-driven primary production, the LTS-US
    dataset enables investigations of the spatial extent and temporal trends of lake
    dystrophication (also known as lake browning). This difference between TSI and
    NCP is important for assessing long term and spatially extensive changes in lake
    browning, as well as “murkification” (i.e. simultaneous browning and greening),
    which has been associated with complex, often non-linear changes in temperature,
    pH, dissolved oxygen, and food web structure24,59. Further, national-scale sampling
    campaigns, such as the U.S. EPA NLA, have helped reveal that the proportion of
    dystrophic lakes has been increasing nationally since 200724. The U.S. EPA NLA
    is one of the most extensive, structured, and coordinated lake sampling efforts
    at the national scale, and the LTS-US dataset can complement these in situ data
    by providing finer temporal information at comparable spatial scales. When data
    from successive NLA sampling campaigns become available, the LTS-US dataset can
    be updated and further benefit from additional training data. Together, the use
    of remote sensing imagery with extensive sampling campaigns, like the NLA, can
    be useful for identifying broadscale changes in water quality. Third, although
    our reflectance data are spatially aggregated to represent each lake’s characteristic
    summertime reflectances, our data pipeline and modeling frameworks are amenable
    to numerous data aggregations, thereby enabling investigation of lakes’ intra-
    and inter-annual phenologies. For example, many oligotrophic lakes experience
    summertime greening, due to increased algal growth throughout the summer. Although
    algal succession tends to follow similar temporal and community compositional
    patterns69,70, users may be interested in understanding how greening events may
    shift temporally in response to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances. Similarly,
    end users may be interested in understanding intra-lake heterogeneities, where
    embayments or nearshore areas may differ in trophic state from the offshore. In
    both cases, users could adapt our data, modeling, and validation pipeline, where
    temporal and spatial resolution are more finely resolved. Operationally, end users
    could modify the aggregation scripts (“1_aggregate.R” and “aggregate_utils.R”)54
    and LimnoSat codes35 to accommodate input data that aggregate at monthly or fortnightly
    timesteps as well as on a per-pixel basis or with varying radii lengths from the
    Chebyshev center. Because our data pipeline allows for automated re-running of
    all harmonization, modeling, and quality control routines, users are able to build
    off the existing infrastructure to tailor the LTS-US dataset to their particular
    research questions without high computational overhead or the need to build new
    workflows de novo. Beyond any specific research question, the LTS-US dataset is
    a streamlined resource for many end users looking to incorporate remote sensing
    and its derived products into their analyses. Because of the dataset’s interoperability
    and flexible structure, the LTS-US dataset serves as a powerful resource for evaluating
    and contextualizing aquatic ecosystem change at local-to-national spatial as well
    as annual-to-decadal temporal scales. Code availability All data harmonization,
    modeling, and validation procedures for the LTS-US dataset54 were scripted in
    the R Statistical Environment71, using the tidyverse72, lubridate73, data.table74,
    sf75, keras76, tensorflow77, caret78, CAST79, yaml80, reticulate81, xgboost82,
    nnet47, viridis83, trend84, multiROC85, ggpubr86, fastshap87, maps88, ggtext89,
    and ggforce90 packages. To enhance reproducibility, all scripts are designed to
    work within a single pipeline that uses the targets package91. The targets pipeline
    is divided into four main components: “1_aggregate”, “2_train”, “3_predict”, and
    “4_qc”. Each component corresponds to one of the steps presented above and can
    be customized by users to fit their specific needs. The associated pipeline setup
    and user guide can be found on the Environmental Data Initiative54, where the
    “README_targets.pdf” file details directory architecture and how to execute the
    pipeline. When downloading the “scripts.zip” folder to access the targets pipeline,
    future users should be aware that empty files within the directory are necessary
    for running the pipeline, as those folders will become populated each time the
    pipeline is run. To ensure reproducibility across operating platforms, all scripts
    for the pipeline can be executed within a container. Running the pipeline within
    the container allows users to execute the entire pipeline without the need to
    make small, yet important, edits to the code, or to configure their own operating
    environment to conform to the pipeline’s requirements. For example, recent versions
    of the sf package default to using the s2 spherical geometry engine instead of
    the Graphic Environment Operating System (GEOS), which assumes planar coordinates.
    End users on a system with one version of the sf library might need to adjust
    the code to use the correct geometry engine, whereas users with another version
    might be able to run the pipeline without any adjustments. The container crystallizes
    a known-working set of libraries, both at the system level (e.g., GEOS, GDAL,
    PROJ) and at the R level (e.g., sf), so that anybody can run the code without
    reconfiguring their own environment. This also provides future proofing by ensuring
    that the inevitable changes to other libraries over time do not lead to errors.
    To help end users, who are less familiar with running containerized code, a tutorial
    for installing and executing the pipeline within the container is located in the
    Environmental Data Initiative repository as a compressed entity (see “README_container.pdf”)54.
    The EDI repository also contains both a rendered (“lake_trophic_status_docker_image.tar.gz”;
    ~3.5 GB) and unrendered (“lts_container.zip”; ~4.0 KB) docker image. While the
    document “README_container.pdf” details information for running both the rendered
    and unrendered images, future users can choose either format depending on their
    familiarity with rendering Docker images and their capacity to download larger
    Docker images. References Mekonnen, M. M. & Hoekstra, A. Y. Four billion people

  description: 'Background: The nationally determined contribution (NDC) presented

    one of the greatest threats to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. However,
    the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of native forests have not been incorporated

    Methods: We used 1040 forest soil samples (0–30 cm) to generate spatially explicit
    estimates of SOC native forests in Argentina at a spatial resolution of approximately

    stock model was fitted as a function of regional climate, which greatly influenced
    forest ecosystems, including precipitation (annual mean precipitation and precipitation

    In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+, information derived in the present
    work from the estimate of SOC in native forests can be incorporated into the annual
    National Inventory Report of Argentina to assist forest management proposals.
    It also gives insight into how native forests can be more resilient to reduce
    the impact of biodiversity loss. Introduction Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the
    main terrestrial C reservoir and contains three times more C than the atmosphere
    and twice the amount stored in the vegetation (Friedlingsten et al. 2019; Mayer
    et al. 2020). Increasing C storage in forest ecosystems is widely recognized as
    having high climate mitigation potential as well as environmental and socio-economic
    benefits (Lewis et al. 2019; Duarte-Guardia et al. 2020). Also, SOC correlates
    positively with several soil functions (soil fertility, infiltration, structural
    stability, porosity) and biodiversity (e.g. plants, insects, birds, and other
    living things) that support ecosystem services to societies (Mori et al. 2017;
    Trivedi et al. 2018; Duarte-Guardia et al. 2019; Canedoli et al. 2020; Magnano
    et al. 2023). SOC stocks vary as a function of C inputs and outputs resulting
    from ecosystem factors such as climate, soil, and vegetation, land use change
    and the mechanisms controlling C residence times (Jobbágy and Jackson 2000; Don
    et al. 2011; Stockmann et al. 2013; Villarino et al. 2017; Berhongaray and Alvarez
    2019; Duarte-Guardia et al. 2020). Different statistical techniques have been
    applied in the mapping of SOC stocks, including multiple linear regression, linear
    mixed models, geographically weighted regression, regression-kriging and methods
    from the machine learning field to map SOC stocks (Vågen and Winowiecki 2013).
    In Argentina, different simulation models have been used to estimate and project
    SOC changes. For example, Villarino et al. (2014) used the IPCC (Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change) empiric Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches to estimate historical
    SOC stocks and flows in the Pampa Region and Piñeiro et al. (2006) applied the
    Century model to simulate historical SOC changes in temperate grasslands. However,
    there are no antecedents of SOC stocks estimation of native forests in Argentina
    at the country level due to the lack of field measurements over large forested
    areas including SOC, bulk density and rock fragment content, and because high
    spatial variability of SOC requires a very high sampling density to get accurate
    estimates. The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report
    stated that unless there are deep reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
    the goal of limiting warming well below 2 °C and close to 1.5 °C will be out of
    reach (IPCC 2021). In this context, Argentina has reaffirmed its commitment to
    the Paris Agreement, extending the country’s goal regarding the reduction of GHG
    by 2030 and announcing a long-term, low-emission development strategy to achieve
    carbon-neutral development by 2050. Also, the nationally determined contribution
    (NDC) presented by Argentina within the framework of the Paris Agreement is aligned
    with the decisions made in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention
    on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the reduction of emissions derived from deforestation
    and forest degradation, as well as forest carbon conservation (REDD+). The Forest
    Reference Emission Levels (FREL) is one of the pillars of the REDD+ process, which
    defines a baseline to evaluate the performance of a country in the implementation
    of REDD+ activities in terms of reducing GHG in the forestry sector. Despite its
    importance, the SOC stock of native forests has not been incorporated into the
    FREL calculations. For this, it is necessary to generate accurate estimates of
    SOC stocks and changes for the major land-use and management conditions. Thus,
    in the context of international policy agendas on GHG emission mitigation, it
    becomes relevant to develop reliable tools for SOC stock monitoring at a national
    scale (Lal 2011). SOC is the basis for sustain net primary production, which in
    fact is one of the key functional dimensions of ecosystems to maintain biodiversity.
    Furthermore, biodiversity is strongly influenced by climatic and environmental
    variables (Read et al. 2020; Rosas et al. 2023), but also by many other site characteristics,
    where soils are pointed as a key factor (Khaziev 2011). Recently, a close relationship
    between SOC stocks and biodiversity was informed (Peri et al. 2019). In other
    words, changes in abiotic factors as temperature, or radiation, can alter the
    biogeochemical cycles inducing losses or gains in forest SOC and consequent alteration
    of NPP, directly affecting biodiversity (Ma et al. 2013; Sardans and Peñuelas
    2013; De Frenne et al. 2021; Mina et al. 2021). When the species are not able
    to adjust to these changes, populations can decline over time due to temporal
    mismatches (e.g. food and reproduction) (Socolar et al. 2017; Silveira et al.
    2021). High spatial variability in phenology (proxy: vegetation greenness) and
    climate (proxy: soil surface temperature) can reduce the biodiversity loss threat
    by increasing ecosystem resilience when high inter-annual variability occurs (Nystrom
    and Folke 2001; Peaucelle et al. 2019). High spatial variability can be related
    to higher food resources, habitat diversity and climatic refugia, enhancing species
    survival (Thuiller et al. 2005; Oliver et al. 2010). Inter-annual variability
    in the vegetation greenness and seasonality of temperature were previously calculated
    for Argentina (Silveira et al. 2021) using temperature infrared data (Hengl et
    al. 2012) and time series of satellite-based vegetation indices, as the Enhanced
    Vegetation Index (EVI) (Hu et al. 2019). The objectives in this study were: (i)
    to model SOC stocks to 30 cm of native forests at a national scale using climatic,
    topographic and vegetation as predictor variables, and (ii) to relate SOC stocks
    with spatio-temporal satellite-derived indices related to vegetation greenness
    and climate to determine biodiversity conservation concerns due to threats from
    high inter-annual climate variability. We hypothesized that SOC is related to
    environmental gradients, which together with other factors (e.g. abiotic and biotic)
    define the potential biodiversity of one particular forest ecosystem. This work
    aims to assist the Government of Argentina in the quantification of SOC content
    of the country’s native forests to have information in relation to the mitigation
    measures in the National Forest and Climate Change Action Plan. Methods Study
    area and SOC database The Argentinian territory covers 2.78 million km2 area from
    21° 46ʹ to 55° 03ʹ S latitude and from 53° 38ʹ to 73° 34ʹ W longitude that determines
    a wide range of ecosystems, where native forest is grouped in six forest regions:
    Monte forests, Espinal forests, Parque Chaqueño forests, Yungas rainforests, Paranaense
    rainforests, and Patagonian forests (Tierra del Fuego forests and Andean Patagonian
    forests) (Appendix 1). Within these regions we masked the native forest lands
    by using the map of the National Native Forest Inventory (SAyDS 2005) and its
    update (SAyDS 2019). On this map, we used the current definition of the native
    forest implemented by the Argentine Government within the framework of Law 26,331/07,
    which regulates the implementation of institutional policies: “all natural forest
    ecosystems in different stages of development, of primary or secondary origin,
    with a tree cover greater than or equal to 20% and a minimum tree height of 3
    m, including palm groves” (SAyDS 2019). The study area was the total native forest
    that covers an area of 0.468 million km2. We used 1040 forest soil samples (0–30
    cm depth) taken from 2015 to 2021. The mean soil sampling density was 2.37 samples
    per 1000 km2 (Appendix 1). We extracted soil samples (n = 3–9 in randomly selected
    areas) using a hand soil sampler including the first 30 cm depth below litter
    layer. The soil sampler has a known volume, making it possible to calculate soil
    bulk density (SBD). The calculations were conducted with air-dried samples, with
    any particles > 2 mm removed previously by sieving (roots, stones, coarse woody
    debris). The SOC stock (kg m−2) was calculated according to the equation: where
    C is the concentration of SOC (kg 100 kg−1); BD is bulk density (kg m−3), 0.3
    is the thickness of the layer (m), CF is the fraction of coarse fragments in the
    soil sample and 0.01 is a scale factor. Environmental predictors for SOC estimation
    We selected 52 potential predictive environmental covariates, which represent
    key factors for the spatial distribution of SOC content such as climate, topography,
    soil and vegetation (McBratney et al. 2003) (Appendix 2). All covariate maps were
    generated or uploaded to the Google Earth Engine cloud-based computing platform
    for subsequent modelling. The original covariates’ spatial resolution was adjusted
    to a common resolution of 200 m and then masked the native forest lands of Argentina.
    Climatic variables We included climatic variables (more specifically precipitation
    and temperature) because climate influences the SOC stock through the control
    of soil processes such as weathering of parent materials, erosion rate and mineralization/humification
    of organic matter, but also because it affects the net primary productivity (NPP)
    that is essential in SOC accumulation (Gaitán et al. 2019). Data on the mean (1970–2000)
    annual precipitation and monthly mean, minimum and maximum temperature were obtained
    from the Worldclim global database. Derived from these monthly temperature and
    precipitation data, we used a group of 17 maps of bioclimatic variables (Hijmans
    et al. 2005). Additionally, we included the mean annual (2001–2021) of day and
    night land surface temperatures, which were obtained from the Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD11A1 V6 product. Topographic variables Topography
    has the potential to control the spatial patterns of soil properties such as SOC
    and, therefore, models that take topographic variables into account can provide
    better estimates of SOC stocks (McBratney et al. 2003). This is because topography,
    through its influence on gravity, solar insolation and micro-climate, determines
    the water, solute, and sediment fluxes throughout the landscape. A set of 13 morphometric
    maps (Appendix 2) was generated using the Terrain Analysis in Google Earth Engine
    (TAGEE, Safanelli et al. 2020). This algorithm uses the digital elevation model
    (DEM) derived from a radar image from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM,
    Farr et al. 2007) with a 30 m spatial resolution. Soil variables Clay has been
    shown to actively protect organic matter from decomposition by adsorption and
    aggregation, slowing turnover and increasing SOC residence times (Paul 1984; Schimel
    et al. 1985). We also included pH because it controls microbial mechanisms of
    carbon accumulation (Malik et al. 2018). On the other hand, soil water erosion
    influences SOC in two ways: redistribution of C within the watershed, and loss
    of C to the atmosphere (Polyakov and Lal 2004). Therefore, in this study, we used
    national maps of soil clay content, pH (0–30 cm depth) and an Universal Soil Loss
    Equation (USLE)-derived map of soil loss rate by water erosion (Gaitán et al.
    2017) (Appendix 2). Vegetation variables We selected vegetation indices (VIs),
    based on satellite observations, that are mathematical transformations of reflectance
    measurements in different spectral bands, especially the visible (usually red)
    and near-infrared bands, that are widely used to obtain information about vegetation
    characteristics (Jackson and Huete 1991; Bannari et al. 1995). In this study,
    we used 10 different VIs and the Blue, Red and NIR bands (Appendix 2) derived
    from the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data produced by the collection
    2, Tier 1 of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor, available in the GEE platform (GEE collection
    snippet: ee. ImageCollection of ‘LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2’). To calculate the VIs,
    we used the CFmask algorithm to mask the cloud and shadow produced, as well as
    a per-pixel saturation mask (Zhu and Woodcock 2012) and used the mean of the 2015–2021
    period of the bands’ surface reflectance. Random forest (RF) modelling for SOC

    variables with SOC stock by applying different digital soil mapping techniques.
    Among those methods, Random Forest (RF, Breiman 2001) algorithm performed better
    than other methods in most comparative studies. Therefore, in our study the RF
    algorithm was selected to predict and map the SOC stocks in the native forest
    of Argentina. This algorithm builds a set of regression trees. Each tree predicts
    the result in each pixel, while the final prediction is obtained by averaging
    these values (Breiman 2001). Each tree is built from a bootstrap sample of the
    original data set which allows for robust error estimation with the remaining
    test set, the so-called Out-Of-Bag (OOB) sample. The excluded OOB samples are
    predicted from the bootstrap samples and by contrasting predicted versus observed
    values different metrics can be calculated to assess the performance of the models.
    For each tree, only a subset of the predictor variables is used, which allows
    estimation of the variable importance measured by the mean decrease in prediction
    accuracy before and after permuting a variable. Of our 52 potential covariates,
    in preliminary simple correlation analyses, several showed a low correlation with
    stock SOC and a high correlation with each other. Therefore, due to random choices
    of subsets of variables being made at each split, many noise variables unrelated
    to the SOC stock may impact model’s performance (Bahl et al. 2019). In addition,
    the presence of correlated predictors impacts RF’s ability to identify the strongest
    predictors by decreasing the estimated importance scores of correlated variables
    (Gregorutti et al. 2017). To overcome this problem, we applied the Random-Forest-Recursive
    Feature Elimination (RF-RFE) algorithm (Gregorutti et al. 2017). The RF-RFE selects
    the subset of covariates that is most predictive for SOC stock by a backward selection
    algorithm that iteratively eliminates the weakest explanatory variable from the
    initial 52-covariates model. The performance of the models was evaluated using
    tenfold cross-validation. For doing this, the SOC dataset was randomly split into
    ten sets in which 70% of the data were used for calibration of models and 30%
    for validation. At each step of the RF-RFE algorithm, we calculate the mean of
    tenfold cross-validation root-mean-square error (RMSE) and plotted it versus the
    number of remaining covariates (Appendix 3). Based on this analysis, we finally
    selected 10 covariates for modelling and mapping SOC stocks (Appendix 2). To evaluate
    the performance of the final SOC stock model, three indices were calculated and
    averaged using tenfold cross-validation: root-mean-square deviation (RMSE), mean
    absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). Additionally,
    we computed the lower (Q5) and upper (Q95) percentiles for each pixel, resulting
    in maps of SOC stocks for lower and upper percentiles. The uncertainty was estimated
    as the difference between the 5th and 95th percentiles (e.g. 90% prediction interval)
    as proposed by Heuvelink (2014). SOC and biodiversity conservation concern To
    determine the biodiversity threats from high inter-annual climate variability,
    we employed the spatio-temporal remotely sensed indices determined by Silveira
    et al. (2021) for the whole of Argentina based on EVI and land surface temperature
    (LST) images from Landsat imagery. We used the final products (GRIDS at 250-m
    resolution): (i) inter-annual variability in phenology based on land surface temperature
    (IAV-LST); (ii) spatial variability based on land surface temperature (SV-LST);
    (iii) inter-annual variability in phenology based on vegetation greenness (IAV-PHE);
    and (iv) spatial variability based on vegetation greenness (SV-PHE). Silveira
    et al. (2021) assumed that: (i) high inter-annual variability in the seasonality
    of land surface temperature and phenology of vegetation greenness threatens biodiversity.
    This high variability can exceed the rate at which organisms are able to adapt,
    disrupting the synchrony of ecological interactions, and thus, the survival of
    the species. (ii) High spatial variability in land surface temperature and vegetation
    greenness enhances resilience to high inter-annual variability. Spatial variability
    provides a higher variety of resources in close proximity by increasing suitable
    conditions during times of climate extremes. Biodiversity conservation concerns
    due to threats from high inter-annual climate variability were considered: (i)
    low concern when IAV is low and SV is high (L); (ii) medium concern when both
    IAV and SV are high, or both IAV and SV are low (M); and (iii) great concern when
    IAV is high and SV is low (H). With these layers, we calculated 3 indices to synthesize
    the biodiversity conservation concerns due to threats from high inter-annual climate
    variability: (i) I-LST = integration between IAV-LST and SV-LST, where IAV and
    LST were classified in high (value = 1 for the area with 50% higher values) and
    low values (value = − 1 for the area with 50% lower values) for each forest region,
    and then calculated the index as I-LST = (IAV-LST − SV-LST)/2; (ii) I-PHE = integration
    between IAV-PHE and SV-PHE, where IAV and LST were classified in high (value = 1
    for the area with 50% higher values) and low values (value = − 1 for the area
    with 50% lower values) for each forest region, and then calculated the index as
    I-PHE = (IAV-PHE − SV-PHE)/2; and finally (iii) I-GLO = global integration between
    I-LST and I-PHE, where I-GLO = (I-LST + I-PHE)/2. We used a mask of native forests
    and forest regions to generate the final GRIDS: (i) a mask of native forests proposed
    by Silveira et al. (2022), which included forested areas taller than 5 m in height
    and 10% in canopy cover, as was defined by Global Forest Change (GFC) data set
    (Hansen et al. 2013). (ii) Forest cover classified into an adaptation of the proposed
    forest regions (Peri et al. 2021a), including Tierra del Fuego forests (TDF),
    Andean Patagonian forests (APF), Monte forests (MON), Espinal forests (ESP), Parque
    Chaqueño forests (PCH), Yungas rainforests (YUN), and Paranaense rainforests (PAR)
    (see Appendix 1). For data extraction, we used the hexagonal binning technique,
    a spatial methodology that offers the advantage of integrating different pixels
    (e.g. averaging values for each pixel) within polygonal regions to effectively
    capture spatial patterns (Battersby et al. 2017). We implemented a hexagonal binning
    process that involved one spatial matrix dividing the territory of Argentina into
    hexagonal areas of 5000 ha each (Rosas et al. 2023). Then, the average values
    of each hexagonal grid were computed. We excluded hexagons that presented less
    than 10% of native forest cover (e.g. < 500 ha in each hexagon). Data analyses
    Our final database included 21,420 hexagons classified in: (i) forest regions
    (TDF = 417 hexagons, APF = 1,487 hexagons, MON = 347 hexagons, ESP = 3,347 hexagons,
    PCH = 13,487 hexagons, YUN = 1,440 hexagons, and PAR = 895 hexagons); (ii) four
    SOC levels (L = low, M = medium, MH = medium high, H = high) representing quartiles
    calculated for each forest region; (iii) seven grids related to LST and PHE, and
    the derived indices. Data were compared through: (i) two-way analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) with SOC levels and forest regions as fixed factors, analysing IAV-LST,
    SV-LST, I-LST, IAV-PHE, SV-PHE, I-PHE, I-GLO; and (ii) simple ANOVAs comparing
    different SOC levels for the same variables, conducted at each forest region individually.
    We used the Fisher test (F) for the ANOVAs, and the means were compared through
    the Tukey test at p < 0.05. Finally, we determined one homogeneity index (HI)
    for each region based on the internal deviation of each SOC level with respect
    to the average value for each biodiversity conservation concern variable (IAV-LST,
    SV-LST, IAV-PHE, SV-PHE). The final index was the average of the four variables
    presented as the percent deviation of the absolutes obtained values. Results SOC
    stock in native forests The values of SOC stocks (to 30 cm depth) at the stand
    level ranged from 2.18 to 17.35 kg m−2 (Fig. 1) and varied considerably across
    forest regions: Patagonian forests (14.45 ± 2.32 mean value in kg m−2 ± standard
    error), Espinal forests (5.21 ± 2.52), Monte forests (2.95 ± 0.68), Parque Chaqueño
    forests (5.16 ± 1.41), Paranaense rainforests (9.73 ± 1.15), and Yungas rainforests
    (7.67 ± 1.44) (Table 1). Total SOC stock of native forests in Argentina was 2.81
    Pg C for a surface of 460,790 km2, where Parque Chaqueño forests represented 58.4%
    of the total SOC stored, followed by Patagonian forests (16.7%) and Espinal forests
    (10%). The estimated uncertainty was 0.10 Pg C (lower limit 5%) and 0.13 Pg C
    (upper limit 95%). Fig. 1 Soil organic carbon stock (30 cm depth) in native forests
    of Argentina Full size image Table 1 Mean (kg m−2) soil carbon contents (SOC)

    model explained 69% of the variance in SOC stock (RMSE = 33.99; MAE = 23.07; R2 = 0.69).
    The 10 most important variables for predicting SOC stocks across all cases were
    as follows: day land surface temperature, temperature seasonality (standard deviation × 100),
    surface reflectance of blue band, mean annual precipitation, maximum temperature
    of warmest month, monthly maximum temperature, precipitation of warmest quarter,
    night land surface temperature, soil water erosion rate, and monthly minimum temperature
    (Fig. 2). Thus, climate variables alone explained most of the variation in SOC
    stocks. Fig. 2 Covariates importance of the top ten variables for soil organic
    carbon (SOC) stock (0–30 cm depth) prediction based on the Random Forest model.
    Acronyms are defined in Appendix 2 Full size image SOC and biodiversity conservation
    concern Biodiversity conservation concern was influenced by the interactions between
    SOC levels and the forest regions (Table 2). Great SOC contents were related to
    high values of IAV-LST and SV-LST and resulting in higher I-LST. While high IAV
    showed a higher biodiversity conservation concern, high SV is associated with
    higher landscape resilience. However, when both variables were combined, I-LST
    indicated that high SOC values had higher biodiversity conservation concern. High
    SOC contents were also related to higher values of IAV-PHE and SV-PHE, and high
    I-PHE values occurred in the lowest SOC contents. Both IAV and SV presented the
    same trend (high biodiversity conservation concern and high landscape resilience).
    However, when both variables were combined, I-PHE indicated that high SOC values
    showed, in average a low biodiversity conservation concern for PHE. Both indices
    combined into a single one (I-GLO) did not present significant differences, but
    had high values (high biodiversity conservation concern and low landscape resilience)
    associated with high SOC values. Table 2 Multiple analyses of variance of biodiversity
    conservation concern, considering levels of soil organic carbon contents (SOC,
    L = low, M = medium, MH = medium high, H = high) at the different forest regions
    (TDF = Tierra del Fuego forests, APF = Andean Patagonian forests, MON = Monte
    forests, ESP = Espinal forests, PCH = Parque Chaqueño forests, YUN = Yungas rainforests,
    PAR = Paranaense rainforests) as main factors Full size table The forest regions
    presented significant differences in the studied variables (IAV-LST, SV-LST, IAV-PHE,
    SV-PHE), but not in the indices (Table 2). The lowest values of IAV-LST were found
    in the driest forest areas (MON and ESP) (lowest threat for biodiversity conservation
    concern), while the highest values were found in rainforests (YUN and PAR) (highest
    threat for biodiversity conservation concern). The lowest values of SV-LST were
    found in the central area of Argentina (ESP and PCH) (lower landscape resilience),
    while the highest values were found in Patagonian forests (APF) (higher landscape
    resilience). The lowest values of IAV-PHE were found in the rainforests (YUN and
    PAR) (lowest threat for biodiversity conservation concern), while the highest
    values were found in the most austral forests of Argentina (TDF) (highest threat
    for biodiversity conservation concern). Finally, the lowest values of SV-PHE were
    found in the driest forest (MON and ESP) and central area of Argentina (PCH) (lower
    landscape resilience), while the highest values were found in Patagonia and Tierra
    del Fuego temperate forests (APF and TDF) (higher landscape resilience). These
    results indicated that the trends for biodiversity conservation concerns varied
    depending on the studied indicator (LST or PHE). Driest areas (MON, ESP and PCH)
    showed different trends compared to rainforests (YUN and PAR) when inter-annual
    variability was considered (LST and PHE). However, the spatial variability of
    both variables (LST and PHE) had similar trends, where the driest areas (MON,
    ESP and PCH) presented low landscape resilience compared to southern forests (APF
    and TDF), which presented the maximum values. It is important to consider that
    these analyses showed significant interactions for all the studied factors (Table
    2), depending on forest region particularities (see Fig. 3, Appendices 4 and 5).
    Patagonian forests (TDF and APF) presented high IAV values (high threat for biodiversity
    conservation concern) at high SOC contents and high SV (enhanced landscape resilience)
    at middle-high SOC contents. Dry and central forests of Argentina (MON, ESP and
    PCH) presented contrasting response in IAV. Generally, higher IAV values (high
    threat for biodiversity conservation concern) were found at higher SOC contents,
    except for MON where IAV-LST was associated with low SOC contents and for PCH
    where IAV-LST was related to middle-high SOC contents. These forests had a similar
    pattern in SV, where high values (enhanced landscape resilience) were related
    to high SOC values. Rainforests (YUN and PAR) showed different patterns than other
    regions: (i) high IAV-LST were related to high SOC contents, but high IAV-PHE
    was related to low SOC contest, and (ii) high SV was related to high SOC values
    in YUN and low SOC values in PAR. These relationships can also be observed in
    the maps of Appendix 4, where the different forest regions presented a significant
    landscape variation for the studied variables (SOC and biodiversity conservation
    concern), but general trends can be observed according to the different particularities
    described before. Fig. 3 Simple analyses of variance for biodiversity conservation

    carbon contents using Tukey test at p < 0.05 Full size image Discussion The estimation
    of forest carbon storage at large scales has attracted considerable interests
    from diverse actors to mitigate climate change and conserve biodiversity (Vågen
    and Winowiecki 2013; Friedlingsten et al. 2019; Peri et al. 2019; Dante-Guardia
    et al. 2020). To our knowledge, this work is the first to quantify the SOC stocks
    in native forests of Argentina at a national scale and to analyse their relationships
    with multiple predictor variables. Thus, the model for SOC (0–30 cm depth) prediction
    accounted for 69% of the variation of this soil property across the whole native
    forest areas in Argentina with values ranging from 2.18 to 17.35 kg m−2. The SOC
    stock was mainly a function of climatic variables related mainly to precipitation
    (mean annual precipitation and precipitation of the warmest quarter) and temperature
    (diurnal land surface temperature, seasonality of temperature, maximum temperature
    of the warmest month, monthly maximum temperature, nocturnal land surface temperature
    and monthly minimum temperature), reflecting the influence of climate on the ecosystem’s
    forests. Temperature influenced SOC by increasing the quantity at lower temperatures
    (Patagonian forests with 14.45 kg m−2) compared to the average SOC stock for the
    entire country (mean of 6.10 kg m−2) and northern forest regions. Some models
    and observations suggest that forests may behave as a C source in response to
    increased decomposition of soil organic matter resulting from temperature increases
    (Davidson et al. 2000). Thus, the temperature sensitivity of decomposing organic
    matter in soil partly determines how much carbon will be transferred to the atmosphere
    because of global warming. This is consistent with Li et al. (2020) who reported
    that soil respiration rates were correlated strongly to air and soil temperatures
    by evaluating seasonal dynamics in contrasting forests across climate gradients.
    The negative effect of temperature on SOC observed is supported by studies in
    other types of ecosystems showing soil organic matter contents decrease with increasing
    temperature (He et al. 2014) due to increased mineralization rates (Kirschbaum
    1995). Rainfall and other related rainfall variables (seasonality) also influenced
    SOC by increasing the quantity of precipitation. It has been demonstrated that
    increased variability in rainfall and soil water content significantly affected
    SOC in forests (Duarte-Guardia et al. 2019). This relationship could be explained
    by the increase in primary productivity due to higher soil moisture and higher
    precipitation values and lower soil temperatures at elevated water supply that
    enhanced SOC storage (Chapin et al. 2002; Adhikari et al. 2014). However, SOC
    is probably controlled by the complex interaction of environmental and biotic
    factors. At the national scale, in this study, patterns of SOC were positively
    associated with mean annual precipitation and negatively correlated with mean
    annual temperature across a diverse range of soils and forest types. This has
    also been documented in grasslands in North America (Burke et al. 1989) and global
    dry-lands (Gaitán et al. 2019). The surface reflectance of the blue band (0.43–0.45
    μm) used to improve sensitivity to chlorophyll represents a proxy of vegetation
    type through estimations of vegetation canopy moisture and greenness indices (Rahaman
    et al. 2017). Thus, SOC may vary in different native forest types across the country
    as a result of the modification of both carbon inputs (e.g. net carbon gain by
    plants) and losses (e.g. microbial decomposition), as was reported previously
    for different vegetation types (Post et al. 1982; Yang et al. 2007). Rasse et
    al. (2005) found that vegetation with higher plant diversity leads to greater
    ANPP and belowground biomass, which enhances belowground carbon inputs and, thereby,
    SOC storage. In contrast, Chen et al. (2018) reported that the negative effect
    of ANPP on SOC in forests and shrublands indicates that the carbon losses associated
    with microbial respiration may offset the positive effect of belowground biomass
    on SOC storage. Also, SOC values related to variability in vegetation characteristics
    may be influenced by topography. For example, in Argentinean Nothofagus forests,
    evergreen species (e.g. less variability in primary productivity) are more common
    in lowlands, near lakes, and locations with alluvial soils, while upland forests
    are generally deciduous (e.g. more variability in primary productivity (Peri et
    al. 2021a). This is consistent with Martínez Pastur et al. (2022) who reported
    that SOC values were highest in valleys of the Andes Mountains and southern Tierra
    del Fuego, ranging from 5.35 to 27.78 kg C m−2 for the whole Patagonia region.
    Soil erosion rate influence negatively SOC. Erosion influences the vertical and
    horizontal distribution patterns of SOC in two ways: redistribution of C within
    the watershed and loss of C to the atmosphere by dispersing the soil, altering
    microbiological activity and inducing mineralization (Polyakov and Lal 2004; Fiener
    et al. 2015). The extent of ecosystems’ capacities to reduce erosion depends on
    many factors related to environmental conditions (amount of precipitation, wind
    velocity, soil properties, slope, and vegetation characteristics) and pressures
    (forest management practices and overgrazing). In Patagonia, Peri et al. (2021b)
    determined a SOC loss by erosion from 85.3 to 250.1 kg C ha−1 year−1. While topsoil
    formation takes thousands of years, erosion can disintegrate all the organic matter
    and nutrients in the topsoil in a few years, dramatically reducing soil productivity.
    This would also explain the higher SOC recorded in the valley or lowland forests
    than on the slopes of the Andes Mountains and in southern Tierra del Fuego. Furthermore,
    forest ecosystems contain a large number of terrestrial carbon stocks globally,
    with more than half allocated in soils (Liu et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019; Martínez
    Pastur et al. 2022; Mayer et al. 2020). It was proposed that SOC stocks and biodiversity
    were closely related (Peri et al. 2019). However, other studies did not find a
    clear relationship between them (Canedoli et al. 2020). Ecosystem services in
    natural ecosystems are underpinned by biophysical structures and processes (de
    Groot et al. 2010), and driven by biodiversity (Balvanera et al. 2006) with positive
    effects (e.g. regulating and supporting services) (Brockerhoff et al. 2017). Biodiversity
    is also important because contributes to soil formation, thereby contributing
    to enhance SOC contents (Canedoli et al. 2020). Many studies showed a positive
    effect of species and functional richness on SOC stocks (Saha et al. 2009; Dawud
    et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019; Magnano et al. 2023), e.g. higher
    plant diversity promotes higher litter accumulation in natural ecosystems (Steinbeiss
    et al. 2008; Lange et al. 2015). These plant–soil relationships play an important
    role in soil C accumulation, where high plant richness results in large litter
    biomass (Steinbeiss et al. 2008; Leff et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2018; Li et al.
    2019). A recent study reported using a prioritization analysis that sites that
    maximize protection of carbon stocks (living aboveground and belowground biomass,
    litter, dead wood, and active SOC) had high values for biodiversity conservation
    (all threatened terrestrial mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, with high
    threat status and endemism), and potential sources of clean water. By conserving
    30% of the territory, it is possible to achieve 80% of the conservation targets
    for biodiversity and water provisioning, and 50% of the conservation targets for
    carbon stocks (Frank et al. 2023). Climate change constitutes one of the greatest
    threats to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services, where model predictions
    warn about significant impacts for the next decades (Sala 2000; Seidl et al. 2014;
    Thom et al. 2019). It was found that climate change impacts will be spatially
    heterogeneous and nonlinear due to differences in climate, edaphic conditions,
    and competitive interactions among other factors (Frey et al. 2016; Creutzburg
    et al. 2017; Thom et al. 2019). Defining this spatial heterogeneity can assist
    land managers and policymakers to prioritize areas where a reallocation of resources
    for climate adaptation could be concentrated (Seddon et al. 2016; Thom et al.
    2017). Identifying spatial–temporal patterns of land surface temperature and vegetation
    greenness at the landscape level is important for decision-making in forest management
    and biodiversity conservation (Silveira et al. 2021), e.g. identification of areas
    to implement multi-objective adaptive management (e.g. land-sharing strategies)
    or areas to priories protection efforts (e.g. creation of new natural reserves)
    (Peri et al. 2022; Rosas et al. 2022, 2023). Forests with high seasonality of
    temperature or inter-annual variability in the phenology may require management
    actions that improve spatial variability to enhance resilience to biodiversity
    loss from high inter-annual variability (Silveira et al. 2021). In contrast, areas
    where spatial variability is higher, are more adequate for protection because
    this is where species can persist if inter-annual variability increases due to
    climate change (Martínez Pastur et al. 2020a; Trew and Maclean 2021; Ye et al.
    2023). In our analyses, we found significant differences among levels of SOC and
    forest regions in Argentina, both for inter-annual and spatial variability. Similarly,
    Silveira et al. (2021) found differences for different eco-regions in Argentina
    and suggest that species living in different areas face dissimilar threats from
    variability in temperature seasonality and associated changes in the ecosystem
    phenology. As we found for the different SOC contents and forest regions, they
    also highlighted the weakly correlation between land surface temperature and phenology.
    This suggests the importance of mapping both variables when assessing the threats
    from phenological and seasonal variations (e.g. areas with high inter-annual variability
    had a strong threat, and low spatial variability meant that resilience is low).
    If we agree that high SOC content is a good proxy for biodiversity (e.g. Peri
    et al. 2019), the results are consistent with many other findings for forests
    around the world (Fischer et al. 2006; Mori et al. 2013; Schmitt et al. 2020;
    Messier et al. 2022). However, our landscape analyses showed contradictory results.
    Inter-annual variability in phenology based on land surface temperature followed
    the described trend (e.g. rainforests presented higher biodiversity conservation
    concern than dry forests), while the inter-annual variability in phenology based
    on vegetation greenness showed the contrary. Besides, high resilience was found
    in the Patagonian forests indicating more stable ecosystem functioning due to
    climate stability at low temperature regions (Forest et al. 2015; Payette and
    Frégeau 2019; Barbé et al. 2020). These mismatches in the general trends and the
    different forests regions can be explained due to the different ecosystem functionality
    across Argentina (Silveira et al. 2022), forest structure and composition (Silveira
    et al. 2023), and human-derived drivers of land use change (Martinuzzi et al.
    2021), that greatly influenced native forests. Argentina implemented a specific
    national legislation to protect native forests (law 26,331/07) to promote sustainable
    uses and more effective conservation strategies (Martinuzzi et al. 2018; Martínez
    Pastur et al. 2020b). Unfortunately, the resulting land use planning incorporates
    little biodiversity explicitly information (Guida-Johnson and Zuleta 2013; Lorenzo
    et al. 2018; Silveira et al. 2022). However, these plans are updated every five
    years, thus, better knowledge about SOC contents (Martínez Pastur et al. 2022),
    as well as patterns of inter-annual and spatial variability of vegetation greenness
    and land surface temperature, can assist to identify those areas where many species
    may have difficulty to persist under more extreme climate events (Silveira et
    al. 2021). Under the negative effects of climate change on native forests, these
    tools can be used to identify vulnerable areas where the slow adaptation process
    implies that adaptive forest management strategies require long lead-in times
    (Maciver and Wheaton 2005; Thom et al. 2019). We need to promote in situ biodiversity
    persistence to avoid negative impacts on future provisioning ecosystem services
    (Bellard et al. 2012; Thom et al. 2017; D’Orangeville et al. 2018). Conclusions
    In the context of climate change mitigation, managing forest ecosystems to conserve
    existing carbon stocks in soils and to remove carbon from the atmosphere by adding
    to stocks is an important issue. In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+ that
    aim to conserve ecosystems and their carbon stocks and achieve land degradation
    neutrality, information derived in the present work from the estimate of SOC in
    the native forests can be incorporated into the annual National Inventory Report
    of Argentina. As Argentina strives to find measures to achieve vital climate targets,
    this work indicates the importance of considering forest soils in improved management
    practices to increase climate change mitigation under forest management practices.
    Increasing forest soils’ capacity to store carbon and reduce net GHG emissions
    is crucial for the Argentinean’s target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
    The inclusion of SOC as biodiversity surrogates allowed to improve conservation
    planning through positive correlation with remotely sensed data indices that capture
    the inter-annual and spatial variability of vegetation greenness and land surface
    temperature. These indices analysed together can be used to identify areas of
    high biodiversity threat and resilience to phenological and seasonal variability.
    Thus, results highlight the importance of long-term monitoring to know the processes
    that determine the magnitude of SOC variation to forecast how it may operate as
    climate and land use change in the future and to assist forest management proposals
    to strengthen the resilience of native forests in order to minimize biodiversity
    loss. Availability of data and materials The datasets used and/or analysed during
    the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

  description: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The condition of the watershed area, particularly
    the Tabunio Watershed, is one with priority treatment due to the condition of
    the land where it is located, which qualifies for the “very high recovery” category
    with a critical land area of 19,109.89 hectares. Moreover, the diminishing water
    absorption also results in flooding during the rainy season and drought in the
    dry season. Environmental damage in the Tabunio Watershed is exacerbated by the
    existence of traditional gold mining and has become a concern for many parties.
    With this in mind, the perceived increase in natural disasters, such as floods,
    landslides, and droughts from year to year requires an evaluation of land degradation
    in the Tabunio Watershed. METHODS: The objective of this study was to monitor
    and simulate the spatial and temporal aspects of land degradation in the Tabunio
    Watershed. It was suggested that a complete land degradation index be developed
    to capture the spatial and temporal aspects of land degradation between the years
    2005 and 2020. This index integrates land use land cover, vegetation coverage,
    soil erosion, and soil moisture content. FINDINGS: The proposed comprehensive
    land degradation index in this study demonstrated that (a) the land degradation
    index, which successfully monitored the spatio-temporal aspect of land degradation
    (kappa coefficient > 0.73 and overall accuracy?> 86 percent), is regarded as having
    high accuracy. (b) In comparison to the individual indices, the land degradation
    index is capable of revealing land degradation in a more comprehensive manner.
    (c) land degradation index is readily transferable and applicable to other study

    in a wide variety of contexts, which also accounts for the provision of quantitative
    predictions with regard to the possibility of land degradation. (e) The rate of
    land degradation will generally increase from 2005 to 2020, with 2010 being the
    most extreme year. CONCLUSION: The proposed comprehensive land degradation index
    method is capable of describing the spatial and temporal aspect of land degradation
    from 2005 to 2020 in the watershed area. Moreover, the proposed approach shows
    that the level of land degradation from 2005 to 2020 normally increases, recording
    the extreme years as the 2010s. In addition, in most years, the amount of land
    degradation was moderate, only few of which had severe or extreme degradation.
    As a consequence of this, some land degradation management measures ought to be

  description: The trade-off and synergy relationship of ecosystem services is an
    important topic in the current assessment. The value of each service provided
    by the ecosystem is substantially affected by human activities, and conversely,
    its changes will also affect the relevant human decisions. Due to varying trade-offs
    among ecosystem services and synergies between them that can either increase or
    decrease, it is difficult to optimize multiple ecosystem services simultaneously,
    making it a huge challenge for ecosystem management. This study firstly develops
    a global Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) accounting framework. It uses remote sensing
    data with a spatial resolution of 1 km to estimate the ecosystem services of forests,
    wetlands, grasslands, deserts, and farmlands in 179 major countries in 2018. The
    results show that the range of global GEP values is USD 112–197 trillion, with
    an average value of USD 155 trillion (the constant price), and the ratio of GEP
    to gross domestic product (GDP) is 1.85. The trade-offs and the synergies among
    different ecosystem services in each continent and income group have been further
    explored. We found a correspondence between the income levels and the synergy
    among ecosystem services within each nation. Among specific ecosystem services,
    there are strong synergies between oxygen release, climate regulation, and carbon
    sequestration services. A trade-off relationship has been observed between flood
    regulation and other services, such as water conservation and soil retention services
    in low-income countries. The results will help clarify the roles and the feedback
    mechanisms between different stakeholders and provide a scientific basis for optimizing
    ecosystem management and implementing ecological compensation schemes to enhance
    human well-being.

    servicesBiophysical quantityMonetary valueTrade-offSynergy 1. Introduction Ecosystems,
    encompassing diverse landscapes, such as forests, agricultural lands, and wetlands,
    offer a plethora of benefits to human society. They are essential sources of timber,
    medicinal resources, food, and raw materials for industry and agriculture. Moreover,
    ecosystems are pivotal in climate regulation, water retention, wind and sand mitigation,
    and biodiversity conservation [1]. These benefits have become fundamental prerequisites
    for our survival and societal progression [2]. In the wake of the global assessment
    conducted by the United Nations (UN) Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) project
    [3,4], the identification, quantification, and conservation of ecosystem services
    have emerged as dominant themes in academic discourse [5]. Numerous scholars have
    significantly advanced the field of ecosystem service valuation. Daily, for instance,
    was instrumental in providing a comprehensive and systematic definition of ecosystem
    services [[6], [7], [8]]. Concurrently, Costanza [[9], [10], [11], [12]] spearheaded
    the comprehensive assessment of the global value of ecosystem services, revealing
    that their total value in 1994 was approximately USD 33 trillion. Subsequently,
    Ouyang et al. [13,14] introduced the Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) indicator,
    quantifying the final ecosystem services to human society. Jiang [15] and Ma [[16],
    [17], [18]] were the first to evaluate GEP for different countries globally and
    provinces within China. Notably, the United Nations Statistical Commission has
    incorporated the GEP into the latest international standard, System of Environmental-Economic
    Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA), endorsing it as a metric for monitoring
    progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 [19]. Now, factors
    such as rapid population growth and global warming are straining the ecosystems’
    capacity to meet the current demands of human society. The urgency for scientific
    decisions and actions to protect and restore ecosystems at a global scale is imperative
    [20]. Exploring trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services at both global
    and regional scales has emerged as a critical field in recent years [21,22]. The
    term “trade-off”, derived from economics, implies that an increase in one service
    often leads to a decrease in other services [[23], [24], [25], [26], [27]]. The
    concept is always represented by a win-lose relation [[28], [29], [30]]. Recognizing
    these trade-offs, particularly at spatial and temporal scales, is crucial, as
    overlooking them could significantly inhibit the benefits of ecological restoration
    or other engineering construction. The construction of dams serves as a pertinent
    example of such trade-offs. While dams are critical engineering structures for
    flood prevention, disaster reduction, irrigation, and electricity generation,
    they may also bring potential drawbacks, including alterations in downstream flow,
    reduction in submerged areas, and changes in river species [31]. Moreover, research
    shows that while large-scale ecological projects have augmented vegetation coverage
    in North and Northeast China, effectively mitigating the risk of soil degradation
    and erosion, they have also led to substantial consumption of water resources
    and a decrease in surface runoff within watersheds [32]. Synergy pertains to scenarios
    where external disturbances simultaneously enhance (win-win) or diminish (lose-lose)
    two or more ecosystem services. Synergistic relationships are typically more conspicuous
    than trade-off relationships. Huang [29] revealed synergistic relationships between
    water production and net primary productivity (NPP) and between water production
    and livestock supply in Xizang. Furthermore, the manifestation of trade-offs/synergies
    will be inconsistent if the spatial scale changes [29,33]. When transitioning
    from the autonomous region scale to the county scale, the relationship between
    water production and NPP shifts from synergy to trade-off. It is noted that some
    trade-offs are inherent, originating from underlying biophysical processes, while
    others can be moderated to a certain degree through management, for example, diversifying
    the regulatory, supportive, and cultural services provided by a single landscape
    through strategic decisions. Therefore, comprehensive understanding and balancing
    of these trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services are crucial for formulating
    effective ecosystem policies and managing or restoring ecosystems. While trade-off
    relationships can be attributed to shared drivers between different services and
    their interactions [34,35], a comprehensive understanding of the influencing factors
    behind ecosystem service trade-offs/synergies is a prerequisite for effective
    management. Current research primarily focuses on identifying the spatiotemporal
    characteristics of trade-off/synergy, with relatively insufficient attention given
    to the mechanisms behind it. The influencing factors could be categorized into
    environmental, ecological, and socio-economic factors. Feng [36] demonstrated
    that the proportion of forests and grasslands was the primary factor influencing
    the trade-off between carbon sequestration and water production services in the
    Loess Plateau. Among various natural environment drivers, rainfall may exacerbate
    these trade-offs, while forest reduction and grassland expansion can mitigate
    these trade-offs. Gross domestic product (GDP) and income level are significant
    socio-economic factors. A study led by Warchold from the Potsdam Institute for
    Climate Impact Research examined the changes in SDGs trade-offs/synergies among
    countries with different income levels. This research utilized the classification
    standards issued by the World Bank (high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income,
    and low-income). Among all 17 goals, synergies outweighed trade-offs, providing
    a positive foundation for implementing the SDGs 2030 Agenda. However, the study
    also highlighted that the SDGs'' trade-offs/synergies can vary by income levels
    and regional groups [37]. MA also provides evidence of trade-offs and synergies
    at different income levels. It indicates that fisheries serve as a major source
    of animal protein for nearly one billion people. Among the 30 countries primarily
    relying on fish as a protein source, 26 are developing nations [3]. Increased
    fishery production frequently results in a decline in other ecosystem services.
    To accurately comprehend these dynamics and identify where and how trade-offs
    and synergies may arise and evolve, this paper quantifies the trade-offs and synergies
    among different ecosystem services across different spatial distribution and income
    level groups. The trade-offs/synergies relationship for each continent enables
    purposeful mitigation of the competitive effects between ecosystem services while
    strengthening the synergistic enhancements [22,23,38]. Additionally, this analysis
    offers technical support for optimizing global ecosystem service management policies
    [39]. 2. Methods and data sources 2.1. Technical framework Fig. 1 provides a technical

    methods This research focused on the year 2018 and covered 179 major countries
    and regions worldwide. The research only included terrestrial ecosystems, such
    as forests, wetlands, grasslands, deserts, farmlands, and urban ecosystems. The
    value of the global marine ecosystem was not considered. 2.2.1. GEP accounting
    method The accounting framework for the global GEP and the detailed calculating
    methods were comprehensively constructed based on relevant guidelines such as
    “Technical Guidelines of Gross Ecosystem Product Accounting of Terrestrial Ecosystem”,
    “Accounting Specifications for Gross Ecosystem Product”, MA, and SEEA-EA. Biophysical
    quantity assessment was carried out in three categories: provisioning services,
    regulating services, and cultural services provided by the ecosystem, such as
    food output, timber output, and soil maintenance quantity. The output of mainly
    ecosystem products could be obtained through the existing economic accounting
    system, and the physical quantity of some other ecosystem regulating services
    could be estimated by combining mathematical models with data from some open source.
    Then, the monetary value assessment required determining the prices of various
    ecosystem products and services, such as the price per unit of timber, water resources,
    and soil conservation. Pricing methods included alternative market technology
    methods and simulated market technology methods. Alternative market technology
    used “shadow price” and consumer surplus to express the price and economic value
    of ecosystem service functions. Simulated market technology estimated the value
    of different ecosystem services by integrating all consumers’ willingness to pay
    through surveys, questionnaires, bidding, etc. This paper used the market value
    method to estimate the value of ecosystem provisioning services, the replacement
    cost method to estimate the value of ecosystem regulating services, and the travel
    cost method to estimate the value of ecosystem cultural services. The specific
    accounting indicators and related methods are shown in Table 1. Table 1. The indicators

    method Many methodologies were available to appraise trade-offs and synergies
    [40]. This study primarily analyzed the trade-offs/synergistic relationships between
    pairwise ecosystem services within a single year. To this end, the spatial correlations
    method was selected for direct calculation. The Spearman correlation coefficient
    [41] and the Pearson correlation coefficient [42] were utilized, employing SPSS
    software for analysis. Then, we measured the synergistic effect by examining the
    competing relationship or synergistic effect among these different indicators.
    The Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) calculation formula and Pearson correlation
    coefficient (rp) were used to determine whether two ecosystem services were positively
    or negatively correlated and to run the significance test, with a significance
    level of α at 0.05 (or 0.01). It was noted that a positive correlation between
    two ecosystem services implied a synergistic effect, while a negative correlation
    suggested a competitive relationship. (1) The calculation formula of Spearman
    correlation coefficient rs: (1) (2) The calculation formula of Pearson correlation
    coefficient rp: (2) In equations (1), (2), A and B denote the ranks of each pair
    of ecosystem services, while n represents the number of countries. A positive
    correlation coefficient for two ecosystem services that passed the significance
    test at the 0.05 (or 0.01) level implies a significant synergistic relationship
    between these two ecosystem services. Conversely, a negative correlation coefficient
    that passed the significance test indicates a trade-off relationship between these
    two ecosystem services. Furthermore, this paper further examined the relationship
    between GEP indicators and various natural-social factors (including land area,
    protected area, population density, GDP, etc.) based on the grouping criteria
    of the continents of each country and the per capita national income issued by
    the World Bank. The results are presented in Section 3.3. 2.3. Data sources This
    paper used the World Bank''s World Development Indicators (WDI) database [43]
    to obtain group data on the protected areas, population, GDP, and per capita national
    income in 2018. The basic data used to calculate the provisioning and cultural
    services also come from the WDI database. Among them, the basic data about agricultural,
    forestry, and fishery products were obtained from WDI statistics on the annual
    added value of agriculture, forestry, and fishery in different countries and regions.
    The basic data about the cultural service was obtained from WDI statistics on
    tourism revenue worldwide. In addition, the data used to calculate the value of
    water resources was obtained from the World Water Outlook database [44]. Data
    used in the accounting of ecosystem climate regulation, carbon sequestration,
    oxygen release, and water storage included 2018 global vegetation NPP, 2018 global
    evaporation data (ET), and 2018 Global Land Use Data (LUCC). NPP and ET data came
    from the MODIS land standard products provided by the NASA Land Process Distributed
    Data Archive Center, which were MOD17A2 and MOD16A2 [45,46], respectively, while
    LUCC data came from the global land cover data of the European Space Agency [47].
    The World Bank divided global economies into four groups based on per capita national
    income [48]: high-income countries (per capita > 12,535 US dollars (USD)), upper-middle-income
    countries (USD 4046 ≤ per capita ≤ USD 12,535), lower-middle-income countries
    (USD 1036 ≤ per capita < USD 4046), and low-income countries (per capita < USD
    1036). The criterion would be used in subsequent trade-offs and synergies analyses
    among ecosystem services under different income levels. 3. Results 3.1. The structural
    composition and spatial distribution The global GEP calculated at constant prices
    was approximately USD 155 trillion in 2018, 1.85 times the global GDP for the
    same year. The unit area GEP was USD 1.07 million km−2, and the per capita GEP
    was USD 20,300 per person, a 4.81% and 2.89% increase compared with 2017, respectively
    [15]. However, this growth rate was slightly lower than the average annual growth
    rate of the global ecosystem service value from 1994 to 2011, calculated in 2014
    [11]. Those differences could be attributed to the different accounting indicators,
    scopes, and price factors. The global terrestrial ecosystem''s regulating service
    value was about USD 140 trillion, accounting for 90.31%, followed by the material
    product supply service value of the global terrestrial ecosystem, accounting for
    5.36%, and the cultural service value, accounting for 4.33%. In 2017, the value
    of these three service functions accounted for 89.84%, 5.70%, and 4.46%, respectively.
    The total GEP, per capita GEP, and GEP per unit area vary significantly across
    different regions. The total GEP is mainly distributed in the Americas, Asia,
    and Africa, as shown in Fig. S1. Developing countries have a total GEP of about
    3.45 times higher than developed countries. However, their per capita GEP is only
    54.61% of developed countries'' GDP. The top 15 countries account for 65% of the
    total global GEP, and the five countries with the highest total GEP are Brazil,
    the United States, China, Russia, and Canada, with the combined GEP of these five
    countries accounting for 37.68%, slightly lower than the 40.90% in 2017. 3.2.
    Synergistic relationship between ecosystem services and other factors Fig. 2 reveals
    a significant positive correlation between the total amount of ecosystem services
    and protected area sizes in five continents, with some variations among countries
    within the same continent. In the Americas and Oceania, the growth rate of ecosystem
    services gradually slows down and approaches a threshold as protected areas increase.
    This suggests that an increase in the protected areas will also increase the total
    value of ecosystem services within a certain range. However, further expansion
    of these areas eventually limits the available space for human economic and social
    activities, leading to a stabilization of this value. In Africa, the correlation
    between the total amount of ecosystem services and protected areas is comparatively
    weaker. This can be attributed to Africa''s economic development model, which
    heavily relies on exporting primary raw materials. Additionally, while a positive
    correlation exists between the total amount of ecosystem services and land area,
    it is weaker than that with protected areas. Social factors like population density
    may also affect these correlations. There is a negative correlation between population
    density and ecosystem services intensity. High population densities are more likely
    to adversely impact the value of ecosystem services due to increased human activity.

    larger the GEP amount, the larger the size of the circle. 3.3. Synergies/trade-offs
    among different ecosystem services Based on the results of countries with different
    income levels in the world in 2018, there is a significant correlation among ecosystem
    services across each group (p < 0.01), as shown in Fig. 3. It is noted that the
    oxygen release service, climate regulation service, and carbon sequestration service
    have a strong synergy (r > 0.75) in all groups due to the photosynthesis of the
    ecosystem. Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through photosynthesis
    while fixing carbon to mitigate global warming. Additionally, plants can regulate
    temperature and humidity through transpiration. Suppose any of the services in
    oxygen release, carbon fixation, and climate regulation are not effectively managed.
    In that case, the value of the other two services will also be affected, resulting
    in a functional relationship of “one prospers and one loses all.” The cultural
    service provides spiritual enjoyment for human society, while the provisioning
    service provides the material basis for survival, improving the quality of life
    and social welfare. The provisioning and spiritual value provided by the ecosystem
    at the global level also show strong synergy. Download : Download high-res image

    among different ecosystem services. A comparison of the synergy among GEP indicators
    in the countries with different income levels shows that in high-income and upper-middle-income
    countries, there are more than ten pairs of ecosystem services with strong synergy
    (r > 0.75), and the number of ecosystem services with strong synergy reaches 20
    in high-income countries, accounting for more than 70%. However, no more than
    ten pairs of ecosystem services show strong synergies in lower-middle-income and
    low-income countries. In 2018, the majority of global ecosystem services exhibited
    synergistic relationships. However, a trade-off was observed between flood regulation
    and other services, such as water conservation and soil retention in low-income
    countries. This reflects the increase in the value of flood regulation and storage
    services in these regions, which would adversely impact their water conservation
    and soil retention capabilities. Furthermore, considering the results for each
    continent, the synergy between ecosystem regulation services is more pronounced
    in American and European countries. However, in African countries, trade-offs
    are observed between soil retention and flood regulation services, climate regulation
    and cultural services, water conservation and flood regulation services, and water
    conservation and cultural services. Upon analyzing GDP levels, it becomes apparent
    that in developing countries, trade-offs are observed between flood regulation
    and soil retention services, as well as between flood regulation and water conservation
    services. In general, a correlation exists between the income levels and the synergy
    among ecosystem services within each nation. The ultimate goal of human activity
    is to maximize the benefits of ecosystem services in synergy through a “win-win”
    model. 4. Discussions 4.1. Comparative analysis In 2018, the GEP and GDP rankings
    of countries exhibited significant differences. Notably, for most countries, their
    total GEP was substantially higher than their total GDP. Countries generally ranked
    high in both GEP and GDP, but African and other underdeveloped nations had higher
    rankings in GEP compared to GDP. The increasement of the global GEP in 2018, relative
    to 2017 [15], may potentially obscure the fact that certain nations experienced
    a decline. Specifically, the GEP of 69 countries declined in 2018, while the rest
    showed an increasing trend. However, only 84 countries or regions, including China,
    demonstrated concurrent growth in both GEP and GDP. Among the top ten countries
    in terms of GEP, only China, Congo (Kinshasa), Indonesia, and Australia manifested
    growth in both metrics. Focusing on China, its global ranking in total GEP value
    in 2018 was third. However, its per capita GEP and per unit area GEP rankings
    were 134th and 101th, respectively. Despite an increase of five places in per
    capita GEP compared to 2017, reaching USD 8800 per person (at current price),
    it remained significantly below the global average. This ranking was even lower
    than the per capita GDP of USD 9900 per person (65th globally). On the other hand,
    China''s GEP per unit area was USD 1,288,200 km−2 (at current price), slightly
    above the global average. 4.2. Uncertainty analysis To analyze the synergistic
    effects among GEP indicators in various countries worldwide, we must first consider
    the uncertainties that arise in GEP accounting. Different researchers may obtain
    varying results due to differences in accounting scope, indicators, data, and
    methods. Moreover, accounting results may be overestimated or underestimated due
    to differences in the acquisition of accounting parameter coefficients. Regarding
    global data required for accounting, there are limitations in animal husbandry
    and bioenergy-related data in the World Bank''s global WDI database, which affects
    the calculation of the value of global ecosystem material products and services.
    Additionally, rainfall, runoff, and evapotranspiration data must be considered
    when calculating the value of water resource services. However, obtaining runoff
    data for all countries is difficult, so this paper uses an alternative algorithm
    based on rainfall intensity, which may lead to overestimated results. Regional
    differences in cooling and humidification services provided by ecosystems at different
    latitudes are fully considered in the accounting process. However, relevant parameters
    for water conservation services are converted according to relevant cost data,
    such as labor costs, in major regions of the world, which may impact the results.
    Furthermore, the value of soil conservation services includes reducing sedimentation,
    mitigating non-point source pollution, and maintaining soil fertility. However,
    due to the challenges in obtaining the necessary parameters for the latter two
    components, our analysis primarily considers the value of sedimentation reduction
    services. This approach leads to an underestimation of this part of the results.
    Lastly, the tourism revenue data of natural scenic spots in various countries
    are limited to international tourists arriving via airports. This method fails
    to account for non-airport inbound tourists, potentially leading to an undervaluation
    of cultural services, especially in countries with less developed air transportation
    systems. Global GEP accounting and synergy analysis still face many difficulties
    in obtaining basic data, particularly regional parameters. This would result in
    many uncertainties in the final analysis. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen
    the research support for global multi-regional parameters, monitoring, and assimilation
    simulation in the future. 4.3. Further implication Human society frequently disturbs
    the equilibrium of ecosystem service supply and demand, making it difficult to
    simultaneously maximize the benefits of various ecosystem services. This imbalance
    results in trade-offs of varying degrees, most notably in low-income countries.
    Among these, African nations, which constitute over 88% of the 26 low-income countries,
    face the most severe flood challenges globally. Addressing flood-related issues
    requires a holistic approach that values not only flood regulation and storage
    services but also considers other ecosystem services. In other words, a myopic
    pursuit of flood mitigation through reservoir construction would inevitably hinder
    the achievement of optimal regional ecosystem management. Moreover, it is proposed
    that synergistic analyses among different ecosystem services be conducted at different
    levels and regions promptly. This would provide a scientific basis for establishing
    a global ecological fiscal transfer payment (EFT). Ultimately, the scale of EFT
    and diversity funds, along with other funding channels could be expanded to offer
    multilateral assistance to regions with high GEP but low GDP, thereby promoting
    global sustainable development. Furthermore, it is essential to thoroughly examine
    the relationship between ecosystem services and natural social factors. Enhancing
    the evaluation system that integrates the social-economic-natural nexus, particularly
    through the dual evaluation of GDP and GEP, is crucial. 5. Conclusions In 2018,
    the global GEP was approximately USD 155 trillion (the constant price), which
    is 1.85 times the global GDP. The growth rate of GEP was slightly higher than
    that of the global GDP. The value of ecosystem regulating services accounted for
    90.31% of the total GEP. Significant spatial differences existed in the total
    GEP, per capita GEP, and GEP per unit area. The total amount of GEP was mainly
    distributed in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Developing countries accounted
    for about 3.45 times the total GEP of developed countries, but their per capita
    GEP was only 54.61% of developed countries. The five countries leading in total
    GEP were Brazil, the United States, China, Russia, and Canada. A notable positive
    correlation exists between ecosystem services and the protected areas across five
    continents and, to a lesser extent, with land areas. However, an increase in population
    density can lead to a decline in the value of ecosystem services due to human
    activities. This study also highlights strong synergies among oxygen release regulation,
    climate regulation, and carbon sequestration services provided by the global ecosystem,
    as well as between ecosystem cultural services and provisioning services. Ineffective
    management of one service can affect the value of other services. Additionally,
    there is a correspondence between the income levels and the synergy among ecosystem
    services within each nation. In low-income countries, particularly in Africa,
    there is a trade-off relationship between flood regulation and water conservation
    soil retention services. Therefore, flood mitigation strategies such as reservoir
    construction should be carefully balanced to avoid overlooking other vital ecosystem
    services. CRediT authorship contribution statement Jinnan Wang: Conceptualization,

  description: This study aims to develop an affordable and continuous method for
    monitoring water quality in arid, remote areas with high erosion rates. It presents
    a hypothesis that establishes a link between the concentration of Total Suspended
    Matter (TSM) and wind speed, emphasizing its ecological importance in lakes with
    dry conditions and high erosion rates. Building upon this hypothesis, the study
    introduces Wind2TSM-Net, a machine learning model that effectively bridges between
    different regression and neural network algorithms. This model connects on-site
    wind speed measurements with TSM data obtained through a physically remote sensing
    approach. It accurately predicts TSM concentration values, overcoming challenges
    such as cloud interference and reducing reliance on satellite imagery. The model
    was applied to Iran's Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs (CNRs) as a case study in an arid
    and remote area. The results revealed a significant correlation between TSM concentration
    and wind speed measurements, with impressive performance metrics (coefficient
    of determination (R2) = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.97 g/m3, mean
    absolute error (MAE) = 1.33). These findings highlight the effectiveness of Wind2TSM-Net
    in monitoring TSM values in remote and dry regions, particularly during extreme
    weather conditions when on-site measurements are impractical or cloud cover obstructs
    satellite observations.

    Suspended Matter (TSM) comprises a complex mixture primarily consisting of mineral
    debris, organic matter, as well as both active and dormant algae, alongside cells
    of aquatic phytoplankton (American Public Health, A, 1971; Chapra, 2008; Ji et
    al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). Acknowledged as a crucial ecological parameter
    in evaluating the water quality of lakes and other aquatic environments, TSM plays
    a multifaceted role in influencing diverse aquatic processes. (Mao et al., 2012;
    Niroumand-Jadidi and Bovolo, 2021; Saberioon et al., 2023). Its impact extends
    to nutrient and oxygen availability within water bodies (Cao et al., 2023; Zheng
    et al., 2015), light penetration, and sedimentation rates (Du et al., 2020; Sankaran
    et al., 2023). Considering these significant impacts, continuous monitoring of
    TSM concentrations as an ecological factor is imperative, offering vital insights
    necessary for a comprehensive understanding of aquatic ecosystems (Lei et al.,
    2020; Saberioon et al., 2023; Sankaran et al., 2023; Walch et al., 2022). In the
    past, checking water quality meant going to the water and taking samples, then
    testing them in a lab (Du et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2014). However, this conventional
    approach proves to be resource-intensive, time-consuming, and economically burdensome
    (Ritchie et al., 1987; Wen et al., 2022). Moreover, the limitations of relying
    on a sparse number of on-site measurements become evident when attempting to capture
    the overall spatiotemporal distribution of water quality parameters, especially
    in lakes characterized by significant variability over time and space (Jiang et
    al., 2023; Matthews, 2011; Wang et al., 2011). The advent of remote sensing (RS)
    technology offers a promising alternative for the comprehensive assessment of
    a diverse range of water quality characteristics over the past few decades (Adjovu
    et al., 2023; Koponen et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2019). Both high and low spatial
    resolution satellite RS images have proven effective in estimating TSM concentrations
    in inland water bodies and lakes (Gao et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023). Notably,
    one should acknowledge the predominant reliance on high-resolution monitoring
    data for inland water monitoring (Sankaran et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2019). Various
    RS image data, such as the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS), medium
    resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS), Landsat series data, and Sentinel-2 multispectral
    instrument (MSI) data, have been leveraged in previous studies (Adjovu et al.,
    2023; Gao et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023; Koponen et al., 2002; Niroumand-Jadidi
    et al., 2019; Wen et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2019). In many recent studies, there
    has been a focus on utilizing reflectance RS data directly to estimate variations
    in various ecologically significant constituents affecting water-leaving radiance
    across the spectrum. For instance, in a study by Matsui et al. (2021), the resolution
    of UAV-based RS data was enhanced to estimate ecological water quality data in
    Lake Hachiroko, Japan, using neural network algorithms. Similarly, in another
    study, a spatio-temporal analysis of colored dissolved organic matter was conducted
    using Landsat-8 data in Ebinur Lake, China, employing modeling and assessment
    techniques (Cao et al., 2023). Furthermore, in a recent field study, the ecological
    status, such as total dissolved solids, of wetland ecosystems was monitored using
    a linked fuzzy inference system combined with RS analysis using Landsat-8 images
    (Sedighkia and Datta, 2023). Likewise, in a study assessing the temporal and spatial
    distribution of chlorophyll-A as an ecological factor in Erhai Lake, a robust
    model was developed based on multispectral data from HJ-1 A/1B satellites (Wang
    et al., 2021). In the pursuit of retrieving water quality parameters, spectral
    analyses are broadly categorized into empirical and physics-based approaches (Bowers,
    2003; Li et al., 2023; Niroumand-Jadidi et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2015). Empirical
    methods, exemplified by regression analysis, link field measurements with spectral
    information (Gholizadeh et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019; Zaghian et al., 2023).
    In contrast, physics-based strategies, utilizing radiative transfer models like
    neural network (NN) models and inverse modeling, offer applicability even without
    in situ samples, albeit requiring prior knowledge of inherent optical properties
    (IOPs) (Brockmann et al., 2016; Gege, 2014; Jiang et al., 2023; Niroumand-Jadidi
    and Bovolo, 2021). Physics-based methods necessitate precise water-leaving radiance
    measurements, making them susceptible to atmospheric effects due to low signal-to-noise
    ratios in water bodies (Jiang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Niroumand-Jadidi
    et al., 2019; Pahlevan et al., 2019). Conversely, empirical methods rooted in
    regression deduce constituents without the need for initial IOP data, exhibiting
    reduced vulnerability to atmospheric interferences, particularly in ratio-based
    models (Gholizadeh et al., 2016). Empirical methods have widespread application
    in inland and coastal investigations (Azidane et al., 2022; Niroumand-Jadidi et
    al., 2021; Soria et al., 2021; Toming et al., 2016; Zaghian et al., 2023). Hereof,
    Niroumand-Jadidi et al. (2021) utilized time-series Sentinel-2 imagery along with
    Case-2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) (Brockmann et al., 2016) and Watercolour Simulator
    (WASI) (Gege, 2014) algorithms to assess water quality parameters in Italian inland
    lakes. Employed empirical methods to map TSM in Changdang Lake, China, utilizing
    Sentinel-2 images. Similarly, Li et al. (2021) estimated TSM concentration dynamics
    in Qinghai Lake, China, through empirical methods using Landsat imagery. Furthermore,
    Ayala Izurieta et al. (2023) conducted a spatial and temporal analysis of water
    quality in High Andean Lakes using Sentinel-2 satellite data, employing a combined
    approach of empirical and physics-based methods. The choice between physics-based
    and empirical methods depends on research objectives and environmental conditions,
    each having its own set of limitations. Water dynamics in lakes and reservoirs
    are predominantly influenced by water currents and wind, serving as a key meteorological
    force in generating waves, currents, and circulation cells (Du et al., 2023; Soria
    et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2016). The impact of wind is particularly noteworthy
    in shallow lakes, where circulation cells play a significant role (Soria et al.,
    2021; Tang et al., 2020). In deeper lakes, wind-induced circulation cells can
    reach depths of up to 8 m within 15 min when wind speeds exceed 30 km per hour
    (km/h), resulting in thorough mixing and uniformity across the surface layer (Barstow,
    1983). Shallow lakes, characterized by surface-to-lakebed circulation cells, experience
    sediment disturbance, particulate dispersion throughout the water column, and
    differential sedimentation based on density once the influence of wind subsides
    (Du et al., 2023; Soria et al., 2021). Wind emerges as a primary factor in agitating
    shallow lake waters and promptly influencing the delicate sedimentary surface
    layer (Wu et al., 2016). These dynamics create diverse scenarios of TSM within
    the water column during sustained and prevailing winds from a single direction,
    facilitating the easy lifting and redistribution of finer sedimentary particles
    (Du et al., 2023; Soria et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2016). Conversely,
    calm or breezy periods exhibit distinct TSM conditions (Barstow, 1983; Soria et
    al., 2021). A limited number of studies emphasize the pivotal role of wind in
    determining TSM concentration in aquatic environments. Hereof, Zheng et al. (2015)
    demonstrated a positive correlation between increasing wind speed and TSM concentration
    in Lake Taihu, China. Jalil et al. (2019) similarly reported a strong correlation
    between sediment resuspension and aerodynamic features, such as wind speed and
    direction. Recent investigations, particularly those by Soria et al. (2021), utilizing
    Sentinel-2 imagery, revealed a significant correlation between wind speed and
    water quality parameters, specifically chlorophyll-a and TSM, in Spain''s Albufera
    wetland. Lei et al. (2020) observed an increase in surface TSM during the daytime,
    especially in the dry season, due to the hourly rise in wind speed in Hongze Lake.
    Despite the established link between wind speed and TSM concentration in prior
    research, there has been limited exploration in developing a model exclusively
    tailored to predict TSM concentration based on wind speed metrics, especially
    for lakes in arid areas prone to intense erosion. As evidenced, there are numerous
    studies related to estimating water quality parameters using RS data, which have
    led to the development of models dependent on satellite imagery. However, our
    research stands out due to its unique approach—it does not rely on RS imagery
    but rather achieves its goal indirectly by focusing solely on wind speed. Additionally,
    it''s worth noting that there is currently no comprehensive study that has attempted
    to construct a robust model for estimating TSM solely based on wind speed, particularly
    in arid and remote regions. Generally, the principal aim of this study is to introduce
    an innovative machine learning model designed to predict lake TSM concentration
    exclusively using wind speed, focusing on the Chah-Nimeh Reservoirs (CNRs) in
    Sistan, Iran. The research adopts a dual-focused strategy: firstly, an in-depth
    analysis of the correlation between TSM concentration and wind speed, utilizing
    both satellite-derived TSM and on-site wind speed data to formulate a model for
    TSM retrieval based on wind speed; secondly, an exploration of temporal transferability
    by introducing an unprecedented machine learning model customized for TSM estimation,
    relying solely on wind speed. To accomplish these objectives, wind speed data
    collected from CNRs and TSM concentration derived from a time series of satellite
    imagery were seamlessly integrated to train a refined model. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Study site In a remote and arid region in southeastern Iran, near
    the border of Afghanistan, there are natural water reservoirs known as CNRs, with
    the coordinates 30° 40′ - 30° 54′ N, 61° 29′ - 61° 44′ E (Bazrafshan et al., 2016).
    The depth of CNRs varies significantly, with the areas around the reservoir borders
    having a shallow depth of almost less than six meters (Bazrafshan et al., 2016;
    MoE, 2014). However, the depth increases significantly towards the central area
    of CNRs, reaching over a hundred meters in some parts (MoE, 2014). On average,
    the depth of CNRs is approximately fifteen meters. The water in CNRs is turbid,
    and their unique location within the Sistan and Hirmand river ranges makes them
    a vital source of water supply for the region (Akbari et al., 2022; MoE, 2014).
    Fig. 1 displays the locations of the CNRs in the Sistan region. Currently, the
    Kahak diversion dam, along with its artificial canal, plays a pivotal role in
    diverting several portions of the Sistan River flow to the four CNR reservoirs,
    namely CNR1 to CNR4, providing a sustainable water supply to the drought-prone
    and secluded southeast region of Iran. For households (0.11 km3/yr), agriculture
    (0.4 km3/yr), and industry (0.03 km3/yr) in the Sistan region, the CNRs serve
    as a crucial water source, with a total demand of 0.54 km3/yr. Furthermore, the
    high rate of erosion in the region, attributed to factors such as wind, contributes
    to the high sediment content in these reservoirs (Alizadeh-Choobari et al., 2014).
    So, evaluating TSM is crucial to ensure human and aquatic life well-being in the

    and Sistan province, (B) the CNRs with multiple measurement stations and a solitary
    meteorological monitoring site. The Sistan watershed is a low-lying topographic
    zone (Whitney, 2006) characterized by aridity and frequent dust storms (Alizadeh-Choobari
    et al., 2014). The area is currently experiencing the effects of the “wind of
    120 days,” which is a consistent wind blowing from the northwest to northeast
    and is commonly referred to as Levar. The Palanghan Mountains in the west and
    the Babaei and Hindu Kush Mountains in the northeast together enhance the force
    of the wind (Alizadeh-Choobari et al., 2014; Goudie and Middleton, 2006; Whitney,
    2006). Insufficient knowledge exists regarding the driving forces of the wind,
    its diurnal variation, and the accompanying dust storms (Alizadeh-Choobari et
    al., 2014). The combination of hyperarid climate, strong wind speeds, high erodibility,
    and absence of vegetation makes the Sistan watershed highly susceptible to erosion,
    causing desertification. The “wind of 120 days” arises annually from the middle
    of May through to the middle of September in the Sistan region of Iran (Alizadeh-Choobari
    et al., 2014; Poormorteza et al., 2023). This prolonged period of strong winds
    can create extreme environmental conditions, including high levels of dust and
    sand storms, which can have significant impacts on the quality of air and water
    in the area (Whitney, 2006). Given the potential impacts of dust and sand storms
    on water quality, monitoring parameters such as TSM is essential to ensure the
    safety and well-being of both humans and aquatic life in the region. 2.2. Remote
    sensing data A dataset of 89 satellite images was selected for this study, comprising
    48 Sentinel-2 and 41 Landsat-8 images, which were carefully chosen based on minimal
    cloud coverage, flares, and other factors between April 2017 and June 2021. The
    seasonal classification of the MSI and operational land imager (OLI) data is presented
    in Table 1. Integrating MSI and OLI imagery allowed for improved temporal analysis
    and increased the number of measured matchups. Data from Sentinel-2 were sourced
    from the European Space Agency''s (ESA) data dissemination platform, which can
    be accessed at. Meanwhile, Landsat-8 imagery was acquired from the United States
    Geological Survey''s (USGS) portal, found at (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).

    preprocessing involved spatial resampling, atmospheric correction, and identification
    of water bodies for the retrieval of TSM concentration in CNRs. Sentinel-2 images,
    with a spatial resolution of 20 m, were resampled using the Sentinels Application
    Platform (SNAP) software. Landsat-8 images, with a default spatial resolution
    of 30 m, were deemed suitable for analysis given that most of the relevant water
    quality constituent bands were obtained at a spatial resolution of 10 to 30 m
    and less than 1000 nm (Hanintyo et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023; Niroumand-Jadidi
    et al., 2021). For data analysis, the Level-1C top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance
    product was used for both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images. Atmospheric correction
    was performed using the C2RCC processor (Brockmann et al., 2016), available on
    ESA''s Sentinel Toolbox SNAP, to correct the values for the atmosphere. Subsequently,
    water body information was extracted, and TSM concentration maps of CNRs were
    generated using the C2RCC processor. 2.3. Field data collection The dataset for
    this study comprised 89 daily wind speed measurements obtained from the Zahak
    meteorological monitoring station (30°53′59”N, 61°40′58″E) between April 2017
    and June 2021, corresponding with satellite images. The wind speed data were provided
    by the Iran Meteorological Organization (IMO) and were reported at six time points
    throughout the day, from (00:00) until (15:00), at three-hour intervals. To facilitate
    an accurate analysis of the relationship between the RS images and wind speed
    data, a linear interpolation was performed between wind speed data at (09:00)
    and (12:00) for the nearest time to the satellite overpass (≈ 10:00 local time).
    The in situ water quality dataset comprises 83 water samples collected from 38
    field sampling stations spanning April 2018 to October 2021, capturing surface
    water samples at depths ranging from 0 cm to 50 cm. Fig. 1 vividly illustrates
    the spatial distribution of all sampling sites in CNRs, identified by the distinctive
    blue circles. This study validates the extracted TSM concentration from RS data
    by leveraging in situ measured turbidity data collected between April 2018 and
    October 2021. Due to the absence of in-situ TSM data, the validation process relies
    on in situ measured turbidity. Although direct TSM concentration data for CNRs
    is not at hand, previous research underscores a substantial correlation between
    TSM and turbidity indicators (Bright et al., 2018; He et al., 2013; Katlane et
    al., 2013a; Putri and Arisalwadi, 2023; Soomets et al., 2020). On-site turbidity
    data in CNRs were procured within an average timeframe of ±3 days from the satellite
    overpass. 2.4. Research methods To develop a model capable of accurately determining
    the average concentration of TSM in CNRs, we utilized field measurements of wind
    speed. Additionally, the research employed RS data through the C2RCC processor
    (Brockmann et al., 2016), accessible in ESA''s Sentinel Toolbox SNAP, presenting
    a physics-based approach for TSM retrieval. Following the validation of TSM estimates
    derived from the C2RCC method with on-site turbidity measurements, the study harnessed
    on-site wind speed meteorological data and the mean TSM concentration of the lakes
    to train a machine learning-based model named Wind2TSM. These models, rooted in
    regression and NN algorithms, accurately estimated the average TSM concentration
    of the lakes solely based on wind speed. Confronted with the absence of direct
    TSM concentration data for the lakes, on-site turbidity data served to corroborate
    the TSM acquired through the C2RCC approach. Previous research has consistently
    highlighted a robust association between TSM and turbidity metrics, establishing
    turbidity as a suitable surrogate for TSM concentration (Bright et al., 2018;
    He et al., 2013; Katlane et al., 2013a; Putri and Arisalwadi, 2023; Soomets et
    al., 2020). To overcome data limitations and enhance the robustness of the model
    training process, this study employed a K-fold cross-validation technique with
    K set to four. Unlike traditional approaches that segregate data into distinct
    sets, this method maximized the utilization of both on-site and RS datasets, integrating
    them comprehensively into both training and validation phases (Aptoula and Ariman,
    2021; Escoto et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). The distinctive feature of
    the K-fold cross-validation method lies in its utilization of all available data
    for both training and validation, providing a more holistic assessment (Guo et
    al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). By adopting this strategy,
    the study aimed to bolster the reliability of the model''s performance evaluation
    while making efficient use of the limited on-site and RS data. The scientific
    flow chart illustrated in Fig. 2 succinctly outlines the adopted methodology.

    Fig. 2. The flowchart of the proposed Wind2TSM model for retrieving TSM concentration
    based on wind speed. 2.4.1. Case-2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) The C2RCC processor
    is software exclusively designed for the purpose of analyzing ocean color data
    obtained from multiple satellite tools (Brockmann et al., 2016; Jiang et al.,
    2023; Li et al., 2023). These instruments include OLI, MERIS, MODIS, MSI, and
    the ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) (Brockmann et al., 2016). The current
    processor is based on the Case-2 Regional Processor (C2R) initially created by
    Doerffer and Schiller (2007), which was subsequently improved during the CoastColour
    project. The fundamental idea that underlies the C2RCC processor is based on the
    radiative transfer modeling of water, utilizing radiative transfer theory based
    on hydrolight (Kyryliuk and Kratzer, 2019), as well as the vector successive order
    of scattering atmospheric model, incorporating aerosol optical properties derived
    from NASA AERONET-OC measurements. The core function of the C2RCC processor is
    to treat the atmospheric and in-water components separately while carrying out
    the inversion of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance to water-leaving radiance (Brockmann
    et al., 2016). This inversion process yields the IOPs of the water column from
    the surface spectra. The inversions are accomplished using a set of NN where the
    atmospheric and in-water parts are treated independently (Brockmann et al., 2016).
    The NN is trained using an extensive database of radiative transfer simulations
    that covers a range of IOPs. These simulations involve the variation of five specific
    IOPs: pigment absorption (a(pig)), absorption of detritus (a(det)), colored dissolved
    organic matter (CDOM) absorption (a(CDOM)), scattering of white particles (b(wit))
    represented by calcareous sediments, and typical sediment scatter (b(part)). In
    this study, the focus lies on the concentration of TSM, requiring the assessment
    of two IOPs, (b(wit)) and (b(part)) (Brockmann et al., 2016). Subsequently, the
    retrieved IOPs are converted into TSM concentration by applying conversion factors.
    The TSM estimation process incorporates scaling factors for b(part) and b(wit),
    termed as f (ac-b(part)) and f (ac-b(wit)), respectively (Eq. (1)). The fixed
    values of these conversion factors used by the C2RCC processor for TSM concentration
    can be found in Table 2. (1) Table 2. The fixed quantities of conversion factors

    achieve the aims of the study, a distinctive model was devised to estimate the
    average concentration of TSM in the lake, utilizing solely wind speed as input,
    we utilized five machine learning methodologies: linear regression (LR) as described
    by Freedman (2009), regression trees (RT) from Verhallen and Bus (2010), support
    vector machines (SVM) introduced by Cortes and Vapnik (1995), Gaussian process
    regression (GPR) detailed by MacKay (2003), and NN models based on Hardesty (2017),
    that each of these algorithms has been previously used in studies investigating
    the relationship between inland water quality and RS data (Parajuli et al., 2022;
    Peterson et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). LR stands as a foundational statistical
    method extensively applied in machine learning and data analysis (Hastie et al.,
    2009; Ndou, 2023). The main objective is to establish a relationship between a
    target variable (labeled as “Y”) and one or more predictor variables (referred
    to as “X”). The model is represented as a linear combination of the independent
    variable, wind speed in this study, with corresponding coefficients (β0, β1, β2,
    …, βn), and an error term (ε) (Eq. (2)) (Freedman, 2009; Hastie et al., 2009).
    These coefficients represent the slope and intercept of the optimal line that
    seeks to reduce the sum of squared discrepancies between the forecasted values
    and the actual outcomes of the dependent variable (Narkhede, 2018). Estimating
    these coefficients commonly involves techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
    (Hastie et al., 2009; Narkhede, 2018; Ndou, 2023), with wind speed being the sole
    feature considered in this study. (2) RT, a powerful machine learning method for
    predictive modeling, constructs a structure through recursive partitioning. It
    begins with a root node representing the entire dataset. Starting with a root
    node representing the entire dataset, the algorithm iteratively selects the best
    feature division at each node until a predefined stopping condition is met (Segal,
    1988; Tian et al., 2023; Verhallen and Bus, 2010). Terminal nodes, or leaf nodes,
    hold prediction values for corresponding data points. Construction involves careful
    selection of features and split points to optimize the chosen criterion (Tan et
    al., 2013; Verhallen and Bus, 2010). To predict values for new data, one traverses
    the tree from the root to a leaf node, obtaining the predicted outcome from the
    mean of target values associated with the data points in that specific leaf node
    (Tan et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2023). SVM, an algorithm for classification and
    regression tasks, identifies an optimal hyperplane to separate data points in
    various classes within a feature space (Burges, 1998; Salas et al., 2022). When
    dealing with linearly separable data, SVM maximizes the margin between support
    vectors, the closest points of distinct classes (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). Mathematically
    defined in Eq. (3), the hyperplane relies on the weight vector (w) and bias term
    (b) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). Solving a convex optimization problem with specific
    constraints, SVM determines optimal values for w and b (Bishop, 2006). For non-linearly
    separable data, SVM employs the kernel trick, using methods like linear, polynomial,
    radial basis function (RBF), or sigmoid to transform data into a more complex
    feature space (Cervantes et al., 2020; Salas et al., 2022). (3) GPR, a non-parametric
    Bayesian machine learning technique prevalent in regression tasks, operates by
    modeling the relationship between input variables and output values as a Gaussian
    process—a probabilistic framework (Sun et al., 2022; Williams and Rasmussen, 2006).
    The underlying principle of GPR centers around modeling the relationship between
    input variables and output values as a Gaussian process, a probabilistic framework
    (MacKay, 2003). Each data point is considered being drawn from a multivariate
    Gaussian distribution, wherein the mean function captures the inherent trend,
    and the covariance function (kernel function) characterizes the smoothness and
    correlations between data points (Rasmussen and Nickisch, 2010). The GPR model,
    as represented in Eq. (4), incorporates f(x) to represent the output at input
    x, m(x) as the mean function, k(x, x’) as the covariance function, and GP denoting
    a Gaussian process (MacKay, 2003). During model fitting, hyperparameters are determined
    from the data using methods like maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches,
    accommodating diverse datasets with varying complexities (Sun et al., 2022; Williams
    and Rasmussen, 2006). Once fitted, GPR enables predictions for new data points,
    offering both point estimates and insights into prediction uncertainty (MacKay,
    2003). (4) NN, a powerful and widely utilized machine learning model, excels in
    tasks such as classification and regression (Arbib, 2003; Niroumand-Jadidi et
    al., 2022). Comprising interconnected nodes (neurons) arranged in layers, NN processes
    and transforms input data to produce desired outputs (Goodfellow et al., 2016;
    Niroumand-Jadidi et al., 2022). The fundamental structure encompasses an input
    layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer (Hardesty, 2017). The number
    of neurons in the input layer aligns with the count of input features, whereas
    in this study, only wind speed is considered. The number of neurons in the output
    layer corresponds to the number of outputs or classes (Hardesty, 2017). An essential
    consideration of NN design involves determining the number of neurons in the hidden
    layers (Goodfellow et al., 2016). While a one-size-fits-all approach does not
    exist, a commonly employed rule, as shown in Eq. (5), suggests, that H denotes
    the number of neurons in each hidden layer and N represents the number of input
    features (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Hardesty, 2017). (5) In crafting and assessing
    the models, MATLAB programming software (MathWorks, 2021) served as the primary
    tool. Fig. 3 illustrates the architectural details of these algorithms. The objective
    was to pinpoint the most effective algorithm tailored for this particular application
    by scrutinizing each model''s capability to predict TSM concentration solely based
    on wind speed data. Download : Download high-res image (629KB) Download : Download

    2.5. Accuracy assessment index To assess the accuracy of water quality parameter
    predictions, various analyses and indicators are commonly employed. In our study,
    we evaluated the effectiveness of our model using four specific metrics: the coefficient
    of determination (R2), mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and
    mean absolute error (MAE), as represented by Eqs. (6), (7), (8), (9). The R2 quantifies
    the fraction of variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent
    variables in the model. The MBE primarily evaluates the model''s average bias,
    assisting in identifying if any rectifications are required to address this bias.
    This metric identifies the mean deviation in the estimations, with a positive
    bias indicating a tendency to overestimate relative to the dataset values. RMSE
    calculates the discrepancies between predicted and true values, while MAE quantifies
    the average size of these prediction errors. Superior model performance is signaled
    by higher R2 scores, reduced RMSE and MAE scores, and MBE figures nearing zero.
    In these equations, and refer to the observed and predicted variable, and n is
    the number of sample data. (6) (7) (8) (9) During the validation phase of the
    machine learning algorithms, a K-fold cross-validation technique was implemented.
    Additionally, a four-fold cross-validation was conducted on the training dataset,
    as illustrated in Fig. 4. The dataset was initially extracted, and the feature
    set was randomly divided into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified
    sampling (Guo et al., 2021; Psychalas et al., 2023). Each fold served as the validation
    set, while the remaining three folds constituted the training set for model training.
    To address imbalances, random under sampling (RUS) was applied to the training
    set, while the validation set remained unchanged. The model underwent training
    using the balanced three-fold training dataset for a specified number of epochs
    and was subsequently tested on the validation fold to generate predictions for
    that specific fold. This process iterated four times with distinct validation
    folds, resulting in four different prediction arrays. These arrays were then consolidated
    to provide predictions for the entire dataset, enabling a comparison with truth
    labels and the subsequent derivation of cross-validation results. Download : Download

    3.1. Remote sensing and on-site constituent values Table 3 provides a comprehensive
    breakdown of on-site data and RS retrieval variables categorized by season in
    CNRs. The on-site data include measurements of turbidity (represented as Tur)
    and wind speed (shown as WS) (Table 3). As previously mentioned, due to the strong
    correlation between turbidity and TSM (Bright et al., 2018; He et al., 2013; Katlane
    et al., 2013b; Putri and Arisalwadi, 2023; Soomets et al., 2020), we utilized
    turbidity data for validation of the TSM results from the C2RCC method, given
    the absence of direct on-site TSM measurements. Furthermore, the RS dataset encompasses
    two primary metrics: the TSM concentration extracted from the C2RCC approach at
    specific sampling sites (denoted as TSM(ss)), and the collective average TSM concentration
    from the C2RCC approach within the CNRs, termed TSM(avg). Table 3. Statistics

    5.9 3.7 Tur and TSM(ss) exhibited wide variability for both MSI and OLI images.
    Tur ranged from 0.0 NTU to 37.4 NTU, with an average of 14.3 ± 8.5 NTU for the
    MSI data. Similarly, for the OLI images, the range was 0.0 NTU to 77.7 NTU, with
    an average of 16.2 ± 11.5 NTU. The concentration of TSM(ss) ranged from 6.9 g/m3
    to 44.7 g/m3, with an average of 20.4 ± 8.1 g/m3 for the MSI data. Likewise, for
    the OLI images, the range was 6.2 g/m3 to 63.8 g/m3, with an average of 22.7 ±
    10.1 g/m3, indicating that the on-site and RS water bodies'' data at measurement
    stations were approximately turbid. The measurements of Tur and TSM(ss) data in
    warm seasons were higher compared to cold seasons; for instance, the average of
    Tur and TSM(ss) values in summer was approximately 43% higher compared to winter
    for MSI images, and a similar trend was observed for the OLI data, with values
    approximately 70% higher during warm seasons. The concentration of TSM(avg) demonstrated
    variability within the MSI and OLI images, ranging from 7.5 g/m3 to 29.7 g/m3,
    with an average of 14.4 ± 5.9 g/m3 for the MSI data. Similarly, for the OLI images,
    the range was 6.2 g/m3 to 29.2 g/m3, with an average of 15.8 ± 5.9 g/m3, indicating
    that the average TSM concentration in CNRs is below 30 g/m3. Similarly, the trends
    observed in Tur and TSM(ss) were also evident in TSM(avg) values, with higher
    concentrations during warm seasons compared to cold seasons. For MSI images, the
    average TSM(avg) values in summer were approximately 48% higher compared to winter,
    while for the OLI data, this difference was approximately 86%. WS statistics values
    exhibited lower variability compared to other parameters. WS ranged from 1.0 m/s
    to 14.0 m/s, with an average of 5.2 ± 3.5 m/s for the MSI data. Similarly, for
    the OLI images, the range was 1.0 m/s to 14.6 m/s, with an average of 5.8 ± 3.7
    m/s. The mean statistics values indicated that wind speed during warm seasons
    was approximately 47% higher than in cold seasons. During summer, which coincides
    with the peak of Levar wind events, the wind speed was approximately 180% higher
    compared to winter. In summary, the data analysis consistently demonstrates elevated
    Tur and TSM(ss) values during warmer seasons in contrast to colder seasons. This
    consistency allows for the effective use of the CNRs turbidity dataset to validate
    TSM results obtained through C2RCC. Furthermore, a parallel trend in statistics
    for WS and TSM(avg) indicates higher values in hot seasons, particularly during
    peak Levar wind events, compared to colder seasons. This supports the application
    of the wind speed and TSM(avg) dataset derived from the C2RCC method in the modeling
    and calibration of the Wind2TSM model. 3.2. Assessment of TSM C2RCC-based estimates
    In assessing the precision of the C2RCC method for estimating TSM concentration
    in the arid lakes of CNRs, where direct on-site TSM data were unavailable, the
    analysis utilized on-site turbidity data. This choice was informed by the established
    high correlation between turbidity and TSM, as documented in existing literature.
    (Bright et al., 2018; He et al., 2013; Katlane et al., 2013b; Putri and Arisalwadi,
    2023; Soomets et al., 2020). The correlation analysis between TSM concentration,
    derived through the C2RCC method, and actual turbidity data from CNRs sampling
    stations is depicted in Fig. 5. In the Sentinel-2 MSI imagery (Fig. 5-A), a robust
    relationship between C2RCC-derived TSM concentration and field-collected turbidity
    data is evident, supported by a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95. Similarly,
    assessments for Landsat-8 OLI imagery (Fig. 5-B) showcase a noteworthy association
    between the two metrics, with an R value of 0.96. Download : Download high-res

    that the TSM C2RCC-based estimates at sampling stations exceeded 40 g/m3, with
    an approximate average of 21 g/m3 (Table 3; Fig. 5). In contrast, the on-site
    turbidity data had a maximum value of 77.7 NTU, with an approximate average of
    16 NTU (Table 3; Fig. 5), clearly indicating that the water bodies were turbid
    at certain times of the year. 3.3. Analyzing the relationship between C2RCC image-derived
    TSM and wind speed The exploration of the correlation between TSM concentration
    and wind speed centered on the assessment of TSM data extracted from C2RCC imagery.
    Illustrated in Fig. 6 are examples of multi-temporal MSI and OLI imagery portraying
    TSM concentration derived from the C2RCC method. Specifically, Fig. 6 (i) exhibit
    the multi-temporal MSI and OLI data for four different years, each maintaining
    a constant wind speed. Across the four MSI images of TSM from 2018 to 2021, with
    an average wind speed of approximately 3 m/s, there is a notable stability in
    TSM concentration within CNRs. Likewise, visual examination of the OLI data reveals
    a consistent pattern of low variation in TSM from 2017 to 2021, maintaining an
    average wind speed of around 2 m/s. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    C2RCC method for MSI and OLI on days with constant wind speed. (ii) Multi-temporal
    TSM maps derived from the C2RCC method for MSI (above) and OLI (below), depicting
    imagery for four distinct wind conditions: (A) Light air, (B) Light breeze, (C)
    Moderate breeze, (D) Strong breeze. Orange arrow indicates the direction of the
    wind. Fig. 6 (ii) display the multi-temporal MSI and OLI data under four distinct
    wind scenarios, characterized according to the Beaufort wind force scale (Davis,
    2016; Weaver et al., 2021). These conditions are: light air, light breeze, moderate
    breeze, and strong breeze (Davis, 2016; Soria et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2021).
    On days characterized by light air (seen in Fig. 6 (ii)-A) with wind speeds around
    1.5 m/s, TSM concentrations, as derived from the C2RCC method, are relatively
    low. However, when the wind speeds escalate to roughly 3 m/s, marking the light
    breeze conditions, there''s a noticeable uptick in TSM concentration values (depicted
    in Fig. 6 (ii)-B). Moving to moderate breeze days with wind speeds touching 6
    m/s (as shown in Fig. 6 (ii)-C), TSM levels persistently rise, with a pronounced
    effect near the CNRs'' edges. In stark contrast, Fig. 6 (ii)-D captures how TSM
    concentrations surge when wind speeds cross the 10 m/s threshold, typical of strong
    breeze days. This pronounced TSM increase is particularly evident on the eastern
    flanks of the CNRs and along the reservoir perimeters. A crucial observation is
    the dominant wind trajectory, symbolized by an orange arrow, which emerges from
    the northwest and directs southeastward. Due to this pattern, CNR 1 and 2, as
    well as the northern part of CNR 3, exhibit higher values of TSM. This pattern
    influences higher TSM values in CNR 1 and 2, as well as the northern part of CNR
    3. The color bar remains consistent for better interpretation, although TSM values
    exceed 30 g/m3 in certain areas. To further evaluate the relationship between
    TSM concentration and wind speed, we examined the multi-temporal profiles of the
    retrieved averaged TSM concentration from the C2RCC method and on-site wind speed
    data. The analysis covered the period from April 2017 to September 2020 for OLI
    data and from June 2017 to September 2020 for MSI data. Fig. 7 illustrates the
    multi-temporal profiles of the averaged TSM C2RCC-based estimates, denoted as
    TSM(C2RCC-Ave), in conjunction with the corresponding on-site wind speed data
    for CNRs. Download : Download high-res image (298KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Multi-temporal profiles of averaged TSM from C2RCC and on-site wind
    speed for MSI (A) and OLI images (B). The relationship between C2RCC-based averaged
    TSM estimates and on-site wind speed data is vividly illustrated through trend
    lines, depicted individually for MSI (Fig. 7-A) and OLI imagery (Fig. 7-B). Notably,
    a strong correlation emerges between these parameters, especially during the spring
    and summer months, aligning with the Levar wind event. During this period, elevated
    wind speeds correspond to an observable upward trend in average TSM values across
    our arid region lakes (Fig. 7). It is crucial to highlight that there is a minimal
    time delay between the initiation and intensification of wind speed and the subsequent
    rise in TSM. As previously noted, daily reports encompassed six time points from
    (00:00) to (15:00) at three-hour intervals. To enable a precise examination of
    the correlation between RS images and wind speed data, a linear interpolation
    was conducted between wind speed data at (09:00) and (12:00), aligning with the
    nearest time to the satellite overpass (≈ 10:00 local time). Fig. 8 illustrates
    the multi-temporal profiles of averaged TSM from C2RCC and on-site wind speed
    for various days spanning 2017 to 2020. The figure reveals that when wind speed
    exceeds 10 [m/s], TSM values are consistently above 20 [g/m3]. Noteworthy is the
    observation that in cold seasons, characterized by lower wind speeds, a sudden
    increase in wind speed leads to a corresponding rise in TSM. This is evident in
    the data for November 13, 2017, where wind speed approached 12 [m/s], correlating
    with an increase in TSM, while the preceding days (November 11 and 12) exhibited
    lower wind speeds. Conversely, during warm seasons, particularly during the Levar
    wind events, higher wind speeds coincide with elevated TSM values. Thus, it is
    apparent that wind speed acts as a driving factor in the region, with an immediate
    increase in TSM following elevated wind speeds. The insights provided by Fig.
    8 underscore that the timing delay of wind speed in our study is not a critical
    factor. The wind speed feature emerges as a significant influence on TSM, where
    an instantaneous rise in wind speed corresponds to an immediate increase in TSM
    values. Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download : Download full-size

    speed on TSM values. 3.4. Development and validation of Wind2TSM models In line
    with the insights detailed in Section 2.4.2, our focus shifted to developing the
    Wind2TSM models, aimed at predicting TSM concentration in CNRs exclusively through
    wind speed data. Leveraging the substantial correlation between on-site wind speed
    and the derived averaged TSM concentration from the C2RCC method, these models
    were constructed. The Wind2TSM models employ diverse machine learning algorithms,
    encompassing LR, RT, SVM, GPR, and NN. Evaluating the efficacy of these models
    demanded a thorough comparison of the TSM estimates derived from wind speed, employing
    R2, RMSE, MAE, and MBE as performance metrics. Table 4 encapsulates the comprehensive
    evaluation outcomes for the diverse algorithms across both the training and validation
    phases. Table 4. An evaluation of Wind2TSM models utilizing varying algorithms.

    1.457 0.034 Table 4 presents compelling evidence of the NN algorithm''s superior
    performance relative to other models. In the training phase, the NN model exhibits
    a high level of agreement with TSM C2RCC-based estimates, with an R2 value of
    0.88, RMSE of 1.970 g/m3, and MAE of 1.33. The results indicate that the NN model
    outperforms the RT model with an approximately 14% increase in R2. Moreover, in
    terms of RMSE and MAE, the NN model shows a significant decrease of approximately
    29% and 36% respectively, compared to the RT model. Similarly, the comparison
    of the NN model with LR, SVM, and GPR models reveals that the NN model outperforms
    these models as well, with an approximately 10% increase in R2. Moreover, the
    NN model achieves a noteworthy decrease of about 24% and 29% in RMSE and MAE,
    respectively, in contrast to LR, SVM, and GPR models. Fig. 9 demonstrates the
    findings of the matchup validation analysis, which compares the performance of
    various algorithms for estimating averaged TSM concentration based on wind speed
    data. Among the algorithms, the poorest performing model is the RT algorithm,
    referred to as Wind2TSM-RT (Fig. 9-B). The assessment index for this model is:
    R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 3.342 g/m3, MAE = 2.43. One notable limitation of this algorithm
    is its tendency to provide the same TSM concentration values for a range of input
    wind speeds (Fig. 9-B). Next is the GPR model, named Wind2TSM-GPR (Fig. 9-D),
    which demonstrates a 15% improvement in R2 compared to Wind2TSM-RT, along with
    approximately 18% decreases in both RMSE and MAE. The SVM model, labeled as Wind2TSM-SVM
    (visible in Fig. 9-C), along with the LR model, dubbed Wind2TSM-LR (shown in Fig.
    9-A), both exhibit notable enhancements. Specifically, there''s an around 18%
    boost in R2, coupled with roughly 21% reductions in both RMSE and MAE when juxtaposed
    with Wind2TSM-RT. Nevertheless, the pinnacle of performance is attained by the
    NN model, termed Wind2TSM-Net, as illustrated in Fig. 9-E.Wind2TSM-Net exhibits
    a notable R2 improvement of approximately 27%, reaching a value of 0.84. Additionally,
    the RMSE and MAE values decrease by approximately 40%, reaching 2.01 g/m3 and
    1.45, respectively, compared to Wind2TSM-RT. Notably, the limited data points
    that fall outside the error line of ±20% indicate the superior accuracy of the
    optimal model, Wind2TSM-Net (Fig. 9-E). Furthermore, it is important to mention
    that all Wind2TSM models tend to overestimate, albeit to a low degree, with the
    best optimal model, Wind2TSM-Net, exhibiting the least overestimation. Download

    assessment of Wind2TSM models To assess the effectiveness of the Wind2TSM models
    and investigate their temporal applicability for predicting TSM concentration
    based on wind speed, we utilized ten separate sets of on-site wind speed data
    collected between January and June 2021. These datasets were instrumental in predicting
    mean TSM concentrations using the Wind2TSM models, and the outcomes were compared
    with TSM average concentrations obtained from C2RCC. Originally developed using
    data spanning April 2017 to September 2020, the Wind2TSM models were subjected
    to scrutiny with the 2021 data (10 sets) to evaluate their performance consistency
    across different time periods, thereby showcasing their temporal transferability.
    Fig. 10 displays the results of the temporal transferability assessment of Wind2TSM
    models, which compares their performance in estimating averaged TSM concentration
    based on independent wind speed data. The Wind2TSM-GPR model (Fig. 10-D) demonstrates
    the poorest performance in terms of temporal transferability, with assessment
    index values of (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 4.75 g/m3, MAE = 3.66). The Wind2TSM-SVM (Fig.
    10-C) and Wind2TSM-LR (Fig. 10-A) models show similar performance for temporal
    transferability, with the difference being that the Wind2TSM-SVM model underestimates,
    while the Wind2TSM-LR model overestimates. Next, the Wind2TSM-Net model shows
    improvement in R2 by 4% compared to Wind2TSM-GPR, and in terms of RMSE and MAE,
    there is a decrease of approximately 10% and 17% respectively, compared to Wind2TSM-GPR
    (Fig. 10-E). While the Wind2TSM-Net does exhibit overestimation, it''s noteworthy
    that its MBE reduces almost 30% relative to Wind2TSM-GPR. The top-tier efficacy
    in assessing the temporal adaptability of Wind2TSM models for predicting TSM concentrations
    is marked by Wind2TSM-RT, as illustrated in Fig. 10-B. This model shows an increase
    in R2 by approximately 10% and a decrease in RMSE and MAE by about 18% and 16%
    respectively (Fig. 10-B). However, it should be noted that Wind2TSM-RT provides
    the same TSM concentration values for a range of input wind speeds, which may
    not be recommended. Considering the results, we rely on Wind2TSM-Net for temporal
    transferability of TSM concentration, as it demonstrates good accuracy with assessment
    index values of (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.29 g/m3, MAE = 3.06). Download : Download

    Network models. The aim of this study was to predict TSM concentration exclusively
    using wind speed, leveraging the well-established correlation between these two
    variables. We began our analysis by validating TSM estimates from the C2RCC method
    against on-site turbidity data, employing an optimal machine-learning model, as
    depicted in Fig. 5. The robust correlation identified between the projected TSM
    values and actual ground-based turbidity data reaffirms the credibility of our
    correlation study. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the C2RCC approach
    and the MSI and OLI datasets in accurately assessing TSM concentrations for RS
    applications. In Section 3.3, the study focused on assessing the correlation between
    imaged-derived TSM concentration maps based on C2RCC and wind speed (Fig. 6).
    Visual examination demonstrated a strong relationship between wind speed and TSM
    concentration maps. Particularly during the Levar wind event in spring and summer,
    higher wind speeds corresponded to increased TSM values, especially along the
    boundaries and in CNR 1, 2, and the northern part of CNR 3 (Fig. 6-(ii)). Given
    the arid and remote nature of our study lakes, where wind plays a significant
    role and other environmental factors like precipitation have limited influence,
    wind speed emerges as a crucial factor shaping TSM dynamics in these regions.
    Additionally, we analyzed the multi-temporal profiles of averaged TSM concentration
    and wind speed (Fig. 7). The findings suggest that in CNRs, the TSM concentration
    is profoundly influenced by the intensity of the wind speed. Events like heavy
    storms with higher wind speeds led to a noticeable rise in TSM concentration due
    to the transport of suspended sediments into the reservoirs. These findings underscore
    the importance of considering wind speed as a critical factor when studying TSM
    concentration in reservoirs, especially in regions susceptible to severe weather
    events that can significantly affect sediment dynamics in water bodies. By incorporating
    wind speed data into water quality assessments, researchers and managers can gain
    valuable insights to develop more effective strategies for maintaining water quality
    in these regions. Moreover, this integration can help mitigate the impacts of
    severe weather events on aquatic ecosystems, leading to enhanced understanding
    and better management of TSM concentration in arid region lakes. The successful
    development of the Wind2TSM model, focusing on TSM concentration estimation through
    wind speed data (Section 3.4), has yielded notable results. Particularly, the
    Wind2TSM-Net model represents a significant advancement in accurately predicting
    TSM concentration in CNRs solely based on wind speed data (Fig. 11). This model
    has substantial potential to inform water quality management strategies and enhance
    our comprehension of the factors influencing TSM concentration in these regions.
    Moreover, its applicability extends to other arid ecosystems, especially those
    susceptible to severe weather events, providing valuable insights for water quality
    management practices. To comprehensively assess the performance of the Wind2TSM-Net
    model, we compared the multi-temporal profiles of averaged TSM concentration from
    C2RCC and the Wind2TSM-Net model, alongside on-site wind speed data during a Levar
    wind event in Fig. 11. The results reveal a robust correlation between average
    TSM concentration and wind speed, underscoring the critical role of wind speed
    in TSM concentration studies in CNRs. Furthermore, the findings highlight the
    Wind2TSM-Net model''s accuracy in estimating average TSM concentration during
    the Levar wind event. These results reinforce the Wind2TSM-Net model''s reliability
    in estimating TSM concentration based on wind speed data, emphasizing its significance
    in water quality assessment and management. With the potential to enhance water
    quality monitoring and support decision-making processes, the Wind2TSM-Net model
    emerges as a valuable tool for sustainable water resource management in arid regions
    and beyond. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 11. Temporal variations of TSM and wind speed; before, during, and
    after a Levar wind event. In the realm of TSM concentration prediction based solely
    on wind speed data, our study stands as a pioneering endeavor, venturing where
    limited research has tread. Leveraging RS techniques, satellite imagery, and advanced
    machine learning, we embark on the unprecedented task of developing an optimal
    algorithm, Wind2TSM-Net, to estimate TSM in arid regions characterized by high
    erosion, relying exclusively on wind speed data. Comparing our study with recent
    research in the field of retrieving ecological parameters based on RS data, such
    as (Cao et al., 2023; Matsui et al., 2021; Sedighkia and Datta, 2023; Wang et
    al., 2021), our work stands out for its independence from satellite imagery in
    final model. Unlike the studies mentioned, which rely directly on RS data to develop
    their models, our final algorithm is based solely on wind speed data for retrieving
    TSM values. Essentially, we indirectly utilize physically RS techniques to achieve
    one of the main goals of the study, resulting in our model being solely based
    on wind speed factors in an arid and remote area. Moreover, the existing literature
    reveals a scarcity of studies focusing on the generation of TSM concentration
    based on wind speed data, particularly in lakes with similar environmental conditions.
    To address this gap, we introduce our Wind2TSM-Net model, designed to estimate
    TSM concentration using wind speed data. To validate the effectiveness of our
    model, we compare it with recent studies that investigate the relationship between
    TSM concentration and wind speed. For instance, in a study by Gao et al. (2021)
    focusing on TSM concentration in Changdang Lake, a linear relationship was established,
    resulting in an R2 value of 0.53. Remarkably, our study exhibits an approximately
    66% increase in the R2 value, showcasing the superior performance of Wind2TSM-Net.
    Similarly, in a study by Zhang et al. (2014), evaluating Lake Topography and Wind
    Waves in Turbid Lake Taihu, China, a linear relationship between daily average
    wind speed and TSM derived from MERIS was developed, yielding an R2 value of 0.68.
    Notably, our study observes an approximately 30% increase in the R2 value, emphasizing
    the enhanced performance of our model. It is noteworthy that the study used 53
    data points, approximately 33% fewer than in our study. In another study by Shi
    et al. (2015), assessing long-term remote monitoring of TSM concentration in Lake
    Taihu using MODIS, the impact of wind speed on TSM is well-illustrated. Despite
    the study''s primary goal being distinct from ours, it effectively showcases the
    robust relationship between these two factors. Furthermore, our study, with a
    broader range of wind speed data, provides clearer observations. Zhao et al. (2018)’study,
    focused on the estimation of TSM in turbid coastal waters using hyperspectral
    satellite imagery, demonstrated an R2 value of 0.6. Our study surpasses this,
    exhibiting an approximately 40% increase in the R2 value. Notably, Zhou''s study
    used 53 data points, with a lower number for modeling compared to our study. Similarly,
    in a study by Soria et al. (2021), examining TSM concentration in Albufera of
    Valencia using Sentinel-2 images, an exponential model between wind speed and
    TSM concentration yielded an R2 value of 0.70. Our Wind2TSM-Net model displayed
    an approximately 38% increase in the R2 value, highlighting its enhanced accuracy.
    Importantly, the number of data points in Soria''s study was 27, approximately
    66% lower than in our study. Further delving into the evaluation of Wind2TSM models,
    we conducted a temporal transferability analysis (Section 3.5). Utilizing independent
    on-site wind speed data collected from January to June 2021, we assessed the models''
    ability to maintain accuracy across different periods. Among the models scrutinized,
    Wind2TSM-Net emerges as the top performer (Fig. 10). Considering the challenges
    of measuring water quality parameters during the Levar wind season and the remote
    location of the study area, Wind2TSM-Net stands out as a robust and applicable
    model for this region. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives Presenting a pioneering
    approach, our study centers on the development of an innovative machine learning
    model designed to predict TSM concentration values in lakes solely utilizing wind
    speed data, with a particular emphasis on CNRs in Iran. The primary objective
    revolves around exploring the feasibility of constructing a robust TSM monitoring
    model tailored for lakes, leveraging the well-established correlation between
    TSM concentration and wind speed. This investigation integrates on-site wind speed
    measurements with TSM data extracted from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8
    OLI satellite imagery. Employing the Wind2TSM models, a machine learning-based
    methodology, we proceed to estimate TSM concentration solely based on on-site
    wind speed data, decoupled from satellite imagery. In the comparative evaluation
    of Regression versus NN models for TSM estimation with wind speed, our results
    indicate superior performance in NN algorithms. Notably, NN models demonstrate
    a substantial improvement in R2, approximately 30% compared to other algorithms.
    Furthermore, the RMSE and MAE values witness a notable decrease of approximately
    40%, respectively, in contrast to alternative approaches. The Temporal Transferability
    assessment highlights the Wind2TSM-Net model''s superiority, showcasing a 5% improvement
    in R2 compared to other models. Additionally, in terms of RMSE and MAE, Wind2TSM-Net
    exhibits a noteworthy decrease of approximately 15% compared to other Wind2TSM
    models. Wind2TSM-Net excels in accurate TSM estimation with wind speed, boasting
    an impressive R2 value of 0.88, RMSE of 1.97 g/m3, MAE of 1.33, and MBE of 0.003.
    The model showcases heightened TSM retrieval during warm seasons, aligning with
    the Levar wind phenomenon in CNRs. Delving into the variations in TSM concentration
    during the Levar wind season, the study evaluates the averaged TSM concentration
    retrieved by the Wind2TSM-Net model, unveiling higher concentrations during this
    specific season compared to others. The performance assessment of Wind2TSM-Net
    yields satisfactory results. These findings underscore the Wind2TSM-Net model''s
    potential in accurately estimating TSM concentration solely based on wind speed
    data, even in remote and inaccessible areas, and during severe weather events
    when no other data is available. This capability positions the model as a valuable
    asset for improved water quality management strategies, enhanced understanding
    of environmental impacts on aquatic ecosystems, and support for sustainable development
    practices. The successful development of this model has the potential to revolutionize
    TSM monitoring practices, offering an efficient and cost-effective tool for water
    quality management. Looking ahead, the profound implications of our study extend
    into the future of environmental research and water quality management. The Wind2TSM-Net
    model, with its exceptional accuracy in TSM estimation based solely on wind speed
    data, emerges as a transformative tool for researchers and managers. Its capacity
    to provide precise estimates, even in remote areas and during severe weather events,
    signifies a pivotal advancement. This model has the potential to redefine TSM
    monitoring practices, offering an efficient and cost-effective solution. Empowering
    decision-makers, the Wind2TSM-Net model contributes to proactive water quality
    management, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. As we chart
    the course forward, considerations for newer algorithms, comparative case studies,
    and the application of advanced machine learning methods promise to unlock new
    dimensions in TSM estimation, ensuring the model''s continued relevance and impact.

  description: Ocean monitoring systems are designed for continuous monitoring of
    the seas and oceans to track their evolution and thus anticipate environmental
    issues. However, they are often based on Internet of Things (IoT) systems that
    are expensive, hard to maintain, and offer little spatial coverage. An emerging
    alternative is Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) systems that offer good geographical
    coverage but, as a reliable and real-time monitoring system, they also face several
    challenges such as environmental conditions, spatio-temporal granularity, terrain
    oleography, etc. This paper introduces an easy-to-use software tool to crawl water-quality
    data from up to 6 satellite instruments (i.e. Sentinel 3A, Sentinel-3B, NOAA VIIRS,
    SNPP VIIRS, Aqua MODIS, Terra MODIS) of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Coopernicus
    system and NASA's Marine Environmental Monitoring Service. We also provide an
    in-depth analysis in terms of reliability and data coverage for the chlorophyll-a
    (Chl-a) in a highly anthropised local/regional context like the Mar Menor lagoon
    (Murcia, Spain), where serious socio-environmental issues are arising due to the
    eutrophication process. Our results show a good linear correlation between in
    situ data, obtained by several Spanish public institutions since 2016, and data
    generated by the IRTM-NN (Inverse Radiative Transfer Model-Neural Network) algorithm
    of Sentinel 3 in general, reaching coefficient correlation values close to 0.9.
    They also show that organic matter inputs from ephemeral streams are relevant
    in determining Chl-a concentrations. Moreover, the temporal coverage using a single
    instrument is rather limited, as no data were recorded for 80% of the days studied.
    This figure decreases to 30% when data from the 6 satellite instruments are combined,
    increasing the temporal granularity of the measurements from approximately 5 to
    1.5 days, suggesting the need for a combination of these systems for a robust
    SRS system.

    Ocean monitoring systems are designed for continuous monitoring of the seas and

    remote sensingData coverageQuantitative validation 1. Introduction Remote sensing
    is gaining relevance in recent years as it offers the monitoring of different
    habitats around the globe such as forest (Lechner et al., 2020), agriculture fields
    (Huang et al., 2018), soil moisture (Pezij et al., 2020), urban environments (Singh,
    2019), archaeological and cultural heritage (Luo et al., 2019), Oceans (Martin,
    2014), Rivers (Beveridge et al., 2020) or Rainfall driven hazards (Wright et al.,
    2017), just to name a few. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS); i.e., monitoring systems
    based on sensors aboard satellites that detect and record reflected or emitted
    energy, are increasingly available, offering global coverage, frequent acquisition,
    and high spatial resolution (Chuvieco, 2016). Beyond obtaining satellite images
    with high-quality geometric and radiometric information, many biogeophysical parameters
    have been obtained from the processing of these images (Sowmya et al., 2017; Vos
    et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2013). For instance, from the spatial and spectral
    ranges provided by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor,
    44 different standard data products have been developed and are classified into
    Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere and Ocean products (Justice et al., 2002). Moreover,
    the continuous development of new retrieval algorithms and the launch of new high-quality
    satellites has led to the development of various satellite products with different
    spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions, such as ESA''s Sentinels missions
    (Malenovskỳ et al., 2012) and the NPP VIIRS products (Justice et al., 2013). SRS
    data is becoming popular for near real-time (NRT) monitoring systems to address
    natural and societal challenges such as shedding light on global and regional
    challenges, thereby supporting several initiatives (e.g. Sendai Framework, Paris
    Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals) (Grainger and Kim, 2020; Noe et al.,
    2022; Walz et al., 2020). However, SRS-based products, including algorithms and
    associated model parameters, are often unknown from a global perspective, but
    their effectiveness and feasibility are ignored at the local/regional scale. As
    a result, large discrepancies might exist between satellite-derived products and
    the actual state of surface parameters (Wu et al., 2019). In addition, other factors
    affect the accuracy of these products such as the state of the local atmosphere,
    and the characteristics of the earth or ocean surface, among others. Undoubtedly,
    biases between in situ and satellite-derived satellite products for a given variable
    or discrepancies of the same product over different regions, not only reduce their
    usefulness in applications but also reduce the accuracy of their downstream products.
    Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly investigate the accuracy of SRS-based
    products in the system under study to improve its quantitative application before
    developing a particular SRS-based monitoring system. In this paper, we deeply
    analyse SRS data acquired from public ESA and NASA-related products to monitor
    the Mar Menor coastal lagoon (Murcia, Spain); a local ecosystem at risk of collapse.
    The Mar Menor is the largest hypersaline coastal lagoon in Europe and is listed
    as a RAMSAR site (Casini et al., 2015). It was chosen as an example to carry out
    this research as it has intensified pressures (e.g. agriculture, tourism, fishing,
    urbanisation, eutrophication, pollution, flash floods, climate change) that have
    led to environmental deterioration and near collapse — last year more than 5 t
    of dead fish washed up on its shores. The high mortality is attributed to lack
    of oxygen in the water due to massive algal blooms (Ruiz et al., 2021). Therefore,
    this paper focuses on the Chl-a concentration as a key indicator of the eutrophication
    status of this ecosystem (Gunia et al., 2022). Several works have been proposed
    for developing SRS-based monitoring systems (Caballero et al., 2022; Erena et
    al., 2019; Gómez et al., 2021) for this variable. However, these works assume
    the validity of the data obtained by satellite systems, focusing mainly on one
    or two satellite sources, mainly Sentinel-derived products, without going into
    the process of validation and/or coverage of all existing products for this lagoon.
    This validation process, developed in this article, is critical in this unique
    ecosystem due to the limited in situ data coverage, the large spatial scale mismatch
    between in situ measurements and remotely sensed pixels, the lack of understanding
    of the intrinsic heterogeneity of land and ocean surfaces (Andersen et al., 2021),
    which release nutrients into the lagoon, the shortcomings and deficiency of theories
    on the scale problem embedded in validation, and the absence of the most reliable
    in situ dataset with continuity, completeness and consistency. Therefore, the
    main contributions of this article include the following: • A quantitative and
    qualitative validation of up to six different SRS-based products for Chl-a concentration
    detection is provided, including Sentinel-3A OLCI, Sentinel-3B OLCI, NOAA VIIRS,
    SNPP VIRRS, Aqua MODIS, and Terra MODIS, for a local/regional coastal lagoon.
    • A comparison of in situ variable detection vs. SRS is carried out to analyse
    the impact of different geospatial and environmental variables that may be relevant
    in the SRS data generation, such as land surface heterogeneity, lagoon depth,
    proximity to the shore, biogeochemical conditions, large-scale spatial mismatch
    between in situ measurements and remotely sensed pixels, etc. • An automatic crawling
    module has been developed to obtain information from different SRS products by
    setting GPS coordinates as input. • Sentinel-3 IRTM-NN algorithm offers the best
    performance for a near real-time surveillance system in a local/regional environment
    such as the Mar Menor. However, we identify the need to complement different systems
    to achieve a higher measurement coverage, going from 19% to 70% of annual daily
    coverage. The rest of the article is structured as follows. First of all, materials
    and methods carried out in this work are described in Section 3. Then, we show
    the quantitative results offered by all SRS-based products for monitoring the
    Mar Menor coastal lagoon in Section 4. Finally, Section 6 ends with some conclusions
    and future work directions. 2. Related work Satellite technology has markedly
    expanded our capabilities for assessing water quality on a planetary scale. Contemporary
    missions are increasingly equipped with sophisticated instruments specifically
    calibrated to discern aquatic characteristics, thereby facilitating the measurement
    of critical water quality parameters through advanced remote sensing algorithms.
    For instance, the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 provides
    extensive datasets for oceanic and coastal water monitoring (Shen et al., 2020).
    These missions contribute significantly to our comprehensive understanding of
    the Earth''s hydrosphere''s health. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged in
    the literature that the calibration protocols, predominantly tailored for the
    open ocean''s optically simpler waters, may not directly translate to the more
    complex optical properties of turbid shallow waters found in inland lakes and
    coastal zones (Loisel et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2015). This discrepancy underscores
    the necessity for region-specific calibration efforts to enhance the accuracy
    of satellite-derived data in these ecologically distinct environments (Chen et
    al., 2020). A multitude of scholarly inquiries have underscored the efficacy of
    SRS in monitoring Chl-a levels across diverse aquatic milieus. Such studies are
    particularly salient when grappling with the intrinsic complexities of shallow
    water bodies. Seminal work by (Gitelson et al., 2011; Li et al., 2017) has been
    instrumental in delineating the correlation between Chl-a concentrations and specific
    spectral bands—namely, the blue, green, red, and near-infrared wavelengths—leveraging
    the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and
    Aqua satellites. These methodologies, while invaluable, encounter limitations
    when applied to the optically complex and variable environments of shallow waters,
    a testament to the ongoing evolution of satellite technologies and their spectral
    sensitivities. The landscape of aquatic environmental monitoring has been notably
    transformed by recent technological advancements, particularly through the integration
    of machine learning (ML) methodologies with satellite data interpretation. Pioneering
    studies by (Cao et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2008) have marked a
    significant leap in refining the precision of satellite-derived analytical processes,
    particularly for the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. Notably, (Binh et al.,
    2022) have spearheaded the development of sophisticated algorithms tailored for
    atmospheric correction, optimized for application with data from the Sentinel-3
    satellite. Their research has yielded algorithms that demonstrate marked efficacy
    in the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations within the optically complex waters
    of shallow lakes. The Mar Menor, a unique coastal lagoon, has become a focal point
    for SRS research, providing a rich dataset for innovative studies. Key research
    conducted by (Caballero et al., 2022; Erena et al., 2019; Gómez et al., 2021;
    González-Enrique et al., 2023) has been instrumental in elucidating the utility
    of data from Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel-2 satellites in environmental monitoring
    endeavors. These studies have not only validated the robust application of SRS
    within the Mar Menor''s context but have also been at the forefront of developing
    and implementing novel algorithms that enhance Chl-a estimation, among other environmental
    variables. Despite these advancements, the research also underscores the inherent
    challenges associated with remote sensing in such dynamic environments. Issues
    such as temporal data gaps stemming from satellite revisit cycles and the critical
    need for data synchronization with in-situ measurements are salient, as underscored
    by (González-Enrique et al., 2023). These challenges necessitate a concerted effort
    to refine data collection methods and algorithmic approaches, aiming to bridge
    the observational intervals and integrate diverse data streams for a more comprehensive
    environmental analysis. The application of SRS to the monitoring of shallow waters
    such as the Mar Menor is fraught with challenges (Mizuno et al., 2018), including,
    but not limited to, the paucity of high caliber in-situ datasets, spatial inconsistencies
    between ground-based measurements and remote sensing pixels, and the propensity
    to ignore the inherent heterogeneity of land and sea surfaces that contribute
    to nutrient dynamics within the lagoon (Jiménez-Navarro et al., 2023). In addition,
    theoretical gaps persist, particularly in terms of reconciling scale differences
    during validation processes [Doe et al., 2021]. Given these complexities, meticulous
    initial analysis is essential to determine the most appropriate remote sensing
    data source that can address the distinctive ecological nuances inherent in regions
    such as the Mar Menor. 3. Materials and methods This section provides a full description
    of the lagoon ecosystem to be monitored, focusing on the critical points of interest
    for SRS. Then, it describes the in-situ reference data used for the validation
    of the SRS data, before showing remote sensing monitoring instruments themselves
    and the data compilation tool for crawling their information. 3.1. Mar Menor coastal
    lagoon One of the largest coastal lagoons in Europe and the largest on the Iberian
    Peninsula, the Mar Menor is a coastal lagoon in Murcia (Southeastern Spain). This
    lagoon is relatively shallow, with an average depth of 3.6 m and a maximum depth
    of 7 m. It is isolated from the Mediterranean Sea by a 22 km long sandy coastal
    barrier (called La Manga). La Manga is crossed by several gullies, which determines
    the semiconfined nature of its waters and gives them unique salinity and temperature
    characteristics (see Fig. 1). In addition to its importance from an environmental
    point of view, the Mar Menor is also a key place for the economy of the Murcia
    Region. The unique climatic conditions and rich natural resources of the region
    have not only fostered tourism and recreational activities but have also bolstered
    the local economy through fishing and agriculture. The basin that drains the Mar
    Menor is called Campo de Cartagena (CC) and is a long plain of more than with
    a network of ephemeral streams that collect the scarce but intense rainfall (Senent-Aparicio
    et al., 2015). Download : Download high-res image (404KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Mar Menor layout. The Mar Menor has been characterized
    by its oligotrophic waters and by its strong resistance to eutrophication. The
    lagoon''s transparent waters have historically served as its key defining feature,
    but during the past ten years, eutrophic tendencies have emerged (Conesa and Jiménez-Cárceles,
    2007). Inputs with high concentrations of nutrients to the lagoon have grown over
    the past few decades due to changes in agricultural practices in the CC and the
    introduction of intensively irrigated crops. Several studies (Domingo-Pinillos
    et al., 2018; Senent-Aparicio et al., 2021) found that flow transfer from the
    CC aquifer to the Mar Menor lagoon must have been significantly impacted by the
    entry of nitrates and other agrochemical elements from fertilization. These inputs
    caused a dramatic increase in pollution in the lagoon (García-Ayllón, 2019) and
    triggered an eutrophication process, resulting in water quality loss (Jimeno-Sáez
    et al., 2020). In 2016, an extreme eutrophication event resulted in sharp bloom
    of phytoplankton (Mercado et al., 2021) that produced a significant change in
    the quality of the waters, with a substantial increase in turbidity, a change
    in the water colour, and a loss of transparency, with a drop in the depth of Secchi
    disc visibility to less than 1 m. These raised significant concerns among environmentalists
    and those working in the tourism industry, with significant socioeconomic repercussions
    (Garcia-Ayllon, 2018). In September 2019, Chl-a levels significantly increased,
    even exceeding the peak observed in 2016. This was due to surface runoff water
    from the drainage basin that flowed into the Mar Menor as a result of a big storm.
    The driving factors of primary productivity were the enormous volumes of nitrogen,
    phosphorus, organic matter, and sediments drained by runoff (Ruiz-Fernandez et
    al., 2019). Under this scenario, early intervention is required to reduce nutrient
    and other pollutant entry into the lagoon. 3.2. In situ data During the last decade,
    mainly due to environmental problems in the Mar Menor, several periodic in situ
    monitoring campaigns have been carried out by two Spanish public bodies; i.e.,
    the regional government of Murcia (CARM) and the Spanish Oceanographic Institute
    (CSIC-IEO). Fig. 1 shows the Mar Menor layout regarding these monitoring campaigns.
    Fig. 1a shows in situ monitoring points (ISMPs) of CARM (in blue) and CSIC-IEO
    (in green) respectively. It is important to note that these campaigns are still
    being carried out nowadays. Table 1 shows the main figures from this in situ monitoring
    for the data period considered in this article. Table 1. In situ monitoring description.

    2016-05-24 2021-08-26 227 CARM 2016-08-02 2022-02-24 3251 The CARM in situ database
    has been obtained through measurements acquired by the Instituto Murciano de Investigación
    y Desarrollo Agrario y Alimentario (IMIDA) from 2 August 2016 to 24 February 20022
    on an approximately weekly basis. These measurements were taken at 12 points in
    the Mar Menor at different depths (see blue points in Fig. 1b). Overall, the database
    used has an average of 152 field campaigns on different dates for each sampling
    point, with a total of 3251 measurements taken. The instrument used to carry out
    the water quality measurements were a Sea Bird Electronics SBE-19 equipped with
    three fluorimeters to estimate, among other variables, the Chl-a (in mg/m3) (Erena
    et al., 2019). It is important to note that the measurements were always taken
    at the same points with fixed coordinates as shown in Fig. 1b. Similarly, the
    CSIC-IEO in situ database has been obtained through measurements acquired by the
    Spanish Institute of Oceanography (CSIC-IEO) from 24 May 2016 to 26 August 2021
    with an approximate monthly frequency. These measurements have been taken at the
    3 most representative points of the Mar Menor at the shallowest part (see green
    dots in Fig. 1b). Overall, the database used has an average of monthly field campaigns
    on different dates for each sampling point, with a total of 227 measurements taken.
    The measurements of Chl-a (in mg/m3) have been performed by laboratory analysis
    using 0.5 L of water filtered through Whatman GF/F filters for determination of
    the Chl-a concentration by spectrophotometry after overnight extraction in 90%
    acetone at 4–5 °C (SCOR-UNESCO 1966). It is important to note that the measurements
    were always taken at the same points with fixed coordinates. Furthermore, this
    dataset is smaller, as the temporal granularity is lower. However, a more reliable
    Chl-a measurement technique is used that allows us to better differentiate the
    levels of this variable, especially for high Chl-a values, as is shown in Section
    4. 3.3. SRS data As mentioned above, this paper analyses SRS data obtained by
    different satellite products in which data is publicly available. Particularly,
    we focus on monitoring the Mar Menor Chl-a concentration with the main objective
    of developing a near real-time monitoring system for early warning. With that
    in mind, this work focuses on six specific satellite Chl-a products for the collection
    of this variable together with its historical data for further quantitative and
    qualitative validation. Table 2 shows different SRS products under study. The
    first two are products from the European Copernicus Marine Service (CMS) that
    provide free, regular, and systematic authoritative information on the state of
    the Blue (physical), White (sea ice), and Green (biogeochemical) ocean, on a global
    and regional scale. Among several products that Copernicus offers through their
    different platforms, this work focuses on data from Sentinel-3A and B. Both satellites
    have on board the imaging spectrometer Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI)
    that measures solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 21 spectral bands at spatial
    resolution of 300 m. It is important to note that this work focuses on these Sentinel-3-related
    products as they offer daily data from the same world region around the same hour
    (see Table 2) and having a high temporal resolution is essential for the development
    of a monitoring system. Table 2. Main satellite instruments features. Satellite/Instrument

    2002 2006* Sentinel-based data are processed and split into products depending
    on the stage of the process. Thus, OLCI provides three different processing levels.
    This work focuses on Level-2 (L2) data that provides the water Chl-a concentration
    in . OLCI L2 product also provides additional data such as reflectances, Aerosol
    Optical Thickness (AOT), and Diffuse Attenuation coefficient (Kd940), just to
    mention a few. Despite these parameters are not consider in this work, they are
    used by ESA algorithm to calculate the Chl-a data provided. Another important
    feature of OLCI products is the resolution. In this work, we use Water Full Resolution
    (WFR) product that provides the data related to water masses at 300 m resolution.
    Regarding time granularity, the CMS download tool selects files by timeless which
    indicates the period from the image was acquired until it becomes public. Particularly,
    we focus on NTC (Non Time Critical) files that refer to products delivered within
    the next 24/48 h after data acquisition by satellite, in contrast to NRT (Near
    Real Time) which refers to products delivered less than 3 h after acquisition.
    NTC products contain data adjusted and collated using information from other platforms
    thus seems more precise to use this product in the present analysis. Although
    the main goal of this paper is to create a robust, near real-time monitoring system,
    the data coverage for monitoring systems is under study. Therefore, we consider
    the best-case scenario for data coverage provided by SRS sources; i.e., NTC data
    instead of NRT. Anyway, a monitoring system could provide the data in NRT and
    then rewrite it with its NTC data when it becomes available. To obtain the processed
    Chl-a historical data from Sentinel-3A and B, we use CREODIAS (Malinowski et al.,
    2020); a platform that contains the data generated by Sentinel, Envisat, Lansat,
    and other EODATA satellites. Its design allows third-party users to prototype
    and build their value-added services and products. This service allows programmers
    to request the previous Sentinel products easily from Sentinel Hub. In this case,
    the API returns a set of netCDF4 files that contain parameters related to Chl-a,
    GPS coordinates, light reflectances, atmosphere light absorption, etc. Sentinel-based
    products use two different algorithms to obtain Chl-a concentration from this
    raw information. The former is the Maximum Band Ratio (MBR) semi-analytical algorithm
    called OC4Me Chlorophyll ( ) developed by Morel et al. (Morel et al., 2007a).
    This is the latest version of the MERIS pigmentation index algorithm which is
    based on the construction of a polynomial based on the use of a semi-analytical
    model using in situ measurements over the last decades in several open water oceanic
    regions (Bricaud et al., 1998; Morel and Maritorena, 2001). The polynomial is
    based on the Eq. 1 (1) where is the irradiance-reflectance of the bands between
    443, 490 and 510 nm, and represents the band at 560 nm. This calculation is performed
    in a loop that includes the calculation of the irradiance-reflectance from the
    outgoing directional reflectance of the water, which requires a bidirectionality
    correction based on the Chl-a estimate. Convergence is achieved when the difference
    between two successive Chl-a estimates is less than a threshold. We refer the
    reader to (Morel et al., 2007b) for insights in the procedure. The latter algorithm
    to estimate the Chl-a (namely ) is based on the Inverse Radiative Transfer Model-Neural
    Network (IRTM-NN) to estimate from normalised water-leaving reflectance at OLCI
    bands b440 to b674, b709, and . This algorithm relies on neural networks to address
    the problem as a non-linear multiple regression method that drastically reduces
    computational time, once the network is properly trained to fit the coefficients.
    Fortunately, CMS already provides the IRTM-NN model that outputs water-inherent
    optical properties such as total backscattering coefficient ( ), total absorption
    coefficient ( ), phytoplankton absorption coefficient ( ), coloured Detrital and
    Dissolved Material absorption coefficient ( ), Chlorophyll (Chl2) concentration,
    Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration. We refer the reader to (Pahlevan et
    al., 2020) for insights. Regarding NASA-based products, the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership
    (SNPP) and NOAA-20 (previously known JPSS-1) satellites. NOAA-20 was launched
    to replace SNPP whose lifespan was until 2021 although it is still working. Both
    satellites have on board a Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) that
    acquires data almost every day. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanner radiometer that
    collects imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere,
    and oceans in the visible and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum with
    a resolution of 375 and 750 m depending on the band of the electromagnetic spectrum.
    Similar to ESA, NASA provides different sorts of products and levels. Thus, VIIRS
    Level 2 products provide water Chl-a concentration with a resolution of 700 m.
    Moreover, the Aqua and TERRA missions are also part of the NASA-centered international
    Earth Observing System (EOS). Both form a twin system that acquires data from
    the same region at AM and PM respectively. These satellites have on board a Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS acquires images with a 1 km
    resolution every 1 or 2 days. Despite their lifespan being until 2006, they still
    send data periodically. It is important to note that Earthdata API (Maxwell et
    al., 2019) allows to request NASA''s satellite information like CREODIAS. Like
    Sentinel-based products, NASA provides Chl-a measurements in as a part of the
    standard Level-2 OC product suite and the Level-3 CHL product suite. The current
    algorithm is a combination of two; the standard OC3/OC4 (Chl_OCX) band ratio algorithm
    (O''Reilly, 2000) and the colour index (CI) defined by Hu et al. (Hu et al., 2012).
    These algorithms combine in situ measurements of chlor_a and remote sensing reflectances
    in the blue-to-green region of the visible spectrum with, at least, three or more
    sensor bands spanning the 440–670 nm spectral regime. The CI is a difference algorithm
    between the green band reflectances and a linear combination of the blue and red
    band reflectances (see Eq. 2). (2) where and are the instrument-specific wavelengths
    closest to 443, 555 and 670 nm respectively. Eq. 3 shows the OCx algorithm based
    on a polynomial that relates reflectances with chl_a. (3) where the numerator
    is the greatest of several input reflectances values and the coefficients, - ,
    are sensor-specific. These coefficients are the main difference between MODIS
    and VIIRs values. For instance, OC3M MODIS sensor uses . However, OC3V VIIRS sensor
    uses . We refer the reader to (Franz et al., 2012) for insights. Unlike the Mar
    Menor lagoon and as it is described in the papers, this product is restricted
    to relatively clear waters and the overall impact is to reduce artifacts and biases
    in Chl-a recoveries in clear waters due to residual glare, stray light, atmospheric
    correction errors and white or spectral-linear bias errors in reflectances. 3.4.
    Crawling SRS data In the pursuit of enhancing our comprehension of aquatic systems,
    the SMARTLAGOON project has been a pivotal initiative. Through this project, an
    innovative satellite data collection tool was developed, which systematically
    collects water quality data from public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
    of major space agencies including the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This tool is engineered to meet the
    needs of users and third-party applications, providing historical and current
    data insights, thus constructing an organized and coherent time series of varied
    variables obtained by Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) services. The architecture
    of this sophisticated tool is divided into two core components as shown in Fig.
    2. The first component focuses on acquiring satellite imagery for predefined geospatial
    coordinates over a determined period. This process begins with the ingestion of
    GPS coordinates from a custom input file named “stations.csv,” outlining the spatial
    boundaries for data acquisition. This component then proceeds to systematically
    retrieve NetCDF4 file links for each set of coordinates. The data stored within
    these NetCDF files, sourced from either ESA or NASA, include vital parameters
    such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient
    (Kd940), and Chl-a concentrations. Download : Download high-res image (258KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Crawling tool developed to get historical
    and near real-time data from different SRS products. A practical application of
    this tool was demonstrated through the generation of SRS data for over a hundred
    GPS coordinates within the Mar Menor lagoon. This data acquisition was part of
    a broader effort to address the environmental challenges faced by coastal lagoons,
    such as Mar Menor, which have been subject to significant degradation due to climatic
    changes and human activities. A portion of these coordinates was closely matched
    with the Comunidad Autónoma de la Región de Murcia (CARM) and the Consejo Superior
    de Investigaciones Científicas-Instituto Español de Oceanografía (CSIC-IEO) in
    situ Monitoring Points (ISMPs) for qualitative validation. The rest were chosen
    to evaluate the influence of geographical attributes on the remote sensing data,
    including bathymetry and proximity to coastlines. The subsequent component of
    the tool is responsible for converting the raw SRS data into structured Comma-Separated
    Values (CSV) files for each GPS point, creating a daily time series for various
    water quality parameters. The design of the CSV files enables a detailed temporal
    analysis, where each row contains data from a single day and each column represents
    different water quality metrics such as water temperature, suspended particulate
    matter, and Chl-a concentration. Fig. 3 shows the systematic approach employed
    to generate these CSV files for each ISMP, utilizing the “stations.csv” file in
    conjunction with satellite imagery data acquired on a given day. The “stations.csv”
    file serves as a repository of geographical coordinates, specifically latitude
    and longitude, for each designated ISMP. During the processing, these coordinates
    are employed to pinpoint the nearest corresponding pixel within the satellite
    image. This selection of the proximate pixel is integral to ensuring the spatial
    relevance of the satellite data to the physical location of the ISMP. Each pixel
    within the satellite image is a multidimensional entity, encapsulating a suite
    of environmental parameters Chl-a concentrations, diffuse attenuation coefficients
    at 940 nm (Kd_940), and spectral reflectance across various bands, to name a few.

    Fig. 3. CSV data time series creation from satellite image and stations.csv file.
    The retrieval process is meticulously designed to extract these parameters from
    the nearest pixel, thereby encapsulating the local environmental characteristics
    with high fidelity. The extracted values are then systematically transposed into
    a CSV format, with each file corresponding to an individual ISMP. These CSV files
    are subsequently structured to provide a temporal snapshot of the water quality
    and other relevant parameters for each monitoring location, facilitating a robust
    analysis over time. This method of data extraction and conversion from satellite
    imagery to CSV files is essential for the accurate monitoring and assessment of
    aquatic environments. It bridges the divide between remote sensing observations
    and ground truth data, enabling a comprehensive analysis that is both spatially
    and temporally informed. Complementing this data collection tool, the SensingTools
    application was developed as part of SMARTLAGOON''s digital twin concept. This
    decision-making application aims to construct a systemic understanding of the
    socio-environmental interplay affecting coastal lagoons. By synthesizing data
    from diverse sources, including in situ IoT infrastructures, remote sensing, social
    media, and socio-economic datasets, and employing advanced AI, NLP, and citizen
    science models, SensingTools provides real-time monitoring, analysis, and management
    of these delicate ecosystems. This tool not only serves the policy-making process
    but also enhances local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts, making
    it a cornerstone for sustainable management of coastal lagoons. For the Mar Menor
    case study, the SensingTools application is being co-developed with local citizens,
    stakeholders, and policymakers to ensure that it effectively meets their needs
    and fosters engagement in environmental stewardship. The agile methodology applied
    in its development guarantees that the tool remains responsive and relevant to
    the specific requirements of Mar Menor, with the potential to be adapted for use
    in other coastal lagoons. The complete suite of the SRS crawling tool, alongside
    the SensingTools application, forms a robust framework for environmental monitoring
    and decision-making. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations inherent
    in the SRS crawling tool. The crawler is sensitive to alterations in the architecture
    of the targeted websites, necessitating regular updates to maintain algorithmic
    accuracy. This sensitivity underscores the tool''s reliance on the continuous
    availability and accessibility of the websites it queries, a limitation that is
    intrinsic to web-based data collection methodologies. By disclosing these constraints,
    we endeavor to ensure a transparent and comprehensive understanding of the tool''s
    operational parameters. The repository housing the SRS crawling tool and the SensingTools
    application, available at (SMARTLAGOON, 2022), contains essential files that support
    the crawling process, manage API requests, file downloads, and other pivotal operations.
    For those who seek to delve deeper into the operational intricacies of these tools,
    the repository''s README.md file serves as a valuable resource. 4. Results This
    section shows the analysis of raw data obtained from the Earth Data and Coorpenicus
    services for the Chl-a concentration in the Mar Menor. The SRS data is compared
    to the in-situ data previously described in Section 3. Fig. 4 shows the data description
    (i.e. box plot) of all data sources. It is important to note that this figure
    is generated by including historical data from all ISMPs. Download : Download

    of all targeted marine observatory systems (i.e. Copernicus, Modis, VIIRS) along
    with in situ monitoring. In-situ data reported by CSIC-IEO are generated with
    a direct analytical procedure, i.e. they are analysed in the laboratory with spectrophotometer
    techniques as described above. Looking at their distribution, it can be seen that
    the data are highly concentrated, except for an outlier ( ) that was reported
    on October 29, 2019. September and October 2019 brought one of the most dramatic
    episodes in the Mar Menor. In September 2019, a big storm occurred, recording
    500 mm in just one day. This episode of heavy rainfall led to the entry of a large
    amount of sediment into the Mar Menor, which, days later, favoured an intensive
    phytoplankton bloom that led to extreme Chl-a levels. In mid-October, the first
    large appearance of dead fish on the coast of the Mar Menor occurred. As previously
    mentioned, the in situ data of Chl-a concentration reported by CARM are obtained
    by fluorescence techniques that are more similar to the possible values obtained
    by SRS data as they are based on reflectance analysis. This is probably the reason
    why the sentinel_chl_nn distribution is quite similar to CARM data. The other
    SRS data sources do not seem to follow a similar distribution to the in situ data
    collected by either, CSIC-IEO or CARM. However, some of the ISMPs are very close
    to land, either because of their proximity to the coast, islands, or gulfs. This
    fact affects close land data where the spectral perturbation is caused by land
    surfaces near the measured point. Also, Mar Menor is shallow in general (maximum
    depth 7 m) but some ISMPs are located in places where the depth is around two
    meters which affects also to reflected light (Bulgarelli et al., 2017). Table
    3 shows the temporal data coverage provided by SRS services under study. All SRS
    services provide daily measures of Chl-a. However, some factors occasionally produce
    anomalies or events that affect the quality and availability of the SRS data.
    Data providers reject images with errors, hence they do not provide level 2 files
    for these days or values are not valid. The column “% of days with image” in Table
    3 shows the number of images obtained by all SRS services. Sentinel-based services
    offer an average of 50.11% data availability, i.e. 1 out of every 2 days image
    are available. This figure is much higher for NASA-based services, providing images
    almost 100% (97.75% on average) of the days. Table 3. Temporal coverage for SRS
    services under study. We assume daily measurements from the starting dates of
    each mission (see Table 2). Satellite product % of days with image Average valid
    values all ISMPs Sentinel-3A OLCI L2 54.17% 34% chl_nn - 21% chl_oc Sentinel-3B
    OLCI L2 46.06% 29% chl_nn - 21.5% chl_oc NOAA VIIRS L2 95.26% 31% both chl_ocx-chl_a
    SNPP VIIRS L2 99.95% 34% both chl_ocx-chl_a Aqua MODIS L2 98.97% 22% both chl_ocx-chl_a
    Terra MODIS L2 99.13% 19% both chl_ocx-chl_a However, it is important to note
    that not all of these images generate good-quality data. SRS data services offer
    quality flags supplied at Level 2 products which have quality-related information
    about each image pixel. In the case of OLCI-based products, a pixel value can
    be masked, indicating a null value depending on the state of the flag, whose main
    reasons are usually atmospheric factors, such as clouds or haze density, which
    in the case of the Mar Menor, located in southeastern Spain, is quite common due
    to the proximity of the Sahara desert. Sentinel provides an ancillary file with
    the meaning of the mask for each pixel. In the first approach, we verify that
    the main reason to mask a pixel is unknown in around 70% of masked pixels and
    the rest is due to cloudy. Only CTD-9, the closest to the coast, shows few values
    masked as “land”. Another frequent factor for poor image quality is that the target
    pixel is grounded due to its spatial granularity. Sentinel-based SRS services
    have a spatial granularity of 300 m. However, MODIS offers a spatial granularity
    of up to 1 km. There are also flag values that do not mask a pixel value, however,
    they indicate a high probability of abnormal values. In this work, we do not consider
    the quality flag directly thus the masked values are treated as no data available.
    The column “Average valid values all ISMPs” in Table 3 shows the number of images
    that have been not masked by the SRS algorithm. It should be noted that, depending
    on the spatial granularity of the SRS services, these figures are lower. As previously
    mentioned, MODIS-based services have a spatial resolution of 1000 m and have the
    lowest rate of unmasked values (22%–19%). It is followed by VIIRS services with
    a maximum rate of 31% of unmasked data and a spatial granularity of 750 m, and
    finally, Sentinel-based services offer a rate of up to 34% of unmasked data in
    the best case. It can be concluded that Sentinel-based services provide less imagery,
    about half of the days they have no imagery available, of which less than one-third
    are useful. Fig. 5 shows the percentage of invalid values for any reason in the
    data history of the satellite services. Now, the data are separated by the in
    situ sampling points performed by CARM in the Mar Menor (i.e., ISMPs, see Fig.
    1a). It should be noted that the points closest to the coast are ISMPs 1, 5, and
    9. They are the GPS coordinates with more non-valid values in all SRS services.
    Again, the impact on the generation of invalid values of the instrument spatial
    resolution is also reflected here. For example, MODIS has a 1 km grid resolution
    and its null data is over 80% for ISMPs 1,2,4,5,9 which are about one km from
    the coast or less. The percentage of invalid values improves for VIIRS data which
    provides over 80% of null data for ISMPs located less than one km (1, 5, and 9).
    For sentinels OLCI, this situation happens in ISMPs 1 and 5, but only for Chl-a
    obtained by OCX algorithm. It can be seen that the algorithm based on Chl_NN is
    more stable because it does not operate like the classical algorithms. On the
    contrary, it focuses on a neural network algorithm that can learn and infer such
    situations. It is also important to note that the location where the percentage
    of null values for Chl-a is lowest is the one that coincides with ISMP6. This
    point matches the deepest point of the Mar Menor lagoon (approximately 6.7 m).
    Depth is another key factor in the determination of Chl-a using satellite instruments.
    Points deeper than 5 m and more than 1 km from land have higher non-zero percentages.
    These satellite points are those that coincide with ISMPs 6, 3, 8, 10, 11, and
    12. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 5. Percentage of null values reported in each SRS source. The X-axis shows
    the percentage of null values. The Y-axis shows the ISMP where the SRS data have
    been requested. With the high percentage of invalid data shown above, it can be
    concluded that a monitoring system based on satellite information for a shallow
    coastal lagoon such as the Mar Menor should consider more than an SRS service
    to obtain daily data with a higher probability. Fig. 6 shows the number of daily
    valid data obtained by the different SRS services during 2021. Satellite service
    is considered to provide valid data if at least one of its instruments/products
    generates valid data; i.e. if any of the Sentinel instruments A and/or B provide
    valid data, then the Sentinel-based SRS service is counted as 1. This analysis
    has been carried out for all ISMPs to figure out the influence of the Mar Menor
    geographical parameters on providing valid data. Let us remind the reader of the
    main geographical points of interest for SRS in Mar Menor that are shown in detail
    in Fig. 1c and d. They include the isobath map of the lagoon, four gulfs that
    serve as points of water interchange with the Mediterranean Sea, i.e. clear waters,
    five islands of volcanic origin in the middle of the lagoon, and the mouth of
    several ephemeral streams where intensive agriculture and urban water treatment
    plants legally, or sometimes presumably illegally, discharge waste with high nitrate
    and phosphate concentrations. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    all ISMPs during 2021. The maximum number of samples is 3 (Dark blue), taking
    into account that some of the Sentinel, VIIRS, and MODIS instruments/algorithms
    provide data (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.). With all of the above
    in mind, Fig. 6 shows some interesting findings. The best data coverage is achieved
    for ISMPs 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 which are those furthest from the lagoon shore
    and with a depth of more than 4 m as previously mentioned. Taking a deeper look
    at ISMP 6, the number of null values (i.e. days without recorded data in the year
    2021) was 112 days, which means 30.68% days of the year no satellite service provided
    data at the deepest point of the Mar Menor. The summer period, where the climate
    of the region is very warm and with clear sky conditions, the number of invalid
    daily registers is lower, compared to more cloudy and rainy periods. There were
    70 days (19.17%) where only valid data was collected, which in most cases comes
    from Sentinel''s neural network algorithms. Finally, there were only 95 days (26.02%)
    where all satellite services reported valid data. Bearing in mind these figures,
    it is important to note that using only a satellite service, the coverage of the
    monitoring system could be described as very low; i.e., less than 20% of the days
    with valid measurements would be reported. With several satellite services as
    backup, this number increases to 69.32%. Therefore, considering only the coverage
    of a hypothetical satellite monitoring service for shallow coastal lagoons such
    as the Mar Menor would require a robust service that integrates several satellite
    sources and cooperates to generate data as close as possible to the daily time
    scale. Fig. 7 shows the Pearson correlation matrix for all satellite sources and
    in situ monitoring sources at all ISMPs. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)
    is used here to assess the strength of the relationship between the Chl-a values
    generated by L2 SRS products and their in situ counterpart measurements. The Pearson''s
    coefficient is a metric for measuring the linear correlation between two datasets
    or, in other words, it quantifies the relationship that may exist between two
    variables. The PCC ranges from −1.0 (strong inverse relationship) to +1.0 (strong
    direct relationship). Several considerations should be taken into account before
    discussing the results. Firstly, CSIC-IEO in situ monitoring is only carried out
    at ISMPs 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, and 12, while the CARM in situ monitoring covers all
    the ISMPs under study, and therefore some rows are missing for the ieo_chl tag.
    Generally speaking, SRS data show a stronger direct correlation with CSIC-IEO
    data than with CARM data in those ISMPs where there are records for both. But
    this has to be analysed carefully, as the statistical significance of the correlation
    through p-value has to be considered. The small number of samples in the CSIC-IEO
    dataset, together with a large number of invalid data in the SRS-based datasets,
    makes the sample size to be correlated very small. There is a small chance that
    these data points fall in such a way that higher PCC is reported, even without
    any argument in favor of supporting the correlation. For instance, the temporal
    matches between the measurements of the CSIC-IEO in situ data and the data generated
    by the SRS products are 3 for the Sentinel-based products, 11 for the Modis-based
    products and 9 for the Viirs-based products for ISMP 6. Although PCC reaches 0.86
    for CSIC-IEO and sentinel_chl_nn datasets at ISMP 6, its p-value is 0.34, which
    means that the correlation is not statistically significant. There are only 8
    statistical tests that are statistically significant in the correlation between
    CSIC-IEO data with data generated by SRS sources. Particularly, these positive
    correlations happen at ISMP 10 and Sentinel_chl_nn data, where the PCC reaches
    up to 0.89 by combining Sentinel-3A and B data, having a p-value of 0.00069 and
    a matched data sample of up to 27 values, and also at ISMP 12 where PCC reaches
    up to 0.64 by also combining sentinel_A_chl_nn and B data, having a p-value of
    0.0167 and a matched data sample of up to 27 values. Although Fig. 7 shows other
    interesting PCC between CSIC-IEO and SRS products, such as 1 between the CSIC-IEO
    and MODIS at ISMP 1 or 0.8, 0.86 and 0.84 PCC between CSIC-IEO and sentinel_chl_nn
    at ISMPs 3, 6 and 11 respectively, they are not statistically significant, therefore,
    we can not conclude they are good samples for Mar Menor lagoon Monitoring. Download

    Pearson correlation matrix for all ISMPs. Dark red means a direct correlation
    close to a Pearson coefficient of 1, and dark blue means an inverse correlation
    close to a Pearson coefficient of −1. (For interpretation of the references to
    colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) The number of in situ samples from the CARM is significantly larger
    and thus offers a larger sample to compare with the SRS systems. The reported
    PCC figures are generally lower than those reported with CSIC-IEO data, in the
    range of 0.5–0.7 at best, but are statistically significant and therefore more
    reliable from a data quality point of view. Looking at ISMP 6, for example, the
    number of coincident elements between SRS and CARM data are 216, 442 and 446 for
    Sentinel, VIIRS and MODIS respectively, which makes significant correlations in
    almost all combinations. Furthermore, it is important to note that sentinel_chl_nn
    is the SRS with the highest correlation figures with CARM (and also CSIC-IEO).
    Therefore, generally speaking, figures reported in Fig. 7 place sentinel_chl_nn
    as the service with the strongest correlation with in situ monitoring data. It
    should be also noted that the correlation of the other satellite services is very
    low and therefore a calibration of the data is necessary to adapt it to the context
    of the Mar Menor. Fig. 8 shows a geospatial distribution of the highest PCC obtained
    between data from any SRS services and both; the CARM data (see Fig. 8a) and the
    CSIC-IEO data (see Fig. 8b) in the Mar Menor. Surprisingly, the best PCC is obtained
    in ISMPs that are very close to the mouths of the ephemeral stream; CARM achieves
    its best PCC at ISMP 7, very close to “Albujón” ephemeral stream (i.e., “Rambla
    del Albujón”), and CSIC-IEO achieves its best PCC at ISMP 10, very close to “De
    Ponce” and “Carrasquilla” ephemeral streams (i.e., “Barranco de Ponce” and “Rambla
    de Carrasquilla”). Let us remind the reader that PCC was statistically significant
    at ISMP 10 for CSIC-IEO and Sentinel_chl_nn. Ephemeral streams, and particularly,
    the Albujón ephemeral stream are the main nutrient input to the lagoon (Senent-Aparicio
    et al., 2021). This result is quite interesting since proximity to land or depth
    is usually identified as the main limiting factors for the quality of SRS data
    in oceanographic products. Indeed, these factors also have an impact here, as
    can be seen in ISMPs 1, 4, and 9, where the lowest Pearson''s coefficients are
    reported (0.2, 0.4, and 0.22 respectively). However, the SRS products generate
    the Chl-a data from the visible spectra (Morel et al., 2007a; O''Reilly, 2000),
    and, at ISMP 7 is where greater weights of the green spectral band are observed,
    in consistency with the band combinations that more commonly are used in the Ocean
    Chl-a Algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download : Download

    streams, with the CSIC-IEO (ISMP 10), CARM (ISMP 7), and the deepest point (ISMP
    6). A good trend is clearly shown between the in situ monitoring data and the
    satellite data, in particular for the areas where phytoplankton may be more abundant
    due to nutrient input. Nevertheless, the results shown in this paper conclude
    that there is room for improvement in adjusting the data provided by SRS products
    to the context of such shallow and highly anthropised lagoons. To make this bias
    correction, it also opens up the possibility of not making general lagoon models,
    but more specific models according to the geographical and ecological conditions
    of the lagoon. Download : Download high-res image (159KB) Download : Download

    5. Discussion In the field of environmental monitoring, the deployment of SRS
    technology offers a paradigm shift, particularly in the domain of coastal lagoon
    monitoring. This research has ventured into an exhaustive analysis of six distinct
    SRS-based products tailored for the detection and quantification of Chl-a in the
    contextually rich backdrop of the Mar Menor lagoon. The insights garnered from
    this inquiry underscore the nuanced interplay between the technological prowess
    of SRS and its applicability to regional and localized environmental phenomena.The
    practical deployment of SRS, either as a complementary resource or as a substitute
    for traditional in situ detection, requires a multifaceted consideration of operational
    elements. The appeal of SRS lies in providing a high-resolution temporal and spatial
    dataset. Our research demonstrates that combining diverse SRS data streams can
    significantly increase the data acquisition window from a mere one-fifth to a
    commendable 70 % coverage. Despite these advances, regional calibration of SRS
    algorithms emerges as a sine qua non to mitigate endemic biases at the local scale.
    This recalibration highlights the commitment to refine SRS methodologies, incorporating
    localized model building to rectify and adapt SRS data. In addition, the establishment
    of a network of terrestrial validation stations, along with a regimented calibration
    schedule, is imperative to promote the veracity and robustness of SRS data. The
    SRS methodology boasts an unparalleled spatial expanse, eclipsing the reach of
    conventional in situ sensors. This capability is particularly salient in scenarios
    necessitating immediate and comprehensive data reconnaissance, such as during
    phytoplankton bloom events, where SRS can serve as an indispensable tool. In the
    Mar Menor study, the SRS data, particularly from the Sentinel-based IRTM-NN modality,
    has exhibited a commendable fidelity to in situ measurements, as evidenced by
    a Pearson correlation coefficient cresting at 0.86. Yet, this technological advantage
    does not render SRS infallible. The precision of SRS data is often contingent
    upon the ecological matrix within which it operates. Anomalies such as algal blooms
    may inadvertently enhance the precision of SRS readings; conversely, anthropogenic
    perturbations can precipitate substantial deviations in data accuracy. The granular
    detail and verisimilitude afforded by in situ measurements are unparalleled, serving
    as the bedrock for the calibration and validation of SRS data. In light of the
    foregoing, we propose an integrative framework for policymakers contemplating
    the assimilation of SRS into extant monitoring regimens: • Validation Imperative:
    Prioritize a robust validation phase, where SRS and in situ data collection are
    synchronized to establish the SRS''s reliability and situational relevance. Qualitatively,
    this stage not only aligns the SRS data with ground truths but also provides insights
    into the SRS''s capabilities to capture the variability and complexity of environmental
    phenomena. • Iterative integration protocol: The assimilation of SRS into monitoring
    frameworks should be characterized by its iterative nature, whereby SRS algorithms
    are continuously refined based on accumulating in situ data. Qualitatively, this
    iterative process allows for the adjustment of SRS methodologies to better reflect
    the dynamic and multifarious nature of ecological environments, thereby enhancing
    the interpretive power of SRS data. • Policy Formulation: It is essential to formulate
    convincing policies and procedural protocols that define the precise modalities
    for the use of SRS, including their integration into broader environmental management
    strategies and contingency protocols that respond to ecological changes detected
    by SRS. Qualitatively, these policies should encompass a nuanced understanding
    of the strengths of SRS, such as its ability to provide a macroscopic view of
    ecological patterns and trends that in situ sensors would not be able to reproduce
    due to logistical constraints. The potential of SRS to revolutionize local and
    regional ecosystem monitoring is unequivocal. However, incorporating SRS into
    existing monitoring frameworks requires discerning recognition of its advantages
    and limitations. By adopting a distributed, iterative approach and establishing
    rigorous validation mechanisms, SRS can effectively complement in situ sensing
    techniques, fostering a more robust and comprehensive environmental monitoring
    and management system. Qualitative insights into the application of SRS underscore
    its usefulness in providing a broader perspective and continuous monitoring capabilities,
    which are particularly beneficial in large and inaccessible areas or where timely
    data collection is crucial. Lessons learned from our study argue for a complementary
    role for SRS, where its breadth of coverage and rapid data processing capabilities
    provide an overall context within which in situ data can be interpreted. This
    synergy facilitates a comprehensive understanding of environmental conditions,
    allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions with a level of detail and speed
    unattainable with in situ methods alone. 6. Conclusions and future work We are
    witnessing the continuous development of remote sensing systems and algorithms
    that enable the development of monitoring systems with high temporal and spatial
    accuracy, and increasingly better precision in the geophysical variables offered
    by their products. However, these systems are usually developed at global scales
    and offer large biases when they are applied to regional or local areas and, therefore,
    there are other limiting factors either technical, environmental, ecological or
    geographical that affect the accuracy of SRS measurements. Validation of these
    data in local/regional context is therefore essential before promoting the application
    of remote sensing products by independently checking their errors using reference
    data such as in-situ measurements, which are considered the cornerstone of validation.
    In this article, up to six different SRS-based products for Chl-a monitoring in
    a local/regional context such as the Mar Menor (Murcia, Spain) are analysed. In
    this highly anthropised coastal lagoon, several satellite measurement systems
    have been proposed, ignoring the validation and spatial-temporal coverage of these
    systems. Our results show that the consideration of only one satellite source
    limits the temporal coverage, reducing data availability to 19.17% of the sampled
    days. Increasing the number of sources enhances data availability by more than
    40%, reaching a coverage of approximately 70% of the sampled days on average.
    Regarding the qualitative validation of the data obtained from the satellite products,
    Sentinel-based IRTM-NN provides the best measurements for Mar Menor lagoon in
    general, showing a Pearson correlation coefficient reaching up to 0.86. Furthermore,
    we have identified that certain ecological components, such as extreme algal blooms
    due to high nutrient inputs to the lagoon, can benefit the accuracy of SRS products.
    But there is still a long way to go to have reliable satellite monitoring systems
    in these highly anthropised lagoons. Data correction and adaptation to these local/regional
    contexts is mandatory, and this can be achieved through several approaches but,
    in light of the results obtained here, we recommend a distributed approach that
    encompasses the heterogeneity of these lagoon environments. In the continuing
    evolution of remote sensing technologies, the future holds a tailored approach
    to environmental monitoring. The development of localized algorithms capable of
    fitting global-scale data to regional ecosystems is an essential step. This accuracy,
    resulting from the combination of multispectral satellite and ground-based data,
    will improve the accuracy of remote sensing applications to capture dynamic ecological
    processes in coastal lagoons. While harnessing these technological advances, the
    scientific effort must be accompanied by policy frameworks that skillfully utilize
    this influx of data for informed ecological management. Long-term environmental
    management will depend on integrating this wealth of remotely sensed information
    into a coherent strategy that ensures that vital aquatic systems such as the Mar
    Menor are protected in the medium to long term. Software availability Name of

    were assessed for the Urmia Lake basin, which is a very critical and challenging
    ecosystem problem. The lowering of water level in the Urmia Lake and the associated
    risk of becoming a completely saline land has become an important issue in Iran.
    In the first step of the study, using the ground- and satellite-based datasets,
    a new multiscale technique based on Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Differential
    Symbolic Entropy (DSE) was proposed to monitor the variations of drought in the

    to severe droughts, and there was a direct relationship between entropy and drought
    intensity. Based on the results, it was concluded that climate change had an impact
    on the shrinkage of the lake; however, these changes were not solely responsible
    of causing the dramatic water loss of the Lake. Variations of the Salinity Index
    (SI) showed that saline lands were mostly seen in the Eastern and Southern parts
    of the lake, causing negative impacts on air quality and agricultural activities
    in these parts. It was found that the proper management of water resources would
    play an effective role in the restoration of the lake.

    basin 1. Introduction Lakes are natural water resources that are affected by climatic,
    hydrological, and geomorphological changes as well as human activities (Ghale
    et al., 2019; Tussupova et al., 2020). Lowering of the water level or shrinkage
    of water surface area of lakes causes negative effects on economical, agricultural,
    and recreational activities related to the lake. In addition, acute changes in
    the water level of lakes cause alterations in the climate of the watershed. One
    of the major problems created due to the drying up of a lake is the increase in
    soil salinity. This type of soils threaten and seriously endanger their adjacent
    lands due to the spread of salinity (Dazzi and Papa, 2019; Ma et al., 2023; Machado
    and Serralheiro, 2017). Soil salinization caused by excess irrigation and other
    intensified agricultural activities is one of the most serious problems among
    other types of soil degradation (Akramkhanov et al., 2011; Bhatt et al., 2008;
    Periasamy and Ravi, 2020; Phogat et al., 2020; Rabinovich et al., 2019; Seydehmet
    et al., 2018). Soil salinity as an influential factor restricts plant growth and
    decreases crop production at various stages (Rabinovich et al., 2019). Therefore,
    soil salinity and its variations should be curbed with proper scientific management.
    Identifying the saline areas and studying the salinity variations in the area
    are one of the first practical actions to be taken in this regard. On the other
    hand, dried lakes have become significant sources of dust. Dust as the most important
    aerosol type in the atmosphere has serious direct and indirect effects on the
    climate system (Cherian and Quaas, 2020; Hamzeh et al., 2023; Kok et al., 2018).
    According to Hamzeh et al. (2023), although sandy deserts are the main source
    of dust, drying lakes can also be an important source of dust. For example, Urmia
    Lake (Feizizadeh et al., 2022), Jazmurian Lake (Soleimani Sardoo et al., 2021),
    and Bakhtegan Lake (Vahidipour et al., 2022) in Iran are some lakes that dried
    up as a result of human interference and climate change and turned to be major
    sources of dust. In recent years, due to climate warming and unsustainable human
    development and utilization, several inland lakes have been on the verge of disappearing,
    including the Aral Sea (AghaKouchak et al., 2015b) and Lake Balkhash (Sala et
    al., 2020) in Central Asia, the Great Salt Lake (Carling et al., 2020) in the
    USA, Lake Chad (Birkett, 2000) in Africa, Lake Eyre (McGowan and Clark, 2008)
    in Australia, and Lake Chahan (Chen et al., 2022) in China. As the lake water
    level decreases and the lake area shrinks, vegetation degradation, desert development,
    and salinization of dry lake bottom occur in the lakeside area (Ghale et al.,
    2019). As a result, dust emissions from dried lakes are characterized by a high
    salt content (saline dust storms), threatening human lives and welfare. These
    environmental changes may cause negative impacts such as the spread of diseases,
    destruction of agricultural lands, and massive damage to the local economy, resulting
    in mass migration of local people; similar to what has happened in the Aral Sea
    over the past decades (AghaKouchak et al., 2015b). The Aral Sea has been extensively
    shrunk over the last decades, largely due to water usage from the Amu Darya and
    Syr Darya rivers for land irrigation. The Aralkum region, which is a new desert
    caused by the drying up of the Aral Sea, is the source of dust storms which have
    negative effects on people''s lives and climate (Indoitu et al., 2015). The shrinkage
    of Urmia Lake, one of the important water bodies of Iran, has caused serious problems
    in the basin of the lake (Hosseini-Moghari et al., 2020). In this basin, factors
    such as the construction of dams, excessive extraction of groundwater resources,
    construction of a causeway on the lake, as well as the decrease in precipitation
    over the lake basin in the past decades have caused a decrease in surface water
    of the lake. Excessive use of the surface water and groundwater resources and
    agricultural land has increased drought in the basin (Habibi et al., 2021). Also,
    the soil in this area is at risk of increasing soil salinity due to improper use
    of environmental resources in recent decades, which is highly effective in reducing
    soil fertility in the area. Therefore, several studies of different scientific
    issues (climatic, ecological, geochemical, atmospheric, health, economic, etc.)
    have been conducted in Urmia Lake (Arkian and Nicholson, 2018; Feizizadeh et al.,
    2021; Gholampour et al., 2015; Hamzeh et al., 2023; Hamzehpour et al., 2022; Nikbakht
    et al., 2013). According to Aghakouchak et al. (2015a), drought and excessive
    use of adjacent lands for agricultural development can be considered as one of
    the most effective factors for the shrinkage of the lake. Various reasons for
    the drying up of the Urmia Lake have been mentioned by researchers debating between
    anthropogenic impacts and climate factors. Some researchers consider human activities
    to be the main reason for the drying up of the lake (Ghale et al., 2019), while
    others consider climate change on a global scale to be the most important reason
    for the dryness of this lake Alizadeh-Choobari et al., 2016). Hamzeh et al. (2023)
    investigated the climatic, terrestrial, and anthropogenic effects that caused
    the shrinkage of the Urmia Lake during the last two decades. They used the synergy
    of ground measurements, satellite products, deep learning models, and the Hybrid
    Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model to assess changes
    in local vs. regional sources of dust that contribute to an increase in dust loading
    over the lake. This research showed that both anthropogenic and climatic factors
    contributed to various degrees of shrinking of the Urmia Lake. Urmia Lake is known
    as the second largest lake in terms of sodium chloride concentration (Hassanzadeh
    et al., 2012). The increase in soil salinity is a serious environmental challenge
    in the Urmia Lake basin, and the drying up of Urmia Lake aggravates this threat.
    Due to the negative impacts of the drying up of the lake, it is necessary to assess
    the drought condition and salinity variation of this basin using reliable methods.
    In this regard, preparing drought and salinity maps of the region and evaluating
    the soil salinization can be the first step towards taking practical measures.
    Regression, Meta-model approaches, and time series analysis approaches are some
    of the models that have been developed in recent decades as a result of the steady
    growth of remote sensing and advancements in computing technologies. These models
    have been developed to resolve scientific issues in a variety of fields (Ghasempour
    et al., 2022). Satellite images can cover the shortcomings of the lack of information
    or the inappropriate distribution of ground-based stations and make it practical
    to extract relevant indicators regularly and in different time periods. Besides
    the advantages of datasets of satellites (i.e. wide geographic coverage, near-real-time
    datasets, and access to information difficult to obtain by other means), the high
    spatial resolution of these datasets has led to their use in various fields (Guo
    et al., 2017; Hamzehpour et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2021). Gorji et al. (2020)
    compared Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A data for mapping soil salinity in the Western
    part of the Urmia Lake by applying three different soil salinity indices coupled
    with electrical conductivity (EC) measurements. Results revealed that soil salinity
    indices extracted from both Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A visible bands estimated
    soil salinity with acceptable accuracy. Aksoy et al. (2022) analyzed the performance
    of three different machine-learning algorithms to map soil salinity for the Urmia
    Lake basin using Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2A satellite images, and ground-based
    EC measurements. The output soil salinity map demonstrated the most reliable spatial
    distribution of various soil salinity classes in the selected study area. In general,
    soil salinization is a dynamic process with remarkable social and economic facets,
    which can threaten communities exposed to the distribution of saline soil. Climate
    change and the occurrence of drought can aggravate the condition. Drought as a
    natural hazard can cause economic, hydrological, environmental, and social problems
    (Balti et al., 2020; Mishra and Singh, 2010; Mukherjee et al., 2018). A brief
    review of the research literature indicates the main advantages of remote sensing
    applied for drought and soil characteristics modeling and mapping. To the best
    of our knowledge, less research has studied the potential of integrated algorithms
    for drought mapping. Considering the importance of the issue, in this study, remotely
    sensed-based datasets along with a new multiscale data processing technique were
    used for investigating the drought and soil salinity variations of the Urmia Lake
    basin. The main aim of the current study (1) is to propose a new integrated method
    based on the Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), Differential Symbolic Entropy
    (DSE), and remote sensing approaches to develop the drought zoning map for the
    basin and (2) use remote sensing datasets to monitor the variations of soil salinity
    in the basin and investigate the effects of climate change and human activities
    on the drying of the lake. The research was conducted in two steps. The first
    step included assessing the condition of the basin in terms of drought using the
    precipitation product extracted from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Merged
    Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) satellite and temperature and vegetation products
    extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite,
    as well as the application of the integrated EWT- DSE method in developing the
    drought zoning map. In general, the main purpose of the first step was to provide
    drought susceptibility maps using reliable and always available datasets that
    can be used in socio-economic and environmental sectors. The integrated method
    proposed in this study can provide valuable insight for better understanding drought
    behavior. In the second step, variations of the water level of the Urmia Lake
    and soil salinity and its environmental effects were assessed in the selected
    period (1985–2020). The main objective of the second step was to monitor the soil
    salinity using time-series satellite imagery and analyze the land use variations
    in the areas surrounding the Urmia Lake. Thus, the salinity index was used to
    determine the areas that were more prone to soil salinization. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Study area and used datasets The Urmia Lake basin, in the Northwest
    of Iran, is one of the six main basins of Iran. The total area of this basin (56,201
    km2) is distributed between the following three provinces; West Azerbaijan (by
    46%), East Azerbaijan (by 43%), and Kurdistan (by 11%). Lake Urmia, as the heart
    of this watershed with an area of 5000 km2, has been the largest internal lake
    in Iran and is considered one of the most significant aquatic ecosystems in Iran
    and the world (Eimanifar and Mohebbi, 2007). Fig. 1 illustrates the location of
    the selected basin and stations. The important rivers of this basin are Zarinehrood,
    Siminerood, and Ajichai. This basin covers 3.15% of the total area of Iran and
    the volume of surface water in the basin constitutes 7% of the total surface water
    of the whole country (Rahimi and Breuste, 2021). The altitude of the basin varies
    between 1267 and 3746 m above sea level. Mountainous regions cover about 65% of
    the basin, followed by plains and foothills (24%), and Urmia Lake (10%). Download

    of the Urmia Lake basin and the considered stations. In terms of climatic conditions,
    this basin has cold winters and relatively mild summers. In the Koppen''s climate
    classification, the climate of this region is semi-arid. The average amount of
    rainfall in the region is about 352 mm per year, most of which occurs from autumn
    to mid-spring. The origin of these rains is air fronts that enter Iran from Europe
    and cold regions, and affect the studied watershed from the north and northwest.
    The basin has a population of about 5 million people, which includes >36 cities
    and 3150 villages. The population density in the basin is 95 people per square
    kilometer, which is more than twice the average population density of the entire
    country. A major part of the land use of the basin is agriculture (see Fig. 2),
    which is strongly affected by drought. In terms of chemical composition, Urmia
    Lake water is in the row of sodium-chloride-sulfide brines. The water of this
    lake contains cations such as Na+, k+, Ca+, Li+, Mg2+ and anions such as Cl¯,
    HCO3¯, and SO42¯ (Feizizadeh et al., 2022). Temperature, precipitation, evaporation,
    relative humidity, and wind variables play a significant role in the formation
    of salts in Urmia Lake (Harati et al., 2021). Due to climate change and various
    other reasons, such as extensive land use /cover changes and droughts over the
    past decades (Garajeh et al., 2021), the lake''s water level has been decreasing
    gradually since 1995. The agricultural sector is responsible for most of the water
    consumption in the basin and uses about 60% of the available water resources (Ghalibaf
    and Moussavi, 2014). As a result of this extensive water consumption and frequent
    droughts, the water level of the lake fell significantly while also leading to
    an increase in the salinity ratio, eventually leading to hyper-salinity conditions
    (Gorji et al., 2020). In the last two decades, the sharp drop in the water level
    and the increase in water salinity have caused the situation of the largest hypersaline
    lake in the world to become critical (Alizade Govarchin Ghale et al., 2018). -

    full-size image Fig. 2. Land use map of the Urmia Lake basin (2018). In this study,
    fifty-eight synoptic stations were considered for drought monitoring as shown
    in according to Fig. 1. The selected stations are among the official sites maintained
    by the Iranian Meteorological Organization (http://www.weather.ir). The precipitation
    datasets were collected from the meteorology portal of Iran, covering the period
    of 1985–2020. The considered stations had records of 36 years, and they showed
    a desirable spatial distribution over the study area. Also, long-term datasets
    (from 1985 to 2020) including temperature, water level of the lake, and volume
    of water entering the lake were collected from the mentioned portal in order to
    investigate the changes in the water body and shoreline of the lake. - Satellite-based
    datasets In this study, The MODIS and CMAP datasets were used for drought monitoring.
    These MODIS datasets were extracted from the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE)
    platform. GEE provides various types of ready-to-use products derived from satellite
    imagery (https://earthengine.google.com). The 16-day composite MODIS vegetation
    product at a 250-m spatial resolution (MOD13Q1) was used to calculate NDVI at
    250 m. MOD13Q1 includes vegetation indices quality control for both vegetation
    indicators and surface reflectance bands. The eight-day composite MODIS LST product
    at 1-km spatial resolution (MOD11A2) was used to obtain day-time land surface
    temperature. MOD11A2 includes quality control for day-time LST and emissivity.
    250 images (with cloud cover percentage <10%) were selected to assess drought
    variations in the selected basin. Since MODIS data providers actively encourage
    using quality bands to screen out poor quality data, the quality reliability of
    MOD13Q1 and MOD11A2 products was evaluated. For MOD13Q1, a pixel was considered
    reliable if the vegetation index quality flag (bit 0–1) was “Good data, use with
    confidence” (value 0). For MOD11A2, if a pixel with “Mandatory QA (quality assurance)
    flags” (bit 0–1) band was “Pixel produced, good quality, not necessary to examine
    more detailed QA” (value 0), that pixel was good to be included in the study.
    In the process of preprocessing, we used the MODIS Re-projection Tool (MRT) to
    extract the day-time LST and NDVI associated with quality assurance (QA) layers
    of all MOD11A2 and MOD13Q1 images. At the same time, all the images were mosaicked
    and resampled from sinusoidal projection to the considered zone to produce image
    maps of the study area. Because of differences in spatial resolution between NDVI
    and LST, a re-projection function with the nearest neighbor resampling by default
    in GEE was used to resample NDVI to the same 1-km spatial resolution with LST.
    The CMAP is a collection of precipitation datasets that can be produced by analyzing
    gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation. The spatial resolution
    of the CMAP is 2.5° × 2.5° and its temporal resolution is monthly. The data of

    Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water surface
    area and salinity variations over a long period of time (i.e. 1985 to 2020). For
    this aim, the most suitable data in terms of identifiability (i.e. frames with
    cloud cover <10%) was selected. It takes eight “Landsat frames” to cover the entire
    Urmia Lake basin. In the present study, 150 images from 1985 to 2020 were used
    to assess land cover variations in the selected basin. To minimize the radiometric
    effects, radiometric calibration was done for the selected images. 2.2. Description
    of the adapted methodology In this study, an integrated multiscale technique along
    with satellite datasets was used to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of drought
    and soil salinity in the Urmia Lake Basin. In this regard, two steps were considered.
    Fig. 3 shows the steps of the adopted methodology in the present research to monitor
    drought and salinity variations. The first step included the assessment of spatiotemporal
    variation of the drought using ground- and satellite-based datasets during the
    time period of 1985–2020. So far, different indices have been introduced to assess
    droughts (Kisi et al., 2019). Among the proposed indices, the Standardized Precipitation
    Index (SPI) is the primary metric used in drought monitoring since it is based
    only on rainfall data and is less complex. Also, the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) are two satellite-based indices
    used in drought studies. NDVI, ranging from −1 to +1, is used to evaluate the
    density of vegetation on a given area (Zare et al., 2019). Low NDVI amounts stand
    for moisture-stressed vegetation and higher values show a higher density of green
    vegetation. This indicator can display the variations in the density of green
    under wet and drought conditions. LST is part of the surface energy budget, and
    can be used as an indicator for climate change (Hengl et al., 2012). LST is able
    to show drought-induced thermal stress faster than NDVI. In this study, the mentioned
    three indices were used for assessing the drought-prone areas in the basin. Download

    Proposed methodology for investigating drought and salinity variations of the
    selected basin. The SPI values were computed using the precipitation datasets
    obtained from the available synoptic stations and the CMAP satellite. The precipitation
    datasets of the CMAP satellite were used to evaluate the effectiveness of precipitation
    products of satellites in drought monitoring. In the next step, basin zoning was
    done via the multiscale approach. In this regard, the unprocessed (raw) SPIs of
    each of the considered stations located in the Urmia basin were decomposed. An
    integrated multiscale method (EWT-DSE) was used to decompose (process) the SPIs
    time series and enhance their capability in drought monitoring. Various internal
    and external factors can affect the quality of the raw dataset. When unrelated
    factors are incorporated, it becomes challenging to accurately model the intended
    variable. Therefore, in order to reduce the modeling complexity, the EWT and DSE
    were used to decompose the raw datasets of SPIs into several subseries. EWT was
    applied to the original time series, and eight Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)
    and one residue signal were produced for each time series. Evaluation of the complexity
    of each IMF was performed using the DSE. In fact, the DSE was used to quantify
    the entropy of the subseries, which were used to prepare the zoning map of the
    basin. The second step included the assessment of the spatiotemporal variations
    of water surface area and salinity of the basin using remote sensing datasets.
    Drought and rapid increase in agricultural activities are the most important reasons
    behind the shrinkage of this lake. This kind of exploitation with the added salinity
    from irrigation occurring over time may cause increased soil salinity in the basin
    leading up to desertification. In this study, Landsat satellite datasets were
    used to detect spatiotemporal variability of salt bodies, salt-affected lands,
    and the development of irrigated lands around the lake to estimate the extend
    of salinization in terms of spectral response of satellite images for the Urmia
    Lake Basin. Also, the salinity index (SI) was used to quantify the soil salinity
    variations of the basin and identify the consequences of the lake drying up. The
    SI can be described as follows: (1) in which ρGreen and ρRed stand for the reflectance
    of the green and red spectral bands, respectively. The range of SI variations
    is between 0 and 1, and larger values indicate areas with higher salinity. It
    should be noted that the used software programs in this study were MATLAB, ArcGIS,
    QGIS, Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and Microsoft Excel. 2.3. Applied drought
    index The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is the most commonly used indicator
    in drought detection and characterizing (Belayneh et al., 2016). This drought
    index shows abnormal wetness and dryness. The main advantage of SPI is that the
    impacts of rainfall deficiency on water resources can be assessed using different
    timescales of the SPI (Belayneh et al., 2016). Another advantage of the SPI is
    that, using it, the drought threshold can be determined for any time period. As
    a result, this index can be used to calculate not only the severity of the drought
    but also its duration. The SPI is based on the probability of rainfall for each
    time period and is very important for early warning and drought severity monitoring.
    The values of SPI can be positive or negative. SPI values below −1 indicate rainfall
    deficits (drier than normal), while SPI values above 1 indicate excess rainfall
    (wetter than normal). The lower the SPI, the more intense is the drought. 2.4.
    Data decomposition approach In this study, the new Empirical Wavelets Transform
    (EWT) technique was used to break down the raw signals into more stationary and
    regular subseries. By signal decomposition, the irrelevant properties (noise)
    of the signals may be removed whereas the relevant components of the signal can
    be isolated. Therefore, the quality of datasets is increased by signal decomposition.
    EWT is a relatively recent adaptive signal-processing technique, which is developed
    by Gilles (2013). This method is similar to the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD);
    however, it has a consolidated mathematical theory. The implication of the EWT
    includes five steps which are: (1) expanding the time series, (2) performing the
    Fourier transform, (3) boundaries extraction, (4) developing the filter bank,
    and (5) sub-bands extraction. The basis of the EWT is to extract the amplitude
    modulated-frequency modulated (AM-FM) time series of the original time series
    through the design of a suitable wavelet filter bank adaptively (Peng et al.,
    2017). In the EWT, Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) are generated based on information
    contained in the signal spectrum. According to Cao et al. (2016), the description
    of the EWT algorithm is as follows: 1) Segmenting the Fourier spectrum of the
    main time series into N contiguous segments. Assuming that the Fourier support
    [0, π] is segmented into contiguous N segments, a total number of N + 1 boundaries
    are needed. According to the local maximum values, the Fourier spectrum of a signal
    is divided into N segments. Denote to be the limits between each segment (where
    0 = 0 and  = π). Each segment is represented as  = [ −1, ]. For each , a transition
    phase with width 2 may be utilized (  =  ), as shown in Fig. 4. The range of γ
    is given as: Download : Download high-res image (77KB) Download : Download full-size

    empirical wavelets using the Little-wood-Paley and Meyer''s wavelets. Eqs. (3),
    (4) describe the empirical scaling function and empirical wavelets, respectively.
    (3) (4) The ratio γ in Eqs. (3), (4) is restricted to a small value as Eq. (2)
    to ensure the empirical scaling function and the empirical wavelets are a tight
    frame of : τ = γ , 0 < γ < 1. The function β(x) is a polynomial function described
    as: (5) The approximation coefficients and detailed coefficients may be calculated
    using Eqs. (6), (7), respectively: (6) (7) 3) Finally, reconstructing the original
    time series as follows: (8) Considering this formalism, the empirical mode can
    be described as follows: (9) (10) 2.5. Differential symbolic entropy (DSE) Yao
    and Wang (2017) introduced Differential Symbolic Entropy (DSE) as a useful tool
    for quantifying the complexity of signals. This method introduces an agent that
    flexibly controls the differential symbol transformation process by taking into
    account the relationship between three elements that occur consecutively in time
    sequences. The DSE approach can be implemented by thoroughly identifying the local
    dynamic information of time sequences (Li et al., 2022). In the DSE calculation
    process, the data sequence is encoded after symbolization. In the next step, the
    final DSE can be obtained by computing the probability of each code. In this study,
    after data decomposition using EWT, the DSE of the subseries were computed, and
    used as the representative feature of IMFs to monitor the basin in terms of drought.
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Drought monitoring in the Urmia Lake basin using
    the EWT-DSE multiscale method As stated above, the EWT-DSE integrated multiscale
    method was used to assess the spatiotemporal variations of draught during the
    selected time period. Fig. 5(a) shows the DSE values for the IMFs obtained for
    the Azarshahr station (shown in Fig. 1). According to this figure, in the considered
    station, the DSE value from the IMF1 to the last IMF has a descending trend meaning
    that the IMF complexity is getting smaller such that the IMF1 with having the
    largest DSE value has the highest complexity. Due to the increase in the number
    of parameters that can be used for zoning the area, the mean entropy values of
    the IMFs were used for zoning the selected basin. The obtained outcomes are illustrated
    in Fig. 5(b). According to Fig. 5(b), it is understood that the Southern and especially
    the Southwestern parts of the basin experienced more severe droughts, while droughts
    were milder in the Northern and Eastern parts. The drought intensity reduced and
    reached the lowest amount in these areas. These findings are in line with Safarian
    Zengir et al. (2020) study. They assessed the variations of drought in the Northwest
    of Iran using the NDVI drought index. Safarian Zengir et al. (2020) stated that
    the Southern parts of the Urmia Lake Basin had higher drought intensity than the
    other parts. Download : Download high-res image (651KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. (a): Decomposed IMFs and their DSE values obtained for the Azarshahr
    station and (b): zoning maps of the mean SPI and DSE obtained from the ground-based
    datasets. It can be deduced from the results that, in most cases, droughts with
    higher intensity occurred in areas with higher DSE. For instance, the Southern
    regions that had higher DSE values also had higher drought severity. Based on
    these findings, a direct relationship can be set between entropy and drought intensity,
    so that the higher the DSE, the higher the drought intensity. The Southwest and
    Northeast regions of the basin, with the lowest SPI amounts (−0.25 < SPI < −0.085),
    had the highest DSEs (DSE > 0.55). Instead, lower values of entropy were observed
    in the Northwest and Southeast regions (DSE < 0.4). In these areas, the severity
    of drought decreased and the drought index values increased towards more positive
    values (SPI > 0). In general, when the values of DSE increase, the values of SPI
    decrease towards more negative values, demonstrating more drought severity. Thereby,
    entropy can be considered as one of the important variables in the drought mapping
    of the basin. In the next step, the potential of the remote sensing-based datasets
    was assessed for drought monitoring in the selected basin. For evaluating the
    efficiency of the CMAP satellite data, the mean annual precipitation values were
    calculated using ground- and satellite-based datasets. The obtained results are
    shown in Fig. 6(a). From the results, there is a desirable correlation between
    the two datasets, so that the high and low precipitation areas of the basin are
    well identified by the satellite. A strong positive correlation can be seen between
    the precipitation values obtained from the two datasets (Correlation Coefficient
    (R) > 0.8 and p < 0.001). After extracting the monthly precipitation datasets
    from the CMAP, the SPI time series were calculated and de-noised using the EWT
    method. Then, the basin was mapped in terms of drought and mean entropy. The obtained
    results are shown in Fig. 6(b). As could be seen, the Southern parts of the basin
    and the East of the lake experienced more severe drought than other parts of the
    basin. It was also observed that entropy and drought severity are directly related.
    A comparison between Figs. 5(b) and 6(b) showed that the precipitation product
    of the CMAP can successfully detect drought-prone areas after de-noising. Therefore,
    in the case of lack of access to ground-based datasets, satellite data can be
    used for drought monitoring. Download : Download high-res image (1001KB) Download

    DSE obtained from the CMAP satellite, and (c): validation of the results obtained
    from the CMAP satellite using the R and RMSE criteria. To validate the results
    obtained from the CMAP satellite, two evaluation criteria including the Correlation
    Coefficient (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used. Fig. 6(c) shows the
    values of R and RMSE for the considered stations. It was observed that the values
    of the mentioned criteria were desirable for drought modeling such that in 77%
    of the stations, there was a strong positive correlation (R > 0.7 and p < 0.001)
    between the SPIs obtained from the in-situ observations and satellite. The RMSE
    values were slightly higher in the Northeast and the R values did not exceed 0.67
    (with p < 0.01) for this part. In general, the CMAP was suitable for drought monitoring
    in most parts of the study area. In the following, the optical and thermal products
    of the MODIS, NDVI and LST, respectively, were utilized to monitor the drought
    conditions in the Urmia Lake basin. NDVI and LST contour plots of the Urmia Lake
    basin for some years are shown in Fig. 7. In general, analysis of the NDVI and
    LST variations indicated that during the period of 2000–2020, the basin experienced
    drought in some years. During drought years, the Southern and Eastern regions
    of the lake had a higher temperature and lower vegetation density. The range of
    NDVI values for dry years, varied from 0 to +0.66. For wet years, the range of
    its variations was between 0 and + 0.89, which indicates higher vegetation density
    in these years. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. NDVI and LST contour maps for some sample years. LST and NDVI values
    indicated that during the considered period, the selected basin experienced drought
    in some years (i.e. 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016). In these
    years, drought intensities were higher in the Southern parts of the basin. High
    values of the NDVI in 2011, 2018, and 2019 indicated the existence of relatively
    good vegetation conditions in these years. The larger LST values were obtained
    for the South and East parts of the lake. Furthermore, lower values of this index
    occurred in 2011, 2018, and 2019. The results of this section are in line with
    the outcomes of the basin zoning via the mean SPI and DSE metrics based on the
    in-situ observations. As stated above, there is a negative correlation between
    NDVI and LST characteristics. An inverse correlation between these two characteristics
    has been reported by some researchers (Anbazhagan and Paramasivam, 2016; Karnieli
    et al., 2006; Shiran et al., 2021; Zhang and Jia, 2013). The current research
    showed that during droughts, only LST increases while NDVI decreases due to lower
    humidity and increased surface temperature. This may be due to low precipitation
    in some parts of the selected basin. 3.2. Variation of the water body in the basin
    In this section, long-term in-situ datasets from 1985 to 2020 were used in order
    to better investigate the changes in the water body and shoreline of the lake.
    Fluctuations in the water level of a lake depend on the amount of precipitation
    and the flow of the rivers into the lake. According to Fig. 8(a), which illustrates
    the annual changes of the water level between 1985 and 2020, it can be seen that
    from 1991 to 1995, the water level increased continuously and reached its highest
    value in 1995. Then, it had a downward trend from 1996 to 2015 and reached its
    lowest value in 2015. After this year, the water level remained almost stable.
    However, the general trend of the lake''s water level was descending. The contours
    of the lake shores are shown in Fig. 8(b), which is consistent with the results
    of Fig. 8(a) and shows that the lake''s water surface area has reduced during
    the selected time period. Fig. 8(c) illustrates the Osman Yumrugu Island, the
    smallest island of Urmia Lake located in the mid-east part of the lake, in different
    ecological conditions. This figure shows the wide range of historical changes
    in the lake''s water level, and the striking lowering of water level. Download

    (a): Fluctuation of Urmia Lake water level, temperature, precipitation, and water
    intake volume to the lake during the selected time period, (b): the shoreline
    variations of Urmia Lake, and (c): the water level variation in Osman Yumrugu
    Island (IWRM, 2016). The trend of temperature variations in the region is slightly
    positive. Analysis of temperature variations in the selected period indicated
    that annual mean temperature varied from 12.9 °C in 1985 to 12.1 °C in 2020. During
    this period, the maximum temperature was 13.7 °C in 2001, and the minimum temperature
    was 9.7 °C in 1992. It can be seen that the temperature variations were not significant
    and effective for the possible increase of evapotranspiration in these periods.
    In fact, the slight increase in temperature does not explain the dramatic shrinkage
    of the Urmia Lake, besides, its contribution is marginal. As seen from Fig. 8(a),
    the amount of precipitation changed during the selected time period, but its trend
    was not steep enough to cause a sharp decrease in the water level of the lake.
    It seems that the decrease in the amount of incoming runoff from the rivers had
    a noticeable effect on lowering the water level of Urmia Lake, and also reducing
    the volume of water entering the lake. The river runoff variation given in Fig.
    8(a) shows a decrease in the volume of incoming water from 3520 Mm3 to 700 Mm3,
    which means that the volume of incoming water has decreased to almost one fifth.
    Many factors are involved in the occurrence of such conditions, which can generally
    be divided into two categories. First, the factors that are related to human activities,
    which include excessive use of water resources, excessive development of agriculture
    around the lake, and the structures built in the basin. One of the human activities
    is changing the cultivation pattern and creating unconventional deep wells in
    the region, especially between 1985 and 2014. At this time, the cultivation of
    water-based agricultural products increased from 350,000 ha to 500,000 ha. The
    construction of dams caused a sharp decrease in the catchment water of the lake,
    which, with these unplanned dams and changing of river direction to the agricultural
    areas, the lake went to dry. By considering the extra flowing water prevented
    by dams, can see the major impact of dams in the crisis. According to the Urmia
    Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) (2015), there are about 56 dams in the Urmia Lake
    basin, 42 of which were built between 1990 and 2014, and the purpose of building
    most of them was the development and prosperity of the agricultural sector. Along
    with the use of dam water for agricultural activities, deep and semi-deep wells
    were created to increase agricultural products. Therefore, dams and wells have
    reduced the amount of water recharging the lake and have had a direct impact on
    the shrinkage of the lake. The second category is climate change, which affects
    the ecosystem of the Urmia Lake as a result of the reduction in rainfall and the
    volume of river flow, as well as the increase in temperature and annual evaporation.
    The studies of Hamzeh et al. (2023) and Khorrami et al. (2023) showed that the
    basin had undergone an alarming hydrological situation from 2000 to 2020 with
    a total loss of 10 km3 from its terrestrial water storage. Hamzeh et al. (2023)
    revealed that the main cause for turning Urmia into a dried lake bed was human
    interference, since climatic factors contributed positively but to a lesser degree.
    They stated that among anthropogenic interferences, the construction of many river
    dams highly contributed to this disaster. 3.3. Variation of the salinity in the
    Urmia Lake basin and its environmental effects Investigating the trend of salinization
    and desertification progress for the selected basin was one of the main aims of
    this research. In this regard, zoning maps of the land use variations of the basin
    were evaluated during the selected period. Fig. 9 shows the obtained results.
    According to Fig. 9, the water surface area of the lake was approximately 5000
    km2 in 1985. Little variations could be seen from 1985 to 1990. After 1990, the
    water body increased and the lake attained its maximum surface area in 1995 (5980
    km2). Saline soil areas increased dramatically between 1996 and 2015. The lake''s
    water body was 5980 km2 in 1995. After this year, the water area gradually decreased,
    so that in 2014 and 2015, approximately 5000 km2 of the lake''s water area was
    converted to salt or salty soil areas. Water body reduced by 30% in 2005, and
    by 85% in 2015 compared to 1995 (the lake area was only 580 km2 in 2015). After
    2015, there was an increase in the water body. From 2015 to 2016, the water body
    increased up to 1495 km2, and the salty zone reduced by 340 km2 in 2016 compared
    to 2015. Between 2016 and 2020, there were slight changes in the area of water
    and salt bodies. After 2015, a general decrease trend in temperature and an increase
    in rainfall could be seen in the region. Therefore, proper climatic conditions
    can be one of the effective factors for the increase in the water area of the
    lake after this year. Also, the government states that more water has been allocated
    to the lake from the dams after this year to prevent it from drying up further.
    The area of irrigated lands has reduced by almost 13% since 2015, which indicates
    the decrease in water demand for agricultural activities in the region. According
    to the mentioned cases, it seems that in recent years, both climatic and human
    factors have had an important impact on the recovery of the lake. However, compared
    to 1995, the water surface area of the lake has reduced to a great extent, and
    the saline land around the lake has increased, which is difficult to reverse.

    Fig. 9. Salinization progress in the Urmia Lake during the selected period. Fig.
    10(a) shows some example photos of observed salty soils in the basin. The reduced
    water level causes the release of salt and salty soils in the air and increases
    the albedo value, which in turn affects the regional climate. Saline lands affect
    air quality and agricultural activities around the lake. Also, the wind spreads
    salt particles, which are harmful to human health, in the surrounding areas and
    disrupts human lives. According to the amount of saturated salt in the water of
    Urmia Lake, if the lake dries up completely, it can become a center for the spread
    of fine salt particles in the region. Hamzeh et al. (2023) stated that beyond
    the long-range transported dust, local factors such as a decrease in precipitation,
    soil dryness, changes in land use, and water-level reduction led to an increase
    in dust loading over the basin. Salt suspended particles in the air can reach
    the central cities of Iran and other neighboring countries. According to Fig.
    10(b), in such conditions, the provinces around the lake, such as West Azerbaijan,
    East Azerbaijan, and Kurdistan, will face the risk of becoming uninhabitable,
    and other provinces will also potentially face environmental disasters. Sotoudeheian
    et al. (2016) investigated the particle generation potential of the Lake Urmia
    bed and its effect on neighboring areas, after prospected desiccation. They developed
    a model assuming the lake''s bed as a potential dust origin and modeled the produced
    PM10 levels from this origin. The results showed that PM10 concentrations would
    have increased up to 30–60% for the studied dust episodes if the lake was desiccated.
    Ghomashi and Khalesifard (2020) investigated aerosols over the Urmia Lake via
    MODIS and CALIPSO and claimed that the dryness of large parts of the lake was
    the main cause for the increase in aerosol loading. Studies by Gholampour et al.
    (2017), Boroughani et al. (2019), and Ghale et al. (2021) showed an increase in
    PM10 concentrations over Northwest Iran and Eastern Turkey during the 2010s, ascribing
    it to the dryness of Lake Urmia. While, Hamzeh et al. (2023) showed that the dryness
    of the lake has affected the dust activity over Northwest Iran, which however,
    was mostly controlled by distant sources and long-range transported dust plumes.
    Considering the dominant southwesterly wind flow passing over the lake, the dust
    storm will mostly affect the Northwest regions, which includes Tabriz city. Download

    Salty soils observed in the basin (IWRM, 2016) and (b): affected areas by the
    saline storm within a radius of 50 to 300 km. In general, the consequences of
    the drying up of Urmia Lake are not only limited to this lake, but the human societies
    around it also face problems, a clear and extremely important and sensitive example
    of which is the phenomenon of “migration” in case of drying up of the lake. On
    the other hand, the reduction of water in Urmia Lake and its drying up have caused
    serious damage to the environment. Extreme salinity reduced the biodiversity and
    biomass of the lake. The native aquatic species of the lake, Artemia urmiana,
    have stopped growing except in the mouths of rivers, and as a result, the population
    of bird species that used to feed on it has decreased significantly. These findings
    are in line with the studies of Alizade Govarchin Ghale et al. (2017) and Feizizadeh
    et al. (2021), who investigated the environmental impacts of the Urmia Lake drying
    up. Alizade Govarchin Ghale et al. (2017) investigated decadal land cover changes
    and salinization in the Urmia Lake basin using remote sensing techniques. They
    stated that the area of irrigated lands has increased more than two times during
    the studied period (1975 to 2016) and soil salinity has increased in regions close
    to the Urmia Lake. Feizizadeh et al. (2021) investigated saline flow sources of
    the Urmia Lake drought and mapped the environmental impacts. Results showed that
    45.8% of the study area faces a very high and moderate probability of saline storm
    occurrence. These areas were more common in the Eastern and Southern parts of
    the Urmia Lake area. This is because the majority of these areas are barren land
    and abandoned agricultural lands affected by soil salinity. In general, according
    to the results of this study and previous studies, a reduction in the quality
    of agricultural lands, increased water salinization, and intensive dust storms
    might result in significant environmental issues. The creation of unfavorable
    environmental conditions due to the drying of the lake has also been confirmed
    in previous studies. Indoitu et al. (2015) and Wang et al. (2021) investigated
    the dust storms status over the last decades in the Aral Sea, which is one of
    the most active dust- and salt-emitting sites. Indoitu et al. (2015) showed that
    the Northeastern parts of the Aralkum Desert are one of the most active dust sources
    in the region, responsible for high aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere.
    Also, Wang et al. (2021) stated that from 2000 to 2019, in general, the eco-environmental
    quality in the Aral Sea basin was graded as worst, but with a trend of initial
    improvement, then deterioration, and finally further improvement. The basic reason
    for the temporal variation in the eco-environmental quality in the Aral Sea basin
    was the combined inter-annual change in the surface water and heat. The change
    in the eco-environmental quality was influenced by human activities more than
    by natural factors. In the next step, the salinity index (SI) is used for assessing
    the variations of soil salinity. Many studies have employed diverse soil salinity
    indices, either coupled or independently with different Remote Sensing methods
    to predict soil salinity (Pouladi et al., 2022). However, there is no specific
    remote sensing technique or soil salinity index that can support soil salinity
    prediction with a high correlation in all regions of the world. Therefore, researchers
    utilize the most relevant index and remote sensing technique based on the environmental
    and physical properties of their study region. Soil salinity indices are principally
    adjusted to detect salt minerals in soils based on the different responses of
    salty soils to various spectral bands. These techniques provide multispectral
    images with resolutions that can be ranged from medium to high, as well as hyperspectral
    images. The optical data sources used in soil salinity quantitative analysis mainly
    include three types of data. The first type is ground-based hyperspectral data.
    The main principle is using continuous spectral information to mine the relationship
    between soil salt content and spectral characteristics. Although ground-based
    hyperspectral data have high precision, only point information can be obtained,
    which makes it difficult to rapidly monitor regional soil salt content information.
    The second type of data source is satellite spectrum images. This source mainly
    uses the index obtained by satellite data to establish the relationship between
    it and soil salinity, and as a result, obtains regional soil salt content information
    (Zhang et al., 2019). Due to the high cost of hyperspectral satellite images and
    their lack of popularity, at present many studies are still based on satellite
    multispectral images. The third type of data source is unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) images. This method mainly uses UAV-carried spectrometers to collect near-map
    images. High-precision remote sensing images can be obtained in small areas, and
    ground information can be analyzed accurately (Wang et al., 2018). Gorji et al.
    (2020) evaluated >10 salinity indices for the Urmia Lake basin. Among the considered
    indices, a salinity index proposed by Douaoui et al. (2006) (i.e. Eq. (1)) revealed
    optimum results of correlation with the EC values provided in field measurements.
    Therefore, in this study, this salinity index was used. Fig. 11 shows the results
    obtained for the salinity index variations. In this figure, the dark and red colors
    show areas that are less and more susceptible to soil salinity, respectively.
    Based on the results, it could be stated that during the study period, salinity
    extended in the basin. The SI maps indicated considerable increase of soil salinity
    and salt affected lands, especially in the Eastern and Southern parts of the lake.
    The decrease trend in water surface area and the increase trend in salt and salty
    soil bodies were considerable after 1995. After this year, the shrinking of the
    lake caused an increase in the area of saline land, so that in 2015, the Southern
    half of the area completely dried up and turned into a salt marsh. After 2015,
    positive changes could be observed in the region. Download : Download high-res

    in the Urmia Lake basin. In order to validate the accuracy of the results obtained
    for the salinity index, the electrical conductivity values of 300 ground control
    sample points collected in 2005, 2015, and 2019 were used. The Correlation Coefficient
    (R) and Determination Coefficient (DC) between laboratory-measured soil salinity
    and remote sensing soil salinity index were assessed based on these sample points.
    The R provides information for the linear dependence between laboratory-measured
    and satellite-predicted values. The DC describes the relative assessment of the
    model performance in dimensionless measures. Table 1 shows the obtained results.
    From this table, a good correlation (R > 0.7 and DC > 0.68) could be seen between
    the selected samples and SI. Table 1. Correlation between soil salinity values

    in the Urmia Lake basin using the EWT-DSE multiscale method, 3.2 Variation of
    the water body in the basin, 3.3 Variation of the salinity in the Urmia Lake basin
    and its environmental effects, it could be deduced that the climate change and
    occurrence of drought had negative effects on the drying up of the lake, so that
    in dry years such as 2014 and 2015, the condition of the lake was worse. However,
    the effect of climate change was not enough to explain the dramatic water loss
    of the lake. The study of land use changes in the basin showed that human activities
    are important reasons for the lake''s shrinkage. For example, increasing the number
    of crops that use too much water, especially water-based products led to the need
    for water resources in the basin. Also, the crops extensively change to many water-used
    crops. In addition to using the dam''s water for agriculture, deep and semi-deep
    wells were developed for increasing crops. The cumulative effect of such human-induced
    interventions has been demonstrated as the main reason for the desiccation of
    the lake between 1996 and 2016. The drying of the lake can create a salty zone
    (with an area covering approximately 6000 km2) that has the potential to generate
    dust and salt storms, polluting the air in the basin and its vicinity. The increase
    in water body since 2015 showed that the restoration of the lake is possible.
    Since 2015, agricultural activities have been reduced, which can be due to the
    lack of water for irrigation, the increase in soil salinity in the basin, and
    the policies adopted by the government to rehabilitate the lake. The Urmia Lake
    disaster is not unique on a global scale. For example, Ebinur Lake in China has
    also experienced drying up conditions (Wang et al., 2019a; Wang et al., 2019b;
    Wang et al., 2023). The Ebinur Lake is a closed inland lake located within the
    arid region of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the Northwestern part of China.
    The shrinkage of this lake area is believed to be caused by ecological environmental
    deterioration and has become an important restraining factor for the social development
    of the local population. Due to the tremendous changes in Ebinur Lake and surrounding
    marshes during the last decades, Ebinur Lake has become a representative ecological
    degradation region. Wang et al., 2019a, Wang et al., 2019b, Wang et al., 2023
    investigated the predictive capability of remote sensing-related indicators for
    the monitoring and mapping of soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. They showed
    that soil salinization changes quite significantly in different seasons. Also,
    Wang et al. (2020) collected a total of 64 topsoil samples in an arid desert region,
    the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) to compare the monitoring
    accuracy between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. Based on the previous studies
    and the results obtained from this research, it can be stated that lake drying
    can be caused by water management failures, and the phenomenon is exacerbated
    by climate change. However, the restoration of the lake is possible and both human
    activities and climate factors can be effective in creating such conditions. According
    to the results of this research and previous studies, the Urmia Lake can be considered
    as a worrying case that clearly shows the need for immediate restoration initiatives.
    Based on the Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) (2017) report, due to the environmental
    effects of increasing salinity and reducing the quality of groundwater resources,
    several villages in the vicinity of the lake have been evacuated, which can be
    another reason for the reduction of agricultural activities in the region in recent
    decades. The use of a sustainable water resource management system compatible
    with climate change along with the appropriate management of water used in the
    agriculture section, the modification of the cultivation pattern, and educating
    the people living in the basin to understand the importance of water can be some
    of the practical solutions to reduce the complete drying risk of the lake, and
    to rehabilitate the lake. The results of this research can be used by authorities
    and environmental planners to identify potential constraints and prevent soil
    misuse and vegetation destruction. These results will lead to the observation
    of soil salinization and degradation, thus helping to reduce the rural exodus
    to the cities located in the basin, which is causing further challenges for these
    cities. 4. Conclusions This study focused on assessing the potential of a multiscale
    method and remote sensing datasets in monitoring the drought and soil salinity
    variations of the selected basin. In this regard, firstly, drought years and drought-prone
    areas were identified, and then, the lake''s water surface area and soil salinity
    variations were assessed. The results obtained for drought mapping using the DSE
    and SPI values indicated that the Southern parts of the basin were more likely
    to experience severe droughts, whereas the Northern parts experienced relatively
    milder droughts. Entropy and drought intensity were positively correlated, so
    that the lower the DSE, the lower the drought intensity. Analysis of the NDVI
    and LST variations of the basin from satellite data showed that during the drought
    years, the Eastern and Southern regions of the Urmia Lake had a higher temperature
    and lower vegetation density, which was consistent with the outcomes of the basin
    zoning using the mean DSE. Analysis of the annual changes of the water level showed
    that the water level increased continuously from 1991 to 1995 and reached its
    highest value in 1995, followed by a downward trend from 1996 to 2015. The water
    level was practically stable after 2015. Based on the results, variations of climate
    variables were not sufficient to explain the sharp drop in the water level of
    the lake. Zoning maps of the land use over the basin showed that saline soil areas
    increased dramatically from 1996 to 2015. In parallel, water covered areas were
    reduced by 30% in 2005, and by 85% in 2015. Between 2016 and 2020, there were
    only slight variations in the area of water and salt bodies. Better climatic conditions,
    reducing water demand for irrigation, and allocating more water to the lake lead
    an increase in the lake area after 2015. In general, the saline land around the
    lake gradually increased since 1995. Thereby, diffusion of salt and salty soils
    in the air affected the regional climate and had negative impacts on air quality
    and agricultural activities around the lake. It can be stated that human activities
    along with climate changes, have affected the ecosystem of the Urmia Lake and
    caused gradual desertification of the basin. Based on the results, land cover
    variations and salinization progress can be successfully determined using the
    developed methodology in this study and remote sensing-based datasets. Therefore,
    the applied method can also be used in other basins to monitor and manage desertification,
    and to protect the ecosystem of lakes. Ethics approval Not applicable. Consent

  description: The second-largest outflow system on Mars is Kasei Valles. The southern
    branch of Kasei Valles includes two inner channels among the best-preserved examples
    of glacial and/or fluvial erosion. This study focuses on the landforms formed
    by surface processes within the midstream part of the southern branch of the Kasei
    Valles. We mapped the landforms and built a morpho-stratigraphical chronology
    using their cross-cutting relationships, and numerical crater dating. We interpret
    a complex geomorphological history, with various landforms in the study area,
    including fans, landslides, topographic barriers, strandlines, terraces and deeply
    incised canyons. Two coluvaial fans and a large landslide temporarily blocked
    the valles, forming topographical barriers to impound fluids (e.g., lava, mudflow,
    water). It has been suggested that the structures observed in the channels were
    formed by Bingham or Newtonian fluid. However, these fluids have disappeared but
    they have left the terraces and strandlines as their geomorphic imprints. The
    surface texture of the terraces implies that they were probably formed by a very
    low viscosity fluid that carved the fan, valley floor and formed terrace staircases
    and deep canyons. Crater statistics reveal two different temporal clusters of
    colluvial fan formation. The age of the older fan cluster in the Early Amazonian
    period, and the age of the younger fan cluster in the Late-Middle Amazonian period.
    The landslide is much younger and estimated to have formed 122 Ma ago, allowing
    us to constrain the timing of the latest erosional period. The youngest studied
    geomorphic features are the platy-textured deposits emplaced either as lavas or
    mudflows, aged 90 Ma, covering the floor of the valles. The strandlines defining
    the limits of the youngest erosional (thermal) process within the study area truncate
    the landslide but not the platy-textured features. Therefore, they are older than
    90 Ma but younger than 122 Ma, implying environmental conditions sufficient to
    have allowed a liquid fluid body at the Martian surface during the Latest Amazonian
    period. Our data suggest that the presence of well-developed terraces between
    strandlines requires the presence of a fluid (e.g. water, liquid lava, mud) that
    ponded and subsequently evacuated from the study area.

    dating 1. Introduction The presence of earth-style landforms formed by surface
    processes (e.g., erosion, deposition) makes it more interesting to investigate
    the geomorphology of Mars since it has not been for a long-time an earth-style
    atmosphere. The mapping and dating of these landforms may provide information
    about the timing and mode of paleosurface processes on the planet and open new
    realms to investigate the evolution of a landscape away from our planet. Several
    studies focus on these landforms to understand Mars''s geology (Carr and Head,
    2010; Golombek et al., 2020) and climate (Kite, 2019) by rarely landscape evolution.
    This study focuses on Kasei Valles, located in the northern hemisphere, due to
    well development of landforms formed by surface processes and their cross-cutting
    relationship. Its channel is 2500 km long and bifurcates starting from midstream.
    Landforms related to surface processes are very evident on the southern branch
    of the bifurcation. This branch of the Kasei Valles flows from west to east from
    Echus Chasma to Chryse Planitia. The channel of the valles is carved within a
    high plateau surface with a 3.6 Ga age (Chapmann et al., 2010a, 2010b). The relief
    of the valles reaches 3 km at some places. The initial erosion of (Noachian period)
    the valles’ channel is related to erosive processes driven by water, water and
    ice, mud and glaciers, debris flows (; Baker and Milton, 1974; Carr, 1974; Schonfeld,
    1976; Masursky et al., 1977;; Nummedal and Prior, 1981; Lucchitta, 1982; Hoffman,
    2000; Williams and Malin, 2004; Leverington, 2011; Hoper and Leverington, 2014,
    2018; Dundas et al., 2019) and lava (Carr, 1974; Schonfeld, 1976; Cutts et al.,
    1978; Schonfeld, 1979a, 1979b; Leverington, 2011). The deep and long channel of
    the valles hosts several landforms formed by surface processes such as fan-shaped
    features (Williams and Malin, 2004; Chapman et al.,2010b; Dundas and Keszthelyi,
    2014), landslides (Dundas and Keszthelyi, 2014; Crosta et al., al.,2018), a deep
    canyon (Williams and Malin, 2004; Chapman et al., 2010b; Dundas and Keszthelyi,
    2014; Leverington, 2018), terraces (Williams and Malin, 2004; Chapman et al.,
    2010b; Leverington, 2018; Hepburn et al., 2020; Duran and Coulthard, 2020), dendritic
    drainage networks (Zealey, 2009; Chapman et al.,2010b), lobate debris aprons (Lucchitta
    and Chapman, 1988; van Gasselt et al., 2007; Hauber et al., 2007; Chapman et al.,2010b;
    Zealey, 2009; Hepburn et al., 2020), shorelines (Chapman et al., 2010b), and platy-ridge
    texture features (Keszthelyi et al., 2000; and Williams and Malin, 2004). There
    is an ongoing debate about the genesis (lava or mud) of the platy-ridge textured
    features covering the floor of valles (Quantin et al., 2005; Mangold et al., 2008,
    2010; Gourronc et al., 2014; Rodriquez et al., 2016; Dundas et al., 2019). In
    this study, we map and date these landforms and aim to understand the mode, mechanism,
    and timing of surface processes within Kasei Valles to propose a conceptual landscape
    evolution model, and we focus on the Late-Amazonian period. Our geomorphic mapping
    and crater-counting dating efforts results indicate that the overall carving of
    the Valles''s canal has been completed between Hesperian and early Amazonian,
    which provides accommodation space for the landforms formed by hillslope and fluvial
    processes such as fans, landslides, a canyon and terrace staircases. Their cross-cutting
    relationship and retention ages indicate environmental changes between early and
    latest Amazonian. 2. Regional setting Kasei Valles (24° N, 65° W) is located in
    the northern hemisphere of Mars (Fig. 1A). Uranius Mons, Tharsis Tholus, Lunae
    Planum, Valles Marineris, and Chryse Planitia are major morphological features
    surrounding Kasei Valles (Fig. 1B). Though Kasei Valles consists strictly of deeply
    eroded valles extending eastward from the Tharsis region toward the Chryse Planitia,
    the broader Kasei Valles system originates at Echus Chasma. Download : Download

    topography and major geomorphic units around the Kasei Valles. The most prominent
    geological units (Chapman et al.,2010a, 2010b) are the Hesperian plains unit (Hr)
    along the Lunae Planum Plateau from south to north. The Lunae Planum has a very
    flat and subtle surface topography with an average surface age of 3.6 Ga (Chapman
    et al., 2010a, 2010b). The east-west-oriented reach of the Kasei Valles is covered
    by Hch1 (Late-Hesperian) and Hch2 (Early-Hesperian) in the central and northeastern
    parts. Still, it is mainly covered by the Ach (Middle-Amazonian) and Apf (Late-Amazonian)
    and At5 (Middle-Amazonian) units (Chapman et al., 2010a, 2010b). Hch1 and Hch2
    are the Hesperian channels deposits, corresponding to the early stages of fluvial
    imprints on the landscape, but Ach and Apf correspond to the Amazonian outflow
    channel floor materials and platy-flow lava units, respectively (Baker, 1982;
    Carr, 1996; Chapman et al., 2010b; Rodriguez et al., 2015a; 2015b; Leverington,
    2018). Apf and At5 are the two youngest lava units in the valles and originated
    from Tharsis province (Dundas et al., 2019). Platy-ridged lavas (Apf) are observed
    in the North Kasei Valles, South Kasei Valles, Sacra Sulci, and Echus Chasma (Chapman
    et al., 2010a; Dundas and Kestzthelyi, 2014). Duran and Coulthard (2020) proposed
    a timeline for the long-term evolution of Kasei Valles. They show five episodes
    of channel incision with an elevated local ocean/base level during the Hesperian
    period. They suggested the development of Kasei Valles from Early-Hesperian (3.6
    Ga) to Early-Amazonian (2.0 Ga). The Kasei Valles''s last resurfacing date provides
    information on when the channel later flooded, indicating that episodic channel
    activity continues up to around 2.0 Ga (Duran and Coulthard, 2020). One volcanic
    and two fluvioglacial episodes followed these episodes during the Early Amazonian,
    <1.8 Ga, (Chapman et al., 2010b). 3. Data and methods 3.1. Geomorphic mapping

    with a resolution of 6 m/pixel (Malin and Edgett, 2001; Malin et al., 2007). We
    focused on the midstream part of the southern branch of the Kasei Valles and mapped
    the landforms in 1:50,000 scales using QGIS (https://www.qgis.org). We built a
    morphostratigraphy of landforms based on their cross-cutting relationships and
    numeric ages. 3.1.1. Numerical dating of landforms: crater size-frequency distribution
    We measured the CSFD (Crater size-frequency distribution) using CTX images (Hartmann
    and Neukum, 2001; Ivanov, 2001). We made our measurements using ArcGIS software.
    We measured all impact craters using CraterTools in ArcGIS (Kneissl et al., 2011;
    Michael and Neukum, 2010). CSFD was calculated using Craterstats 2.0 software,
    and it used a cumulative plot and the function chronology from Hartmann and Neukum
    (2001) and Hartmann (2005). We analyzed a local area in the midstream part of
    the southern branch of Kasei Valles. When estimating the age of the valles floor,
    we removed the fan-shaped feature and the landslide from the crater count area
    and accepted only the lowest outline of the fan or hillslopes we applied to CSFD.
    We determined the crater diameters between 0.1 km and 3 km. We obtained the ages
    by considering all the craters (Table 1). This method enables an age estimate
    of the age of the selected area based on the number of craters (Quantin et al.,
    2004; Schon et al., 2009; Hartmann et al., 2010; Hauber et al., 2013; Rodriquez
    et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2014; Kneissl et al., 2015). Secondary craters
    and ghost craters that might overestimate the ages of landforms are critical problems
    in crater counting. For this reason, we did not use these types of craters in
    estimating the ages of landforms of interest. We integrate our crater model ages
    with the morphostratigraphy of the landforms to constrain the ages of particular
    small features, such as the fan and the landslide. Table 1. Cumulative Distribution

    Valles is carved within the surface of an extensive plateau (Lunae Planum) characterized
    by high elevation and low topographic relief (Figs. 1 and 2). The Kasei Valles
    is deeply incised and shaped by depositional and erosional landforms of different
    ages. The valles floor is smooth except at the four constrictions (Dundas and
    Keszthelyi, 2014), where landslide or fan-shaped features blockade the valles’
    channel (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    Context Camera image (CTX) images. B) Longitudinal profiles of the Kasei Valles
    in the study area. Since the resolution of the DEM is very coarse (463 m), there
    are some noises, but each knickpoint coincides with constrictions formed by a
    landslide or Fans. The headward inclination of the profile at Fans 2 and 3 is
    an excellent geomorphic marker of the damming of the valley but Fans 2 and 3.
    4.1. Depositional landforms and their ages 4.1.1. Colluvial fans Depositional
    landforms within the valles are typically formed by fluvial, hillslope, or both
    processes (Varnes 1978; Reneau et al., 1984, 1990; Blair and Mcpheson, 2009).
    The hillslope of the Kasei Valles is also very rich in fan-shaped features. Based
    on their geomorphic characteristics, such as the mean slope gradient (∼36° near
    the apex and ∼16° near the toe) and the absence of extensive river courses and
    drainage basins on their upstreams, we mapped these features as fan in four areas
    and labelled them as 1, 2, 3, and 4, from downstream to upstream (Fig. 2, Fig.
    3, Fig. 4). The first fan (Fan 1) complex is located downstream of the study area
    (Figs. 2 and 3). Fan 1 begins at the southern wall and stretches until the northern
    wall. The relief of the fan between its apex and distal parts is around 1 km (Fig.
    5A), within a short distance (<10 km) with a high surface gradient. Fans 2 and
    3 are located 20 km upstream of Fan 1 (Figs. 2 and 3). Fan 2 is sourced from the
    southern wall, and Fan 3 is from the northern wall. Both fan complexes are 60
    km long and 8–10 km wide, with 1 km relief from their apexes to their distal parts.
    Fan 4 is the last fan-shaped feature (Fig. 6), located 50 km upstream of Fan 2.
    This fan is more minor than Fan 2, with an 18–20 km length and 3–4 km width. It
    has a lower relief (400–500 m, Fig. 5C). A few smaller craters on the fan surfaces
    surround well-preserved and relatively large impact craters. From downstream,
    our numerical age estimations of Fan 1 yield an age of 1.14±0.34 Ga (Fig. 7).
    However, the surface ages of Fan 2 and Fan 3 are higher, 1.74±0.33 Ga (Fig. 7)
    and 1.48±0.28 Ga (Fig. 8), respectively (Table 1; Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The
    surface age of Fan 4 is much younger and yields 307±92 Ma (Table 1; Figs. 6 and
    8). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image

    4.1.2. Topographical barriers and depressions The extensive development of Fans
    1, 2 and 3 blocked the valles'' channel and gave rise to depressions on their
    upstreams. We identified three depressions formed in different blocked parts of
    the valles. The first depression is located in the downstream portion of the study
    area. The northward propagation of Fan 1 to the northern wall blocked the valles
    (Constriction 4 in Dundas and Keszthelyi, 2014) and formed Depression 1. An outburst
    channel incised this fan and defined its northern limit. Terraces carved the distal
    part of Fan 1, and the talus slopes along the north wall (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig.
    4). This depression''s floor elevation is around −2600 m, and its depth is about
    150–200 m, covering a surface area of approximately 128 km2. The second depression
    formed where Fans 2 and 3 merged and constructed a topographic barrier blocking
    the valles (Constriction 3 in Dundas and Keszthelyi, 2014). This barrier began
    the largest impounding area within the valles, corresponding to Depression 2 (Fig.
    9, Fig. 10). This depression covered a surface area of approximately 7322 km2.
    It was 130–150 m deep and 400 m higher than Depression 1 (Fig. 11), linked to
    a deeply incised canyon. Fan 4 does not fully occupy the valles (Fig. 6). Therefore,
    it does not form a barrier. Still, it does create a constriction (constriction
    2, in Dundas and Keszthelyi, 2014), making the valles floor narrower. The third
    depression is located in the upstream part of the study area (Fig. 12). A landslide
    from the northern wall blocked the valles (Constriction 1 in Dundas and Keszthelyi,
    2014). Today, this part of the valles is not blocked, but the large blocks between
    the landslide and the southern wall indicate that the toe of this landslide used
    to dam this part of the valles for some time (Figs. 12 and 13). The size of Depression
    3 is not precisely determined, but a 200–230 m high and a strandlines can be observed
    15 km in the upstream direction. Crater statistics from depressions estimates
    reveal that the surface age of the valles floor is 90.5 ± 20 Ma (Fig. 14). Download

    Fig. 14. Conceptual geomorphological evolution of the Kasei Valles. 4.2. Erosional
    landforms and their ages 4.2.1. Plateau surfaces Two plateau surfaces were mapped
    within the study area. The higher plateau surface is extensive and can be observed
    from large distances from the study area. The second lower plateau surface covers
    very limited areas, especially along the length of the valles. It is flat but
    accentuated by grooves, polygonal fractures, and carved labyrinthine dendritic
    features (Figs. 3 and 4). Our surface age estimations reveal that the age of the
    higher plateau surface is 3.6 Ga (as Chapman et al., 2010b), and that of the lower
    plateau surface is 3.39 Ga (Table 1). The Kasei Valles was incised within these
    plateau surfaces. The incision is up to 3200 m (Fig. 5A, B, C, D) and formed very
    steep hillslopes between the plateau surfaces and the valles floor, prone to steep
    erosion and depositional features such as landslide and fans. 4.2.2. Landslides
    There is more than one landslide in the valles, but we focused on the largest
    for crater statistics. The largest landslide is just 30 km upstream of Fan 4 (Figs.
    2, 4, and 6). It developed at the southern slopes of an impact crater and has
    eastern and western compartments (Fig. 14). In total, 11 impact craters having
    different sizes formed on the main body of the landslide (Fig. 13). The surface
    age of the landslide is calculated as 122±34 Ma (Table 1; Fig. 14). 4.2.3. Strandlines
    and terraces Strandlines are linear features that truncate the toes of the fans,
    landslides and hillslopes. Chapman et al. (2010b) found similar morphological
    features and defined them as wave terraces at the lake strandlines with the Echus
    Chasma, upstream of Kasei Valles. In our study area, they are especially well-preserved,
    along with the toes of the fans. We identified the strandlines in four sites (Fig.
    2). The first site is at the most downstream part corresponding to Depression
    1. There are three primary strandlines levels, but this increases to four or five
    toward the outlet of the depression (Figs. 3 and 11). The second strandlines group
    belongs to Depression 2 and is developed on Fans 2, 3, and 4 (Figs. 2 and 3).
    Here we identified three major strandlines with terrace staircase morphology (Fig.
    5B and C). The most upstream strandlines in Depression 2 are observed on the distal
    parts of Fan 4, 50 km west of Fan 1 (Figs. 10 and 11). Unlike the fans, there
    is only one level of the strandlines without terrace morphology on the landslide
    (Fig. 12). The eastern compartment has a very subtle strandlines trace. Still,
    the western compartment (the upstream part) has an evident trace that can also
    be observed toward the upstream of Depression 3 along the hillslopes (Figs. 4
    and 12). 4.2.4. Canyon Another well-expressed erosional landform is the canyon
    between Depression 2 and Depression 1 (Fig. 10). The length of this canyon is
    10 km, and its depth is 150–200 m. This canyon should be the result of headward
    erosion due to the elevation difference between the upper depression (Depression
    2) and the lower depression (Depression 1). 5. Discussion 5.1. Evolution of the
    landscape Several processes, such as volcanic (Chapman et al., 2010a, 2010b) and
    fluvial (Williams et al., 2000; Williams and Malin, 2004; Duran and Coulthard,
    2020) activities, were considered responsible for the initial erosion of Kasei
    Valles. After initial carving, the geomorphology of the valles was shaped by the
    gravitational, erosional, and depositional processes driven by different agents.
    The oldest geomorphic unit is the Lunae Planum. As the highest plateau surface,
    it was dated 3.6 Ga earlier by Chapman et al. (2010a). The retention age of the
    lower plateau surface is 3.39 Ga (Fig. 14B), and the channel network dissected
    the upper plateau surface between 3.6 Ga and 3.39 Ga. The large extent of the
    lower plateau surface indicates a denudational phase. Based on the elevation difference
    between the high and low plateau surfaces, we can speculate a denudation rate
    of 0.0152 mm/yr within this time frame (Fig. 14B). This time frame corresponds
    to Hesperian Period when the climate was appropriate for creating river networks
    (Stepinski and Collier, 2004; Toon et al., 2010; Hoke et al., 2011; Dickson et
    al., 2020). The deep channel of the southern Kasei Valles has also dissected the
    upper and lower plateau surface. This episode of landscape evolution must have
    occurred between 3.6 Ga and 1.74±0.33 Ga (based on the minimum age of the oldest
    colluvial surface) before the colluvials along the hillslope of the valles were
    formed. The mean incision of the valles is 3200 m. The incision rate yields 0.0017
    mm/yr within this time frame. It corresponds to the Latest Hesperian and Early
    Amazonian periods when outflow channels could develop on Mars (Lucchitta, 1982;
    Leverington, 2004, 2011). The first generation of colluvial fans developed between
    1.74±0.33 and 1.48±0.28 Ga (Middle Amazonian; Fig. 14D). A cold and dry climate
    with sporadic fluvial activity characterized this time frame. There is significant
    time difference between the first and second generations of colluvial fans. The
    third phase of landscape evolution is the deposition of the second generation
    of colluvial fan around 307±92 Ma, in Late Amazonian (Fig. 14E). After the formation
    of depositional landforms, the first significant geomorphic event was a landslide
    that occurred 122 ± 34 Ma ago (Fig. 13). This landslide and the merged colluvial
    fans gave rise to the formation of constrictions and impounding of water in three
    depressions. The reason why we propose the pounding of liquid fluid (e.g., water
    or mud) is based on the presence of typical terrace morphology of the lacustrine
    terraces (Fig. 9) and the absence of any material such as lava or mud that covers
    terrace surfaces. Besides, the fluvial entrenchment of Colluvial Fan 1 surface
    (see Figs. 3 and 7a) indicates the possibility (probably groundwater sapping)
    of the presence of liquid in the study area. The maximum elevation of the strandlines
    indicates that the valles were filled by approximately ∼ 200–220 m (according
    to 75 m resolution DTM from Mars Express), high above the floor. There are three
    strandlines levels on the toes of fans, whereas there is only one strandlines
    level on the landslide body. The three strandlines levels indicate multiple erosion
    phases along depressions 1 and 2, where fans stretch. This liquid used to flow
    from Depression 2 to Depression 1 along the 10 km long and 150 m deep canyon.
    However, a single strandline on the landslide body indicates the breaching from
    the landslide fan dams and the rapid evacuation of liquid material quickly in
    a single event toward Depression 2. Subsequently, the valles’ floor was flooded
    by a shallow lava (Dundas and Keszthelyi, 2014; Leverington, 2018) or mud (Williams
    and Malin, 2004) that formed a platy-ridge textured pattern along the study area.
    The retention age of this platy-ridge pattern surface yields 90±20 Ma. Accordingly,
    the formation of the strandlines should be after the formation of the 122±34 Ma
    old landslide and 90±20 Ma shallow lava or mud that formed a platy-ridge pattern.
    Although their errors overlap, this time frame is similar ponding of water emitted
    from a fossa or crack and the formation of lacustrine terraces around 54–98 Ma
    (Chapman et al., 2010b) in Echus Chasma (upstream Kasei Valles), corresponding
    to the latest (the fourth) fluvioglacial episode in Amazonian Period. 6. Conclusions
    Our geomorphic mapping reveals that the midstream part of Kasei Valles is dominantly
    shaped by surface processes that formed a large body of fans, landslides, topographical
    barriers, depressions and strandlines. The earliest phase of the valles started
    with the denudation of the higher plateau surface and the development of the lower
    plateau surface between 3.6 Ga and 3.39 Ga with a 0.0152 mm/yr denudation rate.
    On the other hand, the overall 3200 m vertical incision of the main valles’ channel
    occurred between 3.6 Ga and 1.74 Ga. The rate of this incision is 0.0017 mm/yr
    until the first generation of fans is formed. The second and third generations
    of fans developed starting from 1.14 Ga and 0.3 Ga, respectively. The landslide
    in the upstream part of the study area is formed 122±34 Ma. They gave rise to
    forming of depressions and ponding of the water along the valles. The lacustrine
    strandlines of this ponding water must be formed after 122±34 Ma before 90±20
    Ma when platy-ridge textured material emplaced within the study area. CRediT authorship

  description: Land subsidence (LS) due to natural processes or human activity can
    irreparably damage the environment. This study employed the quasi-permanent scatterer
    method to detect areas with and without subsidence in the period from 2018 to
    2020. In addition, 12 factors affecting subsidence were selected to detect LS-prone
    areas. Information gain ratio (IGR) and frequency ratio methods were used to determine
    the importance and weighting of various factors and sub-factors affecting subsidence.
    Novel approaches, including the standard adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference
    system (ANFIS) algorithm and its integration with the particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) algorithm, yielded LS maps. The models’ predictive performance was assessed
    using statistical indexes such as the root mean square error (RMSE), area under
    the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and confusion matrix criteria
    (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and recall). Finally, Shapley
    additive explanations approach was used to explore the importance of features
    in modeling. The findings showed that the subsidence pattern was V-shaped, averaging
    321 mm/year. Ground-leveling and interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements
    revealed a 0.93 correlation coefficient with a σ = 1.43 mm/year deformation rate.
    Based on IGR analysis, aquifer media, the decline of the water table, and aquifer
    thickness played pivotal roles in LS occurrences. In addition, the ANFIS-PSO model
    classified approximately 50.26 % of the study area as high and very high susceptibility.
    The AUROC values of ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS models for the training dataset were 0.912
    and 0.807, respectively. For the testing dataset, the ANFIS-PSO model produced
    a higher AUROC value of 0.863, while the ANFIS model had a value of 0.771. In
    addition, the RMSE values for the ANFIS-PSO model were lower. Given its remarkable
    accuracy, the ANFIS-PSO model was deemed suitable for evaluating subsidence susceptibility
    in the study area.

    Creative Commons license open access Abstract Land subsidence (LS) due to natural
    processes or human activity can irreparably damage the environment. This study
    employed the quasi-permanent scatterer method to detect areas with and without
    subsidence in the period from 2018 to 2020. In addition, 12 factors affecting
    subsidence were selected to detect LS-prone areas. Information gain ratio (IGR)
    and frequency ratio methods were used to determine the importance and weighting
    of various factors and sub-factors affecting subsidence. Novel approaches, including
    the standard adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm and
    its integration with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, yielded
    LS maps. The models’ predictive performance was assessed using statistical indexes
    such as the root mean square error (RMSE), area under the receiver operating characteristic
    curve (AUROC) and confusion matrix criteria (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, precision,
    accuracy, and recall). Finally, Shapley additive explanations approach was used
    to explore the importance of features in modeling. The findings showed that the
    subsidence pattern was V-shaped, averaging 321 mm/year. Ground-leveling and interferometric
    synthetic aperture radar measurements revealed a 0.93 correlation coefficient
    with a σ = 1.43 mm/year deformation rate. Based on IGR analysis, aquifer media,
    the decline of the water table, and aquifer thickness played pivotal roles in
    LS occurrences. In addition, the ANFIS-PSO model classified approximately 50.26
    % of the study area as high and very high susceptibility. The AUROC values of
    ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS models for the training dataset were 0.912 and 0.807, respectively.
    For the testing dataset, the ANFIS-PSO model produced a higher AUROC value of
    0.863, while the ANFIS model had a value of 0.771. In addition, the RMSE values
    for the ANFIS-PSO model were lower. Given its remarkable accuracy, the ANFIS-PSO
    model was deemed suitable for evaluating subsidence susceptibility in the study
    area. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Quasi-permanent

    aquiferParticle swarm optimizationRemote sensing 1. Introduction More than 150
    countries currently face land subsidence (LS) issues (Fabris et al., 2021). Natural
    or human activities cause gradual subsidence or sudden sinking of the Earth’s
    surface (Tomás et al., 2020). LS causes severe economic and social problems, as
    well as the loss of human life (Hu et al., 2019). In Iran, more than 300 plains
    have been directly affected by subsidence (Chatrsimab et al., 2020). Underground
    water extraction is mostly to blame in this area, although some LS occurs due
    to natural events such as earthquakes, drainage in organic soils, and underground
    mining. Therefore, investigating and modeling LS is necessary to identify locations
    vulnerable to LS risk, with the ultimate aim of preparing an LS susceptibility
    map (LSSM) that can be used to make decisions and plan preventive measures to
    reduce damage from future events (Ghorbanzadeh et al., 2020). Subsidence modeling
    begins with determining the range and rate of the phenomenon. Over the past decade,
    subsidence data have regularly been collected using precision leveling and global
    navigation satellite techniques (Baldi et al., 2009, Zhu et al., 2015). However,
    these methods are time-consuming and point-based (Liu and Helm, 2008). In recent
    years, subsidence has been detected using a novel technique called interferometric
    synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) (Smith and Knight, 2019), which operates at a
    regional scale with low costs and centimeter to millimeter accuracy (Zhou et al.,
    2017). However, this method also has limitations, such as temporal and spatial
    decorrelation (Duan et al., 2018). To overcome these issues, time series InSAR
    has recently been applied (Guo et al., 2017). This method has been developed into
    the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique, which has been further expanded into
    permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI), PSI-SBAS, SqueeSAR, and tomographic
    synthetic aperture radar (Zhang et al., 2019). PSI uses several algorithms to
    estimate deformation. One of these is the quasi-permanent scatterer (Quasi-PS)
    method (Perissin and Wang, 2012). Several previous studies have used this method
    to measure and monitor LS; for example, Gao et al. (2019) applied Quasi-PS analysis
    to study LS and ground gaps at Beijing Capital International Airport. The results
    of the processing were evaluated against the results of ground-leveling measurements.
    The deformation rates obtained using leveling and InSAR measurements showed good
    accordance with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.96 and a standard error (SE)
    of 1.33 mm/year. Luo et al. (2014) used the multi-temporal InSAR method to monitor
    subsidence in Tianjin and validated the results using GPS/leveling data from two
    reference stations. The authors reported an average subsidence rate of 4.84 mm/year.
    Given the diverse range of remote sensing analysis methods available, selecting
    the appropriate technique is a crucial prerequisite in the process of modeling
    subsidence. Many researchers have attempted to model subsidence using geographic
    information system (GIS)-based methods (Joseph and Udofia, 2014, Suh, 2020, Arabameri
    et al., 2021a, Ku and Liu, 2023). These methods can be divided into two categories:
    quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative models include statistical methods
    and soft calculations (Khosravi et al., 2021). The methods used include artificial
    neural networks (ANN) (Zhao and Chen, 2011, Kim et al., 2017), logistic regression
    analysis (Oh and Lee, 2010, Tien Bui et al., 2018b), random forest (Mohammady
    et al., 2019), and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) (Ghorbanzadeh
    et al., 2020). Although a variety of models have been devised and used to prepare
    LSSMs (Tien Bui et al., 2018a, Tien Bui et al., 2018b), no comprehensive study
    has identified a successful technique and model for improving prediction accuracy
    and reliability (Oh and Lee, 2010). Therefore, efforts to find a suitable model
    are necessary. Furthermore, due to the influence of various factors with nonlinear
    characteristics on LS, along with the presence of complex dependencies and uncertainties,
    the preparation of LSSM has become a challenging task (Oh et al., 2019). In such
    cases, machine learning (ML) methods that combine fuzzy logic (Zadeh, 1965) and
    neural networks, such as the ANFIS, are useful for modeling uncertainty and complexity
    of the problems such as LSSM preparation (Razavi et al., 2019). Despite its superior
    performance, ANFIS has some limitations due to its difficulty in identifying the
    best weight for model parameters, significantly affecting its prediction performance
    (Tien Bui et al., 2018b). Due to the challenges and constraints associated with
    existing methods, land subsidence studies necessitate innovative approaches. One
    approach could be the combined use of metaheuristic algorithms (Feizizadeh and
    Kienberger, 2017), of which the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is
    one of the most popular. PSO is different from other optimization algorithms in
    that only the objective function is needed, and it is not dependent on the gradient
    or any differential form of the objective function (Rezakazemi et al., 2017).
    The PSO algorithm for weighting parameters has been used to model various natural
    hazards such as floods, landslides, and erosion in combination with the ANFIS
    algorithm (Tien Bui et al., 2018b). The efficiency of the ANFIS-PSO method has
    been proven for flood susceptibility mapping (Razavi Termeh et al., 2018), landslide
    spatial modeling (Chen et al., 2019), potential groundwater mapping (Razavi-Termeh
    et al., 2020), and the spatial prediction of soil properties (Mahmoudzadeh et
    al., 2022), it has yet to be employed specifically for the preparation of LS maps.
    This study used the ANFIS model to build an LSSM and the Quasi-PS technique to
    generate a subsidence inventory map (SIM). The ANFIS algorithm provided accelerated
    learning capacity and the ability to capture complex patterns and nonlinear relationships
    between input data (Chopra et al., 2021). Furthermore, the PSO algorithm was applied
    to determine the optimum value for the ANFIS hyperparameters and thus improve
    model prediction. PSO was used due to its simplicity, fast convergence speed,
    versatility, robustness, and gradient-free nature (Solis-Rodriguez et al., 2023).
    The optimization of ANFIS hyper-parameter values using PSO eliminates the need
    to manually adjust them. Unlike gradient-based algorithms that can get stuck in
    the local optimum, using the meta-heuristic PSO algorithm can avoid this, resulting
    in improved accuracy for the LSSM. Moreover, the contribution and relative importance
    of factors contributing to LS occurrence were investigated. This study was executed
    in four distinct stages. Initially, we performed an in-depth analysis of diverse
    input layers, and collected relevant data. Subsequently, we generated the existing
    ground subsidence layer using the Quasi-PS method using the SARPROZ software.
    In the second stage, we quantified the impact of each contributing factor on LS
    occurrence. To achieve this, we estimated the weights associated with each factor
    through frequency ratio (FR) and information gain ratio (IGR) methods. In the
    third stage, we developed the ANFIS and ANFIS-PSO models to generate the Landslide
    LSSM. Furthermore, we explored the effects of these factors on the model’s output
    using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) approach. Finally, we evaluated
    the accuracy and reliability of the generated map by calculating metrics such
    as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), root mean
    square error (RMSE), and various criteria from the confusion matrix (including
    sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and recall). This comprehensive
    assessment ensures the robustness and validity of our results. 2. Study area LS
    has affected more than 300 plains in Iran, with Tehran-Karaj-Shahriyar being one
    of the most severely affected. The area is located in an approximately 2000 km2
    area of the Daryache Namak watershed between longitudes 50°45′ to 51°34′ and latitudes
    35°18′ to 35°65′ (Fig. 1). Over the 20-year period of 2000–2020, Iran''s average
    temperature and rainfall were 11.7 °C and 412.5 mm/year, with corresponding values
    at the study area of 16.2 °C and 227.5 mm/year. In the last census of groundwater
    resources in 2011, 40,275 wells, 1,336 springs, and 429 qanats with annual discharges
    of 1,931.74, 108.45, and 226.23 mm3, were reported by the Geological Survey and
    Mineral Exploration of Iran (GSI, https://gsi.ir). Download : Download high-res

    area. Furthermore, groundwater consumption (from wells and qanats) was about 2024.6
    million m3, whereas 1013.9 million m3 of water was abstracted from surface water
    resources. Agriculture, drinking, and industrial uses were allocated 1394.17,
    1587.41, and 65872 m3, respectively. The period of greatest aquifer exploitation
    was reported from 1999 to 2001, with an average growth rate of about 5 million
    m3/year. Stratigraphically, the oldest geological unit in the study area is the
    Zagun Formation, which belongs to the Infra-Cambrian, and the youngest sedimentary
    units are the Quaternary. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Subsidence inventory map
    The Quasi-PS method was used to monitor subsidence in 2018–2020 and produce a
    SIM. Quasi-PS is an advanced PS-InSAR technique that extracts phase estimation
    weights from partially coherent targets. The PS and Quasi-PS techniques differ
    mainly in the choice of pixel candidates and the spatial and temporal connection
    diagram (Milillo et al., 2015). In the present study, PS and Quasi-PS analyses
    were performed using SARPROZ software (https://www.sarproz.com/) (Perissin and
    Wang, 2012). First, to perform the processing, an interferometric spatial coherence
    map was used to select the candidate pixels in the Quasi-PS technique, where the
    structure of the interferogram graph was based on a minimum spanning tree (MST).
    The primary function of an MST is to maximize the normalized cross correlation
    (CC) between two images (Jefriza et al., 2020). The data processing stage involved
    utilizing Sentinel-1A satellite images in ascending orbit. The shuttle radar topography
    mission digital elevation model (DEM) was employed to eliminate the topographic
    phase. To ensure high coherence and stability in the SAR acquisition time interval,
    only PS candidates (PSC) with high temporal coherence (threshold 0.8, amplitude
    stability index) were selected to estimate the atmospheric phase scene and preliminary
    parameters. Fig. 2 shows the PSC distribution in the Tehran-Karaj-Shahriyar area.
    To improve displacement and height estimations, atmospheric disturbances must
    be estimated and removed. Afterward, PS was obtained to estimate absolute and
    relative heights, displacements, and land deformation rates. An illustration of
    land deformation velocity (mm/year) modeled using Quasi-PS processing and inverse
    distance weighting is shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (908KB)

    (b) inverse distance weighting method. After preparing the LS map, 2500 points
    representing subsidence and non-subsidence were selected (Fig. 4). 1250 points
    in the subsidence area were randomly selected for modeling. Additionally, 1250
    points were randomly selected in areas without subsidence, specifically in regions
    with substantial bedrock close to the surface, which are less susceptible to LS
    compared to areas with unconsolidated sediment layers. Download : Download high-res

    sample points. Furthermore, the average land deformation velocity (mm/year) was
    considered to accurately identify both subsidence and non-subsidence points. Thus,
    if the land deformation velocity (mm/year) for the point was less than the mean
    value (-134 mm/year), the point was coded 0, and if the velocity was higher than
    the threshold, the point was coded 1. It is common to randomly select subsidence
    and non-subsidence points, as demonstrated by previous studies (e.g., Wen et al.,
    2022, Jafari et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023a, Zhang et al., 2023b). 3.2. Preparation
    of the spatial database There are currently no established guidelines for selecting
    influential factors in LS susceptibility mapping (Jafari et al., 2023). Previous
    studies showed that various (in)direct factors affect LS. Meanwhile, selecting
    the main factors influencing subsidence is crucial for LS spatial modeling and
    determining vulnerable areas. Therefore, according to prior studies, data availability,
    as well as geological and topographic characteristics of the study area, 12 factors
    were selected, as shown in Fig. 5 (Farr et al., 2014, Ghorbanzadeh et al., 2018,
    Arabameri et al., 2021c, Arora et al., 2021, Panahi et al., 2022a). Download :
    Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Factors
    affecting subsidence: (a) aquifer media, (b) land use, (c) lithology, (d) distance
    to faults, (e) distance to streams, (f) bedrock level, (g) transmissivity coefficient,
    (h) storage coefficient, (i) recharge rate, (j) discharge layer, (k) aquifer thickness,
    and (l) declination of water table. The aquifer media layer (mixture of clay,
    silt, sand, and gravel) in the saturation zone is directly proportional to the
    subsidence vulnerability (Sadeghfam et al., 2020). This layer was obtained from
    75 well logs using GSI information. Urban development, agricultural land expansion,
    and other land use changes directly and indirectly lead to LS (Minderhoud et al.,
    2018). A land use map was generated based on a Sentinel-2A (2021) image and was
    classified into range land, agriculture, and urban area. Groundwater pumping is
    the most crucial cause of LS in the plains, particularly sedimentary plains. Water
    abstraction from groundwater sources reduces hydraulic pressure and soil particle
    spacing, increasing the effective tension and layer density, thus causing subsidence
    (Minderhoud et al., 2018). Studies show that every 10 m of declining water level
    can lead to 1 to 50 cm LS and varies according to the type of stress, the density
    and thickness of layers, and the loading times (Alipour et al., 2008). Information
    from the GSI was used to generate a discharge layer based on the annual extraction
    rate from wells in the Tehran-Karaj area (6,870 wells). The recharge rate was
    inversely related to LS; therefore, increasing land recharge reduced the probability
    of LS occurrences (Nadiri et al., 2018). The Piscopo method was applied to determine
    the recharge rate by combining the slope, soil permeability, and rainfall layers.
    The aquifer’s thickness is another factor directly related to LS (Chatrsimab et
    al., 2020). The thicker the aquifer, the more water can be withdrawn, and the
    greater the weight of the sediments and their deformation due to water abstraction.
    Conversely, the lower the aquifer thickness, the less water can be withdrawn (Nadiri
    et al., 2018). The aquifer thickness was determined using geo-electric sections
    of the plain, which dated back to 2007. Tectonic movements, such as faults, are
    a natural factor that causes subsidence. Faults exacerbate subsidence by displacing
    fine-grained and coarse-grained material in crevices. The closer the area is to
    the location of a fault, the greater the possibility of subsidence (Nadiri et
    al., 2018). Ten years (2010–2020) of piezometer data for the region were obtained
    from the Tehran Regional Water Authority (https://wrbs.wrm.ir) to determine the
    groundwater declination. The raster layer was obtained for integration with other
    layers after interpolating the data for the whole region using the Kriging method.
    In addition, the distance to the stream network could affect the groundwater level.
    A stream network was obtained from a topography map (scale 1:25:000) provided
    by the GSI. Reducing the distance to the stream network increase the possibility
    of subsidence. Streams can adversely affect land stability by eroding the slope
    and saturating the lower part of the soil, raising the water level (Alogayell
    et al., 2021). Transmissivity and storage coefficients were determined by pumping
    tests and were classified into four and five classes using ArcMap, respectively.
    Farr et al. (2014) showed that lithology can play a critical role in LS, and various
    geological formations could create different LS patterns (Xu et al., 2008). The
    presence of water influences the dissolution of gypsum and carbonate rocks, which
    also increases subsidence rates (Youssef et al., 2016). Thus, we prepared lithology
    maps using a 1:100,000-scale geology map provided by the GSI. The alluvial thickness
    map data were subtracted from the topographic map data to prepare a bedrock-level
    map. The DEM map for the aquifer was used to prepare bedrock-level maps. In their
    study, Fatolahzadeh et al. (2022) demonstrated that the consolidation process
    amplifies the risk of subsidence due to the incremental depth of the bedrock.
    3.3. Assessing the importance of and correlations between the factors affecting
    subsidence One of the most widely used indices for investigating independent variables
    is the variance inflation factor (VIF) (Arora et al., 2021). A VIF value greater
    than 5 indicates the existence of multi-collinearity between the factors affecting
    subsidence (Lin and Billa, 2021). The IGR method was used to determine the relative
    importance of factors affecting subsidence. A higher IGR indicates a greater power
    for the factor to change the modeling results. In IGR, only variables associated
    with the event are taken into account. It is an entropy-based method (Tien Bui
    et al., 2018a). The following equations were used to calculate the IGR for a specific
    factor (C) in the training dataset (D), which consists of n samples belonging
    to i-th class (Yu et al., 2019, Panahi et al., 2022b): (1) (2) (3) (4) The split
    entropy refers to information gained by splitting D into m partitions corresponding
    to m outcomes of a test on C. In addition, each layer’s weight was calculated
    based on the FR method (Bianchini et al., 2019). Statistical approaches are based
    on the relationships between subsidence-related factors and past subsidence distributions,
    and this correlation can be quantitatively evaluated using the FR model (Mersha
    and Meten, 2020): (5) where PLS and P are the subsidence percentages in the proposed
    subclass and its area, respectively. 3.4. ANFIS-PSO model ANFIS was developed
    by Jang (1993). The model combines an ANN and fuzzy inference system (FIS) (Jacinth
    Jennifer and Saravanan, 2021) and consists of five layers: the inputs and outputs
    of membership functions, rules, normalization, non-fuzzy and output layers (Ghorbanzadeh
    et al., 2020). The equations of these layers are presented in Eqs. (6), (7), (8),
    (9), (10). (6) where μ is a membership function for the fuzzy set Ai. (7) where
    wi is the weight of the neuron. (8) where is the normalized weight. (9) where
    indicates the output of layer 3, and (pi, qi, ri) are the parameter set, also
    referred to as the consequent parameters. (10) The design and training of the
    ANFIS is usually conducted using classical approaches, such as descending and
    post-propagation gradients (Jacinth Jennifer and Saravanan, 2021). In this study,
    the PSO was used for the optimal design of the ANFIS. The PSO algorithm was developed
    by Kennedy and Eberhart (1995) and begins with the initial population; particles
    with one speed move randomly from their initial position within the search space
    (Chen et al., 2017). The particles continue the search by updating their positions.
    Therefore, each particle’s location was updated with two values of Pbest (i.e.,
    the best situation that the particle has ever achieved) and Gbest (i.e., the best
    situation that the population has ever achieved). Finally, the optimum particle
    position was obtained according to two factors ( and ) presented in Eqs. (11),
    (12) (Roushangar and Shahnazi, 2020). (11) (12) where and are acceleration coefficients,
    is the inertia weight, and U1 and U2 are random parameters, respectively. 3.5.
    Proposed methodology Two main steps were developed to prepare a susceptibility
    map using the ANFIS model and its optimization with PSO. Initially, the ANFIS
    algorithm was used to create the initial FIS as described below: 1. Data on subsidence
    influencing factors were collected, and then, a SIM was generated using Quasi-PS
    method. 2. The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets. 3. The fuzzy
    C-means clustering method was used to develop an initial FIS. 4. Using the hybrid
    learning algorithm embedded in ANFIS, the optimal FIS (Known as ANFIS) was created.
    5. All the membership functions of the initial FIS inputs and outputs were estimated
    and placed in the vector. To ensure that all ANFIS generated have the same rules,
    initial FIS rules (R) were also extracted. The second step optimizes FIS membership
    function values. Optimization tunes membership functions to minimize the objective
    function, namely; the RMSE value on training datasets. The steps are as follows:
    1. The Clerc method was used to adjust the initial PSO parameters (Clerc and Kennedy,
    2002). 2. PSO operations were applied to generate solution S ( random numbers-
    n is the number of membership function parameters) to obtain optimal membership
    function values P ( ). During the generation of solution S, the appropriate range
    of the P vector is checked to obtain upper and lower confidence limits. 3. FIS
    is created and evaluated using basic rules (R) and new membership function values
    P. 4. The termination criteria (RMSE = 0) or iteration = 1000 was checked. 5.
    Optimal P values were returned. 6. ANFIS-PSO was created by using the optimal
    membership function value P. Fig. 6 shows the methodological flowchart. Download

    ANFIS-PSO methodological flowchart. 3.6. Validation of the model The ANFIS-PSO
    model was evaluated using the AUROC index. The AUROC was calculated based on the
    following equation: (13) where Ts and Tns are the number of subsidence events
    that were correctly classified as subsidence and non-subsidence, respectively.
    S and NS represent the total number of subsidence and non-subsidence pixels (Chapi
    et al., 2017). A statistical criterion, namely the RMSE, was used to evaluate
    models for subsidence prediction: (14) The subsidence probability values yi and
    xi were the observed and predicted values, respectively, and N was the number
    of samples. Moreover, the predictive performance of models was assessed using
    the sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, recall and F1-score (Arabameri
    et al., 2021b, Jafari et al., 2023): (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) where NLST,
    LST are the number of samples correctly predicted as class 0 (non-subsidence)
    and class 1 (subsidence). NLSF, and LSF are the number of samples incorrectly
    predicted. 3.7. SHAP This study used SHAP technique (Shapley, 1953) to determine
    and rank the importance of features and their effects on the output of ANFIS and
    ANFIS-PSO models during susceptibility map preparation. SHAP is a collaborative
    game theory-inspired method for understanding black-box models and interpreting
    their inner workings (Lundberg and Lee, 2017). In addition to quantifying the
    importance of each feature in a model''s prediction, SHAP also evaluates whether
    a feature has a positive or negative effect (Zhang et al., 2023a, Zhang et al.,
    2023b). A detailed explanation of SHAP can be found in He et al., 2023, Lundberg,
    2018, and Yao et al. (2023). 4. Results This study focused on LSSM preparation.
    To achieve this, the PSO and ANFIS were coupled to develop the ANFIS-PSO. 4.1.
    Factor analysis As shown in Table 1, the distance to faults (VIF = 2.30) and the
    decline of the water table (VIF = 1.01) had the highest and lowest VIF values,
    respectively. Since the alignment between the selected independent variables was
    minimal, less than five, the 12 identified independent variables can be effectively

    created an FIS from the training data. The membership function parameters and
    FIS rules constructed by the ANFIS were extracted for use in the following stages
    of the research, which optimized the ANFIS hyperparameters. For this reason, the
    PSO algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the ANFIS, which are
    the parameters of the FIS membership functions. The Clerc method was applied to
    optimize the initial PSO parameters ( and ). A similar approach was employed by
    (Razavi Termeh et al., 2018) to optimize the hyperparameters. By tuning the initial
    PSO parameters using the Clerc method and conducting 1000 iterations, the FIS
    derived from ANFIS was optimized. Then, each pixel in the area was entered into
    the models (ANFIS and ANFIS-PSO), and LS susceptibility maps were produced using
    the resulting values. Afterward, each map was categorized using the fuzzy c-means
    method as very low, low, moderate, high, or very high hazards. A similar approach
    was employed by Metrikasari et al., 2021, Sahraei et al., 2023, and Yu et al.
    (2023) to classify the flood susceptibility map. Fig. 7 shows the subsidence susceptibility
    maps resulting from the ANFIS and ANFIS-PSO models. LS was high and very high
    in the center and north-western regions of the plain and low and very low in the
    eastern, southern, and northern areas. Download : Download high-res image (338KB)

    class. In the ANFIS-PSO model, the vast majority of area had high and very high
    susceptibility (50.26 %). The ANFIS model considered 47.29 % of the area as high
    and very high susceptibility. In the ANFIS-PSO, the area with moderate susceptibility
    was 25.18 %, whereas in the ANFIS model, this class was 29.87 %. These differences
    underscore the variance in sensitivity between the two models in identifying susceptibility
    classes across the study area. The ANFIS-PSO model appeared to be slightly more
    conservative, categorizing a larger portion of the area as having high susceptibility,
    while the ANFIS model predicted that a significant portion of the study area has
    moderate susceptibility. Table 3. Susceptibility class percentages. Model Class

    processing was assessed by comparing InSAR-derived observations to ground-levelling
    measurements, including deformation rates (Fig. 8). The deformation rates, as
    determined from the leveling and InSAR measurements, exhibited strong agreement,
    with a CC of 0.96 and a SE of 1.33 mm/year. Download : Download high-res image

    As shown in Fig. 9, an AUROC of 0.912 was achieved by the ANFIS-PSO in the training
    phase, while the ANFIS achieved an AUROC of 0.807. In the testing phase, the ANFIS-PSO
    (AUROC = 0.863) emerged as the most accurate model (Table 4). The PSO correctly
    predicted the optimal parameters of the ANFIS model based on the RMSE, sensitivity,
    specificity, precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score values shown in Table 4.

    10 illustrates the importance of features in predicting ANFIS and ANFIS-PSO models.
    The features are ordered by their importance based on ANFIS-PSO on the horizontal
    axis. The features of the decline of water table, storage coefficient, lithology
    and land use had the most significant impact on the model''s prediction. In contrast,
    distance to streams, aquifer thickness, bedrock level, and discharge layer had
    the least impact. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. ANFIS and ANFIS-PSO feature importance plots based on
    mean absolute SHAP values. 5. Discussion Subsidence characterization and monitoring
    were carried out using the Quasi-PS technique. A maximum value of 32.1 cm/year
    was estimated for displacement. Comparing the InSAR and ground-leveling measurements
    of deformation resulted in acceptable CCs and standard deviations. The subsidence
    results calculated in this study were consistent with those obtained in previous
    studies, such as Mahmoudpour et al. (2016), who found that LS in the study area
    in 2018 was about 33 cm/year. Overharvesting of groundwater resources and a series
    of droughts have reduced the groundwater level of the region, leading to LS. The
    delicate texture of the soil in the aquifer media of the study area played a key
    role in predicting LS-prone areas with the highest IGR value, whereas due to the
    lithological uniformity of the plain, the lithology had the least effect on the
    prediction of LS and the lowest value of IGR. These results are consistent with
    those of Chen et al., 2016, Cao et al., 2020, and Giao et al. (2020), which showed
    that among the significant contributors to LS, the clayey layers mainly controlled
    the process. The predictive accuracy of the ANFIS and ANFIS-PSO models was evaluated
    using both the training and testing datasets. The ANFIS-PSO model eliminated the
    main shortcomings of the ANN methods with no trapping in the local optimum for
    the algorithm. The results indicated the acceptable learning and prediction capabilities
    of the ANFIS-PSO, in line with Fadhillah et al., 2022, Mehrabi et al., 2020, and
    Panahi et al. (2021). SHAP mean values of ANFIS-PSO outputs indicate a low importance
    for the discharge layer feature similar to IGR results. However, in contrast to
    IGR, the lithology plays a more significant role in predicting the ANFIS-PSO model.
    On the other hand, based on the SHAP mean values of ANFIS-PSO outputs the decline
    of water table, storage coefficient, lithology and land use emerge as more important
    factors. Therefore, the calculated importance of two SHAP and IGR methods are
    different in some features. This finding may be attributed to the fact that features
    with low individual importance can become crucial when combined with complementary
    features that have high importance. Additionally, methods like IGR, which examine
    features individually, may not always provide accurate results (Xue et al., 2015).
    The spatial distribution of LS-prone areas exhibits approximately a similar pattern
    in the ANFIS and ANFIS-PSO models (Fig. 7). Both models indicated that most subsidence
    occurred in the northwestern of the plain, where the largest decline in groundwater
    occurred. Moreover, a moderate probability of LS occurrence has been reported
    in the central areas due to the fine-grained sediments (clay and clay-silt). These
    results are consistent with those of studies conducted by the Iran National Cartographic
    Centre (https://www.ncc.gov.ir/). Some uncertainties in this study stem from the
    methods used to determine the locations of historical LS using SAR images, (i.e.,
    Quasi-PS) and the ML approaches (i.e., ANFIS-PSO) employed to generate the susceptibility
    map. Generally, SAR signals can be affected by atmospheric conditions such as
    cloud cover, precipitation, and atmospheric turbulence. These factors can cause
    phase errors in SAR images, leading to uncertainties in the measurement of ground
    displacement. Moreover, the Quasi-PS method relies on the interferometric coherence
    between pairs of SAR images. However, this coherence can be deteriorated by factors
    such as vegetation cover, surface roughness, and temporal decorrelation, resulting
    in uncertainties in the measurement of ground displacement. In addition, the ANFIS-PSO
    performance depends on the quality of the input variables (scale/resolution),
    and the method may not perform well on noisy data or data with missing values.
    Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider these uncertainty sources and
    their potential impact on the predictive ability of the ANFIS-PSO model. 6. Conclusion
    The Iranian plains are at risk of subsidence due to droughts and declining groundwater
    levels, which has created the need for modeling studies of this phenomenon. This
    study proposes a new hybrid method to predict LS. ANFIS and PSO are combined in
    our proposed approach. Based on the AUROC, RMSE, and confusion matrix criteria,
    the ANFIS-PSO model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for LS. Furthermore,
    the storage coefficient and decline of the water table were identified as the
    main factors affecting the prediction of LS susceptibility by using the SHAP interpreter.
    Thus, planners and policymakers should include these factors in their land subsidence
    mitigation strategies. The sources of uncertainty that can exist in the process
    of land subsidence modeling include the presence of errors in spatial data and
    errors in subsidence prediction. Thus, it is suggested that future studies use
    methods such as Dempster-Shafer theory (Dempster, 1968, Shafer, 2020) and techniques
    (e.g., voting, stacking) to deal with uncertainty in data and modeling. Identifying
    factors influencing land subsidence and preparing LSSM would help land managers
    and planners to protect and manage water resources, respond to natural hazards,
    and prevent land degradation. More monitoring of groundwater use in the region
    is required, particularly in the agricultural sector, because continuing the current
    trend in groundwater use due to recent droughts will lead to severe subsidence
    risks in the region. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that

  description: Surface coal mining is one of the most environmentally destructive
    human disturbances. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of
    the speed and scale of coal mining and its major environmental impacts in the
    Xilingol Steppe, Inner Mongolia from 1990 to 2015, using remote sensing data and
    landscape metrics. Our results show that during this period the number of surface
    coal mining areas (SCMAs) increased from 40 to 504 (about 13 times), while the
    size of SCMAs increased from 3.21 km2 to 283.62 km2 (greater than 88 times). The
    rapid expansion of SCMAs greatly fragmented the steppe landscape, consumed huge
    amounts of water, damaged rivers and wetlands, and substantially reduced grassland
    productivity. We estimated that the amount of water consumed by coal mining increased
    from 2.35 million m3 in 1990 to 242.61 million m3 in 2015 (more than 103 times),
    negatively affecting all six major rivers and most wetlands in the region. About
    222 km2 of steppes were eradicated, resulting in a grassland production loss of
    7.17×1010 g C. Our findings indicate that surface coal mining has transformed
    the steppe landscape and devastated its ecosystem function and services, posing
    a major threat to the environment of the region. Future studies need to focus
    on more in-depth integrative assessments of environmental, economic, and social
    impacts of surface coal mining to seek sustainability solutions for the region.

    of the most environmentally destructive human disturbances. This study provides
    the first comprehensive assessment of the speed and scale of coal mining and its
    major environmental impacts in the Xilingol Steppe, Inner Mongolia from 1990 to
    2015, using remote sensing data and landscape metrics. Our results show that during
    this period the number of surface coal mining areas (SCMAs) increased from 40
    to 504 (about 13 times), while the size of SCMAs increased from 3.21 km2 to 283.62
    km2 (greater than 88 times). The rapid expansion of SCMAs greatly fragmented the
    steppe landscape, consumed huge amounts of water, damaged rivers and wetlands,
    and substantially reduced grassland productivity. We estimated that the amount
    of water consumed by coal mining increased from 2.35 million m3 in 1990 to 242.61
    million m3 in 2015 (more than 103 times), negatively affecting all six major rivers
    and most wetlands in the region. About 222 km2 of steppes were eradicated, resulting
    in a grassland production loss of 7.17×1010 g C. Our findings indicate that surface
    coal mining has transformed the steppe landscape and devastated its ecosystem
    function and services, posing a major threat to the environment of the region.
    Future studies need to focus on more in-depth integrative assessments of environmental,
    economic, and social impacts of surface coal mining to seek sustainability solutions
    for the region. Similar content being viewed by others Surface coal mining impacts

    the largest contributor to global carbon emissions, accounting for more than 40%
    of global CO2 emissions in 2018 (Ma et al. 2021). Coal mining can also lead to
    a series of ecological and environmental problems, such as soil erosion, natural
    habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, air pollution, water contamination, soil
    erosion and contamination, public health issues, and cultural and aesthetic resources
    (Rathore and Wright 1993; Bian et al. 2010; Palmer et al. 2010; Hendryx 2015;
    Giam et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2018; Sengupta 2021). In recent years, concerns about
    coal production have intensified due to the rapid industrialization driven by
    coal in developing countries such as China, India, and South Africa (Furlow 2017;
    Thomson et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2021). China has the highest
    mining output of coal in the world, and China''s actions are crucial to the carbon
    emission governance in the global coal industry. From 1990 to 2021, the overall
    production of raw coal in China showed an upward trend, increasing from 108,000
    tons in 1990 to 4.07 billion tons in 2021, accounting for 49.80% of the world’s
    total coal production (NBSC, 1991, 2022; Royal Dutch /Shell Group of Companies
    2022). Today, coal remains China’s primary energy source. While the Chinese government
    has taken measures to limit carbon emissions and support renewable energy, the
    likelihood that coal consumption will continue to grow during the \"14th Five-Year
    Plan\" period (2021-2025) is extremely high (Li 2021). The most environmentally
    damaging form of coal mining is surface or strip mining because it usually disturbs
    huge areas of vegetation, soil, and water across landscapes (Ma et al. 2018, 2021;
    Zeng et al. 2018). Surface coal mining areas (SCMAs) refer to the spatial extent
    within which coal reserves are exploited using opencast mining techniques, including
    the surrounding areas associated with mining activities (e.g., heavily damaged
    land areas and waste/gob piles). Specifically, SCMAs consist of extracting areas,
    stripped areas, and dumping areas (World Coal Institute 2015; Zeng et al. 2017,
    2018). In the past several decades, surface coal mining has rampaged across the
    Mongolian Plateau, especially in Inner Mongolia of China (Wu et al. 2015a; Ma
    et al. 2018). From 1980 to 2015, the coal production in the region increased by
    approximately 862 million tons, with its contribution to the country''s total
    coal production rising from 3.57% to 24.27% (NBSC 2016). While coal mining has
    been a key driver for the region’s economic growth, it has brought about enormous
    ecological and environmental impacts on broad scales (Wu et al. 2015a; Shang et
    al. 2019; Qian et al. 2014). These impacts include river interruption (Wang et
    al. 2008), lake shrinkage (Tao et al. 2015), grassland degradation (Liu et al.
    2014a; Kang et al. 2014), and biodiversity loss (Wang et al. 2014). For example,
    surface coal mining destroyed and damaged more than 9,000 km2 of natural vegetation
    and croplands in Inner Mongolia by removing vegetation and topsoil or polluting
    the surrounding soil, water, and air (Ma et al. 2021); and the Swan Lake in the
    Wulagai River Basin in Inner Mongolia decreased in size from 3 km2 to 0.2 km2
    during 1988-2009, due mainly to water consumption by surface coal mining (Shang
    and Wu 2022). Yet, the government of Inner Mongolia, in its \"13th Five-Year Plan
    for Energy Development in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region\", has declared that
    coal production is to be promoted to meet the growing needs for energy production
    and supply (IMARPG 2017). This trend seems to pose greater challenges for sustainable
    development in the region and beyond. In particular, surface coal mining has transformed
    the landscape of the Xilingol Steppe of Inner Mongolia, an internationally renowned
    temperate grassland in the world for its unique flora, fauna, and culture (Wu
    and Loucks 1992; Li et al. 2012). On the one hand, the Xilingol Steppe is arguably
    the most studied grassland ecosystem in China because of its ecological importance
    and well-established long-term research facilities (Wu and Loucks 1992; Bai et
    al. 2004; Wu et al. 2015a, b). On the other hand, the voluminous output of ecological
    research during the past 50 years has done little to slow down the pace of ecosystem
    degradation and landscape fragmentation in the region. As surface coal mining
    has been increasingly recognized as a primary culprit for recent environmental
    changes, several studies have quantified the spatial extent of mining sites (e.g.,
    Zhang et al. 2022) and assessed their ecological impacts in different locations
    within this region (e.g., Chun et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2020). Existing studies
    on coal mining in Inner Mongolia focused mainly on individual local sites, such
    as Shengli open-pit coal mines and Bin Yinhua open-pit coal mines located in the
    central region of the Xilingol Steppe (Wu et al. 2020; Shen et al. 2021; Zhang
    et al. 2022), or were included in broad-scale investigations at the national or
    provincial levels that had inadequte detail within each county (e.g., Xiang et
    al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2022; Shen et al. 2023). But little is known about the
    total amount and spatial distribution of SCMAs across the entire Xilingol Steppe
    which is a core area of the Mongolian grasslands. Regarding the environmental
    impacts of surface coal mining, most studies focused on single ecological and
    environmental factors, such as plant species diversity and vegetation cover (Chun
    et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2020). Comprehensive spatial analysis of coal mining areas
    and their environmental impacts for the Xilingol Steppe region as a whole is still
    lacking. To fill these research gaps, this study was intended to quantify the
    amount, spatial distribution, and major environmental impacts of SCMAs across
    the Xilingol Steppe region in Inner Mongolia. Specifically, we addressed the following
    two research questions: 1) How did the number, size, and spatial pattern of coal
    mining sites in Xilingol change during 1990-2015? 2) How did surface coal mining
    impact water resources and natural ecosystems in this region? This study was expected
    to provide scientific support for curbing surface coal mining and promoting regional
    sustainable development, as well as demonstrating the effectiveness of using a
    landscape ecological approach to tackle the environmental problem of coal mining.
    Data and methods Study area The Xilingol Steppe is located in the Xilingol (or
    Xilinguole) League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Fig. 1), where “autonomous
    region” is equivalent to “province” and “league” is similar to “prefecture”. A
    league in Inner Mongolia is composed of “banners” and counties, both of which
    are county-level administrative units. Hereafter we use Xilingol Steppe, Xilingol
    League, or simply Xilingol to refer to the same geographic region. Xilingol covers
    a land area of about 200,000 km2, accounting for approximately 17% of the total
    land area of Inner Mongolia. The terrain of Xilingol is high in the south and
    low in the northeast, with elevation varying from 755 to 1,859 m. The region is
    dominated by a temperate semiarid and aid climate, with a mean annual temperature
    of 2.2 °C and a mean annual precipitation of 278 mm (Li et al. 2012). Three types
    of natural grasslands together account for more than 95% of Xilingol’s territory,
    with Meadow Steppe in the east, Desert Steppe in the west, and Typical Steppe
    in between as the predominant vegetation in the region (Li et al. 2012). Fig.

    to the administrative boundary of Xilingol League (prefecture), Inner Mongolia,
    with the boundaries of constituent counties (or banners) shown Full size image
    According to a government report (OLCEC 2016), the Xilingol region has a confirmed
    coal resource reserve of 144.8 billion tons and a predicted coal reserve of 260
    billion tons. There are more than 60 coal bearing areas, including 33 coal fields
    with a reserve of over 500 million tons and 6 coal fields with a reserve of over
    10 billion tons. Brown coal (low heat content and high pollution potential) accounts
    for 99.5% of the total coal reserve in Xilingol (IMARSB 2016). Data acquisition
    and processing To quantify the spatiotemporal pattern of SCMAs in Xilingol, we
    obtained Landsat TM/OLI data with a resolution of 30m from the United States Geological
    Survey (USGS) website (http://glovis.usgs.gov). The time period covered was the
    growing season from June to October for the years of 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010,
    and 2015 (because SCMAs were distinct from vegetation during the growing season).
    To evaluate the accuracy of the extracted SCMAs information, we obtained ground
    truth data from Google Earth image on September 12, 2015 (https://earth.google.com).
    Coal production data for the Xilingol region from 1990 to 2015 were obtained from
    the Inner Mongolia Statistical Yearbooks (IMARSB 2016). The river data were obtained
    from the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center (http://www.ncdc.ac.cn). The data
    on administrative boundaries and the digital elevation model (DEM) were obtained
    from the National Geomatics Center of China (http://www.ngcc.cn/). The spatial
    pattern of land use and land cover in Xilingol in 1990 was acquired from the ChinaEco100-Spatiotemporal
    Distribution Dataset of Ecosystem Types in China, provided by Data Center for
    Resources and Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn).
    Seven land use and land cover types were classified: farmland, forest, grassland,
    water body and wetland, desert, settlement, and others, with a resolution of 100m.
    The NPP data used In this study were derived from MODIS/TERRA satellite remote
    sensing parameters and BIOME-BGC model, obtained from USGS (https://www.usgs.gov/).
    Quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns of SCMAs We used the object-oriented decision
    tree method (Zeng et al. 2017) to extract the SCMAs in Xilingol for the years
    of 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The method had been successfully used
    to detect SCMAs in the Ordos region in Inner Mongolia with high accuracy in our
    earlier studies (Zeng et al. 2017, 2018). In this study, we assessed the accuracy
    of the extracted SCMAs using the high-resolution imageries from Google Earth.
    The overall accuracy of the extracted SCMAs information was 97.07%, with an average
    Kappa coefficient of 0.80. Both user and producer accuracy were above 80%. The
    results of our accuracy assessment were shown in Table S1. Thus, the extracted
    SCMAs information in this study had relatively high accuracy and can be used for
    further research. Adequately characterizing landscape changes requires the quantification
    of both landscape composition (i.e., patch diversity and relative abundance) and
    configuration (e.g., patch size, shape, and spatial arrangement) (Gustafson 1998;
    Turner and Gardner 2015). So, we chose three composition metrics (i.e., Patch
    Density, Edge Density, and Percentage of Landscape) and six configuration metrics
    (i.e., Largest Patch Index, Mean Patch Size, Landscape Shape Index, Area-Weighted
    Mean Fractal Dimension, Mean Euclidean Nearest Neighbor Distance, and Aggregation
    Index), all of which have been widely used in landscape ecological studies (Table
    S2). Specifically, we selected the nine landscape metrics based on several previous
    studies that were intended to measure landscape changes driven by human activities
    (Herzog et al. 2001; Wu et al. 2002, 2011; Zeng et al. 2018). Choosing these same
    metrics can facilitate comparison of landscape changes caused by different kinds
    of human activities (e.g., urbanization versus surface coal mining). In our analysis,
    we first quantified the number and area of SCMAs, as well as their changes, between
    1990 and 2015. Then, using FRAGSTATS Version 4.2 (McGarigal et al. 2023), we computed
    the nine metrics all at the class-level by focusing on the coal mining sites.
    Changes in the landscape metrics between 1990 and 2015 were analyzed at the prefectural
    and county levels to examine how these changes varied with scale. Estimating environmental
    impacts of surface coal mining Quantifying the impacts of surface coal mining
    on water resources To assess the possible impacts of surface coal mining on water
    resources in the Xilingol region, we first estimated the amount of water used
    for extracting coal and washing the extracted coal to remove impurities such as
    ash and soil. Our analysis was based on the standards and measures established
    in previous studies. On an average, extracting a ton of coal requires 0.9 cubic
    meters of water, and washing one ton of coal needs 2.5 cubic meters of water (Song
    et al. 2012). Based on these numbers, we calculated the consumption of water by
    surface coal mining with the following equations: $${W}_1={P}_R\\ast 0.9+{P}_W\\ast
    2.5$$ (1) where W1 is the amount of direct consumption of water resources (m3),
    PR is the coal production, and Pw is the amount of coal washed. Because of the
    lack of information on the exact amount of coal that was actually washed, as a
    first approximation of the magnitude of impact, we assumed that all extracted
    coal was washed (i.e., Pw = PR). Our estimation is likely to represents the upper
    limit of the water consumption for coal mining in the Xilingol region. Second,
    we estimated the potential impacts of surface coal mining on groundwater according
    to data in Jin et al. (2007), who reported that producing one ton of coal contaminates
    2.54 cubic meters of groundwater by discharging waste water containing dissolved
    solids and toxic substances. Thus, we used 2.54 m3/ton as a multiplier to calculate
    the amount of groundwater that might be contaminated by surface coal mining. Third,
    we estimated the potential negative influences of surface coal mining on rivers
    using a buffer analysis. Previous studies in China have reported that the detrimental
    environmental influences of human activities, including coal mining, usually reach
    1 to 3 km into the surrounding areas from the sources (Zhou et al. 2016; Zhang
    et al. 2021). Here we chose the average distance (2 km) of influence to assess
    river pollution by coal mining. That is, if a river was within 2 km of a mining
    site in distance, it was considered to be contaminated. So, we created a 2-km
    buffer zone on both sides of the rivers in the study area, and identified all
    SCMAs that fell in the buffer zone for each river. The area of SCMAs in the river
    buffer zone was used to indicate the degree that the river was affected. Quantifying
    the impacts of surface coal mining on vegetation and NPP By overlaying the spatial
    distribution of vegetation in 1990 and the maps of SCMAs in later years, we calculated
    the areas of different types of vegetation that were encroached by surface coal
    mining. The impacts of coal mining on Net Primary Productivity (NPP) were estimated
    by combining spatial downscaling and space-time substitution methods as per Cheng
    et al. (2017) and Zhou et al. (2016). Specifically, the 30-m resolution NDVI of
    the study area in 2015, obtained from the Landsat-8 OLI image, was resampled at
    the resolution of 1 km. Then a linear model was fitted to represent the relationship
    between resampled NDVI and MODIS NPP (Fig. S1). The loss of NPP due to surface
    coal mining from 1990 to 2015 was computed using the following formula: $${NPP}_L=\\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^N{NPP}_i\\left({SCMA}_i^{2015}-{SCMA}_i^{1990}\\right)$$
    (2) where NPPL represents the amount of NPP lost to surface coal mining for the
    entire Xilingol Steppe region from 1990 to 2015. NPPi is the annual NPP value
    of the i-th pixel in 2015 if the i-th pixel was non-SCMA in 2015, or it takes
    the average NPP value of non-SCMA pixels within 1 km of the i-th pixel if the
    i-th pixel was SCMA. \\({SCMA}_i^{2015}\\) and \\({SCMA}_i^{1990}\\) are binary
    variables to indicate whether the i-th pixel was part of SCMA in 2015 and 1990,
    with a value of 1 for SCMA and 0 for non-SCMA. Results The number, area, and spatial
    pattern of SCMAs in Xilingol Changes in the number and area of SCMAs The number
    and spatial extent of SCMAs in Xilingol increased rapidly from 1990 to 2015, especially
    in the eastern part of the region (Fig. 2a). The total area of SCMAs increased
    from 3.21 km2 in 1990 to 283.62 km2 in 2015 (Fig. 2b), while the number of SCMAs
    increased from 40 in 1990 to 504 in 2015 (Fig. 2c). Among all the counties, Xiwuzhumuqin
    had the fastest spatial expansion of SCMAs (Fig. 2d), with the total coal mining
    area increasing by 122.86 km2 from 1990 to 2015 (accounting for 43.82% of the
    total increase in Xilingol). Xilinhot City’s area of SCMAs increased by 78.88
    km2, accounting for 28.13% of the total areal increase of SCMAs in Xilingol. Dongwuzhumuqin,
    Sunitezuo and Abaga had an increase of 10 to 50 km2 in the area of SCMAs, accounting
    for 15.03%, 5.55%, and 4.45% of the total increase, respectively. For the other
    seven counties, the area of SCMAs increased less than 10 km2 each, totaling 8.21
    km2 and together accounting for 2.93% of the total increase in SCMAs across Xilingol
    (Fig. 2d). Changes in the number of SCMAs by county over time followed a similar
    pattern (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2 Changes in the number and size of SCMAs in Xilingol

    total coal mining area in 2015 for the corresponding years; (b) Changes in the

    the area of SCMAs by county; (e) Changes in the number of SCMAs by county Full
    size image By 2015, both the total number and area of coal mining sites in Xilingol
    soared to an unprecedented level: totaling 504 SCMAs in number and 283.68 km2
    in size (Fig. S2a). SCMAs scattered throughout the entire region, but with a substantially
    higher density in the northeast (Fig. S2a-c). Of all the constituent counties,
    Xiwuzhumuqin, Xilinhot City, and Dongwuzhumuqin had the largest numbers and areas
    of SCMAs. Specifically, the total area of SCMAs was 123.33 km2 in Xiwuzhumuqin,
    79.64 km2 in Xilinhot City, and 50 to 10 km2 in Dongwuzhumuqin, Sunitezuo, and
    Abaga (Fig. S2b). The area of SCMAs for the other seven counties was much smaller,
    totaling 10.15 km2 altogether. Similar to what was observed with the area of SCMAs,
    Xiwuzhumuqin had the largest number of SCMAs (153), followed by Xilinhot City
    (94). Dongwuzhumuqin, Sunitezuo, Suniteyou, and Abaga each had similar numbers
    of SCMAs, ranging from 49 to 56 (Fig. S2c). Changes in spatial pattern of SCMAs
    The size, density, shape, and connectivity of SCMAs in Xilingol changed dramatically
    from 1990 to 2015 (Fig. 3; Table S3). At the level of the Xilingol region, as
    the total area of SCMAs (PLAND) increased over the years, Patch Density (PD),
    Edge Density (ED), Mean Patch Size (MPS), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Landscape
    Shape Index (LSI), Area-Weighted Mean Fractal Dimension (AWMFD), and Aggregation
    Index (AI) all increased rapidly, while Mean Euclidean Nearest Neighbor Distance
    (NND) declined precipitously (Fig. 3). Specifically, from 1990 to 2015, PD of
    SCMAs increased by14.5 times, ED by 36.52 times, PLAND by 176.46 times, MPS by
    8.88 times, LPI by 63.17 times, LSI by 1.92 times, AWMFD by 0.02 times, and AI
    by 0.08 times, and NND decreased by 0.82 times. Except for NND and AWMFD, all
    other landscape metrics showed monotonic changes, exhibiting a major acceleration
    after 2000. Fig. 3 Changes in spatial pattern of SCMAs in Xilingol from 1990 to
    2015. (a) Patch Density (PD); (b) Edge Density (ED); (c) Percentage of Landscape
    (PLAND); (d) Mean Patch Size (MPS); (e) Largest Patch Index (LPI); (f) Landscape
    Shape Index (LSI); (g) Mean Euclidean Nearest Neighbor Distance (NND); (h) Area-Weighted
    Mean Fractal Dimension (AWMFD); (i) Aggregation Index (AI) Full size image At
    the county (or banner) level, the temporal trend of changes in spatial pattern
    of SCMAs was generally similar for each landscape metric and each county, but
    the between-county differences for each metric showed contrasting patterns over
    time (Fig. 4; Table S3). For PD, ED, PLAND, MPS, and LPI, Xiwuzhumuqin and Xilinhot
    City showed a quite similar exponential increase with a taking-off point around
    2000, whereas Dongwuzhumuqin, Sunitezuo, and Abaga resembled each other with a
    much slower increase rate than that of Xiwuzhumuqin and Xilinhot, especially after
    2000-2005 (Fig. 4a-e). Consequently, the differences in these landscape metrics
    between the two groups became substantially large by 2015. In contrast, the differences
    in NND and AI among counties became increasingly smaller, especially after 2000
    (Fig. 4g,i). For AI, again Xiwuzhumuqin and Xilinhot City showed a similar pattern
    (Fig. 4i), while Dongwuzhumuqin, Sunitezuo, and Abaga behaved similarly. But for
    NND, separating the two groups did not seem possible (Fig. 4g). Fig. 4 Changes

    impacts of surface coal mining in Xilingol Impact of surface coal mining on water
    resources We estimated, using Equation 1, that the total water consumption (both
    surface water and groundwater) by surface coal mining (including extraction and
    washing) in Xilingol increased from 2.35 million m3 in 1990 to 242.61 million
    m3 in 2015, an increase of more than 100 times (Fig. 5a). This was a direct consequence
    of the exponential increase in coal production from 0.81 million tons in 1990
    to 83.66 million tons in 2015 (IMARSB 1991, 2016). The total amount of water consumption
    grew relative slowly before 2000, but increased dramatically after 2005. Water
    consumed by coal mining as a percentage of the total available water resources
    increased from 0.17% or less before 2000 to 10.21% in 2015. Fig. 5 The water consumption
    of surface coal mining in Xilingol. (a) The amount of water used for coal production;
    (b) Groundwater contaminated by surface coal mining Full size image Surface coal
    mining not only consumed a huge amount of water, but also polluted an equally
    large amount of groundwater. We estimated that the amount of groundwater potentially
    polluted by coal mining in Xilingol increased from 0.02 billion m3 in 1990 to
    212.50 million m3 in 2015 (Fig. 5b). The polluted groundwater by coal mining accounted
    for 0.10% of the total available water resources in the region in 2000, and this
    number increased to 8.04% by 2015. Most of the SCMAs were located in the vicinity
    of the six major rivers (Fig. 6a). The area of the SCMAs within a 2-km buffer
    zone of the six major rivers accounted for more than 80% of that of all rivers
    between 1990 and 2015 (Fig. 6b). In contrast, most other small rivers were far
    away from major SCMAs (Fig. 6a). Thus, here we focused on the impacts of surface
    coal mining on the six major rivers. Surface coal mining had devastating impacts
    on the six major rivers in Xilingol. We estimated that, during 1990-2015, the
    area of the SCMAs within a 2-km river buffer zone increased from 0.70 km2 in 1990
    to 37.12 km2 in 2015 (Fig. 6c,d; Table S4). Among the six main rivers in Xilingol,
    Yanjiga River had the most extensive coal mining-impacted area within the 2-km
    buffer zone, increasing from less than 0.95 km2 before 2005 to 16.98 km2 in 2015.
    In addition, the coal mining impacted area increased by 10.86 km2 for Seyeqinle
    River, 3.39 km2 for Xilin River, 2.79 km2 for Gaorihan River, 1.71 km2 for Wulagai
    River, and 0.11 km2 for Balagari River. It is evident from visual inspection of
    Fig. 6d that Xilin River, Balagari River, and Gaorihan River were surrounded by
    a rapidly increasing number of coal mining sites over the years, suggesting increasing
    risks of water and soil contamination expanding into great areas of the floodplains
    of these rivers (Fig. S3), if surface coal mining continues as it has in the past
    several decades. Fig. 6 Impact of surface coal mining on rivers in Xilingol from

    Full size image Impact of surface coal mining on terrestrial ecosystems From 1990
    to 2015, surface coal mining in Xilingol destroyed large areas of several natural
    and agricultural ecosystems (Fig. 7a). The majority of the destroyed land by surface
    coal mining was natural grassland, totaling 222.07 km2 (accounting for 78.64%
    of the total area of SCMAs), followed by wetlands with a loss of 25.13 km2 (or
    8.90% of the total area of SCMAs). Other types of ecosystems that were encroached
    by surface coal mining included desert (24.78 km2), forests (1.46 km2), and farmland
    (0.91 km2). In this dryland region, wetlands and forests are biodiversity hotspots,
    but their geographic distribution is quite limited. While the natural grasslands
    in Xilingol are spatially extensive, surface coal mining has resulted in conspicuous
    habit fragmentation across the landscape. Fig. 7 Proportions of different types
    of ecosystems wiped out by surface coal mining in Xilingol. (a) Area of each ecosystem
    destroyed as a percentage of the total area of SCMAs, and (b) NPP loss for each
    ecosystem type as a percentage of the total NPP lost to surface coal mining Full
    size image By destroying vegetation and fragmenting the landscape, surface coal
    mining also decreased the net primary productivity in Xilingol. We estimated that
    the total NPP loss caused by surface coal mining in Xilingol was 8.49×1010 gC
    from 1990 to 2015. Specifically, 84.43% of the total loss of NPP came from grasslands,
    totaling 7.17×1010 g C (Fig. 7b). The loss of NPP in wetlands, deserts, forests,
    and other ecosystems were 5.4×109 g C, 5.3×109 g C, 5×108 g C, and 1.8×109 g C,
    respectively (Fig. 7b). The NPP loss from farmland was the smallest (0.02×1010
    g C, accounting for 0.25% of the total loss of NPP). Discussion Spatiotemporal
    patterns of surface coal mining in Xilingol Our results showed that the number,
    size, and spatial pattern of SCMAs in Xilingol changed dramatically from 1990
    to 2015. The total number and spatial extent of SCMAs increased by 12.6 times
    and 88.4 times during 1990-2015, respectively, and soared exponentially after
    2000 (Fig. 2). The rapid expansion of SCMAs in Xilingol was much faster than that
    in Inner Mongolia as a whole during the same time period, with the increase rates
    of the total number and spatial extent of less than 3 times and 6 times (Ma et
    al. 2021). Most of the SCMAs were concentrated in the eastern part of the Xilingol
    region where some of the best-conserved typical steppe and meadow steppe are found.
    As the existing SCMAs continued to expand in size (Fig. 3c,d) and sometimes coalesced
    into clusters (Fig. 3i), new SCMAs kept popping up throughout the region. Surface
    coal mining (as well as its environmental impacts) in Xilingol accelerated greatly
    around 2000, a pattern also observed at the level of Inner Mongolia for coal production
    and economic growth indicators (Wu et al. 2015a; Ma et al. 2021). These changes
    led to a rapid increase in grassland fragmentation and landscape structural complexity,
    as indicated by increasing patch density, edge density, and shape complexity,
    as well as decreasing landscape connectivity (Figs. 5 and 6). These findings were
    also consistent with other studies at the local site level. For example, Shang
    and Wu (2022) found that patch density, edge density, largest patch index, and
    aggregation index of SCMAs all increased substantially in the Wulagai River Basin
    located in the northeast part of Xilingol, indicating the rapid expansion and
    aggregation of coal mining sites. Interestingly, these general patterns are quite
    similar to those of rapid urbanization repeatedly observed around the world (Jenerette
    and Wu 2001; Buyantuyev et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2016). This should
    probably not be surprising because both surface coal mining and urbanization are
    driven primarily by socioeconomic factors and because they may follow the similar
    general modes of growth – i.e., infilling, edge-expanding, and leapfrogging (Li
    et al. 2013). In order to concisely and adequately describe and monitor the spatiotemporal
    patterns of SCMAs in Xilingol, here we propose a three-landscape metric representation
    based on O''Neill et al. (1996) and Wu et al. (2011). Specifically, we suggest
    to use PLAND, AI, and LSI to construct a three-dimensional space in which the
    temporal trajectory of SCMAs is depicted (Fig. 8). On the one hand, this 3-metric
    representation clearly captures the key landscape changes of Xilingol driven by
    surface coal mining: SCMAs increasing in size, aggregation, and structural complexity
    over time at an accelerating rate. On the other hand, this 3-metric representation
    can be used as an indicator for monitoring landscape changes caused by coal mining
    or due to ecological restoration. Together with other landscape metrics used in
    this study, this 3-metric representation is likely to be useful for the study
    and sustainable management of surface coal mining in Xilingol and beyond. Fig.
    8 Trajectory of changing landscape pattern of SCMAs in Xilingol in terms of spatial
    extent, aggregation, and shape complexity Full size image Impacts of surface coal
    mining on water resources and natural ecosystems Surface coal mining had enormous
    impacts on water resources in Xilingol, through both consumption and pollution.
    Given that Xilingol is dominated by semiarid and arid climate, water is a scarce
    and critical resource for both natural ecosystems and human society. However,
    our results showed that the extensive coal mining consumed and contaminated large
    amounts of water during recent decades, including surface water and groundwater,
    accounting for a significant portion of the total available water in the region.
    In addition, all six major rivers – ecologically essential for maintaining the
    biodiversity, ecosystem function, and landscape integrity of the Xilingol Steppe
    – have been increasingly threatened by the encroachment of coal mining onto their
    riparian zones. Due to the lack of filed data, our estimated coal mining impacts
    of water resources should be considered as a first approximation with potentially
    large uncertainties. In a comprehensive study of coal mining impacts on groundwater
    and surface water in central and eastern Australia, Post et al. (2020) reported
    that impacts on groundwater could reach up to 5 km from coal mining sites and
    that impacts on surface water characteristics may extend for tens of hundreds
    of kilometers downstream. Thus, we consider our estimation of coal mining impacts
    on water resources in Xilingol to be rather conservative in terms of the spatial
    extent that is affected by coal mining activities. Our results corroborate the
    previous findings that, due to its huge water footprint, surface coal mining has
    exacerbated the problem of water shortage in the vast steppe region of the Mongolian
    Plateau (Tao et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2015a). Similar results of surface coal mining
    impacts on water resources were reported by previous studies in other places of
    Inner Mongolia. For example, surface coal mining was identified as the main cause
    for decreasing groundwater levels in Ordos (Zheng et al. 2015), disrupting seasonal
    flows of the Kuye River Basin (Wang et al. 2008). Surface coal mining has also
    shaped the landscape pattern and devastated ecosystem function and services in
    the region. As our results show, SCMAs have encroached onto several types of natural
    ecosystems in Xilingol, in the forms of excavating vegetation in the mining and
    stripping areas and burying vegetation in waste disposal areas. Consequently,
    the legendary landscape of Xilingol with endless grasslands has become an increasingly
    fragmented landscape with numerous brown scars. Compared with other studies that
    found surface coal mining destroyed or disturbed large areas of natural grasslands
    and croplands in Ordos (Zeng et al. 2018) or in Inner Mongolia as a whole (Ma
    et al. 2021), this study indicates that native steppe vegetation and wetlands
    suffered the greatest loss to surface coal mining in Xilingol (Fig. 7a). According
    to the third territorial survey of Xilingol, grasslands and wetlands accounted
    for about 86% and 4% of the total land area, representing the two most critically
    important ecosystems in this region because of the extensiveness of the former
    and the biodiversity hotspots status of the latter. Both grasslands and wetlands
    play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, providing ecosystem services,
    and maintaining biodiversity in this semiarid region. Also of particular concern
    is that all major rivers in the region may have been contaminated. Water is the
    most critical but scarce resource in this region, and deserves the highest priority
    for conservation and protection. Rivers in Xilingol represent an indispensable
    source of water not only for natural vegetation but also for animal husbandry
    as well as herders’ livelihoods (Li et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2015a). In addition,
    NPP is a synoptic indicator of ecosystem capacity for ecological functioning and
    services, and the substantial decrease in NPP in Xilingol due to surface coal
    mining implies the loss of biodiversity, biomass production, and capacities for
    soil conservation and carbon sequestration. We note that, although the relationship
    between NPP and NDVI for arid and semiarid ecosystems is well-established (e.g.,
    Paruelo et al. 1997; Buyantuyev and Wu 2009), our estimated NPP was a first approximation
    based on a simple linear regression between NPP and NDVI in arid and semiarid
    regions. We also tried nonlinear regressions which had a higher R2 (0.784 for
    logarithmic regression and 0.678 for exponential regression; see Table S5), indicating
    the existence of nonlinearity. Also, spatial correlation could lead to biased
    regression parameters. Future research is needed to improve the accuracy of NPP
    loss due to surface coal mining, although our general conclusions here would unlikely
    change appreciably. On a broader scale, Ma et al. (2021) reported that during
    recent decades surface coal mining has occurred across much of the Mongolian Plateau,
    including both Inner Mongolia and Mongolia, and resulted in myriad environmental
    and social consequences. The magnitude of surface coal mining and its environmental
    impacts in Inner Mongolia far exceeded those in Mongolia (Ma et al. 2021). With
    a more focused and in-depth analysis, this study confirms that Xilingol is certainly
    one of the hardest-hit areas within Inner Mongolia. Implications for land management
    and policy Quantifying the speed and scale of surface coal mining is necessary
    for adequately evaluating its environmental and socioeconomic impacts and designing
    more sustainable development strategies. This is especially important for places
    like the Xilingol Steppe where coal reserves and thus mining-oriented development
    pressures both are enormous. Based on existing data, we estimate that, with today’s
    extraction rate, it would take more than 1000 years to exhaust the currently known
    coal reserves of 260 billion tons in Xilingol. However, our findings suggest that,
    although short-term economic benefits are attainable, surface coal mining in Xilingol
    is not possibly sustainable in the long run because of its negative environmental
    impacts (as well as socioeconomic and cultural impacts which were not studied
    here). The increasing urgency for mitigating climate change and mounting evidence
    of coal’s myriad devastating environmental and health impacts call for coal to
    be phased out in the near future (Hendryx 2015; Jakob et al. 2020). Thus, the
    Xilingol region cannot continue to rely on coal mining for its economic growth.
    Instead, surface coal mining must be curbed before being completely phased out,
    the industrial structure needs to be reformed, and water resources and natural
    ecosystems must be conserved to promote regional sustainability (Wu et al. 2015a;
    Shang et al. 2019). This also is necessary for China to achieve its carbon-peak
    and carbon-neutral goals and keep its promises made to the world and for the common
    good (Normile 2020). To achieve these goals, more stringent governmental policies
    and regulations, guided by the principles of environmental sustainability and
    social equity, justice, and inclusion, must be established and implemented. It
    is imperative to strengthen environmental governance in mining areas, adopt clean
    production processes, implement water-saving measures, improve water resource
    use efficiency, and minimize environmental impacts. Renewable energy sources such
    as solar, wind, and biomass energy ought to be prioritized in mid- and long-term
    governmental development plans. Also, establishing ecological compensation mechanisms
    and reducing income disparities are essential to social equity and stability in
    the region. Our study also suggests that some immediate actions are needed to
    stop the disorderly rampage of surface coal mining in the Xilingol Steppe. All
    illegal mining activities must be completely eliminated without exception. All
    coal mining operations must be required and re-evaluated for land rehabilitation
    and ecological restoration, which should be guided and evaluated by scientists.
    Protecting rivers and groundwater from contamination is an urgent priority because
    it is not only critical to the native biodiversity and ecosystems, but also vital
    to the health of local populations. Wetlands and natural steppes with high levels
    of biodiversity and ecosystem services also should be protected from coal mining
    from now on no matter how much economic potential there is. Limitations and future
    directions Our study has several limitations. First, potentially substantive uncertainties
    exist in the estimated amounts of surface water and groundwater consumed and contaminated
    and rivers impacted by coal mining primarily because of the scarcity and quality
    of data. Second, this study did not consider some important ecological impacts
    of coal mining, such as biodiversity loss. But coal mining can lead to biodiversity
    loss through directly destroying habitat, polluting water, soil, and air, and
    degrading the land in other ways. For example, Giam et al. (2018) showed that
    surface coal mining in the US negatively affected stream biodiversity, reducing
    invertebrate richness by 32%, fish richness by 39%, and salamander richness by
    28%. Xiang et al. (2021) reported that surface coal mining in China led to declines
    in grain production of 1.5×105 tons and water retention of 6.42×108 tons between
    2000 and 2015. Third, this study did not explicitly consider the economic and
    sociocultural impacts of coal mining, but these are critically important to the
    sustainability of the region (e.g., Liu et al. 2014b). Thus, future studies need
    to focus on improving data quality and conducting more in-depth analyses, so as
    to elevate the precision and accuracy of surface coal mining studies in Xilingol
    to the next level. Extensive and detailed investigations are needed to document
    and monitor the environmental, social, and cultural impacts of coal mining in
    the Xilingol region. The mining operations and land rehabilitation projects need
    to be systematically and periodically evaluated. On the other hand, integrating
    environmental, economic, and social dimensions in such studies is necessary to
    produce policy-relevant scientific findings. Towards this end, a landscape sustainability
    science approach seems essential as it integrates landscape pattern, biodiversity,
    ecosystem function, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing with explicit consideration
    of environmental and sociopolitical drivers (Wu 2013, 2021; Zhang et al. 2020;
    Gilman and Wu 2023). Conclusions In this study, we quantified the number, area,
    and spatial pattern of surface coal mining sites in the Xilingol Steppe, representing
    the most widely distributed grassland type on the Mongolian Plateau – the typical
    steppe or dry steppe. From 1990 to 2015, both the total number and area of SCMAs
    increased dramatically by nearly 12 times and 88 times, with a major acceleration
    around 2000. As SCMAs proliferated, the Xilingol Steppe landscape became increasingly
    fragmented ecologically and complex structurally. In 2015, 242.61 million m3 of
    surface water and groundwater were consumed and contaminated by surface coal mining,
    and all major rivers in the region were negatively influenced. In addition, large
    areas of grasslands and wetlands were eradicated, accounting for 78.64% and 8.90%
    of the total area of SCMAs, which substantially undermined the region’s capacities
    for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Our findings indicate that surface coal
    mining in Xilingol is not sustainable, and it must be curbed now and completely
    phased out in the future. Data Availability Data available on request from the

  description: Jatiluhur dam, located in West Java province, is one of the most extensive
    reservoirs in Indonesia and is used to secure the water supply for 240,000 ha
    of rice fields to prevent agricultural drought in the downstream Citarum watershed.
    During the last two decades, several areas in the downstream Citarum watershed
    have been experiencing agricultural drought following meteorological drought events.
    This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural drought
    and their correlation with meteorological drought occurrence by utilizing a remote
    sensing image processing technique. The Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI)
    and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) derived from MODIS and CHIRPS data
    were used to estimate agricultural and meteorological drought events, respectively.
    The results showed that the magnitude of agricultural drought in the downstream
    Citarum watershed was varied and related to earlier meteorological drought. The
    agricultural drought mainly occurred after a meteorological event with the magnitude
    mostly related to the magnitude of the ONI and DMI. A strong El Nino and positive
    IOD will cause a higher magnitude of agricultural drought. The time lag between
    the two drought occurrences was found to be related to the distance of the paddy
    fields from the main irrigation network and the proximity of the main irrigation
    network to the Jatiluhur Dam spillway.

    • The duration and magnitude of meteorological drought relate to the extent of
    agricultural drought. • Easier or closer the production field to access of irrigation,
    it means the longer time lag between both droughts. • Distribution of agricultural
    drought depends on the path distance of production fields, major irrigation, and
    reservoir. Abstract Jatiluhur dam, located in West Java province, is one of the
    most extensive reservoirs in Indonesia and is used to secure the water supply
    for 240,000 ha of rice fields to prevent agricultural drought in the downstream
    Citarum watershed. During the last two decades, several areas in the downstream
    Citarum watershed have been experiencing agricultural drought following meteorological
    drought events. This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural
    drought and their correlation with meteorological drought occurrence by utilizing
    a remote sensing image processing technique. The Normalized Difference Drought
    Index (NDDI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) derived from MODIS and
    CHIRPS data were used to estimate agricultural and meteorological drought events,
    respectively. The results showed that the magnitude of agricultural drought in
    the downstream Citarum watershed was varied and related to earlier meteorological
    drought. The agricultural drought mainly occurred after a meteorological event
    with the magnitude mostly related to the magnitude of the ONI and DMI. A strong
    El Nino and positive IOD will cause a higher magnitude of agricultural drought.
    The time lag between the two drought occurrences was found to be related to the

    of the main irrigation network to the Jatiluhur Dam spillway. Previous article

    precipitation indexTime lag 1. Introduction Water is the main factor in maintaining
    rice production continuity in major paddy fields around the world, with the availability
    depending on rainfall and irrigation network (Chauhan et al., 2017). Generally,
    an irrigation network provides water supply more continuously because the water
    source comes from a reservoir or perennial river stream. In contrast, water supply
    from rainfall is usually seasonally dependent. Therefore, it is relatively clear
    that the rain feed paddy field area is sensitive to become drought agriculturally
    due to meteorological drought occurrence (Erythrina et al., 2021; Hossain and
    Fischer, 1995; Hossain et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2018; Zeigler and Puckridge,
    1995) whereas for the irrigated paddy field area is assumed less sensitive. However,
    studies by Arifah et al. (2022) and Cho et al. (2021) show that the irrigated
    paddy field area may also become drought agriculturally due to meteorological
    drought related to climate change. This kind of study is still limited and needs
    to be improved for the country that consumes rice as the staple food, such as
    Indonesia, to strengthen food security. An example of an irrigated paddy field
    area in Indonesia that was suspected of having experienced agricultural drought
    occurrence is the downstream Citarum watershed in Java, as shown in Fig. 1. The
    area is served by one of the most extensive reservoirs in Indonesia, the Jatiluhur
    dam, which is expected to maintain the continuity of water supply for the agricultural
    field (DHV et al., 2010), decrease the flood risk and drought in the downstream
    area, as well as also to provide electricity (Ministry Of Public Work Republic
    Of Indonesia, W. R. D., & Deltares, 2010). Water from the reservoir is utilized
    by more than 240,000 ha of paddy fields (Hatmoko et al., 2020), which contribute
    to 17 % of Indonesia''s annual rice production (Firmansyah et al., 2016). Even
    though the reservoir capacity, together with the irrigation network, can be sufficiently
    used to fulfill the water demand of the downstream paddy field area for continuous
    production, some locations do not receive enough water supply, particularly during
    the dry season, thereby leading to the occurrence of agricultural drought (Hatmoko
    and Mulyantari, 2014). The dry season in the area usually occurs from March to
    September, following the monsoonal pattern (Aldrian and Dwi Susanto, 2003a), with
    the driest months found in July, August, and September (Purnama, 2008). This dry
    period may be extended into November due to El Nino and positive IOD (Aldrian,
    2002a). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    satellite image (A), and drainage pattern and administrative regions (B). Agricultural
    drought can be described as a condition of insufficient soil water content in
    the root zone where the percentage is lower than the minimum requirement for a
    plant to grow (Liu et al., 2016a; Rickard, 1960). Generally, agricultural drought
    occurs after the sequence of meteorological and hydrological drought events (Liu
    et al., 2016b). A meteorological drought can be described as a temporary condition
    in which the amount of rainfall in a specific period is decreased compared to
    the average (Wilhite, 1993). The degree of the meteorological drought is determined
    according to the ratio between the amount of precipitation and the quantity considered
    normal for that period (Siswanto et al., 2022). This event usually leads to the
    occurrence of hydrological drought, a condition associated with the decrease in
    surface and groundwater supply, indicated by the significant lowering of the river''s
    water level in the reservoir, lake, and groundwater table (Dai, 2011). According
    to preliminary studies, Java Island was hit by meteorological and hydrological
    drought (D''Arrigo et al., 2011; Sahu et al., 2012, 2017), which likely disturbed
    the Jatiluhur dam operation (Hatmoko and Mulyantari, 2014). Agricultural drought
    occurs in most areas of Java Island, including paddy fields (Daruati et al., 2013;
    Erasmi et al., 2009). However, it also occurred in the irrigated paddy fields
    in the study area, as indicated by the significant decrease in rice production
    during the drought period for the last two decades (Hatmoko and Mulyantari, 2014).
    The lost of rice production due to drought events in West Java is reported can
    reach up to 40% (Surmaini et al., 2015). However, the spatiotemporal distribution
    and pattern are still unknown because a detailed report cannot be found from a
    public source. Therefore, this study aims to describe and analyze the spatiotemporal
    patterns of the agricultural drought event in the paddy field located in the downstream
    Citarum watershed. Therefore, a remote sensing approach was used with a dataset
    of the last two decades, considering the limitation of ground-measured data. To
    achieve the aim of this study, the agricultural drought occurrence was approached
    using the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) due to its best accuracy
    (Dobri et al., 2021; Gouveia et al., 2012; Rahmi and Dimyati, 2021; Rhee et al.,
    2010). Furthermore, a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset
    was used to monitor the agricultural drought. NDDI and MODIS were used due to
    their temporal resolution sufficiency for paddy field monitoring, the high temporal
    resolution, and continuity in the observation in the last two decades (Kurnia
    Jayanti et al., 2012). The calculated Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) method
    was derived from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS)
    data (Paredes Trejo et al., 2016). This tool was used to determine the meteorological
    drought event and the best validation result against the ground observation data
    (Shen et al., 2020), respectively. In addition, this study also investigated how
    the existence of the dam irrigation network can shape the spatiotemporal pattern
    of the agriculture drought. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Datasets and pre-processing
    This study used the MODIS dataset acquired between January 2001 and December 2020
    to describe the agricultural drought events. Furthermore, it used the CHIRPS dataset
    acquired between January 1981 and December 2020 to describe the meteorological
    drought events. The MODIS dataset consists of reflectance Band 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared),
    and 7 (mid-infrared) captured from the collection of the Terra-Aqua vegetation
    index 16-day composite 250 m product (MOD/MYD13Q1) v.006 (Saleska et al., 2007)
    together with the related VI quality band. The MODIS dataset was downloaded from
    the NASA''s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Centre (LP DAAC) server.
    It was then processed for geometrical reprojection and subset to adjust the study
    area boundary using MODIStsp (Busetto and Ranghetti, 2016). The CHIRPS dataset
    used in this study was a v.2 global monthly precipitation dataset at a spatial
    resolution of 0.050 × 0.050°, obtained from https://data.chc.ucsb.edu/products/CHIRPS-2.0/global_monthly/.
    The CHIRPS dataset was also used as a subset to adjust the boundary of the study
    area. In addition, a dataset of the irrigation network acquired from the Geospatial
    Information Agency (BIG) of the Republic of Indonesia, a Google map, and field
    observation were also used to analyze the relationship between agricultural drought
    occurrence and the Jatiluhur dam service coverage. This study also used a paddy
    field map from the Ministry of Agriculture of The Republic of Indonesia to assess
    the agricultural drought on a particular land cover type. All datasets used in
    this study were observed visually against the reference of the local topographic
    map to determine the geometric consistency and processed geometric correction.
    The temporal variation of the precipitation in the study area is influenced mainly
    by the monsoonal pattern (Aldrian and Dwi Susanto, 2003b). However, the sea surface
    temperature anomaly in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean may also contribute significantly
    (Aldrian, 2002b). The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) from the National Weather Service
    Climate Prediction Centre (https://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/) and Dipole Mode
    Index (DMI) from the Global Climate Observing System (https://psl.noaa.gov/) were
    used to analyze the relationship between meteorological and agricultural drought
    in the study area and the occurrence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
    and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), respectively. 2.2. Drought assessment methods
    Drought assessment in this study was carried out in four steps (see Fig. 2). The
    first step was to describe the meteorological drought occurrence using the SPI
    method (McKee et al., 1993) based on the CHIRPS dataset. The SPI was calculated
    using the principle of measuring any possibility of precipitation anomalies at
    a particular time, which was identified based on a long-term historical precipitation
    record. The time can be set for some duration, such as 1 (SPI-1), 3 (SPI-3), 12
    (SPI-12), or 24 (SPI-24) months, which describes the water supply from precipitation
    at those particular periods compared to the historical precipitation data. Deepa
    B. Kamble et al. (2019) stated that the response of paddy plant conditions may
    be affected by a short-term (1 month) meteorological drought, hence the use of
    SPI-1 in this study. This tool helps describe the rules of the irrigation system
    in the study area when meteorological drought is detected. Precipitation data
    is usually not distributed normally but transformed to fit the gamma function.
    The SPI-1 data used was provided based on the study by Siswanto et al. (2022)
    by using the open-source module of Climate and Drought Indices in Python (https://climate-indices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    (Adams, 2017) with the principle of the following equation (Song et al., 2020):
    (1) where X is the monthly precipitation series of n years, t represents the yearly
    index, m is the specific month and s denotes a certain time scale. The prediction
    of meteorological drought based on SPI is determined using Eq. (1) (Svoboda et
    al., 2012). Download : Download high-res image (509KB) Download : Download full-size

    step was to model the agricultural drought occurrence using the NDDI method (Gu
    et al., 2008) by employing the MODIS dataset and MODIStsp (Busetto and Ranghetti,
    2016). According to preliminary studies, NDDI is an appropriate remote sensing
    image transformation method used for agricultural drought assessment occurrence.
    It examines the process by detecting the greenness and water content on the surface
    of the green vegetation canopy (Gu et al., 2008; Gulácsi and Kovács, 2018), including
    paddy plants (Du et al., 2018). The vegetation canopy''s greenness degree and
    water content are detected using band ratios of the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), respectively. The NDDI
    value for each MODIS pixel, was determined using Eq. (2). (2) where the NDVI and
    NDWI were generated from the MODIS datasets as stated in Eqs. (3), (4)). (3) (4)
    The resulting NDDI computation was then composed into monthly data to match the
    SPI-1 timestep. Furthermore, the dry condition capable of triggering water stress
    for vegetation or agricultural drought occurrence was indicated by the NDDI value
    above 0.5 (Khampeera et al., 2017). The third step is to define the temporal pattern
    of agricultural drought occurrence using results from the first and second steps.
    Three considerations were taken into account when defining agricultural drought
    in this study. First is the meteorological drought occurrence (indicated by using
    SPI-1) together with the ONI and IOD. This consideration was due to the sequence
    of meteorological and agricultural droughts (Liu et al., 2016). Any drought conditions
    detected by the NDDI value without being triggered by meteorological effects in
    advance might indicate a false agricultural drought requiring further analysis.
    Second, the local agricultural office''s information (Ramadhani et al., 2021)
    shows that the harvesting and preparation activities for the new planting season
    may take up to 60 days (approximately two months). The land surface has an NDDI
    value above 0.5 (dry) in this condition. Therefore, an agricultural drought was
    defined when dry conditions based on the NDDI value were found for at least three
    consecutive months. Third, the Quality Assurance (QA) bands of MODIS VI data were
    considered (Didan, 2015) and used to define the confidence of the resulting NDDI
    value. For the sake of simplicity, this study only considered the mixed cloud,
    adjacent cloud, and shadow pixel bands. A lower percentage of the QA pixels indicates
    higher confidence in the NDDI value and vice versa. Furthermore, the temporal
    pattern of agricultural drought occurrence was defined using a graphical boxplot
    of the study area''s monthly SPI-1 and NDDI values and the related QA pixels,
    ONI, and IOD values. The fourth step was to describe the spatial pattern of the
    agricultural drought historical event in the paddy field of the study area based
    on the results from the third step using a series of maps and charts. Furthermore,
    overlay analysis was used to describe the relationship through the time lag between
    the occurrence of agricultural and preceded meteorological drought. It was also
    carried out between the agricultural drought map, with its time lag used to determine
    the related preceding meteorological drought maps and the existing irrigation
    network map. Therefore, this study aims to understand how the irrigation network
    influences the agricultural drought spatiotemporal pattern. The irrigation network
    focused on the path distance from the Jatiluhur dam spillway and the position
    of the sluice gate to the paddy field. Due to data limitations, this study did
    not consider the historical water inflow to and outflow from the dam. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Temporal assessment of meteorological and agricultural droughts
    Both types of droughts can occur mostly between June and November following the
    monsoonal dry season. The meteorological drought found during the study period
    can be distinguished into two groups: (a) the first group is indicated by an SPI-1
    value below −1 and occurred for three or more consecutive months in 2003, 2006,
    2015, and 2019, as shown in Fig. 3A; (b) the second group was also indicated by
    an SPI-1 value below −1 but occurred in shorter periods for the rest of the years,
    except in 2004, 2017, and 2020 which showed almost no drought occurrences. The
    first group of meteorological drought occurrences related to the ONI and DMI (Fig.
    3B), where El Nino occurred together with positive IOD. This condition indicates
    a higher magnitude of drought with a further decrease in rainfall amount and intensity
    than normal conditions (D''Arrigo and Smerdon, 2008; Siswanto et al., 2022). Meanwhile,
    the second group of meteorological drought occurrences is closer to the normal
    condition of dry seasons in the study area, which follows the monsoonal pattern
    with the lowest rainfall amounts found from August to October. Some events of
    the second group were affected by a lower magnitude of El Nino together with positive
    IOD, such as those found in 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2018. Download : Download

    meteorological (B) and agricultural (C) drought events are indicated with a violet.
    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the Web version of this article.) Following the meteorological
    drought occurrences, some agricultural drought events were detected by the NDDI
    values above 0.5, as shown in Fig. 3C. One was found after the first group of
    meteorological droughts in 2003, 2006, 2015, and 2019, which mainly occurred with
    a duration of 3–6 consecutive months, commonly between June and November. Furthermore,
    agricultural drought was also found to be associated with the second group of
    meteorological drought occurrences in a shorter period of up to 3 consecutive
    months, commonly between July and September. Some agricultural droughts were also
    detected without the preceding occurrence of meteorological drought (2004 and
    2020) which most probably it is related to the quality of MODIS VI (Fig. 3D).
    The QA bands of MODIS VI data gave an overview of how confident the NDDI value
    derived from MODIS VI data can predict agricultural drought occurrence. The inclusion
    of low-quality MODIS VI data in this study may produce inaccurate information
    (Teodoro et al., 2015). The QA bands summary by means of the annual percentage
    of the coverage of adjacent cloud, mixed cloud, and shadow between 2001 and 2020
    are 21%–34%, 17%–32%, and 11%–19%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3D. The agricultural
    drought occurrence detected in 2003, 2006, 2015, and 2019 seems quite confident,
    with the QA bands coverage close to the minimum percentage, as shown in Fig. 3C
    and D. This condition is also found in other agricultural drought occurrences;
    only the ones in 2002 seem to have higher adjacent cloud coverage, and in 2010,
    2013, 2016, and 2020 to have all three QA bands with a higher annual percentage.
    Regarding the NDDI value distribution in Fig. 3C, the box plot indicates that
    agricultural drought is found to occur every month in a relatively small part
    of the study area for more than 4 months. The relation between the meteorological
    and agricultural drought occurrences in the study area was further analyzed and
    indicated using a graphical scatterplot between the average SPI and NDDI and considering
    Pearson''s correlation coefficient (R) value (see Fig. 4). Both the scatterplot
    and R-value showed that the magnitude of agricultural drought occurrence in the
    study area is strongly related to the degree of meteorological occurrence. The
    detection of agricultural drought in the area was also confirmed with the rice
    production (see Fig. 5). A strong relation of agricultural drought detection using
    NDDI with the decrease of rice production can be seen in 2003 and 2019. A less
    strong signal can be seen in 2006 and 2015, while a weak signal can be seen in
    other year with agricultural drought detected. A less strong signal in 2006 and
    2015 compared to 2003 and 2019 most probably due to different situation of the
    pest strike that common occurred in the dry season (Effendi et al., 2020). In
    addition, drought anticipation from the farmer sides seems better in 2006 and
    2015 by utilized the groundwater source (Setiobudi and Sembiring, 2009). However,
    a comprehensive study of rice production fluctuation seems need a deeper study
    since many factors can be contributed besides drought itself. Download : Download

    results of this study in the context of the temporal pattern showed that agricultural
    drought in the study area mostly occurred after the occurrence of meteorological
    drought. However, the magnitude and duration of the agricultural drought are followed
    by the magnitude and duration of the preceding meteorological drought, which is
    closely related to ENSO and IOD occurrence. The next section describes This finding
    further in spatiotemporal patterns using a series of maps and graphs. 3.2. Spatiotemporal
    assessment of meteorological and agricultural drought The spatiotemporal pattern
    of the agricultural drought occurrences in the study area is shown in Fig. 6.
    In addition, the average duration and the related frequency distribution are illustrated
    in Fig. 7. The agricultural drought that occurred after the first group meteorological
    drought (2003, 2006, 2015, and 2019) mostly covered more than 20% of the study
    area, except in 2003. Fig. 6A shows the occurrence scale of 2006, 2015, and 2019,
    which is comparable with the preceding meteorological drought with SPI-1 indicates
    3 to 6 consecutive dry months, as shown in Fig. 3A. Despite most of the area being
    served by an irrigation system, some are not affordable due to limited access
    to the irrigation network and, hence, still managed as rainfed paddy fields (Mulyono
    and Fanany, 2016). In addition, the first group of meteorological droughts associated
    with El Nino and positive IOD significantly lowered the Jatiluhur dam water stock
    and was followed by a decrease in the irrigation water supply (Boer et al., 2012a;
    D''Arrigo et al., 2011). Meanwhile, the agricultural drought coverage in 2003
    covered far less area than in 2006, 2015, and 2019 because the preceding meteorological
    drought occurred on a smaller magnitude. Download : Download high-res image (692KB)

    Considering other agricultural drought events that occurred after the occurrence
    of the second group of meteorological drought events mostly covered smaller areas
    than ones after the first group (Fig. 6A). However, events of 2008 and 2018 have
    more extensive coverage than those in 2003. This fact is comparable with the magnitude
    of the preceding meteorological drought, as shown in Fig. 3A. This finding is
    confirmed by the previous result studies of Aldrian, 2002a, Aldrian, 2002b, D''Arrigo
    et al. (2006), and D''Arrigo and Smerdon (2008). However, a relatively high coverage
    in 2004 and 2020 is associated with a high percentage of low-quality MODIS VI
    pixels, as shown in Fig. 3D. Therefore, further study needs to be conducted. Considering
    the box plot in Fig. 3C, which indicates that agricultural drought is found to
    occur every month in a relatively small part of the study area and might occur
    for more than 4 months, the related spatial distribution is shown in Fig. 6, Fig.
    7. Most of the area is located in the southwest part of the study area, and the
    other small part is distributed randomly. Initially, the study area was assumed
    to be only covered by paddy fields based on a map from the Ministry of Agriculture
    of The Republic of Indonesia. However, further analysis using high-resolution
    satellite images from Google Earth and information acquired from a field campaign
    in July 2022 revealed that the areas with an NDDI value above 0,5 or experiencing
    agricultural drought for more than 4 months were mostly abandoned land or were
    rice fields that have been converted into built-up areas, such as in the southeast
    that mainly changed into settlements and industrial construction (Widiatmaka et
    al., 2013). Whereas the other randomly distributed suspected agricultural drought
    area was a built-up area constructed to support the new toll road construction
    (Fiqriyati et al., 2022), and some of them were also found as abandoned land.
    Since this situation Therefore, advanced study is required. The extent of agricultural
    drought events follows the magnitude of the preceding meteorological drought based
    on the assessment results. The agricultural drought in the rice field in the study
    area commonly lasts for 3–4 months, as indicated by the NDDI value. The NDDI duration
    for less than 3 months indicates the preparation stage for the new planting season,
    whereas, for those more than 4 months, it is indicated as a non-rice field area.
    The drought area is distributed randomly; however, since the area is served by
    an extensive irrigation system, it is important to see the drought pattern based
    on the existing irrigation network. Therefore, the next section examines the time
    lag between the occurrences of meteorological and agricultural drought events,
    which may indicate the importance of the irrigation system in maintaining the
    continuity of rice production in the area. 3.3. The time lag between agricultural
    and meteorological drought Based on the assessment result, agricultural drought
    in the downstream Citarum watershed area usually occurs after a meteorological
    drought. Therefore, defining the time lag between those two events is important
    for the future anticipation of an irrigated paddy field. The mean time lag between
    meteorological and agricultural drought occurrence distribution in the downstream
    Citarum Watershed from 2001 to 2020 is shown in Fig. 8. The shortest time lag
    between meteorological and agricultural drought (indicated with 0 months), is
    clustered in the southwest part of the area. Download : Download high-res image

    and agricultural drought occurrence distribution in the downstream Citarum Watershed
    during 2001–2020. However, it is no longer known as a paddy field but a built-up
    area due to the extensive land use conversion into commercial utilization and
    settlement in the last few decades (Firman, 1997; Gandharum et al., 2022). Some
    other areas with the same time lag, which are distributed randomly as a relatively
    set of pixels, also experienced the same condition at a smaller scale. Another
    time lag distribution related to the irrigation network and the possibility of
    the existence of rainfed paddy fields (Mulyono and Fanany, 2016), which are difficult
    to be differentiated in the scale of MODIS VI pixel size, are shown in Fig. 8.
    The closer the paddy fields are to the path distance of the water-flowed irrigation
    network, the slower it dries, as shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9. This is in line with
    the Boer''s study, stating that the path distance close to the spillway have a
    longer time lag (Boer et al., 2012b). Download : Download high-res image (626KB)

    network and the spillway of the Jatiluhur dam. The time lag between agricultural
    and meteorological drought that occurs in the downstream Citarum watershed area
    varies, mostly due to different access to the water-flowed irrigation network.
    The area close to the water-flowed irrigation network has a longer time lag than
    those further and without access. Furthermore, the path distance of the irrigation
    network from the dam spillway also plays a role, where the further it is, the
    shorter the time lag. The statistical Pearson''s correlation test supports this
    finding despite the statistical value is relatively low (R = −0.178) but still
    indicates the inverse relation. It is probably requiring a detail irrigation network
    map to obtain a more comprehensive relationship, but unfortunately cannot be obtained
    in this study due to data limitation. Therefore, further study is still needed
    to analyze another source of water-flowed irrigation network as the alternative
    to irrigation water, particularly in drought periods, as well as the effectiveness
    and affordability of the existing irrigation network in the area where the time
    lag is relatively short. 4. Conclusion Even though most of the paddy fields in
    the downstream Citarum Watershed are being served by an irrigation network, it
    still experiences agricultural drought in some areas. Therefore, this study assessed
    the agricultural drought occurrence in the area and its relationship with the
    predeceased meteorological drought events based on remote sensing data, namely
    MODIS VI and NDDI for agricultural drought assessment, as well as CHIRPS and SPI-1
    for meteorological drought assessment. The agricultural drought mainly occurred
    after a meteorological event where the magnitude was mostly related to the magnitude
    of the ONI and DMI. A strong El Nino and positive IOD will cause a higher magnitude
    of agricultural drought and vice versa. Some parts of the study area have agricultural
    drought duration for a longer period and are no longer used as paddy fields anymore.
    The distribution of the agricultural drought related to the magnitude and the
    time lag from the earlier meteorological drought depends on three factors. These
    include the path distance of the paddy field, the main irrigation network, and
    the path distance to the closest main irrigation network to the Jatiluhur dam
    spillway. Data availability The data that support the findings of this study were

  description: The rapid increase in population accelerates the rate of change of
    Land use/Land cover (LULC) in various parts of the world. This phenomenon caused
    a huge strain for natural resources. Hence, continues monitoring of LULC changes
    gained a significant importance for management of natural resources and assessing
    the climate change impacts. Recently, application of machine learning algorithms
    on RS (remote sensing) data for rapid and accurate mapping of LULC gained significant
    importance due to growing need of LULC estimation for ecosystem services, natural
    resource management and environmental management. Hence, it is crucial to access
    and compare the performance of different machine learning classifiers for accurate
    mapping of LULC. The primary objective of this study was to compare the performance
    of CART (Classification and Regression Tree), RF (Random Forest) and SVM (Support
    Vector Machine) for LULC estimation by processing RS data on Google Earth Engine
    (GEE). In total four classes of LULC (Water Bodies, Vegetation Cover, Urban Land
    and Barren Land) for city of Lahore were extracted using satellite images from
    Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 for years 2008, 2015 and 2022, respectively.
    According to results, RF is the best performing classifier with maximum overall
    accuracy of 95.2% and highest Kappa coefficient value of 0.87, SVM achieved maximum
    accuracy of 89.8% with highest Kappa of 0.84 and CART showed maximum overall accuracy
    of 89.7% with Kappa value of 0.79. Results from this study can give assistance
    for decision makers, planners and RS experts to choose a suitable machine learning
    algorithm for LULC classification in an unplanned urbanized city like Lahore.

    sensingLand use/land cover 1. Introduction Land use and land cover (LULC) maps
    are fundamental source of information for numerous studies related to earth system
    including biodiversity, climate change, public health and carbon cycling around
    the globe (Luo et al., 2022). LULC maps are extensively utilized as essential
    input for numerous models related to hydrology (Salem et al., 2023), carbon storage
    (Fernandes et al., 2020) and other numerical models. Additionally, LULC maps are
    the provider of vital information for the planning of urbanization expansion,
    ecosystem services management and natural resources management (Ammann et al.,
    2022, Gao and O’Neill, 2020, Rayner et al., 2021). Remote sensing technology is
    providing data for large scale land cover (LC) studies for decades. Remote sensing
    technology can give coverage on different levels (Region, Continent and Global),
    which make this technology a primary choice for researchers to study the LC variations
    on different scales (Wang et al., 2022). Likewise, fusion of multitemporal and
    multi-source remotely sensed data can improve the results for continues monitoring
    LC types and natural resources (Cavender-Bares et al., 2022). In contrast, processing
    of multitemporal and multi-source remotely sensed data for large scale exhibits
    challenges such as high complexity of computation, heavy storage and high-tech
    resources (Song et al., 2022). Conversely, freely available cloud-based platforms,
    such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), efficiently offers a solution for the computational
    and storage challenges to process the remotely sensed data. GEE is huge platform
    containing remotely sensed geospatial data from multiple sources, GEE offers a
    high-speed processing of planetary scale remote sensing data with a storage capacity
    to store the processed results online (Benhammou et al., 2022). Additionally,
    huge consolidated library of free satellite imagery provided by GEE have make
    the continues monitoring of LC changes very access able through acceptable temporal
    and spatial resolution (Tamiminia et al., 2020). GEE offers a web-based development
    environment which can perform parallel and rapid processing of analysis and visualization
    of large-scale geospatial data. In addition to remotely sensed data, useability
    of GEE has been broadly adopted in numerous analyses of big data related to LC,
    like river monitoring (Riggs et al., 2022), forest changes (Ram et al., 2021),
    monitoring of burned areas (Roteta et al., 2021), cropland land variations (You
    et al., 2021), urban areas mapping (Zafar et al., 2023a), mapping of flood areas
    (Tripathy and Malladi, 2022), land surface temperature (LST) (Al-Khakani and Al-janabi,
    2023, Yousif and Shneen, 2015) and mapping of other types of LC (Roteta et al.,
    2021, Shafi et al., 2023, Zafar et al., 2023b). Machine learning approaches are
    common choice of researchers for LULC classification and results utilizing remotely
    sensed data and machine learning algorithms like random forest (RF), support vector
    machine (SVM), and classification and regression trees (CART) exhibited exceptional
    accuracy in recent studies (Le et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022).
    RF is the one of the most extensively utilized machine learning algorithm (Kong
    and Yu, 2018), this algorithm can be used for regression purpose in addition to
    its classification ability (Saha et al., 2023). The dual ability of RF made it
    a primary choice for numerous applications in Earth sciences including land use
    modeling (Gounaridis et al., 2019), land cover modeling (Masiliūnas et al., 2021),
    and change in forest cover (Kumar and Sinha, 2020). Researchers from India applied
    RF in Kolleru lake area to map the land use, RF showed a kappa value of 0.94 and
    over all accuracy of 95.9% (Kolli et al., 2020), RF exhibited 91% accuracy with
    0.89 Kapa value for LULC mapping of Thanh Hoa province of Vietnam (Le et al.,
    2022). SVM is also from one of the mostly used machine learning algorithms, it
    is also utilized and tested for many regions around the globe. According to recent
    studies, SVM showed 90.8% of accuracy in mapping of paddy rice in China (Mansaray
    et al., 2020) and 93.8% of accuracy for Sentinel-2 for Munneru River Basin, India
    (Loukika et al., 2021). CART is a state of the art machine learning algorithm,
    CART exhibited overall 83% accuracy over Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for LULC
    mapping in Canada (Basheer et al., 2022) and for mapping of LULC of east coast
    of India CART showed the accuracy score of 84% (Priya et al., 2022). Classification
    of LULC using machine learning algorithms gained a significant importance as various
    environmental changes such as deforestation, expansion in agriculture area and
    urbanization can be monitored conveniently by these algorithms. Additionally,
    in context of increase in processing of remotely sensed data over GEE for reliable
    LULC maps of large areas, it is utmost need of time to test the performance and
    reliability of machine learning algorithms on GEE. The majority of the previous
    studies emphases applying single classifier for LULC classification, few studies
    focused comparing the classifiers but with conventional applications instead of
    using GEE. The primary focus of this study is (i) to accurately map the LULC of
    Lahore city of Pakistan, (ii) to use data from different sensors of Landsat satellite
    for LULC classification, (iii) to check the best performing machine learning algorithm
    from three most famous machine learning algorithms. Below is the representation
    of characteristics that were utilized and tested by this study. • Methods o SVM,
    CART, RF. • Accuracy Comparison Indicators o Kappa Coefficient, Overall Accuracy,
    User''s Accuracy, Producer''s Accuracy. • LULC Classes o Water Bodies, Vegetation
    Cover, Urban Land, Barren Land. 2. Data and methodology 2.1. Study area Lahore
    is the second most populated city of Pakistan and this city is most populated
    and capital city of province of Punjab (Mehmood et al., 2022). The dynamic change
    in land LULC has become a major concern in Lahore, causing a variety of socioeconomic
    and environmental issues relating to air quality (Ahmad et al., 2023). Thus, accurate
    LULC mapping of Lahore is need of the hour. Lahore is situated between 31° 32′
    N and 74° 20′ E, with river Ravi on its west side and India on East side, city
    consists of flat terrain with average elevation of 217 m above sea level (ASL)
    (Rana and Bhatti, 2018). According to census of 2017, population of Lahore jumped
    to 11.2 million which was recorded as 6.3 million in 1998 and 98% of this huge
    population is living in urban areas of Lahore (PBS, 2017) Additionally, being
    a megacity Lahore has a vast area of 1684 km2 and is the center of cultural, academic
    and economic activities, this city often known as heart of Pakistan (Fahad et
    al., 2021). Lahore lies in less humid zone (Zafar et al., 2023a) of Pakistan,
    this city has extreme weather conditions in summer and winter. Months of April
    to September are considered as summer seasons and average daytime temperature
    for summer seasons remains between 40 °C to 48 °C, months of May and June are
    the hottest months in which temperature normally touches 48 °C. Months of November
    to March are considered as winter season, in which December and January are most
    cold months in which temperature touches the 0 °C. Lahore received average 600
    mm rainfall annually and most of the rainfall observed during the months of July
    and August (Monsoon season) (Abbas, 2022). Fig. 1 showed the geographical location
    and a general reflection of LULC of Lahore city. Download : Download high-res

    with Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 imagery. 2.2. Satellite data GEE offers
    a massive amount of remotely sensed data from well-known satellites like Landsat,
    MODIS and Sentinel for last four decades. Landsat satellite is very common choice
    for LULC extraction due to its acceptable spatial and temporal resolution (Kafy
    et al., 2021, Leta et al., 2021, Soomro et al., 2021). This study utilized surface
    reflectance Tier 1 data from two sensors (Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Operational
    Land Imager (OLI)) of Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 to extract LULC maps
    of years 2008, 2015 and 2022. Additionally, cloud cover and malfunctioning (e.g.,
    the Landsat 7 scan line corrector malfunction) has always been hindering the optimal
    use of the Landsat data for LULC mapping (Robinson et al., 2017). Hence, to enhance
    the quality of the results, images with less than 5% cloud were selected for classification,
    and gap filling algorithm was applied. Afterwards, selected images were combined
    to a single image for further processing. Study utilized band 1–7 for all three
    satellites but in case of Landsat-7 band 6 (Thermal band) was excluded. 2.3. Methodology
    This study utilized a framework for the comparison of three different machine
    learning methods using GEE for two different sensors (Fig. 2). We developed four
    major classes (Water Bodies, Vegetation Cover, Urban Land, Barren Land) for classification,
    details about classes are given in Table 1. For purpose of input to classifier,
    total 846 training samples for four classes were generated using high resolution
    imagery from Google Earth, from which 70% of samples used for training purpose
    and remaining 30% were used as testing of algorithms. Download : Download high-res

    to classify the image for each year. Previously numerous studies used tested and
    compare the different algorithms for LULC classification. Table 2 showed the details
    of algorithms applied in different studies. Table 2. Details of previous studies

    and regression tree (CART) classifier CART, first developed by Breiman in 1984
    (Breiman et al., 1984), based on simple decision-making logic (If-else) and regression
    analysis. CART build a decision tree by dividing training data into successive
    subsets. This dividing of data is recursive and based on a predefined threshold,
    this phenomenon continued until CART achieved non dividable leaf nodes on tree.
    Afterwards, these leaf nodes on decision tree are used as output for predictions
    and the decision tree is then utilized in test phase to evaluate the performance
    of the algorithm. CART is highly sensitive about the training dataset and very
    minor variation in training dataset can lead to a totally different result. This
    heavy dependency on training dataset is considered as foremost disadvantage of
    CART. Nevertheless, CART is a simple model and proved it remains robustness in
    modern times. This study utilized “classifier.smileCart” method already embedded
    in GEE to apply CART classification. 2.3.2. Random forest (RF) classifier RF is
    most commonly used classifier for classification of LULC, RF is known as collective
    classifier that contains many autonomous trees to execute the classification.
    RF generates multiples random decisions trees by utilizing predictions of previously
    defined trees. A subset of inputs given to RF are used for training purpose and
    remaining input data is used for unbiased validation. Final result of classification
    is calculated by taking the average of probability of each class by individual
    tree. RF is considered as very stable classifier which can efficiently handle
    the issues like over fitting and noise, RF has also ability for handling the high
    dimensional data (Teluguntla et al., 2018). There are many parameters those can
    affect the final classification from RF. Two most effecting parameters for RF
    classifiers are number of total trees and number of variables in each node (Khan
    et al., 2021). 2.3.3. Support vector Machine (SVM) classifier SVM is supervised
    learning method commonly used for LULC classification and regression analyses.
    This algorithm creates an optimal decision boundary which is known as hyperplane
    and this hyperplane separates the on the base of minimum misclassified pixels
    from training data. The SVM adopted the iterative approach to create the optimum
    hyperplane to differentiate the patterns of training dataset. To create an optimal
    hyperplane SVM select the extreme points (support vectors). To determine the support
    vectors, cost parameter, Kernel Function and GAMA are the key parameters. By utilizing
    nonlinear kernel function, SVM can also applicable for nonlinear. SVM has a complex
    training mechanism which primarily depend upon size of the dataset, this training
    complexity made SVM not much suitable for large data. Nevertheless, SVM is very
    useful for complex data due to its kernel approach. 2.4. Accuracy assessment Accuracy
    of any classifier is dependent upon amount of input data, study area and satellite
    sensor. Several studies found different LULC accuracies for different classifier
    in different study area (Puttinaovarat et al., 2023, Soomro et al., 2021, Vivekananda
    et al., 2021). After performing the LULC classification, efficiency of any classifier
    can be evaluated through accuracy assessment. The most frequently adopted indicators
    for accuracy assessment are kappa coefficient and overall accuracy. Kappa coefficient
    evaluate the ability of a classifier in view of the forecasted values. Kappa coefficient
    has a value range from 0 to 1, where 0 value of kappa denotes no ability and 1
    denotes the perfect ability of classifier. In contrast, over all accuracy is the
    indication of ratio between number of pixels correctly classified and total number
    of pixels classified. GEE has an embedded confusion matrix algorithm. This study
    utilized a GEE embedded confusion matrix approach for validation and evaluation
    of classification accuracy. Equations for overall accuracy and kappa coefficient
    calculation are given below (Basheer et al., 2022): (1) where Cp is indicating
    correctly classified pixels and Tp is indicating the total pixels. (2) where N
    is the total number of observations, cr is the representation of total number
    of column and rows, is denotation of the total observations in row j and column
    k, represents marginal total of row j, and marginal total of column j is denoted
    by . Additionally, user’s accuracy for each class is calculated by taking the
    ratio of correctly classified pixels of class and total classified pixels of class,
    equation for user’s accuracy is given below: (3) Basically, user''s accuracy is
    the possibility for a pixel to exist in its corresponding forecasted class. Correspondingly,
    producer’s accuracy is calculated by the ratio of correctly classified pixels
    to the total reference pixels in a class, given below is the equation to calculate
    producer’s accuracy: (4) Producer’s accuracy is the possibility for a class being
    classified properly. Fig. 2 is the representation of complete methodology adopted
    for this study. 3. Results 3.1. LULC classification This study examined the four
    different types of LULC (water bodies, vegetation cover, urban land and barren
    land) of Lahore city for three different years (2008, 2015 and 2022) using Landsat-7,
    Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 imagery. Study utilized three commonly used machine learning
    algorithms (CART, RF, SVM) and every algorithm has produced results slightly different
    from other. Fig. 3 showed the spatial distribution of all LULC classes done by

    the results from overall accuracy and kappa coefficient, RF classifier outperformed
    both of the classifier in all case of all three images. RF classifier showed maximum
    overall accuracy of 95.2% for Landsat-9 image, 92.35% overall accuracy for Landsat-7
    and 91.6% accuracy for Landsat-8 imagery, which is above both of the classifier.
    Additionally, CART showed least overall accuracy which is below the both classifiers.
    In case of sensors of Landsat satellite, OLI sensor from Landsat-9 showed maximum
    performance for all three classifiers. Landsat-9 showed overall accuracy of 89.7%
    for CART classifier, 89.8% for SVM and 95.2% accuracy for RF classifier. Additionally,
    OLI sensor from Landsat-8 performed least from all three sensors. Fig. 8 showed

    4. Discussion This study utilized the machine learning algorithms for LULC classification
    of Lahore city to identify the best suit machine learning algorithm for classification
    of LULC in unplanned cities like Lahore. Results of user’s and producer’s accuracy
    showed that barren land and urban land showed minimum values. Lahore has is a
    city with unplanned urbanization and Lahore has very few high-rise structures
    in urbanized areas. This caused the a very slight misclassification of these classes
    and effect their accuracies. Lahore city is currently under a stress of air pollution
    and very low air quality index (AQI) (Ali et al., 2022) and one the reason for
    this problem is very minimum vegetation and tree cover within the city (Khan et
    al., 2022). Low AQI also affect the quality of satellite imagery as, the quality
    of satellite images is affected due to the scattering and absorption of sunlight
    by atmospheric molecules and aerosols. Aerosols are major constituents for the
    formation of haze and thus responsible for degradation in the satellite images
    (Joshi et al., 2020). Vegetation cover of Lahore is mostly separated from urban
    areas and that made the machine learning classifier to classify vegetation cover
    more correctly, spatial separation of urban areas and vegetation cover made it
    easy to collect correct samples for the training of classifier and also scarce
    of urban vegetation help to avoid mixing of signature to classify the different
    classes accurately. Generally, Lahore contains only one water body (Ravi River)
    which is also suffering from water pollutants from city waste (Aslam et al., 2022),
    which caused the very tine misclassification of water pixels with barren and urban
    land. Overall, RF performed way better than in every LULC class but SVM gave almost
    same accuracy for vegetation cover land and even for Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 SVM
    surpass the RF for vegetation class, SVM also surpassed RF in user’s accuracy
    of barren land class. It is quite challenging to exactly distinguish between classes
    like barren land and urban land with 30 m spatial resolution in city like Lahore.
    Satellite with better spatial resolution may give better results for classification
    with machine learning algorithms. Every machine learning has some advantages and
    disadvantages. For instance, CART and SVM misclassify between LULC classes but
    SVM performed very when a small training dataset is available which made him and
    perfect choice for classification with little number sampling points (J. Wang
    et al., 2022). In contrast to SVM, RF is more robust and less dependent upon parameters
    (Lin and Doyog, 2023). In general, RF associate many soft linear boundaries at
    the surface of the decision and utilized previously defined predictions for classification.
    In this study, RF outperformed both classifiers (CART and SVM), irrespective of
    size of training data, SVM is performed well but a bit less than RF and CART performed
    less than both classifiers. A recent study from Kerala (India) also indicates
    that RF outperformed SVM and CART for LULC classification with 89.5% accuracy
    (Kulithalai Shiyam Sundar and Deka, 2022). A study from Munneru River Basin (India)
    also endorsed the results from this study, as study suggested RF as best performing
    machine learning algorithm with 94.5% accuracy (Loukika et al., 2021). RF also
    outperformed SVM for LULC classification in Greater Gaborone Planning Area of
    Botswana (Ouma et al., 2023). However, some study suggested that SVM performed
    better than RF, for example a recent study from El-Fayoum Governorate (Egypt)
    (Atef et al., 2023) suggested that SVM produced most accurate LULC maps with kappa
    coefficient of 0.916 compared to RF (0.909). Studies also suggested that CART
    outperformed SVM for LULC classification (Goldblatt et al., 2016). SVM also outperformed
    RF with accuracy of 91.4% in Urmia Lake Basin (Iran) (Feizizadeh et al., 2023).
    Different researchers found different machine algorithms best to apply for LULC
    classification in different areas. Thus, it is recommended to adopt latest, less
    sensitive and fastest machine learning algorithm for classification of LULC. The
    accuracy of a machine learning algorithms for LULC classification does not only
    vary with study area but also with study period. This is possibly due to the influence
    of atmospheric, surface and illumination variations. Accuracy of machine learning
    algorithms are also dependent on training samples. Thus, it is essential to maintain
    the quality of input samples and recommended to adopt latest, less sensitive and
    fastest machine learning algorithm for classification of LULC. 5. Conclusion Data
    from remote sensing satellite is suitable option for detection of LULC changes
    in an urbanized city Lahore analysis. Results showed the useability of machine
    learning algorithms with use of Landsat data for LULC analyses. Major findings
    and conclusion of this study are listed below: • RF is the best performing machine
    learning algorithm with overall accuracy of 92.7% for Landsat-7, 91.6% for Landsat-8
    and 95.2% for Landsat-9 imagery. • Sensor from Landsat-9 showed best overall accuracy
    of 89.7% for CART, 95.2% for RF and 89.8% for SVM. • According to the best performing
    algorithm (RF), urban Land area of Lahore city increased by 34.9% in last fifteen
    years. In case of LULC classifications various studies found different results
    based on selected satellite, study area and selected algorithms. Furthermore,
    studies also suggested that different classifiers performed differently in different
    climatic zones and geographical locations. Hence, future researchers should try
    to explore LULC by using high resolution imagery, more detailed classes, field
    gathered input data and adopting variety of sophisticated and modern machine learning
    algorithms designed for LULC classification. This study can be helpful for policy
    making, planning of city services, betterment of management practices, and additional
    LULC classification in urbanized cities. Current study is preliminary and has
    limitation with regards to (i) study area, (ii) the study duration, (iii) selected
    datasets and (iii) selection of machine learning algorithms for LULC extraction,
    any change in study area or study duration can affect accuracy of machine learning
    algorithms and in same way any change in adopted machine learning algorithms or
    datasets can lead to different results. Thus, a vigorous study may need more continues
    data, less sensitive machine learning algorithms and data from satellites having
    high spatial resolution. CRediT authorship contribution statement Zeeshan Zafar:

  description: Inter-basin water transfer interventions are inherently prone to large-scale
    climate variability and droughts that may affect the reliability of the water
    supply to the recipient basin. This research evaluated the reliability of three
    streams of Maragua, Irati, and Gikigie in the Upper Tana basin to meet the proposed
    water transfers to Nairobi City in the Athi River basin. HEC HMS model was used
    to simulate the stream flows with NSE and R2 of 0.59 and 0.72 respectively in
    the validation period, using remotely sensed WaPOR ETa as input data. During the
    dry years, the reliability of Maragua, Irati, and Gikigie to meet the water transfer
    was 15 %, 23 %, and 33 % respectively. In normal years, the reliability increased
    to 45 %, 60 %, and 62 %; and to 83 %, 98 %, and 94 % in the wet years. This implies
    that the project will not meet its objective during the dry and normal years.
    The dry years had a 5 years cycle of occurrence while the wet years occurred every
    10 years. Baker Flashiness index showed Irati and Gikigie flows to vary between
    9 % and 25 % while Maragua flow, vary between 7 % and 44 % showing that the Maragua
    stream has higher variability thus lower reliability. The results showed the importance
    of considering water assessment of new infrastructural work on the cyclic nature
    of stream flows over traditional approaches that use long-average historical data.
    Inter-basin flood based systems coupled with storage reservoirs may enhance supply
    reliability thus reducing the hydrological risks of stream flow variability.

    are inherently prone to large-scale climate variability and droughts that may
    affect the reliability of the water supply to the recipient basin. This research
    evaluated the reliability of three streams of Maragua, Irati, and Gikigie in the

    flowWaPOR 1. Introduction Water is increasingly becoming a scarce resource due
    to population growth, urbanization and climate change, especially in the arid
    and semi-arid regions (ASAL). Supply-oriented strategies such as desalination
    of seawater, inter-basin water transfer (IBWTs) and reservoir storage have continued
    to offer solutions to address this water scarcity (Gohari et al., 2013). However,
    in most of the regions, inter-basin water transfers have only temporarily solved
    the water scarcity problem in the recipient basin (J. Gupta and van der Zaag,
    2008; Tian et al., 2019). This is because most inter-basin water transfer developments
    are based on long term water balance where regions deemed to have “surplus” water
    donate to regions perceived to be water “scarce” (Gohari et al., 2017). Gupta
    and van der Zaag (2008) in their review of inter-basin water transfers gave a
    set of criteria for evaluating inter-basin water projects, among them, being a
    real and verifiable surplus in the donor basin and a deficit in the recipient
    basin. This criteria is vital because of the sensitive nature of IBWTs to hydrological
    variations where in the dry seasons, the systems seldom meet the recipient basin
    water demands, in addition to increasing the hydrological risks in the donor basin.
    In most IBWTs, water allocation studies seldom consider flow variability (Khadem
    et al., 2021) which leads to an overestimation of the available water (Pittock
    et al., 2009). Much of the research on IBWTs has been on the negative impacts
    of the diverted water on the donor basin (Fraj et al., 2019; Quan et al., 2016;
    Wang et al., 2016),while stream flow variability which influences the reliability
    of the system to meet the water demand in the recipient basin at different climatic
    conditions is seldomly addressed.For adequate stream flow reliability assessment,
    long term daily flow data is required to capture changes in the discharge. However,
    in most regions, these data is scarce or unavailable which necessitates the use
    of hydrological models to simulate the required stream flows (Dile and Srinivasan,
    2014). Furthermore in tropical and heterogeneous landscape, evapotranspiration
    is vital for proper hydrological modelling. Penman Monteith is the commonly used
    method for ET estimation, however, it requires significant climatic data that
    is scarce in most of the regions. Thus an innovative methodology that uses ET
    WaPOR data that has been validated (FAO, 2020) as input to the model has been
    adopted to improve the hydrological model performance and limit the model uncertainty
    (Blatchford et al., 2020). The Upper Tana basin has experienced increasing demand
    and competition for water resources to sustain food production, energy requirements,
    and drinking water. Most of the infrastructural development for inter-basin water
    transfer has been undertaken in the basin diverting water from the Chania and
    Thika rivers, which are tributaries of the Tana River. Population and industrial
    growth in Nairobi have further increased the demand and competition for water
    resources. The Kenyan government is implementing the Northern Collector Tunnel
    (NCT) phase I, a water transfer project intended to alleviate this water shortage
    and meet the growing water demand in Nairobi city and its environs. The project,
    expected to supply approximately 140,000 m3/day involves the construction of a
    tunnel to convey the diverted water to the already existing Thika Dam. The assessment
    of the available water from three streams (Maragua, Gikigie and Irati) was based
    on a hydrological assessment of 2010 that estimated the mean annual flow less
    the required reserve flow and present abstractions from the streams (AWWDA, 2016).
    Based on the engineering design of NCT Phase 1, only the normal flow (Q80) and
    flood flow (Q68) will be abstracted for use in Nairobi city and its environs from
    the respective streams using regulated height-dependent water diversion structures.
    As such, water availability and reliability will be highly dependent on the temporal
    variability of flow in Maragua, Gikigie and Irati streams (AWWDA, 2012; MCG, 2015;
    World Bank Group, 2017). Stream flow variability in Upper Tana basin largely depends
    on the changes in the rainfall pattern from the Aberdare and Mount Kenya Forests.
    Over the years, climate variability events such as La Nina have resulted in frequent
    and extreme droughts affecting the reliability of flow in many streams in the
    basin (Langat et al., 2017; Okal et al., 2020). Therefore, for sustainable management
    of the NCT phase I, stream flow variability and the effect on supply are crucial
    for optimal water shortage solutions. However, there is limited scientific studies
    on stream flow variability and reliability of the tributaries of Tana River and
    many river systems in Africa. At present, most of the research has been on the
    hydropower and irrigation expansion effects on sediment and river discharge of
    Tana River (Duvail et al., 2012; Hunink et al., 2013; Odhiambo-Ochiewo et al.,
    2016). Often, as in the case of NCT phase 1 and many others in the region, hydrological
    assessment is based on long term average data, mostly at monthly timestep that
    aggregate large daily variations and therefore not the true assessment of the
    water diversion. This maybe critical when assessing reliability of flood flows
    that may occur in short time - often a day and the water diversion is based on
    height-dependent hydraulic structures. In addition, short-term effects on hydrological
    variability caused by frequent droughts maybe lost or not effectively accounted
    for in the assessments. Hydrologic Engineering Center-the Hydrologic Modelling
    System (HEC HMS) was adopted as the hydrological modelling tool because of the
    ease in its use, low data demand as well as its ability to use external data as
    input data (Feldman, 2000; Fleming and Doan, 2010; Munyaneza et al., 2014). HEC-HMS
    has successfully been used to predict river discharge in many river basin in the
    tropical climate including in Kenya (Gebre, 2015; Halwatura and Najim, 2013; Ouédraogo
    et al., 2018; Sampath et al., 2015) It is also a public domain free software.
    The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the changes in the hydrological
    regime of stream flow in water transfer systems. Further, to investigate the impacts
    of stream flow variability on water availability and reliability for proper water
    resources planning and management of inter-basin water transfer systems. Remote
    sensing data including ET WaPOR and CHIRPS datasets have been used to partially
    mitigate problem of data scarcity in African landscapes in addition to the observed
    climate data. The results of this study will inform policymakers on the planning
    and design of future water transfer projects and their operations for sustainable
    water management. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The Upper Tana basin
    covers an area of 17,000 km2, with elevation ranging from 400 m.a.s.l to 5199
    m.a.s.l in the mountainous upper region. The main rivers in the basin originate
    from the Aberdare and Mt. Kenya Forests flowing to the Indian Ocean. The Inter-basin
    water transfer (NCT phase 1) is in Maragua sub-basin diverting flows from the
    Maragua stream and two of its tributaries (Gikigie and Irati streams) (AWWDA,
    2012). The annual rainfall in the study area varies between 2600 mm/year to 900
    mm/years in the highlands and lower altitudes respectively. The agri-climatic
    zones are the forests in the high-altitude region, dairy, tea, and coffee in the
    middle altitude and maize cultivation in the lower altitudes area. Majority of
    the population in the region depend on rain-fed agriculture (MCG, 2015). 2.1.1.
    Inter-basin water transfer (northern collector tunnel phase 1) The Northern Collector
    Tunnel (NCT) phase 1 is a major component of the water master plan for Nairobi
    city and major satellite towns as an alternative water source up to the year 2035.
    The project involves approximately 12 km long water, a 4m diameter concrete-lined
    tunnel, river diversion weirs, intakes, and compensation channels. The project
    is expected to transfer 140,000 m3/day from three streams (Maragua, Gikigie and
    Irati) to the existing Thika dam for use in Nairobi. Currently, Thika and Sasumua
    dam are the main water sources for Nairobi city contributing approximately 440,000
    m3/day and 62,500 m3/day respectively. However, the medium projected water demand
    is approximately 800,000 and 1,100,000 m3/day for year 2020 and 2030 respectively.
    Therefore, the NCT phase 1 project is unlikely to alleviate water shortages in
    Nairobi city and its environs (AWWDA, 2012). 2.2. Research methodology set-up
    The research systematic methodological framework is as shown in Fig. 1. HEC HMS
    model was used to simulate Maragua, Gikigie and Irati stream flows while FDC,
    trend analysis, FI and BFI were used to understand the stream flow variability.
    Reliability index was used to estimate the service reliability of the system under
    different climatic conditions. Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) was
    applied to investigate the magnitude of stream flow alteration caused by the NCT
    phase I. Download : Download high-res image (311KB) Download : Download full-size

    and preparation Hydrological modelling is often a challenge in a data scarce basin,
    however, over time satellite datasets with finer spatial resolutions have became
    available. Research in remote sensing has resulted in improved quality of a variety
    of spatial data. This paper presents a novel method of using actual ET data from
    Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data (WaPOR)
    database for the period 2010–2017 in decadal (10 days) timesteps.The method to
    calculate E and T is based on the ETLook model. It uses the Penman-Monteith (P-M)
    equation, adapted to remote sensing input data (FAO, 2020) The evaluation of actual
    ET-WaPOR datasets showed that the quality is satisfactory to contribute in understanding
    the hydrological processes at a local and global spatial scale (Blatchford et
    al., 2020). The evapotranspiration points were identified based on the land cover
    of the basin. To estimate evapotranspiration data for years (1982–2009), this
    study correlated 2010–2017 evapotranspiration with precipitation using the linear
    relation ET = βPET+αP (Cheng et al., 2011). For a tropical climate, the effect
    of variability of potential evapotranspiration on a monthly timescale is minimal
    (Woodroffe and Falkland, 2004) therefore βPET was assumed to be constant. The
    slope α indicates the variability of ET with respect to P (precipitation). The
    study used daily precipitation data from three stations namely Ndakaini, North
    Mathioya and DWO collected from Muranga County Meteorological department that
    are located in the Maragua watershed for the period of 1982–2017. Four Climate
    Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station - CHIRPS (PG1, 2, 4, 5) were
    used in areas that were not sufficiently covered by the observed rainfall stations
    for the same period (1982–2017) (Fig. 2). CHIRPS datases was corrected using the
    power transformation method with the three observed stations. River gauging station
    4BE01 was used for calibration and validation with data from Water Resources Authority
    (WRA) for the period 1983–1987 and 2012–2015 respectively A digital elevation
    model (DEM) was downloaded from the Regional Centre for Mapping Resource for Development
    (RCMRD) website at a resolution of 30-m. Soil Type Data was downloaded from the
    Upper Tana KENSOTER database with a resolution of 1:1 m. The land use/land cover
    data was obtained from Kenya Sentinel 2 2016 at a resolution of 10 m since the
    study area is largely in a forested area, and there has been no change over time.

    time series, and control specifications model for each sub-basin. The basin model
    consists of the basin map prepared and derived from ArcGIS as shown in Fig. 3.
    The meteorological component consists of rainfall & evapotranspiration data. Evapotranspiration
    can be estimated using the physical-based energy balance (Penman-Monteith) or
    imported to HEC HMS software as in the ET datasets from WaPOR. The control component
    involves the simulation period and time step to be used. Download : Download high-res

    of the Upper Tana basin. In this study, SMA (Soil Moisture Accounting) was used
    as the loss rate method for each basin. SMA method simulates the movement of water
    through vegetation, surface interception, soil profile and two groundwater layers.
    Output from the SMA algorithm is precipitation excess (surface runoff), groundwater
    flow, and deep percolation. 2.6. Stream flow variability indices Stream flow variability
    was analyzed using Flashiness index (FI), flow duration curve (FDC) base flow
    index (BFI) and monthly trend analysis. 2.6.1. Flashiness index Flashiness index
    was used to show the recurrence and speed of short-term changes in flow thus evaluating
    stability of the three streams. The index (FI) shows the changes in the stream
    flow using the ration of absolute day to day fluctuations with the total annual
    as defined by (Baker et al., 2004): Equation 1 Where FI is the flashiness index,
    is the mean daily discharge, is the mean daily discharge of the previous day and
    is the total flow for the year. Long term changes (annual) in river discharge
    were estimated using this index as illustrated by (Baker et al., 2004; Holko et
    al., 2011) 2.6.2. Flow duration curve Flow Duration Curve (FDC) is a stream flow
    variability index that shows the exceedance of flow for a given percentage of
    the time (Equation (2)). FDC is a representative of low and flood flows for a
    given river system (Smakhtin, 2001). FDC was chosen for this study because the
    Northern Collector Tunnel (NCT) phase 1 abstractions are based on flow exceedance
    at any given time. For instance, once the project is implemented, it will only
    abstract flood flows exceeding Q80 for Maragua and Gikigie and Q68 for Irati stream
    (MCG, 2015). The study used the FDC software (from http://hydrooffice.org/) to
    plot the curves using average daily discharge flows for each of the streams. Equation
    2 Where P is the percentile, N is the number of data points and Rank is the rank
    order (from1-N). 2.6.3. Base flow index Base Flow Index (BFI) is a non-dimensional
    ratio given by dividing the volume of the base flow by the total stream flow (Smakhtin,
    2001). BFI can be used to estimate the flow stability of rivers and streams. A
    BFI closer to 1 shows a high groundwater recharge to stream flow while that closer
    to 0 indicates a seasonal stream (Sapač et al., 2019; Smakhtin, 2001). BFI was
    calculated also using the BFI index software (http://hydrooffice.org/) for each
    year of the study period (1983–2017) using Equation (3). Equation 3 2.6.4. Monthly
    trend analysis Linear regression model is among the parametric methods of estimating
    patterns in data series (Ahn and Merwade, 2014; Ye et al., 2003). In this study,
    the model was used describe the trend of the monthly streamflows using Equation
    (4). Equation 4 Where y is the dependent variable (streamflow), X is the independent
    variable (time), m is the slope and C is the intercept. Negative (−) slope sign
    indicates a decreasing trend while positive (+) sign indicate an increasing trend.
    p value of <0.05 in linear regression model shows statistically significant correlation
    in the stream flow. 2.7. Hydrological alteration of streams flows in the NCT phase
    I Changes in the stream flows as a result of the NCT phase I were estimated using
    Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) software developed by the US Nature
    Conservancy (Mathews and Richter, 2007)). The indicators were categorized into
    five groups of magnitude of monthly flows, magnitude of extreme flows, timing
    of extreme flows, flow pulses and rise & fall rate. Degree of hydrological alteration
    was estimated using the Range of Variability Approach (RVA). RVA divides the pre
    impact data into three categories based on percentile values and computes the
    expected frequency with which the post impact values should fall within the categories.
    As such, degree of hydrological alteration is defined in Equation (5). Equation
    5 Where the expected frequency is the number of years which annual statistics
    fall within the RVA limits in the pre-impact period and observed frequency is
    the number of years which annual statistics fall within the RVA limits in the
    post-impact period. Since, the NCT phase I is yet to start operating, the post-impact
    hydrological series (1982–2017) were simulated to the hydraulic system designs.
    2.8. Reliability of the NCT phase I under different climatic conditions 2.8.1.
    Characterization of climatic conditions Studies in East Africa have shown an increase
    in drought events and climate variability. Upper Tana basin has been experiencing
    frequent and more severe droughts over the last decades (Okal et al., 2020). Proper
    IBWT planning and management requires a comprehensive understanding of variability
    and reliability of flow under different climatic conditions. As such dry, normal,
    and wet years, were characterized using the Stream flow Drought Index (SDI) (Eq.
    (6)). Equation 6 Where cumulative streamflow volume for the k month of the i th
    hydrological year. and are the mean and standard deviation of the streamflow of
    the k th month in the study period. SDI was calculated using the DrinC software
    at a 12-month time step (annual) (Tigkas et al., 2015). The dry, normal, and wet
    years were identified based on guidelines of drought categories shown in Table
    1. Table 1. Description of climatic condition based on SDI value and corresponding
    drought category (Tigkas et al., 2015). SDI Value Drought category Climatic year
    2.00 or greater Extremely wet Wet years 1.50–1.99 Severely wet 1.00–1.49 Moderately
    wet 0–0.99 Near normal (mildly wet) Normal years 0 to −0.99 Near normal (Mild
    drought) −1.00 to −1.49 Moderate drought Dry years −1.50 to −1.99 Severe drought
    −2.00 or lower Extreme drought 2.8.2. Supply reliability There are several indicators
    used to analyse the performance of a water system. The most commonly used is the
    deficit of water in volume (shortages) and the supply reliability. These two indicators
    have been used successfully in many studies (Digna et al., 2018; Mersha et al.,
    2018). For this study supply reliability at daily time step (Equation (7)) was
    used to analyse the performance of NCT phase I under different climatic conditions
    identified in section 2.8.1 (Sandoval-Solis et al., 2011). Equation 7 2.9. Calibration
    and validation The HEC HMS model was calibrated and validated using daily stream
    flow data for a period of 5 years (1983–1987) and 4 years (2012–2015) respectively
    for river station 4BE01 (Maragua river). To improve the accuracy of the simulated
    results, calibration was done using the optimization tools in HEC HMS model and
    manually using basin input parameters estimated from watershed characteristics.
    2.10. Model performance Model performance was evaluated using the three objective
    functions as shown in Table 2. First, Coefficient of determination (R2) which
    represents the proportion of variation of the simulated data from the observed
    data. R2 value ranges from 0 to 1, where values greater than 0.5 indicate that
    the model results are acceptable (Moriasi et al., 2007). Secondly, the Nash-Sutcliffe
    Efficiency (NSE) which estimates the accuracy of the model by assessing the relative
    magnitude of the residual variance to the observed data variance (Nash and Sutcliffe,
    1970). According to (Moriasi et al., 2015) NSE values greater than 0.5 are regarded
    as satisfactory. Lastly, PBIAS (percentage bias) which represents the average
    tendency of the simulated data to be greater than or less than the observed data.
    Negative PBIAS values show an overestimation of the model results while positive
    values show an underestimation. PBIAS values of 0 would show a perfect fit (V.
    H. Gupta et al., 1999). Table 2. Model performance guidelines used for hydrological
    modelling in Upper Tana (Moriasi et al., 2015). Performance NSE PBIAS R2 Very
    good 0.75 <NSE≤1.00 PBIAS≤ ±10 >0.85 Good 0.65 <NSE≤0.75 ±10 <PBIAS≤ ±15 0.75<R2

    NSE≤0.50 PBIAS≤ ±25 R2 ≤ 0.60 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Calibration and validation
    For this study, the model was calibrated and validated using daily stream flow
    and non-exceedance as shown in Fig. 4. The Coefficient of determination (R2) for
    calibration and validation was 0.57 and 0.72 while the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency
    (NSE) was 0.45 and 0.59 respectively as shown in Table 3. Lower NSE values during
    calibration is widely experienced in data scarce basin mostly attributable to
    the uncertainty involved in the observed stream flow data. Hernandez-Suarez et
    al. (2018), Kiptala et al. (2014), Nyeko (2015), and Sirisena et al. (2020) obtained
    similar results where the NSE was lower than 0.50 in calibration (unsatisfactory)
    but above 0.50 during the validation (satisfactory). As indicated by Kiptala et
    al. (2014) this uncertainty can be attributed to poorly maintained river gauging
    stations and outdated river rating curves especially in African landscape. In
    addition, smaller streams are more prone to uncertainty of the observed flows
    due to the short-term temporal variability in high flows in tropical climate (Hernandez-Suarez
    et al., 2018). Percentage bias (PBIAS) was −38 % for the calibration period and
    14 % in the validation period. The results showed an underestimation of the peak
    flows during the calibration period (Fig. 4). Underestimation of peaks is a common
    drawback of hydrological modelling and may be as a result of poor data collection
    and entry because the observed data is manually read and recorded (Zhang and Savenije,
    2005). However, the results were acceptable since the model performance indices
    (Table 3) were within the range stipulated in Section 2.10. PBIAS during the calibration
    period was not within the range because of the underestimation of the peak flows.

    3.2.1. Flow duration curve (FDC) and monthly trend analysis The proposed plan
    of the Northern Collector Tunnel(NCT) phase1 is to abstract in excess of 0.843
    m3/s and 0.137 m3/s (Q80) for Maragua and Gikigie stream respectively and 0.481
    m3/s (Q68) for Irati stream upon its completion (MCG, 2015). Based on that, this
    study analyzed possible variations in flow in exceedance of Q80 and Q68 over the
    study period. The results in Fig. 5 showed the changes in Q80 for Maragua & Gikigie
    and Q68 for Irati stream over the period 1982–2017. All three streams showed an
    increasing trend in Q80 and Q68 flows. Similarly, Table 4, shows the result of
    linear regression model, where all the streams showed an increasing trend in the
    monthly flow other than for the month of May where Maragua stream had a decreasing
    trend. For Irati stream, seven of the months had a p-value of less than 0.05 showing
    high statistical significance as compared to Maragwa and Gikige steams which had
    4 and 5 months with p-value of less than 0.05 respectively. Langat et al. (2017)
    obtained similar results when investigating changes in Tana river flow and rainfall
    trends in the basin. Stream flow had an increasing trend, which they concluded
    was a result of the upward trend of rainfall in the stations located in the highland
    (Aberdare Ranges and Mount Kenya). Similarly, Fig. 6, shows an upward trend in
    rainfall from North Mathioya and Ndakaini rainfall stations in the study area.
    However, in some low flow years, the flows were significantly below the proposed
    abstractions. Thus, although there is an increasing trend in stream flow, changes
    in the flow regime are significant. This calls for adaptive water management solutions
    to ensure the sustainability of the project and all users of the streams (Langat
    et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (481KB) Download : Download

    The analysis of the BFI index showed a value of 0.5 in all three streams indicating
    the groundwater component of the streams is approximately 50 % which is vital
    for users in the dry periods (Khadem et al., 2021). 3.2.3. Flashiness index The
    annual flashiness index (FI) in Maragua stream varies from 0.07 to 0.44. This
    showed that the stream discharge varies between 7 % and 44 %. Irati and Gikigie
    streams showed a flashiness index of between 0.09 and 0.29 meaning the discharge
    varies between 9 % and 29 %. From, the results, Maragua stream is the least stable
    of the three streams with more variability of flow. Irati stream had no changes
    in the trend analysis however, Gikigie and Maragua streams showed a decreasing
    trend as shown in Fig. 7. The flashiness index (FI) depends on the main geological
    units, precipitation, and catchment size. Irati stream at the abstraction point,
    has a tributary which may result in attenuation of flow thus a more stable stream
    flow (Holko et al., 2011). Download : Download high-res image (555KB) Download

    alteration influences the risk of environmental damage for the streams in the
    NCT phase I diversion system. The changes in the three streams were similar in
    that the median for monthly flow were lower during the wet season (April–July)
    after NCT phase I in all the streams. The magnitude of the median monthly flow
    for Maragua, Gikigie and Irati decreased by an average of 55 %, 66 % and 56 %
    respectively during the wet season while in the dry season magnitude of the decrease
    was lower at 4 %, 21 % and 9 % respectively (Fig. 8). Similarly all the three
    streams showed a downtrend for the annual 1, 3, 7, 30 and 90 day maximum flow.
    However, the annual 1, 3, 7, 30 and 90 day minimum flow showed a constant trend
    (Table 5). The results show that during the wet seasons all the streams will be
    affected when the flood flows are diverted. Studies have shown that alteration
    of the hydrological regime affects the quality of riparian conditions and decreases
    habitats in the stream ecosystem. A change in the flood intensity might cause
    the stream beds to be invaded by plants. In some streams, the spawning of fish
    is affected thus influencing the diversity and abundance of fish in the streams
    (Belmar et al., 2013; Eum et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2020). However, IHA is limited
    in quantifying the changes in the habitat thus more research is needed on the
    magnitude of the changes in the ecosystem of the streams. Download : Download

    and wet years) Based on the methodology described in section 2.8.1, SDI index
    was used to analyse stream discharge data to estimate dry, normal, and wet years
    for each stream in the study area. Fig. 9 and Table 6 shows that the streams experienced
    extremely dry years in 1984–1985, 1993–1994, 1996–1997, 2000–2001, 2004–2005,
    2008–2010. Characterization of drought has been done in the Upper Tana basin with
    similar results as in this study. Okal et al. (2020) made a similar conclusion
    and categorized drought years in the basin as 1982, 1989, 1994, 2000, 2006, 2011,
    and 2017. Dry years had a cycle of occurrence of 5 years and lasted for two years.
    Normal years were 1989–1991, 1992–1993, 2002–2004, and 2007–2008 while wet years
    were 1997–1999, 2012–2016, which showed a 10 years cycle. The Upper Tana basin
    has experienced frequent and severe drought, especially during the dry seasons.

    additionally evaluated using the reliability of the three streams under the dry,
    normal, and wet years. The results showed that the reliability of supply in all
    three streams was highest during the wet years, it reduced in the normal years,
    and lowest during the dry years (Fig. 10). On average, the reliability of Maragua,
    Gikigie, and Irati streams during the dry years was 15 %, 33 % and 23 % respectively.
    In the normal years, the reliability increased to 45 %, 62 %, and 60 % for Maragua,
    Gikigie and Irati streams respectively. The reliability of the streams was highest
    during the wet years with 83 % for Maragua, 94 % for Gikigie, and 98 % for Irati

    quartiles of reliability of the streams at dry, normal and wet years. The objective
    of the Northern Collector tunnel Phase 1 project is to bridge the water demand
    gap in Nairobi city and its environs with an 84 % reliability. However, from the
    results, this objective will not be met during the dry and normal years due to
    the low reliability of the stream flows. Yet, the demand for water is highest
    particularly during the dry years in both the donor and recipient basins. Further
    investigation is required to explore ways of storing the water during the wet
    periods for use during the dry and normal periods. Of the three streams, Maragua
    stream had the lowest reliability in all the years, which could be because of
    its great variability in flow as indicated by the flashiness index. In addition,
    competition for scarce water resources during dry periods may lead to conflict
    in and between the basins. Water transfer projects tend to focus on increasing
    supply thus shifting the attention from water demand management strategies. Thus,
    the water demand in the Nairobi city may increase with time because of the new
    water transfer project. Studies have shown similar results, that the expansion
    of inter-basin water transfer systems to meet the growing demand does not guarantee
    reduced shortages in the recipient basins. In most water transfer projects, the
    supply reliability in the donor basin is greatly reduced thus being unable to
    meet the water demands of the recipient basin (Tian et al., 2019). The hydrological
    risks of water transfers from the northeast of England to London, in the United
    Kingdom, were high and could lead to a supply deficit of 60 %. To meet the water
    demands in London with minimal risks in the donor basin, large volumes of water
    would only be abstracted during the winter months. This water would be stored
    either as recharge to aquifers or through the construction of a small reservoir
    for use in the summer months (Khadem et al., 2021). Similar conclusions were made
    for inter-basin water transfer in Hanjiang River, China. The authors noted that
    shortages in supply were more likely to occur during the dry periods than during
    the wet periods. Developing optimal water allocation strategies were key to improving
    the reliability of the system. This would mean coming up with measures to coordinate
    the inflow, storage, and demand through reservoir operating rules (Ming et al.,
    2017; Tian et al., 2019). Since flow uncertainty influences the water transfer
    systems’ supply reliability, the use of a stochastic model when assessing water
    availability and developing reservoir operating rules would improve the performance
    of the inter-basin water system (Li et al., 2014). 4. Conclusions This research
    evaluated the variability and reliability of Maragua, Gikigie and Irati stream
    in the Upper Tana basin to meet the water requirements of Nairobi city under different
    climate conditions (NCT phase 1). HEC HMS model was used to simulate the stream
    flows with NSE and R2 of 0.59 and 0.72 respectively in the validation period,
    the model performance can be attributed to using ETa WaPOR as input data. The
    use of ETa WaPOR data reduced the number of climatic data required and thus limiting
    the model uncertainty. All the streams showed an upward percentile and monthly
    flow trend, however, with significant seasonal variability. During the dry years,
    streams (Maragua, Gikigie, and Irati) had supply reliability of 15 %, 33 %, and
    23 % respectively. In the normal years, the reliability increased slightly to
    45 %, 60 %, and 62 % respectively. This shows that proposed water transfers will
    not meet the demands in Nairobi city in the dry and normal years. However, in
    the wet years, the streams have high flows, therefore, meeting the proposed water
    abstractions with high supply reliability of 83 %, 98 %, and 94 % respectively.
    From the characterization of the climatic conditions, dry years are more frequent
    than wet years with a cycle of every 5 years and 10 years respectively. Thus,
    periods of limited flow for the transfer system are likely to occur more often
    necessitating measures to enhance supply reliability. The Baker Flashiness index
    showed that Maragua stream flow fluctuated more than Gikigie and Irati streams.
    Since, the stream is proposed to contribute the highest amount of the water transfer,
    catchment-based strategies to mitigate this variability are necessary. NCT phase
    I is likely to cause significant hydrological changes in all the streams during
    the wet season as indicated from the analysis of indicators of hydrological alterations.
    The outcome of this research has demonstrated the need for water practitioners
    and engineers to assess reliability of IBWTs at different climatic conditions
    using daily stream flow data for better insights into the technical viability
    of such projects. Water management strategies where water is stored during the
    wet years for use in the dry and normal years will improve on supply reliability.
    In addition, the optimal operating policy of the reservoir in the recipient basin
    needs to be responsive to the hydrological variability to enhance the water transfer
    reliability. This would mean inter-basin water transfer systems modeling where
    a stochastic approach to stream flow is used to optimize the operation of reservoirs.
    Further, inter-basin water transfers that rely on flood flow should be coupled
    with storage reservoir to enhance inter & intraseasonal variability, especially
    in the tropical climate. Based on the results of this study, an integrated water
    supply system coupled with a storage reservoir may be optimized to enhance supply
    reliability, thus sustainable water supply to the recipient basin. CRediT authorship

  description: Microbial communities are the primary drivers of carbon cycling in
    the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Dense microbial mats, consisting mainly
    of photosynthetic cyanobacteria, occupy aquatic areas associated with streams
    and lakes. Other microbial communities also occur at lower densities as patchy
    surface biological soil crusts (hereafter, biocrusts) across the terrestrial landscape.
    Multispectral satellite data have been used to model microbial mat abundance in
    high-density areas like stream and lake margins, but no previous studies have
    investigated the lower detection limits of biocrusts. Here, we describe remote
    sensing and field-based survey and sampling approaches to study the detectability
    and distribution of biocrusts in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Using a combination
    of multi- and hyperspectral tools and spectral linear unmixing, we modeled the
    abundances of biocrust in eastern Taylor Valley. Our spectral approaches can detect
    low masses of biocrust material in laboratory microcosms down to biocrust concentrations
    of 1% by mass. These techniques also distinguish the spectra of biocrust from
    both surface rock and mineral signatures from orbit. We found that biocrusts are
    present throughout the soils of eastern Taylor Valley and are associated with
    diverse underlying soil communities. The densest biocrust communities identified
    in this study had total organic carbon 5x greater than the content of typical
    arid soils. The most productive biocrusts were located downslope of melting snowpacks
    in unique soil ecosystems that are distinct from the surrounding arid landscape.
    There are similarities between the snowpack and stream sediment communities (high
    diversity of soil invertebrates) as well as their ecosystem properties (e.g.,
    persistence of liquid water, high transfer of available nutrients, lower salinity
    from flushing) compared to the typical arid terrestrial ecosystem of the dry valleys.
    Our approach extends the capability of orbital remote sensing of photosynthetic
    communities out of the aquatic margins and into the drier soils which comprise
    most of this landscape. This interdisciplinary work is critical for measuring
    and monitoring terrestrial carbon stocks and predicting future ecosystem dynamics
    in this currently water-limited but increasingly dynamic Antarctic landscape,
    which is particularly climate-sensitive and difficult to access.

    Biocrusts, i.e., soil aggregates containing communities of cyanobacteria, algae,
    moss, lichen, etc. on the surface of soil (Weber et al., 2022), inhabit all continents
    (Belnap et al., 2016), are estimated to cover 12% of the Earth''s terrestrial
    surface (Rodriguez-Caballero et al., 2018), and play foundational roles in the
    ecosystems where they occur (Belnap et al., 2016). Biocrusts are distributed across
    hot and cold deserts and are oftentimes an important source, if not the primary
    source, of carbon (C) in these systems (Elbert et al., 2012). They perform key
    ecological functions, including photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, nutrient cycling,
    and soil stabilization (Belnap, 2003), which are particularly important in ecosystems
    that lack vascular vegetation. Biocrusts may be more susceptible to climate change
    than previously thought (Finger-Higgens et al., 2022). Climate warming and precipitation
    variation appears to have already impacted some biocrust communities and will
    likely continue to result in biocrust degradation across ecosystems (Finger-Higgens
    et al., 2022). Detecting and mapping biocrust is essential for monitoring these
    important soil communities in a changing climate. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV)
    of Antarctica, microbial communities are the drivers of carbon cycling, particularly
    in and adjacent to lakes, ponds, and streams where dense microbial mats are abundant
    (Cary et al., 2010; Van Horn et al., 2016; Stone et al., accepted). However, less
    dense microbial communities also occur in drier soils outside the hydrological
    influence of glaciers, stream channels, or lakes in areas where snow or subsurface
    thaw are presumably the main sources of water. In such environments, which constitute
    most of the dry valley landscape, microbial communities are sparse, have high
    soil content, and are better described as biocrusts. Here, we define biocrusts
    as the communities which are present in drier areas away from streams and lakes,
    and although they can be quite similar morphologically to the microbial mats present
    in aquatic areas, biocrusts are typically less dense and patchily distributed
    among the terrestrial landscape where there are alternative sources of moisture,
    e.g., snowpacks and groundwater seeps (Gooseff et al., 2013; Weber et al., 2022).
    Previous studies of MDV microbial mat dynamics have primarily focused on the communities
    occurring close to or within the streams and lakes (e.g., Alger et al., 1997).
    Soil environments outside of stream channels have traditionally been thought to
    support less visible biocrust biomass in comparison, so fewer studies have focused
    on these terrestrial communities. However, these terrestrial areas are far more
    spatially extensive than the aquatic environments in the MDV, and therefore, even
    sparse distributions and densities of biocrusts could sum to a considerable amount
    of total biomass. For example, the Lake Fryxell basin, excluding Lake Fryxell,
    is 53.55 km2, while the cumulative stream area is approximately 2.58 km2 (4.82%),
    determined via satellite imagery. The terrestrial landscape of this region occupies
    more than 20x the surface area relative to ephemeral stream channels and lake
    margins, so although biocrusts are typically less dense than microbial mats, we
    anticipate soils of the MDV contain a considerable amount of carbon in and under
    these biocrusts (e.g., Burkins et al., 2001). We suggest that the terrestrial
    regions of Taylor Valley may contain more cumulative biomass than the stream channels
    given their spatial extent. A systematic and scalable method is required to measure
    and monitor biocrust biomass over large spatial scales: remote sensing. Assessing
    the detectability of biocrusts via remote sensing is a critical first step in
    estimating terrestrial carbon stocks in this region and examining controls over
    the distribution and activity of these soil communities. Our previous research
    has demonstrated the utility of multispectral satellites (e.g., WorldView-2 and
    WorldView-3; WV-2 and WV-3) in detecting densely colonized microbial mats near
    streams in the Lake Fryxell basin region using spectral parameters and spectral
    linear unmixing models (Power et al., 2020; Salvatore, 2015; Salvatore et al.,
    2020, 2021). In addition to the strong photosynthetic signatures identified near
    stream channels and lake margins, we also observed enhanced spectral signatures
    indicative of photosynthetic activity in upland areas not connected to streams
    or lakes (Power et al., 2020). While remote sensing techniques have been demonstrated
    to be effective in regions of dense microbial mats, these techniques have not
    been specifically validated throughout the broader landscape where photosynthetic
    communities are much more dispersed and their resultant signatures are often much
    weaker and discontinuous. Therefore, this work tests the hypothesis that these
    observed spectral signatures outside of stream channels are associated with areas
    of increased soil productivity and not, for example, associated with spectral
    artifacts created by topographic or lithological variations. Our objectives for
    this study are to assess the detectability of biocrust and examine the environments
    in which these unique communities are found in the MDV. By investigating the spatial
    distribution of biocrusts using orbital data, our work contributes in part to
    efforts in refining existing carbon budgets (e.g., Barrett et al., 2006b; Burkins
    et al., 2001), predicting future carbon stocks, and examining controls over the
    distribution and activity of biocrusts in the MDV. Here, we present the first
    assessment of biocrust detectability in the MDV terrestrial landscape using a
    combination of laboratory hyperspectral spectroscopy, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3
    multispectral satellite imagery, and in-situ soil and biocrust surveying and sampling.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description The MDV are the largest contiguous
    ice-free area on the Antarctic continent, with approximately 4500 km2 of exposed
    soil, stream, and lake ecosystems (Levy, 2013). Glacial meltwater during the austral
    summer (i.e., 24 h daylight) feeds streams that flow for an average of 4–9 weeks
    per year (Wlostowski et al., 2016). These streams drain into perennially ice-covered
    lakes along the floor of Taylor Valley. While dense microbial mats (mm – cm thick)
    occupy streams and lake margins (Fig. 1 a), biocrusts occur at lower densities
    as discontinuous mats in intermittently wet soils (Fig. 1 b, c). The microbial
    mats are dominated by cyanobacteria (e.g., Nostoc, Oscillatoria, and Phormidium)
    and also contain chlorophyta (green algae) (Alger et al., 1997), various diatom
    species (Alger et al., 1997), and mosses which can also occur separately from
    microbial mats (Bryum spp. and Hennediella spp.; Pannewitz et al., 2003; Schwarz
    et al., 1992). While studies on biocrust composition in the MDV are lacking, the
    biocrusts here contain cyanobacteria and mosses based on visual identification
    and appear to be dominated by Nostoc specifically. Communities of nematodes, rotifers,
    and tardigrades also inhabit the soils, sediments, and microbial mats of this
    region (Freckman and Virginia, 1997; Simmons et al., 2009a). Though, given the
    relatively low soil invertebrate biomass, grazing influences on microbial mats
    and biocrusts are thought to be minimal, making the MDV a simple system for studying
    biocrust and microbial mat dynamics. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    the McMurdo Sound of the Ross Sea in the east to the Taylor Glacier in the west.
    The eastern portion of Taylor Valley includes a dozen ephemeral glacial meltwater
    streams and Lake Fryxell, which have been the subject of numerous microbial mat
    studies (e.g., Alger et al., 1997; Kohler et al., 2015; McKnight et al., 1998;
    Stanish et al., 2011). Due to proximity to the coast, eastern Taylor Valley also
    has the greatest relative humidity and the most shallow ice-cemented permafrost
    layers in the region, and therefore typically has higher soil water content (Bockheim
    et al., 2008; Doran et al., 2002; Obryk et al., 2020) and richer communities of
    soil invertebrates with greater biomass than other parts of Taylor Valley or neighboring
    Wright Valley (Adams et al., 2006; Barrett et al., 2006c, 2007; Courtright et
    al., 2001; Xue et al., 2023). 2.2. Spectral detection limit experiment We created
    microcosms of biocrust material and bare soil (not containing biocrust) of varying
    percent (0–100%) biocrust by weight (g/g) in the laboratory and characterized
    these materials using hyperspectral reflectance techniques to quantify the potential
    detection limits of our remote sensing methods. The soil was collected from the
    Fryxell basin, and to minimize oversampling of the sensitive dry valley biocrust
    communities, we collected a Nostoc-dominated biocrust from a warm desert environment
    in Arizona, which has a similar spectrum as the dry valley biocrust (Fig. S1).
    Both biocrust spectra contain absorption features at ∼0.68, 1.19, 1.45, 1.78,
    and 1.93 μm, indicating that the major spectral characteristics between both types
    of biocrust are the same and therefore justify this analog material''s appropriateness
    for our laboratory experiment. The biocrust and soil were separately ground into
    a homogenous fine particle size for hyperspectral analysis. This disaggregation
    process allows the biocrust to evenly distribute among the soil particles, and
    from a chemical and pigment perspective, the spectral characteristics of the biocrust
    remain largely unchanged after disaggregating. A known quantity of biocrust was
    mixed with a known quantity of soil to achieve the desired percent biocrust mixtures,
    and the mixtures were placed into a sample holder ∼2.5 cm in diameter and 0.5
    cm in depth. Sample mixtures were moistened with DI water and placed under a halogen
    lamp for several minutes, allowing time for the organisms to reactivate and begin
    photosynthesizing. We targeted a final water content for our wetted samples of
    approximately 0.25 GWC (g H2O/g dry soil and biocrust material). Spectra were
    acquired using an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec4 high-resolution
    hyperspectral reflectance spectrometer set up for use in a stable lab environment.
    Data were collected between 350 and 2500 nm at a 1 nm sampling interval. A halogen
    lamp was used to illuminate the samples at 30° off-nadir and approximately 25
    cm away, while reflectance was measured at nadir using the ASD''s bare fiber optic
    cable roughly 3 cm above the sample surface with a 25° field of view projecting
    a 1.39 cm2 spot size onto our samples. To minimize instrument noise, particularly
    at the longest and shortest wavelengths where the output of the halogen bulb is
    lowest, we averaged 50 individual spectra for each biocrust-soil combination produced
    in the lab. All data were then downsampled to WV-2 and WV-3 spectral resolutions
    for direct comparison to the respective orbital platforms. Linear mixtures of
    pure soil and biocrust spectra were also modeled for comparison to the spectra
    of those known physical mixtures to determine the nature of the observed spectral
    mixing relationship, validating the ability to confidently translate this linear
    unmixing method to orbital data. 2.3. Orbital spectral collection and processing
    Satellite images acquired during austral summers were used to identify photosynthetic
    signatures in upland terrestrial areas. WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 (DigitalGlobe,
    Inc.) are multispectral satellites in polar orbit with 8 multispectral bands at
    1.84 m and 1.24 m nadir resolutions, respectively. Georeferenced data, validated
    using ground control points, were obtained from the University of Minnesota Polar
    Geospatial Center (PGC) through a cooperative agreement between the National Science
    Foundation (NSF) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). These data
    were subsequently processed to atmospherically corrected surface reflectance using
    five spectral ground validation targets acquired in the field during the 2018–2019
    austral summer, following methods from Salvatore et al. (2021). Band-specific
    linear relationships between top-of-atmosphere reflectance data and ground validation
    spectra were applied to the entirety of the satellite images to remove atmospheric
    contributions to the observed signal. These corrected surface reflectance data
    were used in several analyses and compared with ground-based surveys of soil chemical
    and biological properties detailed in the sections below. 2.4. Field site identification
    and in-situ environmental sample collection We used vegetation indices, such as
    the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index parameter (NDVI; Tucker, 1979), to
    target locations of varying photosynthetic activity across the eastern Taylor
    Valley landscape. High NDVI values are typical of photosynthetic vegetation, which
    has a unique spectral signature of absorbance in the visible wavelengths (due
    to the activity of chlorophyll-a and other pigments) and strong reflectance in
    near-infrared regions due to scattering and reflectance of long-wave radiation
    by cell walls. NDVI was calculated using spectral reflectance measurements acquired
    in the near-infrared (WV-2 Band 7, centered at 831 nm; WV-3 centered at 832 nm)
    and red (WV-2 Band 5, centered at 659 nm; WV-3 centered at 661 nm) using the Environment
    for Visualizing Images (ENVI, Harris Geospatial) software package. Thirty locations
    with either consistently high NDVI values, consistently low NDVI values, or variable
    NDVI values were identified in eastern Taylor Valley outside of stream channels
    and lake margins (Fig. 2) using three satellite images: a WV-3 image acquired
    on January 17, 2015 (1040010006846000), a WV-2 image acquired on January 19, 2018
    (1030010077755100), and another WV-2 image acquired on December 11, 2018 (1030010089D13500).
    These 30 locations were selected to represent a range of potential photosynthetic
    activity and topographic features (i.e., slope, aspect, and elevation) characterized
    using an airborne lidar-derived digital elevation model (DEM) at 1 m spatial resolution
    (Fountain et al., 2017). Depressions, rocky outcrops, sloped hills, and flat surfaces
    were all represented in our field locations. Overall, these locations were selected
    to maximize spatial coverage of ranges in photosynthetic activity and topography
    across the landscape. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    Inc. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the
    reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) We sampled, photographed,
    and documented relevant environmental conditions (e.g., evidence of surface moisture,
    presence/absence of microbial mat, moss, or biocrust, presence of snowpacks, surface
    or lithological variations like dominant presence of oxidized granite) at each
    of these 30 locations in December of 2019. We collected a surface layer sample
    of soil or biocrust (if present) and rock from all sites for subsequent hyperspectral
    analysis in the laboratory using the same methods and laboratory set-up as previously
    described in Section 2.2. At 12 of the sites, we established 5 m × 5 m intensive
    sampling plots and collected 5 surface layer soil or biocrust samples 128 cm2
    in area from each corner and center of the plots for pigment analysis (chlorophyll-a,
    scytonemin, and carotenoids) and organic matter content via ash-free dry mass
    (AFDM). We also collected underlying soil down to 10 cm below the surface for
    gravimetric water content (GWC), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, inorganic nitrogen
    (N) concentration in the form of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−), inorganic
    phosphorus (P) concentration in the form of phosphate (PO43−), total organic carbon
    (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and invertebrate abundance (see below). After the
    initial soil chemistry and invertebrate diversity and abundance analyses, samples
    were frozen at −20 °C and transported to Virginia Tech and Northern Arizona University
    for remaining chemical and spectral analyses. 2.5. Analysis of environmental field
    samples We estimated pigment concentration on the surface ∼1 cm layer soil and
    biocrust samples using a trichromatic spectrophotometric method for chlorophyll-a,
    carotenoids, and scytonemin at 663, 490, and 384 nm, respectively (Garcia-Pichel
    and Castenholz, 1991). Throughout the process, care was taken to avoid exposing
    the samples to light. The samples were dried at 105 °C for 24 h, sieved through
    a 4 mm sieve, and extracted for 24 h at ambient temperature in 90% unbuffered
    acetone using a 3.75:10 soil to solvent ratio, based on protocols from Couradeau
    et al. (2016) and the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research Program
    (MCM LTER) standard methods. After centrifugation, the extracts were analyzed
    on a spectrophotometer using 10 mL cuvettes. The absorbances contributed by each
    pigment were calculated using the trichromatic equations outlined in Garcia-Pichel
    and Castenholz (1991), and the pigment concentrations were calculated using the
    Beer-Lambert Law with the extinction coefficients of 89.7 L g−1 cm−1 for chlorophyll-a
    (Couradeau et al., 2016), 112.6 L g−1 cm−1 for scytonemin (Brenowitz and Castenholz,
    1997), and 262 L g−1 cm−1 for carotenoids (Thrane et al., 2015). Additionally,
    the surface layer soil and biocrust samples were measured for AFDM by weighing
    a known area of sample, combusting at 550 °C for 24 h using a muffle furnace,
    gently stirring samples halfway through combustion, and reweighing after cooling
    in a desiccator. Given the very low clay content of soils in this region (Barrett
    et al., 2006a), the rehydration of clays was assumed negligible, so we did not
    rewet samples. Using the underlying 1–10 cm soil, we measured pH and electrical
    conductivity using a 1:2 and 1:5 soil to DI H2O slurry with pH and conductivity
    probes, respectively (Barrett et al., 2004), and we measured gravimetric water
    content by mass lost after oven drying at 105 °C for 24 h. We also extracted inorganic
    N (NH4+ and NO3−) in 2 M potassium chloride and inorganic P (PO43−) in 0.5 M sodium
    bicarbonate; inorganic N and P were measured on extracts using a Lachat QuikChem
    flow injection analyzer (Keeney and Nelson, 1982; Olsen and Sommers, 1982; Knepel,
    2003; Prokopy, 1995). Additionally, we measured TOC and TN using an Elementar
    Vario MAX Cube analyzer after fumigating samples with concentrated hydrochloric
    acid to remove the influence of carbonates on TOC values (Ramnarine et al., 2011;
    Walthert et al., 2010; Fritsen et al., 2000). Invertebrate abundance was enumerated
    using inverted light microscopy on soil solutions using a modified sugar-centrifugation
    extraction procedure described by Freckman and Virginia (1993). Nematode abundance
    is reported as the total number of live Scottnema, Eudorylaimus, and Plectus individuals,
    and total live rotifers and tardigrades per kg dry mass soil. Using R Statistical
    Software version 4.0.3 (R Core Team, 2017), a PCA on correlation was executed
    to visually compare plots in terms of their physicochemical properties. A MANOVA
    was performed to statistically assess whether there is a significant difference
    between the three plot types (biocrust, oxidized granite, soil) using physicochemical
    variables. An ANOVA was performed next to assess which, if any, physicochemical
    variables are significantly different between the plot types. 2.6. Vegetation
    index analysis using orbital data To examine variations in photosynthetic activity
    across our sampled locations in eastern Taylor Valley, we applied several vegetation
    indices to orbital data. The primary WV-2 image used in this analysis (103001009FA0AE00)
    was acquired on December 3, 2019, approximately three weeks before our field sampling
    campaign. In addition to NDVI, we also calculated the Simple Ratio Index (SR),
    the Red-Edge Simple Ratio Index (SRre), and the Normalized Pigment Chlorophyll
    Index (NPCI). SR and NPCI are effective in detecting dry biocrust communities
    from other arid regions (e.g., the Colorado Plateau) with a portable spectroradiometer
    (Young and Reed, 2017). SR was calculated using the NIR and red bands, SRre was
    calculated using the NIR and red-edge bands, and NPCI was calculated using the
    red and coastal bands. Each of the parameter values were extracted from the four
    pixels centered at each of the plot locations, based on handheld GPS coordinates
    taken during sampling and visually confirming plot location via nearby boulders,
    snowpacks, etc. These values were averaged to estimate an average NDVI, SR, SRre,
    and NPCI value for each of the plots. Average reflectance values for each of the
    eight WV-2 bands were calculated for each plot as well. Using R Statistical Software
    version 4.0.3 (R Core Team, 2017), a correlation matrix was constructed with the
    vegetation indices and raw bands to investigate any significant relationships
    between these primary remote sensing data and biological parameters collected
    in-situ (AFDM and pigment concentration). A principal components analysis (PCA)
    on covariance was executed to visually compare plots in terms of their orbital
    reflectance spectra (raw bands B1 – B8). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
    was performed to statistically assess whether there is a significant difference
    between the three plot types (biocrust, oxidized granite, soil) using the multispectral
    bands. A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed next to assess
    which, if any, spectral bands and vegetation indices (NDVI, SR, SRre, NPCI) are
    significantly different between the plot types. Plot 11 and plot 21 were excluded
    from these three statistical analyses because they were covered in snow and therefore
    their reflectance data skewed the analyses. 2.7. Spectral linear unmixing of orbital
    data Spectral linear unmixing was used to model the spectral contribution of individual
    surface types, and therefore calculate the fractional abundance of each surface
    type per pixel (Lawson and Hanson, 1974; Adams et al., 1993; Ramsey and Christensen,
    1998; Bioucas-Dias et al., 2012; Salvatore et al., 2020). Spectral unmixing uses
    a library of ‘pure’ spectral endmembers of each surface type to train the model
    by matching the measured spectral signature, while reducing the misfit between
    the measured and modeled spectra. Endmembers are limited to the number of spectral
    bands and degrees of freedom in the data that are being unmixed; therefore, we
    were constrained to eight or fewer endmembers for unmixing using the WV-2 and
    WV-3 satellites (Adams et al., 1993; Ramsey and Christensen, 1998). Our seven
    hyperspectral endmembers were derived through collection in the field, collection
    after laboratory preparation, or were modeled from field experiments. Six of these
    endmembers (black microbial mat, orange microbial mat #1 and #2, water, moss,
    and soil) were previously used in this region and are described in detail in Salvatore
    et al. (2021), and one additional endmember (an orange oxidized granite) was added
    for an updated emphasis on the terrestrial landscape and was collected during
    our field campaign and subsequently measured in the laboratory. This granite endmember
    is from a minor subunit of the broader Granite Harbour Intrusive Complex that
    outcrops near the top walls of Taylor Valley (Cox et al., 2012). X-ray diffraction
    confirmed the dominance of quartz (∼30%), plagioclase feldspar (∼25%), alkali
    feldspar (∼25%), and mafic and other ancillary phases (∼20%), while VNIR reflectance
    spectroscopy indicated a crystalline Fe-oxide phase, likely goethite or hematite,
    at orbitally relevant wavelengths. As a result of these analyses, we refer to
    this endmember as “oxidized granite.” All seven spectra were downsampled to WV-2
    and WV-3 resolutions to create a spectral library that was used to unmix the entirety
    of each orbital image. Snow and ice were not included as spectral endmembers despite
    their pervasiveness across the landscape, because both snow and ice are known
    to exhibit significant VNIR spectral variability. For example, variations in snow
    crystallinity, grain size, liquid water content, and impurity content all have
    significant spectral influences (Warren, 1982). Instead, snow was identified in
    unmixed images using a combination of both high root-mean-square errors (RMSE)
    and high VNIR albedo. Linear unmixing is less commonly used in the visible or
    near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum in more vertical ecosystems
    where multiple scattering can be significant, (i.e. between vegetation canopy
    layers). Here, however, we assume minimal spectral contributions from volumetric
    scattering with depth in the largely barren surface environments of the MDV where
    linear unmixing has been demonstrated successfully (Salvatore et al., 2020, 2021).
    Because of these assumptions and their demonstrated effectiveness in the past,
    we have selected linear unmixing as an appropriate method for this study (Peddle
    et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 1993; Salvatore et al., 2020, 2021). An ‘early season’
    December 21, 2021 WV-2 image (10300100CB9F3900) and a ‘late season’ January 21,
    2015 WV-2 image (103001003ED2B400) were the primary images used in this unmixing
    analysis to capture potential seasonal variation in the spectral signatures of
    biocrusts and soils. The DaVinci software package was used to run the unmixing
    model, using our seven spectral endmembers to linearly derive the areal abundance
    of these different surface components. The results include percent surface abundance
    as well as RMSE, which provides a measure of the goodness of fit between the input
    spectrum and the modeled spectrum. Abundance estimates from each of the endmembers
    were extracted from the 30 plot locations, incorporating a buffer to confidently
    capture the plot area (25 pixels per plot). RMSE were analyzed for each pixel-level
    abundance estimate, commonly ranging between ∼0.1% to below 0.4%. However, certain
    pixels contained high RMSE and were attributed to being covered in snow, as verified
    by examining albedo estimates and the true-color WV-2 images. To account for the
    uncertainty imposed by snow in these areas, we filtered the abundance data by
    applying a threshold of RMSE >0.5%. Any pixels that contained RMSE >0.5% were
    removed from the analysis. To qualitatively and quantitatively assess the unmixing
    model output for an early season and late season image, we selected 15 plots to
    examine abundances of the different surface types. These plots were visually categorized
    in the field as having either biocrust/incipient biocrust, soil, or oxidized granite
    (i.e., 5 biocrust/incipient biocrust, 5 soil, and 5 oxidized granite plots). The
    orange microbial mat #1 and #2 endmember abundances were aggregated into a single
    orange mat group abundance, and we combined the soil endmember and water endmember
    abundances together as ‘other abiotic’ abundance. We compared our field measurements
    to our modeled total biocrust abundance, which was calculated as the sum of modeled
    black microbial mat, orange microbial mat, and moss abundance estimates for each
    pixel. While it is unlikely for all three of these microbial mat communities to
    co-occur in the environments we assessed outside of stream channels (Alger et
    al., 1997), summing all biological endmembers to create a “total biocrust abundance”
    parameter provides a quantitative assessment of the spectral contributions of
    photosynthetic pigments and the reflective structure of living cells. Therefore,
    this parameter is effective for the purposes of distinguishing surfaces where
    photosynthetic signatures are present, and our efforts will help to quantify our
    abilities to derive the abundances of these communities remotely. 2.8. Albedo
    analysis of orbital data We selected 13 cloud-free WorldView images acquired between
    2009 and 2019 (six images acquired in December and seven images acquired in January)
    (Table S1) to determine how the landscape''s albedo changes from the ‘early season’
    to the ‘late season’ and to therefore examine the potential presence of ephemeral
    snowpacks in the vicinity of our study plots, which based upon our field surveys
    were often associated with visible biocrust communities. Moreover, the presence
    of snowpack can mask surface soil features, so it was necessary for our analyses
    to characterize snowpacks in the vicinity of our plots. The mean and standard
    deviation of each pixel in these suites of early and late season images can provide
    important information related to surface landscape features. For example, brightening
    of surfaces indicates the presence of salts or snow on the surface, while darkening
    typically indicates increased soil moisture. We assume that topographic variations
    resulting in variations in shadows are negligible on the valley floor for the
    purposes of this exercise. We predict that surfaces dominated by abiotic materials
    (granite and soil) will experience less variability in albedo over time than areas
    exhibiting increased photosynthetic and/or hydrological activity. After stacking
    the December and the January images, the average albedo and albedo standard deviation
    (SD) were calculated for each of the 25 pixels surrounding each plot''s center.
    Plot-level average and SD albedo were then calculated for December and January,
    separately. These data were plotted against one another and visualized based on
    identified surface type (biocrust, granite, soil) to analyze any associations
    with albedo and seasonality. 3. Results 3.1. Laboratory spectral validation study
    Hyperspectral measurements of the soil biocrust microcosms exhibited significant
    chlorophyll absorption features at ∼0.68 μm for all mixtures containing biocrust
    (Fig. 3), including the lowest abundance sample of 1% biocrust by weight (g/g).
    Lab measurements of the two extreme spectra (100% soil and 100% biocrust) were
    downsampled to WorldView resolution to compare with the resolution of the orbital
    data available for the field plots and were used to unmix spectra of actual biocrust
    mixtures measured in the lab. There was a strong linear fit between the modeled
    and measured biocrust abundance with an R2 of 0.99 and p-value <0.001 (Fig. 4).
    Mixtures of biocrust and soil combine linearly in VNIR spectral space in these
    ideal conditions, demonstrating how linear unmixing models can successfully predict

    mixtures of soil and biocrust. 3.2. Field surveys and spectral analyses We found
    that many of the high or variable NDVI locations occurred in areas near snowpacks
    and in the lee of hills or in depressions (i.e., nivation hollows; Eveland et
    al., 2013), where biocrust cover over desert pavement was visually evident. One
    location in particular had visibly wet soils and dense biocrusts, plot 09 (Fig.
    5 a, d, g). Percent coverage of up to 47% biocrust and average surface AFDM of
    280 g m−2 of biocrust in plot 09 is similar to the lower range of densities reported
    for microbial mats on riparian sediments adjacent to nearby stream channels (Alger
    et al., 1997; Power et al., 2020; Salvatore et al., 2021). In contrast, several
    plots were extremely dry with no visible biocrust but had oxidized granite boulders
    and relatively high NDVI from orbital data (Fig. 5 b, e, h). Hyperspectral VNIR
    measurements collected from the field plot samples exhibited clear spectral differences
    between plots with visible presence of biocrust, granite boulders, and typical
    desert pavement soil (Fig. 5 j, k, l). Additionally, some plots were visually
    characterized as having sparse, incipient biocrust with weak but significant chlorophyll
    absorptions (e.g., P04, P11; Fig. 6). We ranked each plot on biocrust presence
    as “not present”, “possibly present”, “likely present”, and “present” based entirely
    on visual observations in the field, finding that plots where biocrust was present
    or was likely present had overall higher NDVI values using the hyperspectral VNIR
    measurements (Fig. 7). Plots that were dominated by oxidized granite also had
    relatively high NDVI but lacked visible biocrust. The densest biocrust plot and
    the granite boulder plots had relatively high NDVI based on the hyperspectral
    data as well; however, the shapes of their spectral signatures are very different
    (e.g., biocrust plot 09 and oxidized granite plot 20; Fig. 5 j, k; Fig. S2). Download

    B8), plot types are significantly differentiated using multispectral band data
    (MANOVA, p-value = 0.048) (Fig. 8). Notably, the plots with oxidized granite are
    spectrally dissimilar from the biocrust and soil plots when all eight bands are
    used. It is also possible to distinguish among plot types using common vegetation
    indices (ANOVA; NDVI p-value <0.001; SR p-value <0.001; SRre p-value <0.01; NPCI
    p-value <0.01). Particularly, oxidized granite plots have significantly higher
    values for all vegetation indices compared to the biocrust and soil plots. In
    a correlation matrix between the vegetation indices, raw reflectance bands, and
    biological parameters (AFDM, chlorophyll, and scytonemin concentration), there
    are no significant relationships between these primary remote sensing data and
    biological parameters (Table S2). Download : Download high-res image (225KB) Download

    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the Web version of this article.) 3.3. Soil characterization There
    was significant variation in pigments, organic matter, invertebrate populations,
    (Table 1) and in other physical and chemical variables (Table 2) among the plots.
    Notably, plot 09, with dense biocrust, had the highest abundances and diversity
    of soil invertebrates, hosting three nematode taxa (Scottnema, Eudorylaimus, and
    Plectus) in addition to tardigrades, rotifers, and ciliates, similar to the community
    composition found in soils near streams (Ayres et al., 2007; Simmons et al., 2009a;
    Treonis et al., 1999). While Scottnema was present in relatively high abundances
    throughout most plots (as has been previously reported for this area of Taylor
    Valley; Courtright et al., 2001), there were several plots (P22, 30, 31) without
    any invertebrates present where distinct soil chemistry (pH, nitrate, and electrical
    conductivity) likely created inhospitable conditions (e.g., Barrett et al., 2004;
    Poage et al., 2008). The majority of samples had NH4+ concentration below detection
    except for plots 01, 09, 10, 22, 31, 33. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen
    concentrations were higher than average compared to soils in this part of Taylor
    Valley (Barrett et al., 2006b, 2007) and may reflect the influence of moderate
    to dense biocrusts found in our most productive plots (Table 2). Importantly,
    dense biocrust plot 09 had the lowest electrical conductivity (indicator of soils
    that are regularly flushed by water), a more neutral pH, and a relatively higher
    concentration of ammonium, NH4+, (indicative of active microbial decomposition).
    Moreover, plot 09 had more than 5x the AFDM of the other plots on average. In
    a PCA on correlation, plot types are not significantly distinguished by physicochemical
    properties (MANOVA, p-value = 0.56) (Fig. S3). However, NH4+ availability is significantly
    different among the plot types (ANOVA, p-value = 0.044) with dense biocrust most
    associated with increasing NH4+ availability. Table 1. Biological variables averaged

    analysis of an early season (Dec 21, 2021) and late season (Jan 21, 2015) image
    demonstrated consistency in surface cover estimates between the two images (Table
    3). RMSE were relatively low except for areas that were snow covered (i.e., also
    displayed high albedo values). Notably, these snowy areas often coincided with
    plots that were identified in the field as either having biocrust present or likely
    present (incipient biocrust). Half of locations with biocrust or incipient biocrust
    (n = 4 of 8) were snow covered during the early season image. The remaining locations
    with biocrust and incipient biocrust were all within 15–35 m of snowpacks, measured
    from the center of the plots. Among the remaining 22 plots identified as biocrust
    not present or possibly present, only 3 plots contained some pixels with RMSE
    >0.5%. One of these plots contained some snow cover and lacked visible biocrust
    (P33), while the other two plots did not contain snow cover in the immediate area
    (P29, 30). Table 3 includes a subset of our 30 plots documenting the consistency
    of surface cover types between our two analyzed images, and also demonstrates

    biocrust cover and early season snowpack, the mean albedo and albedo SD were calculated
    for all plots among several December and January images (Fig. 9). Locations that
    contained snow cover had greater mean albedo, primarily early in the season when
    snowpacks are most present, and greater albedo SD between images based on the
    seasonality of snow and surface soil moisture. All of the plots that contained
    visually conspicuous biocrust cover had higher mean albedo and albedo SD than
    typical soil or oxidized granite plots. While not all of our biocrust identified
    plots were associated with variations in snow cover within the immediate area
    of the plots (note that biocrust can obtain moisture from groundwater seeps or
    melting subsurface ice as well), we do find that the brightest and most variable
    surfaces in our study area are all biocrust identified areas (Fig. 9). Download

    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the Web version of this article.) 4. Discussion 4.1. Laboratory
    spectral detection of biocrust Our laboratory spectral validation study demonstrated
    that biocrust present in soil microcosms is detectable at abundances as low as
    1% by weight, and that spectral linear unmixing models can be used to successfully
    predict biocrust abundance. The absorption feature associated with photosynthetic
    pigments (∼0.68 μm) is present in all biocrust microcosm mixtures, including the
    1% biocrust microcosm where the feature is observable as well (Fig. 3). When comparing
    the modeled biocrust abundance of each sample mixture to the actual measured biocrust
    abundance, there is a strong linear fit between the modeled and measured abundance
    with an R2 of 0.99 (Fig. 4). We have shown how, under ideal conditions, mixtures
    of biocrust and soil combine linearly in VNIR spectral space, allowing for linear
    unmixing models to accurately predict biocrust abundance. This detection method
    is successful over a range of abundances analogous to dense microbial mat communities
    associated with productive aquatic habitats (Power et al., 2020; Salvatore et
    al., 2021) and sparse biocrusts in the more typical arid soils of the MDV. Despite
    the known complexities associated with extrapolating these results to field and
    orbital data (e.g., atmospheric contributions, variations in biotic and abiotic
    surface composition and moisture), the relationships derived in our laboratory
    analyses are successful in identifying and quantifying biocrust and can be modeled
    to approximate the distribution of microbial communities in the MDV. 4.2. Oxidized
    granite impedes use of vegetation indices It was evident during our field surveying
    and sampling campaign that geological features are a significant factor in the
    detection of low density biocrusts in dry terrestrial environments. While the
    soils and dominant lithologies of the MDV have been widely characterized by previous
    investigators (e.g., Bockheim et al., 2008), isolated outcrops or boulders of
    distinct composition have been shown to locally influence observed spectral signatures.
    For example, during our field campaign, several plots with high NDVI values were
    found to be predominantly covered by oxidized granitic boulders (Fig. 5 e, h).
    Despite their high NDVI values, these oxidized granite plots lack visible biocrust
    presence based on visual observation in the field (Fig. 7) and had low AFDM and
    chlorophyll contents (Table 1), indicating that these relatively high NDVI values
    are not associated with photosynthesis. The hyperspectral data of the surface
    samples of all plots illustrated clear distinctions among the plots (Fig. 6).
    For example, plots 20 and 29 were located within oxidized granite boulder fields
    and exhibit two broad absorption features associated with the presence of ferrous
    and ferric iron (Fe), centered near 0.67 μm and 0.94 μm, and resulting in a broad
    reflectance peak at approximately 0.74 μm (Fig. 5 k; Fig. S2). While the hyperspectral
    shape of these granitic spectra is distinct from those of biocrust, NDVI does
    not effectively distinguish between them due to the granitic spectra containing
    an Fe-absorption feature at red wavelengths and thus an increase in reflectance
    in the NIR (Fig. S2). This change in reflectance creates a slope that causes these
    granitic areas to have a high NDVI, despite not being correlated to indicators
    of photosynthetic activity (e.g., chlorophyll or AFDM). While hyperspectral reflectance
    data can be used to distinguish these abiotic absorption features from those associated
    with biological activity, simple multispectral parameters (e.g., NDVI) are less
    capable of distinguishing between these different compositions and are therefore
    less reliable at detecting biocrust presence. 4.3. Biocrust distribution is associated
    with seasonal snowpacks In contrast to soils with oxidized granites, several locations
    contained sparse, incipient biocrust, where it appeared that cyanobacteria colonies
    and potentially moss were emerging from wet desert pavement (Fig. 1 c). The locations
    identified as having biocrust present or likely present had relatively higher
    NDVI compared to the desert pavement locations not containing biocrust and which
    upon analyses were shown to have low chlorophyll concentrations and AFDM. Of particular
    interest, plot 09 hosted dense biocrust (Fig. 5 d, g) and diverse soil fauna (Table
    1), similar in composition to the diversity found near stream and lake ecosystems
    (Ayres et al., 2007; Treonis et al., 1999). Plot 09 is outside of any stream channel
    or water track and is ∼700 m above the current elevation of Lake Fryxell. The
    only visible source of liquid water for plot 09 are a series of snowpacks immediately
    uphill and ∼10 and 50 m uphill (at the time of sampling and visible in multiple
    satellite images). While diverse invertebrate communities are common near aquatic
    environments in the Fryxell basin (Courtright et al., 2001; Freckman and Virginia,
    1997), they have not been commonly reported for upland soils outside stream channels.
    One well-documented landscape that exhibits similar biotic diversity to plot 09
    is the Wormherder Creek wetland in western Taylor Valley on the south side of
    the west lobe of Lake Bonney (Harris et al., 2007; Simmons et al., 2009b; Nielsen
    et al., 2012). Unlike the soil biocrusts documented here (e.g., plot 09), which
    are fed by the melt of relatively small snowpacks (<60 m in diameter), the Wormherder
    Creek wetland is fed intermittently by the melt of large snowpacks on the southern
    valley wall which create melt-water drainages that have contributed to saturated
    soils and overland flow on at least 3 documented occasions (sufficiently warm
    and sunny summers) in the last thirty years (Lyons et al., 2005; Nielsen et al.,
    2012; Wlostowski et al., 2019; Stanish et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2007). Abundant
    microbial mats hosting diatom and invertebrate communities have been described
    in Wormherder Creek (Nielsen et al., 2012; Stanish et al., 2012; Simmons et al.,
    2009b). Both these snowpack-fed meltwater environments are examples of biological
    hotspots in an otherwise arid terrestrial landscape physically separated from
    the diverse communities within the annual ephemeral streams. These snowpack-fed
    biological hotspots are distinct from the water track features described by Levy
    et al. (2011), which are narrow areas of subsurface hydrologic flow that route
    water downslope through soils above the ice table and lack overland flow. Water
    tracks are more saline in comparison to the surrounding landscape and therefore
    do not host conspicuous surface biocrust, microbial mats, or invertebrate communities
    (Kuentz et al., 2022; Levy et al., 2011, 2014). Therefore, biological activity
    in these snowpack areas is not driven solely by the presence of liquid water,
    but also suitable soil conditions as well. A continuum of hydrological conditions
    exists: the arid terrestrial landscape, hypersaline water tracks, snowpack-fed
    microhabitats, snowpack-fed non-annual ephemeral wetlands, annual ephemeral streams,
    and lakes (Table 4). Plot 09 is compositionally and chemically more similar to
    near-stream environments than to the persistently dry and low organic matter soils
    that characterize most of this arid terrestrial landscape (Burkins et al., 2001;
    Barrett et al., 2006a). For example, plot 09 is wetter and less alkaline than
    the other soil plots with low or no biocrusts, which are representative of the
    arid soils described by Barrett et al. (2006a) and Campbell et al. (1998) (Table
    2). Plot 09 also has the lowest electrical conductivity, which is an indicator
    that soils are regularly flushed by water, and it has a relatively higher concentration
    of ammonium, NH4+, typical for biologically active soils with active turnover
    of organic matter (Barrett et al., 2009). Additionally, the concentration of soil
    organic C in this plot is more than 2x greater on average than previous reports
    for arid soils in Taylor Valley (Barrett et al., 2006b; Burkins et al., 2001)
    and closer to the concentrations of C in near-stream and lake sediments (Barrett
    et al., 2009). Moreover, the mass of carbon in the biocrust itself is 2–3x greater
    than that in the underlying surface soils (Burkins et al., 2001), indicating the
    importance of including biocrust estimates in regional carbon mass balances. Rather
    than viewing this landscape as simply aquatic or terrestrial units, a continuum
    of hydrological conditions exists, and these snowpack-fed landscapes constitute
    a unique component of the soil-sediment environment. Elucidating the factors contributing
    to the structure and function of these snowpack-associated environments is essential
    for refining our understanding of species distribution and organic C balance in
    the MDV. Table 4. Continuum of hydrological conditions in Taylor Valley, Antarctica.

    There are inherent limitations to multispectral data when they are used for detecting
    surfaces that are spectrally weaker and discontinuous, such as patchy biocrusts.
    When investigating our intensively sampled plots which had in-situ biological
    data collected (i.e., AFDM, pigment content), there were no significant correlations
    between the biological parameters and multispectral vegetation indices and raw
    bands (Table S2). There were some correlations (e.g., with B1, R ∼ 0.73; and with
    B2, R ∼ 0.64) that were driven by plot 09 with orders of magnitude higher AFDM
    and pigment concentration, but all significant correlations were lost when removing
    this dominant plot. Solely using these traditional multispectral indices is inadequate
    for identifying patchy biocrust surfaces, specifically in areas with spectrally
    dominant surface geology, such as the MDV. Hyperspectral reflectance measurements
    were essential in this study to understand the spectral complexities of our surface
    types. For example, plot 09 contained the most visibly dense biocrust in our field
    campaign and was spectrally unique with the highest NDVI measured from hyperspectral
    data in the laboratory (Fig. 6). However, it did not always have the highest satellite-derived
    NDVI as expected; the oxidized granite areas sometimes had higher NDVI across
    images. This demonstrates the differences in spectral resolution between a hyperspectral
    reflectance spectrometer and a multispectral satellite, and also the differences
    in surface area of larger granitic surfaces compared to patchy biocrust surfaces
    when using satellite data. Additionally, this difference in plot 09 NDVI from
    hyperspectral laboratory measurements to multispectral orbital data could also
    in part be the result of fluctuating biological activity through time. For example,
    a 2019 WorldView-3 image shows higher NDVI at this location in January when the
    snow generally melts, the surrounding soils are moist, and the biocrust communities
    are likely active (Fig. 5 a). Barták et al. (2016) and Trnková and Barták (2017)
    both demonstrate the relationship between water content in black microbial mats,
    their photosynthetic activity, and their resultant spectral signatures. Their
    results indicate that there is a reduction in NDVI by roughly 50% from maximum
    photosynthetic signatures at roughly 55% relative water content (RWC) to complete
    desiccation at 0% RWC. These and other authors (e.g., Salvatore et al., 2021)
    also note how burial by windblown sand can significantly mask the spectral signatures
    of dry mats and biocrusts. Together, these studies and our results demonstrate
    there are many factors that can influence the observed NDVI signature at multispectral
    resolutions beyond simply the abundance of photosynthetic biomass, and hyperspectral
    data were necessary to elucidate these interactions. However, incorporating all
    multispectral bands makes it possible to differentiate between the three plot
    types here (Fig. 8). The gradient of plots from bare soil to denser biocrust along
    the raw WV-2 band reflectance vectors informs a detection threshold for biocrust
    around 47% cover or 280 g m−2 AFDM (plot 09). The oxidized granite plots are most
    spectrally dissimilar from the biocrust and soil plots. When using the vegetation
    indices calculated from the multispectral data, it is also possible to statistically
    distinguish among plot types. Though, the plots with the highest vegetation index
    values are those with the oxidized granite surfaces. It is evident through our
    analyses that surface geology in this environment can result in higher NDVI values,
    which is not indicative of biological activity, but are instead spectrally dominant
    areas in the wavelengths typically diagnostic for photosynthesis. Although hyperspectral
    data in the laboratory show that biocrust is identifiable and distinct from oxidized
    granite surfaces and typical soil surfaces, we are currently limited to multispectral
    resolution with available satellite data. While vegetation indices are also limited
    in the number of bands they incorporate and are shown here to be affected by surface
    geology, incorporating all eight multispectral bands proves useful in distinguishing
    biologically active surfaces. It is of particular importance to note that the
    overall success of our analyses was dependent on our ability to ground truth,
    which allows us to confidently link spectral data to what we saw and measured
    with boots on the ground. 4.5. Spectral linear unmixing models predict biocrust
    abundance Moving beyond traditional remote sensing indices, we applied spectral
    linear unmixing models to WV-2 orbital data using spectral endmembers collected
    from the field with a hyperspectral reflectance spectrometer, including an oxidized
    granite endmember (Table 3). The low RMSE associated with the unmixing of all
    surface types discussed here demonstrates that there are no clearly omitted spectral
    endmembers. Although our hyperspectral measurements outperform multispectral data
    in terms of biological detection, we are limited to multispectral bands with available
    satellite imagery. However, using multispectral orbital data, our results demonstrate
    how linear unmixing models perform better than vegetation indices, because they
    use all eight multispectral bands as opposed to only a few select bands. Specifically,
    there are clear spectral differences between oxidized granites and photosynthetic
    biocrust when all eight spectral bands are investigated, but these differences
    are lost when using vegetation parameters like NDVI. While some endmembers are
    less spectrally unique at multispectral resolutions in comparison to hyperspectral
    and can confuse the unmixing models at times, these models are still a far improvement
    over simple vegetation indices in detecting low density biocrusts and can be used
    to infer ecologically relevant properties of biocrust in this region. Most notably,
    our unmixing analyses with RMSE indicate that plots containing biocrust were all
    either snow covered or within 15–35 m of snowpacks during an early season (Dec
    21, 2021) WorldView-2 image (Table 3). This result suggests snowpacks are important
    sources of moisture sustaining biocrust community microhabitats in an otherwise
    arid terrestrial landscape, and therefore encourages further investigation. 4.6.
    Snowpacks as microhabitats for biocrusts and diverse soil communities To identify
    associations between biocrust cover and early season snowpack, we visualized the
    mean albedo and albedo SD for all plots based on surface type among several December
    and January images (Table S1). We found that the brightest and most variable surface
    areas, where snow is present, were areas that were identified as biocrust visually
    in the field (Fig. 9). There are biocrust areas that have lower mean and SD albedo
    and are likely associated with other sources of moisture, like groundwater seeps
    or snow, which accumulates to a much lesser extent and melts earlier in the season.
    Among our plots, the highest and most variable albedo surfaces are associated
    with biocrust presence, indicating that these MDV biocrust habitats are likely
    associated with areas where snow accumulates early in the season, slowly melts
    later in the season, and supplies soil communities and biocrusts with sufficient
    moisture to sustain biological activity throughout the austral summers. Snow is
    an important surface component of the Taylor Valley. Seasonal snow accumulates
    more on the eastern portion of the Taylor Valley closer to the coast (Eveland
    et al., 2012, 2013; Fountain et al., 2010). The Fryxell basin, where our study
    region is located, receives the greatest annual snowfall and has the highest interannual
    variability of snowfall within Taylor Valley (Myers et al., 2022). The Fryxell
    basin region received an average of 11.5 mm wet equivalent of snow accumulation
    from 1995 to 2017 between the months of August and May (Myers et al., 2022). While
    the magnitude of snowfall and snow accumulation is dependent on the variability
    of the frequency and intensity of storms and winds, snow is expected to collect
    in the same locations inter-annually because snow accumulation is most associated
    with variation in fine-scale topography (Eveland et al., 2012, 2013). Seasonal
    snow accumulates across a large portion of the Fryxell basin region. For example,
    prior research has shown accumulation covering an area of 10.29 km2 (17.83% of
    the Fryxell basin delineated region) in late October of 2009 (Eveland et al.,
    2012). By mid-January of 2010, 93% of the snow accumulation was lost (Eveland
    et al., 2012), primarily due to sublimation given the arid environment but also
    due to snowmelt. For example, Gooseff et al. (2003) and Ayres et al. (2010) observed
    increases in soil moisture near snowpacks compared to the nearby dry soils. Eveland
    et al. (2012) also suggest that volumes of water that usually seem insignificant
    to some ecosystems may be an important driver in structuring communities below
    snow in highly water-limited environments such as the MDV. Snow cover has also
    been shown to reduce temperature extremes in underlying soil and influence biogeochemical
    cycling and microbial activity in soils generally (Schimel et al., 2004; Van Horn
    et al., 2013). Furthermore, we suggest that snowpacks commonly occurring throughout
    eastern Taylor Valley provide enough moisture for the development of biocrusts
    and underlying soil communities and likely create suitable microhabitats shielded
    from temperature extremes and intense UV-radiation. Given the broader spatial
    extent of the terrestrial landscape outside of stream channels and lake margins
    and the abundance of snowpacks, we anticipate that a considerable proportion of
    the valley-wide carbon budget is represented by biocrust communities. To refine
    the Taylor Valley carbon budget, future field work should incorporate more sampling
    and surveying of these snowpack areas to document the influence of snowpack variability
    on the dynamics of biocrust and soil microbial communities in the MDV. Given the
    strong interannual variability of snowfall and snow persistence in the Taylor
    Valley (Myers et al., 2022), the documented occurrence of anomalous weather events
    (Barrett et al., in review), and the prediction that Antarctic coasts will experience
    more frequent and intense rainfall by the end of the century (Vignon et al., 2021),
    we encourage continued research on these biocrust microhabitats in this currently
    water-limited but increasingly dynamic landscape. 5. Conclusion Here, we show
    that low density biocrusts are patchily distributed throughout the eastern Taylor
    Valley region in upland areas away from streams and lake margins. Seasonal snowpacks
    create microhabitats for these biocrust communities to successfully thrive in
    this otherwise harsh, desert environment. Soils beneath these biocrusts can support
    diverse soil fauna, similar in community composition to soils immediately beside
    streams and lake margins. A continuum exists between aquatic and terrestrial environments
    where microhabitats are driven by snowpacks physically separate from streams that
    otherwise have ecosystem properties and biological diversity more similar to the
    local streams than the nearby arid soils. We suggest that these snowpack-fed microhabitats
    are unique ecosystems and a key ecological component to the region''s carbon budget.
    Moreover, our work to study these microhabitats in further detail is ongoing (e.g.,
    Power et al., in prep), and we encourage other efforts as well. Ground truthing
    is essential for detecting and mapping biocrust. Although geological surface composition
    can impede use of NDVI on soils, spectral linear unmixing methods are a practical
    alternative for successful biocrust detection. Our modeling efforts are currently
    the foundation of follow-up studies where further validation efforts in the field
    are needed to extrapolate the model and test our hypotheses about hydrological
    transitions and their influence on photoautotrophic communities. This work brings
    us closer in our efforts to refine the carbon budget for this region and to examine
    the controls over the distribution and activity of these critical soil communities.
    These remote sensing technologies are ideal for measuring ecosystem dynamics in
    Antarctic ecosystems, which are particularly climate-sensitive and difficult to
    access. Funding This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)

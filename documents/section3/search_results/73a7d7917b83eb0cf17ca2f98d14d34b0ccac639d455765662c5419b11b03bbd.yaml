    Abstract Authors Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Countries are collaborating
    to make agriculture more efficient by combining new technologies to improve its
    procedure. Improving irrigation efficiency in agriculture is thus critical for
    the survival of sustainable agricultural production. Smart irrigation methods
    can enhance irrigation efficiency, specially with the introduction of wireless
    communication systems, monitoring devices, and enhanced control techniques for
    efficient irrigation scheduling. The study compared on a wide range of study subjects
    to investigate scientific approaches for smart irrigation. As a result, this project
    included a wide range of topics related to irrigation methods, decision-making,
    and technology used. Information was gathered from a variety of scientific papers.
    So, our research relied on several published documents, the majority of which
    were published during the last four years, and authors from all over the world.
    In the meantime, various irrigation initiatives were given special attention.
    Following that, the evaluation focuses on the key components of smart irrigation,
    such as real-time irrigation scheduling, IoT, the importance of an internet connection,
    smart sensing, and energy harvesting. Published in: IEEE Access ( Early Access

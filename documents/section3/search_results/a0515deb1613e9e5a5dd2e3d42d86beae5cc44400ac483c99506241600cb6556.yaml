    twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled through
    data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling,
    and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics
    solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management
    tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to
    reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications.
    Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system,
    avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital
    twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical
    intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary
    systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary
    modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies
    and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling
    perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges
    and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various
    stakeholders. A working digital twin of an offshore oil platform. Screenshot from

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\
    \ 8.\nTable 2. Common wireless nodes used in the agriculture domain.\nSr #\nWN1\n\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\

    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    \ water more efﬁciently. Such solutions\ninvolve the development of smart irrigation\
    \ systems where Internet of Things (IoT) nodes are\ndeployed throughout large\
    \ areas. In addition, in the mentioned areas, wireless communications\ncan be\
    \ difﬁcult due to the presence of obstacles and metallic objects that block electromagnetic\n\
    wave propagation totally or partially. This article details the development of\
    \ a smart irrigation\nsystem able to cover large urban areas thanks to the use\
    \ of Low-Power Wide-Area Network\n(LPWAN) sensor nodes based on LoRa and LoRaWAN.\
    \ IoT nodes collect soil temperature/moisture\nand air temperature data, and control\
    \ water supply autonomously, either by making use of fog\ncomputing gateways or\
    \ by relying on remote commands sent from a cloud. Since the selection\nof IoT\
    \ node and gateway locations is essential to have good connectivity and to reduce\
    \ energy\nconsumption, this article uses an in-house 3D-ray launching radio-planning\
    \ tool to determine the best\nlocations in real scenarios. Speciﬁcally, this paper\
    \ provides details on the modeling of a university\ncampus, which includes elements\
    \ like buildings, roads, green areas, or vehicles. In such a scenario,\nsimulations\
    \ and empirical measurements were performed for two different testbeds: a LoRaWAN\n\

    The lack of water and water-stressed areas are becoming serious problems to many\
    \ places around\nthe world. According to the United Nations (UN), by 2025, water\
    \ scarcity will affect 1.8 billion\npeople and two thirds of the population will\
    \ live under water-stressed conditions [1]. In addition,\nwater demand is expected\
    \ to grow 50% by 2050 due to the increase in the number of people living in\n\
    urban areas. As a consequence, drought is expected to have a widespread short\
    \ and long-term impact\non the everyday life of many people. Together with that,\
    \ climate change is increasing ﬂood risks and\nextreme precipitation events [2].\n\
    To tackle the previous issues, the UN recommends taking actions on three aspects\
    \ [1]:\nthe development of drought monitoring systems, the assessment of the potential\
    \ risks and vulnerabilities,\nand the design of drought risk mitigation strategies.\
    \ The present article deals with the latter by designing,\nimplementing, and validating\
    \ empirically a smart irrigation system that can be deployed in urban and\nsuburban\
    \ scenarios.\nSpeciﬁcally, the irrigation system proposed in this article has\
    \ been deployed on a university\ncampus and makes use of Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ nodes able to collect environmental data\n(e.g., soil temperature/moisture and\
    \ air temperature) and that can be activated remotely, either through\nmanual\
    \ commands or through intelligent automated actions. In addition, the proposed\
    \ system\novercomes the main communications challenges that arise in urban scenarios\
    \ (e.g., the need for\nlong-range communications, long battery life, or high network\
    \ node capacity) by using Low-Power\nWide-Area Network (LPWAN) transceivers based\
    \ on LoRa and LoRaWAN, a standard that has recently\nattracted a lot of attention\
    \ from industry and academia [3–5].\nThis article also deals with another emerging\
    \ technology that has gained momentum:\nfog computing [6]. Fog computing is a\
    \ type of edge computing [7–9] that allows for extending certain\ncloud computing\
    \ features to the edge of the network through the use of low-power computational\n\
    devices like Single-Board Computers (SBCs). Thus, low-cost fog computing devices\
    \ have proven to be\nable to provide responses to IoT nodes signiﬁcantly faster\
    \ than a cloud [10], besides bringing location\nawareness to such responses (i.e.,\
    \ the responses provided by a fog device to the monitored IoT nodes\ncan be adapted\
    \ and reﬁned depending on their physical location).\nThe optimization of the deployment\
    \ of fog computing gateways and IoT nodes requires carrying\nout radio planning\
    \ tasks. Such tasks are essential for scenarios like the one modeled for this\
    \ paper\n(i.e., an university campus), which are specially challenging in terms\
    \ of radio propagation due to\ntheir large dimensions and the numerous obstacles\
    \ that impact electromagnetic waves. For that\npurpose, empirical models are usually\
    \ employed, which give rapid results but, with high errors,\nsince they are very\
    \ site-speciﬁc. In order to obtain accurate estimations, in this work, an in-house\n\
    developed 3D-Ray Launching (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm has been used to characterize\
    \ the\nLoRa/LoRaWAN radio channel at 868 MHz and 433 MHz. As it will be later\
    \ described in Section 4,\nthe algorithm provides a good trade-off between accuracy\
    \ and computational time. In addition,\nin order to complete the radio planning\
    \ study of the scenario under analysis, and validate the\nobtained simulation\
    \ results, empirical RF measurements were obtained for both 868 MHz and 433 MHz\n\
    frequency bands. Speciﬁcally, the following are the main contributions of this\
    \ article:\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n3 of 33\n•\nA comprehensive state-of-the-art\
    \ section is provided on the most relevant academic smart\nirrigation systems\
    \ and on the use of LoRa/LoRaWAN for underground scenarios.\n•\nAn architecture\
    \ is proposed for building novel smart irrigation systems based on the deployment\n\
    of LoRa/LoRaWAN transceivers and fog computing nodes.\n•\nThe implementation of\
    \ the proposed system and its hardware is described in detail so as to allow\n\
    future developers to replicate it easily.\n•\nThe radio planning analysis of the\
    \ scenario (i.e., a university campus) is presented together with\nan empirical\
    \ measurement campaign to corroborate the analytical results.\nThe rest of this\
    \ article is structured as follows. First, Section 2 analyzes the most relevant\
    \ previous\nworks on smart irrigation systems and on the use of LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ in underground scenarios.\nSection 3 describes thoroughly the proposed communications\
    \ architecture, the deployment scenario,\nand the implementation of the different\
    \ components of the smart irrigation system. Section 4 provides\ndetails on the\
    \ performed radio analysis: its characteristics, the conﬁguration of the used\
    \ 3D-RL tool,\nand the obtained simulation results. Finally, Section 5 is dedicated\
    \ to the description and analysis of the\nresults obtained during an empirical\
    \ measurement campaign, while Section 6 is devoted to conclusions.\n2. State of\
    \ the Art\n2.1. IoT Smart Irrigation Systems\nIoT has gained in the last few years\
    \ a lot of interest as a key enabler technology in smart\nagriculture [11]. With\
    \ respect to smart irrigation systems, there are a number of recent academic works\n\
    focused on decision planning and operation support. For instance, Khan et al.\
    \ [12] describe a Decision\nSupport System (DSS) that uses Xbee devices to cover\
    \ a relatively small area. Another interesting work\nwas presented by Togneri\
    \ et al. [13], who designed a ﬂexible IoT platform that enables developing\nMachine\
    \ Learning (ML)-based solutions for smart irrigation. Its core components are\
    \ a set of software,\nhardware, and communication technologies (e.g., LoRaWAN)\
    \ that include soil moisture sensor probes,\nthe use of an open-source platform\
    \ (FIWARE), a SPARQL event processing architecture, as well as\nspeciﬁc services\
    \ for irrigation planning and operation. Unfortunately, the mentioned article\
    \ does not\nprovide further details on the communications architecture. Recently,\
    \ Boursianis et al. [14] proposed\na sophisticated smart irrigation system that\
    \ exploits the capabilities of 5G networks and energy\nharvesting. A different\
    \ approach is proposed by Munir et al. [15], which uses an intelligent method\n\
    based on a fuzzy logic to schedule irrigation based on different parameters. Since\
    \ the design of smart\nirrigation systems involves several considerations, Table\
    \ 1 shows an overview of the main aspects\nto be taken into account. A complete\
    \ and detailed overview of the current state-of-the-art regarding\nthe IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture is presented in [16]. The authors review in\
    \ detail\ncommon sensors and actuators to develop the IoT irrigation systems,\
    \ most common parameters to be\nmonitored, the type of irrigation, the type of\
    \ node, the type of wireless communication technology,\namong others.\nSensors\

    Among the most popular LPWAN communications technologies (e.g., Sigfox, LoRa/LoRaWAN,\n\
    WavIoT, Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA), Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) or LTE-M),\
    \ LoRa and\nLoRaWAN were selected due to their expected communications range and\
    \ performance in scenarios\nwhere signiﬁcant signal attenuation occurs, like is\
    \ the case for underground communications. In fact,\nsome authors already performed\
    \ thorough comparisons among LPWAN technologies and showed that\nRPMA and LTE-M\
    \ incur additional path losses in comparison to Sigfox or LoRAWAN technologies\
    \ [17].\nIn the case of LoRa or LoRaWAN, they use a proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum\
    \ (CSS) modulation in\nthe PHY layer, but their MAC layer is an open speciﬁcation.\
    \ On the contrary, Sigfox makes use of an\nopen chipset, but its network is closed\
    \ (i.e., it is necessary to pay a periodic fee). Nonetheless, it must\nbe noted\
    \ that there is no fully open LPWAN protocol stack (for PHY and MAC layers).\n\
    To provide coverage for large areas, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been suggested\
    \ for\ndeveloping smart irrigation systems. For example, Gloria et al. [18] describe\
    \ a Wireless Sensor\nNetwork (WSN) controlled by a single gateway (a broker) that\
    \ is in constant communication with\nan online server that uses LoRa peer-to-peer\
    \ connections. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport\n(MQTT) via a WiFi connection\
    \ is used for exchanging messages between the server and the nodes.\nAnother solution\
    \ was presented by Usmonov et al. [19], who detailed a LoRaWAN-based cost-effective\n\
    wireless control system for drip irrigation. Such a solution uses a master station\
    \ to relay packets\nbetween the control application and the deployed end-device\
    \ nodes. It is also worth mentioning the\nwork described in [20], which details\
    \ the design and implementation of a LoRaWAN smart irrigation\nsystem in a typical\
    \ urban environment. In such a work, the authors indicate that the communications\n\
    distance between the irrigation node and the gateway can reach up to 8 km (covering\
    \ an area of up to\n2 km2) and provide energy-consumption results that consider\
    \ different operating modes of the end\nnodes. Note that larger areas could be\
    \ easily covered with LoRa. Finally, it is relevant to mention the\nwork of other\
    \ authors like Citoni et al. [21], who studied the deployment limitations of large-scale\n\
    LoRaWAN IoT applications. Speciﬁcally, such a work analyzed the impact of packet\
    \ collision on the\nscalability of a LoRaWAN deployment.\n2.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ in Underground Scenarios\nIn this article, underground scenarios are deﬁned\
    \ as the ones that make use of wireless\ncommunications transceivers to send and\
    \ to receive data from under the soil. Such transceivers have\nto be able to avoid\
    \ the communications issues that arise when operating underground in a number\n\
    of industrial applications, like maintenance [22], mining [23,24], agriculture\
    \ [25,26], or structural\nengineering [27].\nIn underground scenarios, the radio\
    \ signal absorption loss caused by the soil severely affects\nthe performance\
    \ of traditional wireless communications technologies. In particular, factors\
    \ that\naffect signal propagation in underground scenarios are the soil type and\
    \ density, the soil moisture,\nthe existence of certain elements (e.g., plant\
    \ roots, rocks or underground pipelines), and the burial\ndepth [28].\nAlthough\
    \ authors like Akyildiz et al. [29] suggest some interesting preliminary results,\
    \ the existing\nresearch on in-soil underground communications is still not mature.\
    \ For instance, one of the ﬁrst\nempirical studies on the topic was presented\
    \ in 2010 by Silva et al. [30]. In such a work, the authors\ntested ZigBee MICA2\
    \ and MICAz motes in an agriculture ﬁeld.\nTheir results showed a high\nasymmetry\
    \ between underground and above ground communications, being highly dependent\
    \ on\nburial depth and soil moisture (e.g., a 21% increase in water content decreased\
    \ the signal coverage\nby more than 70%). Besides ZigBee, other authors have tested\
    \ in similar scenarios some of the most\npopular traceability technologies like\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) [31,32] for developing\nunderground applications\
    \ [33,34].\nLoRa and LoRaWAN make use of a chirp spread modulation that offers\
    \ several advantages for\nunderground communications [35]: better coverage than\
    \ technologies like WiFi or ZigBee, a sensitivity\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n6 of\
    \ 33\non the order of –130 dBm, low energy consumption, and low cost. There are\
    \ a number of recent papers\nthat study the performance of LoRa/LoRaWAN in underground\
    \ scenarios. For instance, Wan et al. [36]\ndesigned and evaluated a LoRa propagation\
    \ test node. They concluded that, if rainfall and irrigation\nhappen frequently,\
    \ their associated channel losses need to be compensated with increased transmission\n\
    power or with the use of high-gain antennas, the latter being the recommended\
    \ approach. Moreover,\nthe authors provide additional recommendations: with respect\
    \ to the burial depth of the node, it should\nbe as close as possible to the surface\
    \ and, regarding the Packet Success Rate (PSR) of underground\ncommunications,\
    \ a shorter LoRa payload is required for a higher PSR.\nLoRa in-soil propagation\
    \ was also studied by Xue-fen et al. [37], who proposed a smartphone-based\nLoRa\
    \ underground measurement system. Thus, the authors described thoroughly two scenarios\n\
    (a farmland and a garden) that considered the type of soil (e.g., homogeneous\
    \ loam) and plants\n(e.g., mainly rice), the root depth of grass and camphor trees,\
    \ and the characteristics of underground\niron pipelines that are used for municipal\
    \ drainage and communications. They also considered\ntwo different paths: underground-underground\
    \ (UU) and underground-above ground-underground\n(UAU). In their experiments,\
    \ the attenuation of the radio signals in the UU path, which is related\nto the\
    \ soil characteristics and to other underground obstructions, was higher than\
    \ for the UAU\npath. Thus, the actual attenuation in the analyzed environment\
    \ needed to be obtained through\nmeasurements, due to the randomness of the soil\
    \ and the obstructions. Xue-fen et al. also note\nthe negative impact of soil\
    \ moisture on LoRa in-soil propagation considering the precipitation rate,\nthe\
    \ randomness of rainfalls, and the amount of irrigation water in the area for\
    \ the last 12 h. Since the\nwater content in deep soil is usually higher than\
    \ the one of the surface, the packet success rate decreases\nwith deeper burial\
    \ depth. A similar approach was taken in [38], where, after developing an in-soil\n\
    propagation test node, the authors performed measurements and analyses of the\
    \ results in a riverside\npark. In the case of Lin et al. [39], they focused their\
    \ research on an experimental analysis on the\ninﬂuence of various physical layer\
    \ parameters (e.g., spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth) on\nLoRa’s propagation\
    \ performance.\n2.4. Key Findings\nAfter reviewing the state-of-the art, it can\
    \ be concluded that there are a number of recent articles\nthat make use of LoRa/LoRAWAN\
    \ as preferred wireless technology for IoT smart irrigation systems.\nIn contrast\
    \ to the proposed system, previous research is mainly focused on DSS capabilities\
    \ introducing\nstatistical or ML/AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence) techniques for decision-making,\
    \ or on the proper irrigation\nsystem design, focused on optimizing hardware capabilities.\
    \ Thus, there is barely any system that proposes\nthe use of fog or edge computing.\
    \ In addition, in relation to radio signal absorption loss in underground\nscenarios,\
    \ most authors recommend performing in-soil wireless propagation measurements\
    \ before the\ndesign, installation, and maintenance of any smart irrigation system,\
    \ but the use of scenario simulators\ntogether with practical deployments has\
    \ been barely documented.\nTable 2 compares the main features of the most relevant\
    \ smart irrigation systems. As it can be\nobserved, in contrast to the compared\
    \ systems, this article presents an IoT LPWAN smart irrigation\nsystem with a\
    \ fog computing-based architecture whose node and gateway locations can be optimized\n\
    for urban areas thanks to the help of an in-house developed 3D-ray launching radio\
    \ planning simulator.\nThe system proposed in this article is based on the use\
    \ of LoRa or LoRaWAN due to their ability\nto provide medium and long-range coverage\
    \ in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, thus ﬁtting into\nthe traditional areas\
    \ where smart irrigation is required. Speciﬁcally, previous literature evaluated\
    \ LoRa\nrange, obtaining up to 30 km for boat communications and 15 km for car\
    \ communications [40], up to\n8 km (but losing many packets) and up to 4 km (losing\
    \ a few packets) within urban environments [41],\nup to 500 m for very dense-vegetation\
    \ environments [42] and a radius coverage of 1.8 km for a soil\nmonitoring system\
    \ in agriculture by means of LoRa devices with worse performance in terms of\n\
    sensitivity than the ones used in this article [43].\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n\

    \ its robustness against interference has been proven [44,45],\ntransceiver cost\
    \ is also low (less than US$ 8, as of writing) and there is no need to pay monthly\
    \ fees to a\nmobile carrier. Nonetheless, developers must note that LoRa and LoRaWAN\
    \ have not been devised to\ntransfer large data payloads fast (the theoretical\
    \ maximum data rate is usually 50 Kbps for LoRa and\n27 Kbps for LoRaWAN) and\
    \ they make use of Industrial-Scientiﬁc-Medical (ISM) bands, so interference\n\
    may arise from other devices that operate in the same radio frequency.\n3. Design\
    \ and Implementation of the System\n3.1. Smart Irrigation Scenario\nBefore describing\
    \ the design and implementation of the proposed smart irrigation system, it is\n\
    ﬁrst necessary to detail the characteristics of the scenario where it is deployed\
    \ in order to understand\nthe choices made. Such a scenario is located in the\
    \ Campus of Elviña, at the University of A Coruña\n(Spain), in an area that covers\
    \ 7500 m2 (with 50 m of width and 150 m of length). The speciﬁc area\nis shown\
    \ in Figure 1 together with the locations of the deployed smart irrigation nodes\
    \ (red circles,\nnumbered 1 through 8) and communication gateways (purple circles,\
    \ numbered 9 to 11).\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n8 of 33\n1\n2\n3\n5\n6\n7\n8\n4\n\
    9\n11\n10\nFigure 1. Analyzed scenario with deployed nodes (red circles) and gateway\
    \ locations (purple circles)\n(Map source: ©2020 Google).\nThe area where the\
    \ smart irrigation system was deployed includes elements typically found in\n\
    urban and suburban environments: besides the gardens to be irrigated (composed\
    \ by lawn and diverse\ntypes of trees), there are several buildings, roads, and\
    \ cars. As an example, the pictures in Figure 2 show\nthe areas where smart irrigation\
    \ nodes 1, 3, and 4 were located, and where the mentioned elements\nof the scenario\
    \ can be observed. It is important to note that the size of the scenario and the\
    \ speciﬁc\narea were selected for convenience reasons, as they are close to the\
    \ lab of the researchers, and they are\nrepresentative of the entire campus. In\
    \ such a scenario, gateways and nodes were deployed in an area\nthat is large\
    \ enough to validate the proposed communications architecture and the smart irrigation\n\
    system, but larger areas could be easily covered by adding more LoRaWAN nodes\
    \ and, if needed,\nadditional gateways. Moreover, the scalability provided by\
    \ LoRa for the communication between\nnodes and the gateway can be easily replicated\
    \ by the used 3D-RL simulator, which, once the scenario\nto be simulated is created,\
    \ only requires specifying the desired number of nodes and their location in\n\
    order to obtain simulation results. Nonetheless, it must be emphasized that the\
    \ higher the number of\nnodes, the higher the computational cost/time that will\
    \ be required for the simulations.\nFigure 2. Areas where smart irrigation nodes\
    \ 3 and 4 (left) and 1 (right) were located.\n3.2. Designed Communications Architecture\n\
    Figure 3 shows the communications architecture of the proposed system. In such\
    \ a ﬁgure,\nthe different components are connected through arrows that indicate\
    \ the way communications are\nperformed (e.g., the two-way arrow that connects\

    \ the IoT Node Layer with the Fog Computing\nLayer in Figure 3 represent bidirectional\

    \ from the deployed\ncomponents of the smart irrigation system. The collected\
    \ data can be processed and stored on\nthe cloud database in order to be later\
    \ shown to remote users through a user-friendly interface.\nMoreover, the services\
    \ on the cloud can exchange information with useful third-party services\n(e.g.,\
    \ an external weather forecast service).\n3.3. LoRa and LoRaWAN\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer operates in the ISM bands (e.g., 868 MHz, 433 MHz, and 915 MHz).\nIn Europe,\
    \ only the 868 MHz and 433 MHz bands can be used. Transmitted power is limited\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6865\n10 of 33\nto 14 dBm Effective Isotropic Radiated Power\
    \ (EIRP) with a 1% duty cycle limit of on-air time.\nLoRa integrates a Forward\
    \ Error Correction (FEC) to increase robustness against noise and burst\ninterference.\n\
    Transmissions can be sent on different spreading factors, and, depending on the\n\
    modulation and transmission power, the link budget can be as high as 155 dB.\n\
    LoRaWAN involves a protocol stack with LoRa as the physical layer. It uses Adaptive\
    \ Data Rate\n(ADR) for managing individual data rates and maximizing the battery\
    \ lifetime of each connected\ndevice. The LoRaWAN network architecture has a star\
    \ topology in which end nodes communicate\nwith gateways which in turn connect\
    \ to network servers. A summary of LoRa/LoRaWAN main\ncharacteristics can be seen\
    \ in Table 3. In addition, the interested reader can obtain further details in\
    \ [46].\nTable 3. LoRa/LoRaWAN main speciﬁcations (Europe).\nParameter\nValue\n\

    \ the proposed system making use of LoRa/LoRaWAN, the three different layers deﬁned\n\
    in Figure 3 were implemented as illustrated in Figure 4. Note that Figures 3 and\
    \ 4 show an identical\nRemote Service Layer, but they differ signiﬁcantly on their\
    \ fog computing layer and on the way\nthey manage IoT nodes. Regarding Figure\
    \ 4, it is worth pointing out that, for the sake of clarity,\nit only refers to\
    \ LoRaWAN, since a LoRa-based architecture would be a subset. The main difference\n\
    between a LoRa-based and a LoRaWAN-based architecture is that LoRa does not need\
    \ a speciﬁc LoRa\nServer, while, in the case of LoRaWAN, such a server is necessary\
    \ to manage different aspects of the\nLoRaWAN network, like its security or certain\
    \ packet management tasks. For such a reason, the rest of\nthis subsection and\
    \ the next would only refer to LoRaWAN. Considering the previous clariﬁcation,\n\
    the layers depicted in Figure 4 were implemented as follows:\n•\nIoT Node Layer.\
    \ This layer is composed of IoT nodes that embed LoRaWAN transceivers, soil\n\
    sensors, and irrigation actuators. The LoRaWAN packets sent by the IoT nodes can\
    \ be collected\nby one or more nearby LoRaWAN gateways.\n•\nFog Computing Layer.\
    \ In this layer, LoRaWAN gateways collect packets from the deployed smart\nirrigation\
    \ nodes and then send them to a central LoRaWAN server, where they are decoded\
    \ and\nprocessed in order to provide fog computing services.\n•\nRemote Service\
    \ Layer. It works as it was previously described in Section 3.2.\nSensors 2020,\

    Node 2\nFigure 4. Implemented communications architecture.\n3.5. Implemented IoT\
    \ Node Layer\nThe implemented LoRaWAN IoT nodes send and receive information using\
    \ the LoRaWAN\nprotocol. Speciﬁcally, the deployed nodes are able to send periodically\
    \ the data collected from their\nsoil temperature/moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensors. In addition, the nodes can receive remote\ncommands to carry out different\
    \ tasks (e.g., to activate the irrigation actuator or to establish the\nwatering\
    \ schedule).\nIt must be noted that LoRaWAN end devices can be divided into three\
    \ classes (A, B, and C)\ndepending on their needs regarding downlink communications\
    \ (i.e., for transmitting data from a\nLoRaWAN gateway to the irrigation nodes)\
    \ [47]. In order to reduce node stand-by power consumption,\nthe smart irrigation\
    \ nodes were chosen to be of class A. Such a class allows the nodes to remain\
    \ asleep\nmost of the time to save power and to receive commands only during a\
    \ short period of time after\nsending data (this fact implies that remote commands\
    \ will not be executed in real time).\nEach IoT node was designed so that different\
    \ sensors can be used. For illustration purposes,\nFigure 5 shows one of the smart\
    \ irrigation IoT nodes disassembled. As it can be observed, each node\nincludes\
    \ interfaces for a DS18820 temperature sensor [48] and an SHT15 temperature and\
    \ moisture\nsensor [49]. In addition, each node provides an interface to connect\
    \ a 12 V-DC solenoid valve (Seafront\nG763hwmgsk) to control water irrigation.\n\
    The IoT node main board is based on a Heltec LoRa 32 V2 [50], which provides WiFi\
    \ connectivity,\nan OLED Display, and an SX1276 LoRa module. Moreover, a Real-Time\
    \ Clock (RTC) was embedded\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n12 of 33\nso that the microcontroller\
    \ can take time-accurate actions when the network time is not available\n(i.e.,\
    \ based on the local time indicated by the RTC).\nSHT15 \nSolenoid\nValve \nPower\
    \ \nRegulation \nHeltec LoRa 32 V2\nRTC\nDS18820\nFigure 5. Disassembled smart\
    \ irrigation node and its internal components.\nIt is possible to make use of\
    \ the characteristics of the previously described hardware to determine\nthe performance\
    \ of the system. Speciﬁcally, the characteristics of the selected valve allow\
    \ for estimating\nthat its water ﬂow is about 8 L per minute (a more precise estimation\
    \ could be calculated by embedding\na water ﬂow meter in every IoT node, but this\
    \ will also derive into the development of more expensive\nand power hungry nodes).\
    \ Assuming that the approximate amount of water required by the lawn to\nstay\
    \ green is about 10 L per square meter per day, it is possible to calculate the\
    \ savings yielded by the\nproposed smart irrigation system.\nFor calculating water\
    \ savings, it is necessary to consider that the smart irrigation system can\n\
    irrigate depending on the weather, since the system will not activate the node\
    \ valves if the weather\nforecast indicates that it is going to rain. Thus, if\
    \ the rainfall prediction is higher than 10 L per square\nmeter, it is not necessary\
    \ to irrigate throughout the whole day. On the contrary, if sunny weather\nconditions\
    \ are expected, with high solar radiation and low humidity, water evaporation\
    \ increases and,\nas a consequence, the amount of required irrigation will be\
    \ higher.\nThe proposed system allows, by means of automatic planning systems\
    \ or by manual programming,\nto reduce the amount of water to the minimum necessary\
    \ when weather conditions are adequate and\nto increase it when soil is too dry,\
    \ thus making a more efﬁcient use of water and thus reducing the\nwaste of water\
    \ considerably.\nSpeciﬁcally, considering only weather forecasts and by using\
    \ local forecasts data (provided by\na regional government agency called Meteogalicia\
    \ [51]) to obtain average rainfall over a year in\nthe selected irrigation area,\
    \ it has been estimated that 22.8% water savings would be achieved in\ncomparison\
    \ to a ﬁxed-schedule irrigation system. Such an estimation comes from the results\
    \ shown\nin Figure 6, which depicts the amount of water used throughout a whole\
    \ year (from November 2019\nto November 2020) by the smart irrigation system (red\
    \ line) depending on the amount of rainfall\n(blue line). As an additional example,\
    \ Figure 7 shows a more detailed graph for the month of September\n2020 in order\
    \ to illustrate the difference in water usage depending on weather conditions.\
    \ As it can\nbe clearly observed in Figure 7, the smart irrigation system makes\
    \ use of roughly 10 L per square\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n13 of 33\nmeter when\
    \ there is no rain, but such an amount decreases in proportion to the rainfall,\
    \ thus saving a\nsigniﬁcant amount of water.\nFigure 6. Estimated irrigation per\
    \ day during a year when depending on rain forecasts.\nFigure 7. Estimated irrigation\
    \ per day during the month of September 2020 when depending on\nrain forecasts.\n\
    3.6. Implemented Fog Computing and Remote Service Layers\nThe higher layers of\
    \ the architecture depicted in Figure 4 were implemented as follows:\n•\nFog Computing\
    \ Layer. It makes use of a central LoRaWAN server and LoRaWAN gateways\nthat can\
    \ be scattered throughout large areas. The LoRaWAN gateways are based on a regular\n\
    microcontroller (STM32L1), while the LoRaWAN server can be executed on a regular\
    \ PC. When IoT\nnodes need to send data, they send a LoRaWAN packet that will\
    \ be received by the nearest gateway.\nThen, the gateway forwards the packet to\
    \ the LoRaWAN server in the local network, which can\nsend it later to the cloud,\
    \ where all the information from the different LoRaWAN networks is\naggregated.\
    \ The LoRaWAN server is also able to perform local actions based on the received\n\
    information from a speciﬁc area before interacting with the cloud.\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 6865\n14 of 33\n•\nRemote Service Layer. The core of the Remote Service\
    \ Layer manages data collection through\nNode-RED [52].\nIn addition, a MongoDB\
    \ database [53] is used to store the collected data.\nFurthermore, this layer\
    \ is able to make use of third-party services like weather forecasters\n(for deciding\
    \ irrigation schedules), which can be easily integrated with the Remote Service\
    \ Layer\nthrough Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs).\n3.7. Enabled Applications\nThe proposed smart irrigation\
    \ system provides numerous advantages with respect to traditional\nsystems thanks\
    \ to the intelligent automation of the irrigation process. Speciﬁcally, the following\
    \ are\nsome of the most relevant features of the proposed system that enable the\
    \ development of advanced\nirrigation applications:\n•\nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ can be adjusted dynamically and in a smart way by considering multiple\ninformation\
    \ sources like weather forecasts.\n•\nThe system can adjust dynamically to changing\
    \ environmental conditions, like soil moisture,\nground temperature, or real-time\
    \ weather conditions.\n•\nThe system is able to adjust the irrigation schedule\
    \ dynamically so as to adapt it to the species\nthat are grown on each individual\
    \ green area.\n•\nIn case of having directional irrigators on the IoT nodes, it\
    \ is possible to establish speciﬁc dynamic\nirrigation patterns with the objective\
    \ of watering very speciﬁc areas.\n•\nThe system can be easily scaled (it autonomously\
    \ connects to the nearest gateway), thus being\nable to cover large areas thanks\
    \ to the use of LPWAN technologies.\n•\nIt is straightforward to add additional\
    \ IoT sensor nodes (which do not need to embed irrigation\nactuators, but only\
    \ sensors like rain or leaf moisture sensors) in order to provide accurate data\
    \ on\nthe monitored green areas, thus enhancing the accuracy of the decisions\
    \ made on the irrigation.\n4. Campus Radio Channel Analysis\n4.1. Radio Analysis\
    \ Characteristics\nThis section introduces the radio planning tasks performed\
    \ prior to the deployment of the smart\nirrigation system. Since the considered\
    \ outdoor scenario is especially complex in terms of radio\npropagation, a precise\
    \ analysis of radio wave propagation must be performed.\nThe main factor that\
    \ makes the scenario so challenging is the underground wireless channel,\nwhich\
    \ is a heterogeneous layer of soil, rocks, water, and organic matter, among others.\
    \ Moreover,\nthe underground channel can also vary depending on the location and\
    \ weather conditions. In fact,\nelectromagnetic wave propagation through soil\
    \ and rock has been previously studied extensively for\nground-penetrating radar\
    \ applications [54–56]. However, a comprehensive channel model for the\nunderground\
    \ environment does not exist yet.\nThe main problems that impact communications\
    \ when using electromagnetic waves in an\nunderground environment are the following:\
    \ extreme path loss, reﬂection/refraction, multi-path\nfading, reduced propagation\
    \ velocity, and noise. A detailed description on the impact of these\nphenomena\
    \ in the underground communication can be found in [57].\nIt must be noted that\
    \ electromagnetic wave propagation depends on the dielectric constant of\nmedium\
    \ materials, which, in a smart irrigation scenario, is a heterogeneous mixture\
    \ of air, water,\nand soil. If the porosity of the soil particles is high, propagation\
    \ will be better due to the higher\namount of air present in the medium. On the\
    \ contrary, if the presence of water in the soil is high,\nelectromagnetic propagation\
    \ in the medium will be worse. Thus, particles of sand, clay, and silt of the\n\
    soil impact communications performance. Moreover, node burial depth also impacts\
    \ electromagnetic\npropagation [58,59].\nDue to the previously mentioned issues,\
    \ electromagnetic wave propagation in near-ground\nand underground environments\
    \ is challenging. To tackle them, this work makes use of an in-house\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 6865\n15 of 33\ndeterministic three-dimensional ray launching (3D-RL)\
    \ simulation tool together with an intensive\nmeasurement campaign for characterizing\
    \ the wireless channel within the scenario under analysis.\nThe used algorithm\
    \ is based on Geometrical Optics (GO) and the Uniform Theory of Diffraction\n\
    (UTD), making use of the 3D environment to efﬁciently launch rays from the transmitter\
    \ source.\nThus, the algorithm launches hundreds of rays from the transmitter\
    \ source with a predetermined\nangular separation. Such rays are traced in the\
    \ scenario according to the presence and distribution\nof obstacles. Along their\
    \ trajectory, when they encounter an obstacle, electromagnetic phenomena\nlike\
    \ reﬂection, refraction, and diffraction are considered. The 3D-RL principles\
    \ of operation and\nthe different considered phenomena are represented schematically\
    \ in Figure 8 for a transmitter\nlocated underground.\nFigure 8. Operation principles\
    \ and propagation phenomena of the used 3D-RL algorithm.\nThe used RL technique\
    \ is also referred in the literature as brute-force Ray Tracing (RT),\n‘shooting\
    \ and bouncing rays’ or beam-launching method [60–62]. The technique assumes a\
    \ space\ndiscretization in the simulated scenario, which limits ﬁeld prediction\
    \ accuracy and depends on the\nscenario dimensions. The optimal space discretization\
    \ for different scenarios has been obtained\nby experimental measurements in [63].\
    \ A detailed description of the used 3D-RL algorithm can\nbe found in [64]. Its\
    \ validation has been performed for different applications such as vehicular\n\
    communications [65], smart cities [66], or in homogeneous vegetation environments\
    \ [67]. It is worth\nnoting that, although the employed 3D-RL algorithm has inherent\
    \ constraints which lead to estimation\nerrors, mainly the limitation to create\
    \ the objects present within the scenario by tetrahedrons, and the\nnon-application\
    \ of the scattering effect due to rough surfaces, the obtained simulation results\
    \ are very\naccurate, and, therefore, the approximation valid.\n4.2. 3D-RL Scenario\n\
    Before deploying IoT nodes on a real scenario, it is worth realizing that a smart\
    \ irrigation system\nmay be impacted by certain limitations. First, the position\
    \ of the nodes on the ground depends on\nthe access to water supply and on the\
    \ surface to irrigate. Moreover, the deployment of the LoRaWAN\ngateway can be\
    \ optimized based on radio planning analysis. To contemplate such factors, the\
    \ scenario\nwas modeled in 3D with the 3D-RL tool as it can be observed in Figure\
    \ 9 (this scenario is actually part\nof a larger scenario created and used previously\
    \ in [4]).\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n16 of 33\nFigure 9. Scenario created for 3D-RL\
    \ simulations (Map source: ©2020 Google).\nTo obtain accurate RF power distribution\
    \ estimations, the simulation scenario was created as\ndetailed as possible, thus\
    \ including the most relevant elements that may inﬂuence electromagnetic\npropagation\
    \ (e.g., buildings, roads, trees, and vehicles) and their speciﬁc material properties\n\
    (permittivity and conductivity, as indicated in Table 4). Then, the input parameters\
    \ of the 3D-RL\ntool were carefully selected, including the operation frequency,\
    \ the transmitter, and receiver radiation\npatterns, the number of permitted reﬂections\
    \ and the ray angular/spatial resolution. In addition,\nin order to obtain accurate\
    \ simulation results in a limited amount of time, it was necessary to\nset correctly\
    \ the number of reﬂections and the angular/spatial resolution parameters through\
    \ a\nproper analysis [63]. The resulting parameters for the scenario under analysis\
    \ are indicated in Table 5.\nTable 4. Material properties for the 3D-RL simulations.\n\

    \ locations were virtually placed on the ground on the positions\ndepicted in\
    \ Figure 10, following the deployment structure previously depicted in Figure\
    \ 1. In Figure 10,\nthe red circles represent irrigation node locations, while\
    \ purple circles represent gateway locations.\nEight different irrigation node\
    \ potential locations were analyzed and simulated when exchanging\ndata with a\
    \ gateway that could be positioned into three different locations. Two of the\
    \ gateway\nlocations were outdoors (locations 9 and 10, which have a height of\
    \ 1.8 m), while the other was indoors\n(location 11, at a height of 5.5 m). The\
    \ outdoor locations were chosen by considering aspects such as\nease of installation\
    \ (e.g., access to electrical power) and the existence of line of sight with respect\
    \ to\nmost of the deployed IoT nodes and to the surrounding buildings. The gateway\
    \ indoor location was\nselected to be inside one speciﬁc building due to its challenging\
    \ outside enclosure (such a building can\nbe observed on the picture on the left\
    \ of Figure 2), which is covered by an external metal mesh that\nacts as a sort\
    \ of Faraday cage, thus blocking electromagnetic waves partially.\nFigure 10.\
    \ Schematic upper view of the deployment of the irrigation nodes and the gateways.\n\
    Since the 3D-RL tool provides the RF power distribution for the whole volume of\
    \ the scenario, it is\npossible to optimize node and gateway deployment locations.\
    \ Considering that the developed smart\nirrigation nodes provide a sensitivity\
    \ of –148 dBm (both for 433 MHz and 868 MHz), deterministic\nestimations of the\
    \ received RF power level at each gateway position can be obtained. Thus, the\
    \ validity\nof the proposed locations can be inferred.\nBefore showing the obtained\
    \ simulation results, it is important to mention that the created scenario\nwas\
    \ previously validated by means of empirical results obtained during a measurement\
    \ campaign [4].\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n18 of 33\nThe obtained results showed\
    \ a very good agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations,\nobtaining\
    \ a mean error of 0.53 dB and a standard deviation of 3.39 dB.\nThe results obtained\
    \ for the 868 MHz and 433 MHz transceivers are presented in Figures 11\nand 12,\
    \ respectively. Speciﬁcally, such ﬁgures show bi-dimensional planes of the RF\
    \ power distribution\nestimations for all the eight smart irrigation nodes at\
    \ the ground level. As expected, 433 MHz\npropagation is better in the same conditions.\
    \ This is due to the higher transmitted power and to its\nlower radio propagation\
    \ losses in comparison to the higher 868 MHz frequency.\nFigure 11. 868 MHz simulation\
    \ results: RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane on the\nground\
    \ level.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n19 of 33\nFigure 12. 433 MHz simulation results:\
    \ RF power level distribution in a bi-dimensional plane on the\nground level.\n\
    When the gateway is located at position 9, irrigation nodes 2 and 8 obtain their\
    \ worst results due\nto the shadowing created by the building. Even in such a\
    \ situation, due to the low sensitivity values\nof both 433 and 868 MHz devices,\
    \ the received power level is higher than the sensitivity threshold\n(−148 dBm).\
    \ This fact was corroborated during the empirical measurement campaign (described\
    \ later\nin Section 5).\nIn the case of placing the gateway into position 10,\
    \ the worst results are clearly obtained by\nirrigation node 2, again due to the\
    \ shadowing created by the building. Like in the previous case,\nthe low sensitivity\
    \ of LoRaWAN devices facilitates wireless communications also in cases when the\n\
    shadowing effect due to buildings absorbs a great amount of energy of the propagated\
    \ wave.\nThe third analyzed gateway location corresponds to position 11, which\
    \ is inside the building,\nat a height of 5.5 m from the street ground level.\
    \ Figures 13 and 14 show estimations of the RF power\nlevel distribution at a\
    \ height of 5.5 m for 868 MHz (Figure 13) and 433 MHz (Figure 14) transceivers\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6865\n20 of 33\n(note that, for this simulation, the irrigation\
    \ nodes remained on the ground). Like in the previous\nsimulations, higher RF\
    \ power levels are observed for 433 MHz due to the higher transmitted power\n\
    level and the lower radio propagation losses. However, in comparison to the results\
    \ obtained for\ngateway positions 9 and 10, the results obtained in position 11\
    \ are worse. As it can be observed,\nposition 11 is inside blue areas or next\
    \ to them. This means that the received RF power is signiﬁcantly\nlower in comparison\
    \ to the other two gateway positions, which, in some cases, can lead to packet\n\
    losses and even to a wireless communication outage. This behavior is conﬁrmed\
    \ by the empirical\nmeasurements presented in the next section.\nFigure 13. 3D-RL\

    \ section and to determine node performance on the selected scenario. Thus, signal\
    \ strength\nmeasurements from LoRa and LoRaWAN IoT nodes were collected by gateways\

    \ Testbeds\nIn order to determine the performance of LoRa and LoRaWAN for the\
    \ deployment of smart\nirrigation IoT nodes, two different testbeds were created:\
    \ one based on LoRaWAN that works at\n868 MHz and another one that uses LoRa at\
    \ 433 MHz.\nFigure 15 shows an 868 MHz LoRaWAN-based IoT node and its components.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the\nnode is based on a WisTrio RAK5205 LPWAN tracker, which makes\
    \ use of a Semtech SX1276 LoRa\ntransceiver and an STM32L1 microcontroller. The\
    \ main speciﬁcations of the node are indicated in\nTable 6. Regarding the 433\

    \ Tests\nThe tests consisted of transmitting packets from every IoT node outdoor\
    \ location to the respective\ngateway (depending on the link quality, between\
    \ none and roughly 60 packets were received). It is\nimportant to note that, since\
    \ different protocols were used for each testbed, the considerations for\nmeasuring\
    \ their performance and signal strength differ slightly:\n•\nLoRaWAN is more complex\
    \ than LoRa. By default, most LoRaWAN transceivers make use of an\nadaptive algorithm\
    \ (Adaptative Data Rate, ADR) when transmitting, which implies that their\nspreading\
    \ factor and transmission power are adjusted dynamically. In the performed tests,\
    \ it was\nobserved that, after the transmission of the ﬁrst packet, the spreading\
    \ factor was adjusted to a\nvalue that remained static for the rest of the transmissions.\
    \ Likewise, there were no variations in\nthe power level, which was always set\
    \ in level 1, which implies a transmission power of 14 dBm.\n•\nIn the case of\
    \ LoRa, the ADR algorithm is not executed, so spreading factor and transmit power\n\
    values remain static and thus independent from the communications conditions.\
    \ During the tests,\nthe maximum allowed transmission power for the EU433 band\
    \ was used, which corresponds to a\nspreading factor of 12 and a power transmission\
    \ of 20 dBm.\nRegarding the measurement locations, they were the ones analyzed\
    \ with the 3D-RL simulator and\ndepicted in Figure 1. For every IoT node position,\
    \ the node was placed on the ground or underground\n(at a burial depth of roughly\
    \ 10 cm; one of the moments of the burying process is illustrated in Figure 17)\n\
    depending on the experiment. Regarding the gateway, during the measurements in\
    \ position 11,\nthe gateway was located indoors, next to a window at a 5.5-meter\
    \ height above the ground level. In the\ncase of positions 9 and 10, the gateway\
    \ was outdoors and its antenna was placed in a tripod, as it is\nshown in Figure\
    \ 18.\nAt every measurement location, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ values were\ncollected for the node-to-gateway communications. It is important\
    \ to note that RSSI depends on\ndiverse factors [69], so the results and conclusions\
    \ presented in the next section cannot be extrapolated\ndirectly to other scenarios\
    \ and, therefore, they should be considered as an example of the validation of\n\
    the appropriateness of the proposed smart irrigation system design approach and\
    \ on the usefulness of\nperforming simulations with the used 3D-RL tool prior\
    \ to a real hardware deployment.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n25 of 33\nFigure 17.\
    \ Deployment of one of the smart irrigation nodes.\nFigure 18. Location of the\
    \ gateway antenna during the experiments at position 9.\n5.3. Results\nThe measurement\
    \ campaign provided a lot of information regarding the performance on the\nwireless\
    \ link for all the eight irrigation nodes and the three gateway potential positions.\
    \ Figure 19\nshows a summary of the results obtained with an operating frequency\
    \ of 868 MHz, for both the\nnear-ground (i.e., on the ground) and underground\
    \ locations of the irrigation nodes. The same\nkind of measurements but for the\
    \ 433 MHz nodes are shown in Figure 20. As it can be observed,\nwhen an irrigation\
    \ node is underground, the RSSI measured by the gateways is generally lower,\n\
    which is expected due to the losses of the ground. Nonetheless, in most cases,\
    \ the difference between\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n26 of 33\nnear-ground and underground\
    \ transmissions is not critical, due to the burial depth of the underground\n\
    nodes (10 cm). It is worth noting that, when the gateway was located at position\
    \ 11 (i.e., inside the\nbuilding), it collected the lowest RSSI levels from all\
    \ the irrigation nodes. Moreover, it is the only\ngateway position where some\
    \ packets were lost (in fact, no packets were received from irrigation\nnodes\
    \ 1, 2, and 3), showing the worst performance of all gateway positions. Thus,\
    \ the obtained results\nagree with the estimations obtained by the 3D-RL algorithm\
    \ and previously described in Section 4.3.\nIn order to gain insight into the\
    \ obtained measurements, Figure 21 presents, as an example,\nthe RSSI received\
    \ at the three potential gateway locations for each 868 MHz irrigation node position\n\
    for the near-ground case. Again, it can be observed how the signal sent by irrigation\
    \ nodes 1, 2, and 3\ndoes not reach successfully the gateway when it is located\
    \ at position 11. Moreover, the RSSI received\nby the gateway at position 11 is\
    \ the lowest of all the cases.\nFigure 19. Summary of the measurements at 868\
    \ MHz.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n27 of 33\nFigure 20. Summary of the measurements\
    \ at 433 MHz.\nRegarding positions 9 and 10, the RSSI collected by the gateways\
    \ depends on the distance\nbetween them and the speciﬁc transmitting irrigation\
    \ node, as well as on the presence of obstacles\nlike buildings or cars (as previously\
    \ depicted and modeled in Figure 10). For example, for irrigation\nnode 8, the\
    \ gateway in location 10 received much better quality signal than the one in location\
    \ 9\ndue to the shorter distance and also the shadowing effect caused by the near-by\
    \ building. On the\ncontrary, in the case of irrigation node 6, the gateway at\
    \ location 9 received better signal levels than the\none at 10, even despite location\
    \ 9 being further from the irrigation node. This effect was due to the\nfact that\
    \ several vehicles (which are mainly metallic) were parked between node 6 and\
    \ location 10,\nthus blocking partially radio waves and leading to higher RF losses.\n\
    All the measurements agree with the simulation results presented in Section 4.3,\
    \ both at 433 MHz\nand 868 MHz, and lead to the same conclusions: position 11\
    \ is the worst position for placing the\ncommunications gateway. On the other\
    \ hand, locations 9 and 10 present different performance in terms\nof RSSI depending\
    \ on the irrigation node positions, but in both cases the performance in terms\
    \ of lost\npackets is the same (zero packets were lost for near-ground and underground\
    \ nodes, both for 433 MHz\nand 868 MHz), so such positions are valid for the proposed\
    \ application. In any case, if larger areas\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n28 of 33\n\
    were monitored and controlled by irrigation nodes, the better radio propagation\
    \ achieved at 433 MHz\ncould lead to the use of such nodes instead of the ones\
    \ that operate at 868 MHz. Furthermore, once the\n3D-RL simulator has been validated,\
    \ new RF power distribution estimations could be obtained in\norder to assess\
    \ the impact of transmitting with lower power levels (for energy saving), which\
    \ will\nimpact the RSSI and, therefore, the possibility of losing packets due\
    \ to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and\nto the sensitivity threshold of the devices.\
    \ In the same way, new gateway and irrigation node positions\ncould be easily\
    \ analyzed without the necessity of new extensive measurement campaigns.\nFigure\
    \ 21. RSSI received by the gateways from the eight irrigation nodes (near-ground)\
    \ that operate at\n868 MHz.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6865\n29 of 33\n6. Conclusions\n\
    This article proposed a smart irrigation system based on LoRa/LoRaWAN IoT nodes\
    \ and gateways\nwith a novel communications architecture able to exchange data\
    \ with local fog computing nodes and\nwith a remote cloud in a campus scenario.\
    \ The prototype of the proposed IoT system was developed\nand described in detail\
    \ so as to allow future developers to replicate it easily. In order to validate\
    \ the\nproposed system and assess the potential locations for the nodes to be\
    \ deployed, an in-house 3D-ray\nlaunching radio-planning tool was used in conjunction\
    \ with an accurate 3D model of the simulated\nscenario (a university campus).\
    \ In such a scenario, simulations and empirical measurements were\ncarried out\
    \ for 433 MHz LoRa-based and 868 MHz LoRaWAN-based testbeds. The obtained results\n\
    validate the accuracy of the used radio planning tool (the results obtained in\
    \ this scenario showed a\nvery good agreement between measurements and 3D-RL estimations,\
    \ obtaining a mean error of 0.53 dB\nand a standard deviation of 3.39 dB), which\
    \ allows for estimating the RF power level distribution of the\ninvolved nodes\
    \ and gateways for the whole volume of the scenario. Thus, the potential coverage\
    \ of the\ndifferent areas can be identiﬁed prior their deployment. The obtained\
    \ radio propagation results also\nremark, on one hand, the negative effect that\
    \ some architectural elements of a building (such as the\nmetallic facade in this\
    \ case) may have in terms of radio propagation, and, on the other hand, that the\n\
    impact of underground communications in signal attenuation may not be critical\
    \ if the burial depth is\nshallow (10 cm in this case). The conclusions obtained\
    \ show that the proposed tool provides useful\nguidelines for future developers\
    \ on the design of smart irrigation systems in similar large scenarios.\nFurther\
    \ work will add additional intelligence (e.g., predictive models with AI to ﬁne-grained\
    \ the\namount of water) to the IoT nodes layer and will study in depth the effect\
    \ of burial depth in LoRaWAN\nunderground wireless channels.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

    \ Fourth Indus-\ntrial Revolution, known as Industry 4.0 or 4IR [59, 91], \nwhich\
    \ envisions fast change in technology, industries, soci-\netal patterns, and processes\
    \ as a consequence of enhanced \ninterconnectivity and smart automation. This\
    \ revolution \nis impacting almost every industry in every country and \ncausing\
    \ a tremendous change in a non-linear manner at an \nunprecedented rate, with\
    \ implications for all disciplines, \nindustries, and economies. Three key terms\
    \ Automation, \ni.e., reducing human interaction in operations, Intelligent, \n\
    i.e., ability to extract insights or usable knowledge from \ndata, and Smart computing,\
    \ i.e., self-monitoring, analyz-\ning, and reporting, known as self-awareness,\
    \ have become \nfundamental criteria in designing today’s applications and \n\
    systems in every sector of our lives since the current world \nis more reliant\
    \ on technology than ever before. The use of \nmodern smart technologies enables\
    \ making smarter, faster \ndecisions regarding the business process, ultimately\
    \ increas-\ning the productivity and profitability of the overall opera-\ntion,\
    \ where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is known as a leading \ntechnology in the\
    \ area. The AI revolution, like earlier indus-\ntrial revolutions that launched\
    \ massive economic activity in \nmanufacturing, commerce, transportation, and\
    \ other areas, \nhas the potential to lead the way of progress. As a result, the\
    \ \nimpact of AI on the fourth industrial revolution motivates \nus to focus briefly\
    \ on “AI-based modeling” in this paper.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a broad\
    \ field of computer \nscience concerned with building smart machines capable of\
    \ \nperforming tasks that typically require human intelligence. \nIn other words,\
    \ we can say that it aims is to make computers \nThis article is part of the topical\

    \ to think and \nlearn using computer programs or machines, i.e., can think \n\
    and function in the same way that people do. From a philo-\nsophical perspective,\
    \ AI has the potential to help people \nlive more meaningful lives without having\
    \ to work as hard, \nas well as manage the massive network of interconnected \n\
    individuals, businesses, states, and nations in a way that \nbenefits everyone.\
    \ Thus, the primary goal of AI is to enable \ncomputers and machines to perform\
    \ cognitive functions \nsuch as problem-solving, decision making, perception,\
    \ and \ncomprehension of human communication. Therefore, AI-\nbased modeling is\
    \ the key to building automated, intelligent \nand smart systems according to\
    \ today’s needs, which has \nemerged as the next major technological milestone,\
    \ influenc-\ning the future of practically every business by making every \nprocess\
    \ better, faster, and more precise.\nWhile today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution\
    \ is typically \nfocusing on technology-driven “automation, intelligent and \n\
    smart systems”, AI technology has become one of the core \ntechnologies to achieve\
    \ the goal. However, developing an \neffective AI model is a challenging task\
    \ due to the dynamic \nnature and variation in real-world problems and data. Thus,\
    \ \nwe take into account several AI categories: The first one is \n“Analytical\
    \ AI” with the capability of extracting insights \nfrom data to ultimately produce\
    \ recommendations and thus \ncontributing to data-driven decision-making; the\
    \ Second one \nis “Functional AI” which is similar to analytical AI; how-\never,\
    \ instead of giving recommendations, it takes actions; \nthe Third one is “Interactive\
    \ AI” that typically allows busi-\nnesses to automate communication without compromising\
    \ \non interactivity like smart personal assistants or chatbots; \nthe Fourth\
    \ one is “Textual AI” that covers textual analytics \nor natural language processing\
    \ through which business can \nenjoy text recognition, speech-to-text conversion,\
    \ machine \ntranslation, and content generation capabilities; and finally \nthe\
    \ Fifth one is “Visual AI” that covers computer vision or \naugmented reality\
    \ fields, discussed briefly in “Why artificial \nintelligence in today’s research\
    \ and applications?”.\nAlthough the area of “artificial intelligence” is huge,\
    \ we \nmainly focus on potential techniques towards solving real-\nworld issues,\
    \ where the results are used to build automated, \nintelligent, and smart systems\
    \ in various application areas. \nTo build AI-based models, we classify various\
    \ AI tech-\nniques into ten categories: (1) machine learning; (2) neural \nnetworks\
    \ and deep learning; (3) data mining, knowledge \ndiscovery and advanced analytics;\
    \ (4) rule-based modeling \nand decision-making; (5) fuzzy logic-based approach;\
    \ (6) \nknowledge representation, uncertainty reasoning, and expert \nsystem modeling;\
    \ (7) case-based reasoning; (8) text min-\ning and natural language processing;\
    \ (9) visual analytics, \ncomputer vision and pattern recognition; (10) hybridization,\
    \ \nsearching and Optimization. These techniques can play an \nimportant role\
    \ in developing intelligent and smart systems in \nvarious real-world application\
    \ areas that include business, \nfinance, healthcare, agriculture, smart cities,\
    \ cybersecurity, \nand many more, depending on the nature of the problem \nand\
    \ target solution. Thus, it is important to comprehend the \nconcepts of these\
    \ techniques mentioned above, as well as \ntheir relevance in a variety of real-world\
    \ scenarios, discussed \nbriefly in “Potential AI techniques”.\nBased on the importance\
    \ and capabilities of AI tech-\nniques, in this paper, we give a comprehensive\
    \ view on \n“AI-based modeling” that can play a key role towards auto-\nmation,\
    \ intelligent and smart systems according to today’s \nneeds. Thus, the key focus\
    \ is to explain the principles of \nvarious AI techniques and their applicability\
    \ to the advance-\nment of computing and decision-making to meet the require-\n\
    ments of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Therefore the \npurpose of this paper\
    \ is to provide a fundamental guide \nfor those academics and industry professionals\
    \ who want \nto study, research, and develop automated, intelligent, and \nsmart\
    \ systems based on artificial intelligence techniques in \nrelevant application\
    \ domains.\nThe main contributions of this paper are therefore listed \nas follows:\n\
    • To define the scope of our study in terms of automation, \nintelligent and smart\
    \ computing, and decision-making in \nthe context of today’s real-world needs.\n\
    • To explore various types of AI that includes analytical, \nfunctional, interactive,\
    \ textual, and visual AI, to under-\nstand the theme of the power of artificial\
    \ intelligence in \ncomputing and decision-making while solving various \nproblems\
    \ in today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n• To provide a comprehensive view\
    \ on AI techniques that \ncan be applied to build an AI-based model to enhance\
    \ the \nintelligence and capabilities of a real-world application.\n• To discuss\
    \ the applicability of AI-based solutions in vari-\nous real-world application\
    \ domains to assist developers \nas well as researchers in broadening their perspectives\
    \ on \nAI techniques.\n• To highlight and summarize the potential research issues\
    \ \nwithin the scope of our study for conducting future \nresearch, system development\
    \ and improvement.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next sec-\n\
    tion provides a background highlighting why artificial intel-\nligence is in today’s\
    \ research and application. In the subse-\nquent section, we discuss and summarize\
    \ how various AI \ntechniques can be used for intelligence modeling in various\
    \ \napplication areas. Next, we summarize various real-world \napplication areas,\
    \ where AI techniques can be employed to \nbuild automated, intelligent, and smart\
    \ systems. The impact \nand future aspect of AI highlighting research issues have\
    \ \nbeen presented in the penultimate section, and the final sec-\ntion concludes\

    \ Science\nWhy Artificial Intelligence in Today’s \nResearch and Applications?\n\
    In this section, our goal is to motivate the study of vari-\nous AI techniques\
    \ that can be applied in various application \nareas in today’s interconnected\
    \ world. For this, we explore \nIndustry 4.0 and the revolution of AI, types of\
    \ AI techniques, \nas well as the relation with the most prominent machine and\
    \ \ndeep learning techniques. Hence, the scope of our study in \nterms of research\
    \ and applications is also explored through \nour discussion.\nIndustry 4.0 and the Revolution\
    \ of AI\nWe are now in the age of the 4th Industrial Revolution, \nreferred to\
    \ as Industry 4.0 [59, 91], which represents a new \nera of innovation in technology,\
    \ particularly, AI-driven \ntechnology. After the Internet and mobile Internet\
    \ sparked \nthe 3rd Industrial Revolution, AI technologies, fueled by \ndata,\
    \ are now creating an atmosphere of Industry 4.0. The \nterm “Industry 4.0” typically\
    \ refers to the present trend of \nleveraging modern technology to automate processes\
    \ and \nexchange information. In a broad sense, Industry 4.0 has \nbeen defined\
    \ as “A term used to describe the present trend of \nindustrial technology automation\
    \ and data exchange, which \nincludes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of\
    \ Things, \ncloud computing, and cognitive computing, as well as the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the smart factory”. The digital revolution \nto Industry 4.0 begins with\
    \ data collection, followed by \nartificial intelligence to interpret the data.\
    \ Thus, the term \n“Intelligence Revolution” can be considered in the context\
    \ \nof computing and services as the world is being reshaped by \nAI that incorporates\
    \ human behavior and intelligence into \nmachines or systems.\nAI is the buzzword\
    \ these days as it is going to impact \nbusinesses of all shapes and sizes, across\
    \ all industries. \nExisting products or services can be enhanced by indus-\n\
    trial AI to make them more effective, reliable, and safe. For \nexample, computer\
    \ vision is used in the automotive industry \nto avoid collisions and allow vehicles\
    \ to stay in their lane, \nmaking driving safer. The world’s most powerful nations\
    \ are \nhurrying to jump on the AI bandwagon and are increasing \ntheir investments\
    \ in the field. Similarly, the largest and most \npowerful corporations are working\
    \ hard to build ground-\nbreaking AI solutions that will put them ahead of the\
    \ compe-\ntition. As a result, its impact may be observed in practically \nevery\
    \ area including homes, businesses, hospitals, cities, and \nthe virtual world,\
    \ as summarized in “Real-World Applica-\ntions of AI”.\nUnderstanding Various\
    \ Types of Artificial \nIntelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is primarily\
    \ concerned with com-\nprehending and carrying out intelligent tasks such as think-\n\
    ing, acquiring new abilities, and adapting to new contexts \nand challenges. AI\
    \ is thus considered a branch of science \nand engineering that focuses on simulating\
    \ a wide range of \nissues and functions in the field of human intellect. How-\n\
    ever, due to the dynamic nature and diversity of real-world \nsituations and data,\
    \ building an effective AI model is a chal-\nlenging task. Thus, to solve various\
    \ issues in today’s Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution, we explore various types of\
    \ AI that \ninclude analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual,\
    \ \nto understand the theme of the power of AI, as shown in \nFig. 1. In the following,\
    \ we define the scope of each category \nin terms of computing and real-world\
    \ services.\n• Analytical AI: Analytics typically refers to the process of \n\
    identifying, interpreting, and communicating meaningful \npatterns of data. Thus,\
    \ Analytical AI aims to discover \nnew insights, patterns, and relationships or\
    \ dependen-\ncies in data and to assist in data-driven decision-making. \nTherefore,\
    \ in the domain of today’s business intelligence, \nit becomes a core part of\
    \ AI that can provide insights to \nan enterprise and generate suggestions or\
    \ recommenda-\ntions through its analytical processing capability. Various \n\
    machine learning [81] and deep learning [80] techniques \ncan be used to build\
    \ an analytical AI model to solve a \nparticular real-world problem. For instance,\
    \ to assess \nbusiness risk, a data-driven analytical model can be used.\n• Functional\
    \ AI: Functional AI works similarly to ana-\nlytical AI because it also explores\
    \ massive quantities of \ndata for patterns and dependencies. Functional AI, on\
    \ the \nother hand, executes actions rather than making recom-\nmendations. For\
    \ instance, a functional AI model could be \nFig. 1  Various types of artificial\
    \ \nintelligence (AI) considering \nthe variations of real-world \nissues\n \n\
    SN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158 \nPage 4 of 20\nSN Computer Science\nuseful\
    \ in robotics and IoT applications to take immediate \nactions.\n• Interactive\
    \ AI: Interactive AI typically enables efficient \nand interactive communication\
    \ automation, which is well \nestablished in many aspects of our daily lives,\
    \ particu-\nlarly in the commercial sphere. For instance, to build \nchatbots\
    \ and smart personal assistants an interactive AI \nmodel could be useful. While\
    \ building an interactive AI \nmodel, a variety of techniques such as machine\
    \ learning, \nfrequent pattern mining, reasoning, AI heuristic search \ncan be\
    \ employed.\n• Textual AI: Textual AI typically covers textual analytics \nor\
    \ natural language processing through which businesses \ncan enjoy text recognition,\
    \ speech-to-text conversion, \nmachine translation as well as content generation\
    \ capa-\nbilities. For instance, an enterprise may use textual AI \nto support\
    \ an internal corporate knowledge repository \nto provide relevant services, e.g.,\
    \ answering consumers’ \nqueries.\n• Visual AI: Visual AI is typically capable\
    \ to recognize, \nclassify, and sorting items, as well as converting images \n\
    and videos into insights. Thus, visual AI can be consid-\nered as a branch of\
    \ computer science that trains machines \nto learn images and visual data in the\
    \ same manner that \nhumans do. This sort of AI is often used in fields such as\
    \ \ncomputer vision and augmented reality.\nAs discussed above, each of the AI\
    \ types has the potential \nto provide solutions to various real-world problems.\
    \ How-\never, to provide solutions by taking into account the target \napplications,\
    \ various AI techniques and their combinations \nthat include machine learning,\
    \ deep learning, advanced ana-\nlytics, knowledge discovery, reasoning, searching,\
    \ and rel-\nevant others can be used, discussed briefly in “Potential AI \ntechniques”.\
    \ As most of the real-world issues need advanced \nanalytics [79] to provide an\
    \ intelligent and smart solution \naccording to today’s needs, analytical AI that\
    \ uses machine \nlearning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques can play \na\
    \ key role in the area of AI-powered computing and system.\nThe Relation of AI\
    \ with ML and DL\nArtificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and \n\
    deep learning (DL) are three prominent terminologies \nused interchangeably nowadays\
    \ to represent intelligent \nsystems or software. The position of machine learning\
    \ \nand deep learning within the artificial intelligence field \nis depicted in\
    \ Fig. 2. According to Fig. 2, DL is a subset \nof ML which is also a subset of\
    \ AI. In general, AI [77] \ncombines human behavior and intelligence into machines\
    \ \nor systems, whereas ML is a way of learning from data or \nexperience [81],\
    \ which automates analytical model build-\ning. Deep learning [80] also refers\
    \ to data-driven learning \napproaches that use multi-layer neural networks and\
    \ pro-\ncessing to compute. In the deep learning approach, the \nterm “Deep” refers\
    \ to the concept of numerous levels or \nstages through which data is processed\
    \ to develop a data-\ndriven model.\nThus, both ML and DL can be considered as\
    \ essen-\ntial AI technologies, as well as a frontier for AI that can \nbe used\
    \ to develop intelligent systems and automate pro-\ncesses. It also takes AI to\
    \ a new level, termed “Smarter \nAI” with data-driven learning. There is a significant\
    \ rela-\ntionship with “Data Science” [79] as well because both \nML and DL can\
    \ learn from data. These learning methods \ncan also play a crucial role in advanced\
    \ analytics and intel-\nligent decision-making in data science, which typically\
    \ \nrefers to the complete process of extracting insights in data \nin a certain\
    \ problem domain. Overall, we can conclude that \nboth ML and DL technologies\
    \ have the potential to trans-\nform the current world, particularly in terms\
    \ of a powerful \ncomputational engine, and to contribute to technology-\ndriven\
    \ automation, smart and intelligent systems. In addi-\ntion to these learning\
    \ techniques, several others can play \nthe role in the development of AI-based\
    \ models in various \nreal-world application areas, depending on the nature of\
    \ \nthe problem and the target solution, discussed briefly in \n“ Potential AI\
    \ techniques”.\nPotential AI Techniques\nIn this section, we briefly discuss the\
    \ principles and capabili-\nties of potential AI techniques that can be used in\
    \ developing \nintelligent and smart systems in various real-world applica-\n\
    tion areas. For this we divide AI techniques into ten poten-\ntial categories\
    \ by taking into account various types of AI, \nmentioned in earlier “Why artificial\
    \ intelligence in today’s \nresearch and applications?”. Followings are the ten\
    \ catego-\nries of AI techniques that can play a key role in automation, \nFig.\

    \ systems, depending on the \nnature of the problem.\nMachine Learning\nMachine\
    \ learning (ML) is known as one of the most promis-\ning AI technologies, which\
    \ is typically the study of computer \nalgorithms that automate analytical model\
    \ building [81]. ML \nmodels are often made up of a set of rules, procedures,\
    \ or \nsophisticated “transfer functions” that can be used to dis-\ncover interesting\
    \ data patterns or anticipate behavior [23]. \nMachine learning is also known\
    \ as predictive analytics that \nmakes predictions about certain unknowns in the\
    \ future \nthrough the use of data and is used to solve many real-world \nbusiness\
    \ issues, e.g., business risk prediction. In Fig. 3, a \ngeneral framework of\
    \ a machine learning-based predictive \nmodel is depicted, where the model is\
    \ trained from histori-\ncal data in phase 1 and the outcome is generated for\
    \ new \ntest data in phase 2. For modeling in a particular problem \ndomain, different\
    \ types of machine learning techniques can \nbe used according to their learning\
    \ principles and capabili-\nties, as discussed below.\n• Supervised learning This\
    \ is performed when particular \ngoals are specified to be achieved from a set\
    \ of inputs, \ni.e., a ‘task-driven strategy’ that uses labeled data to \ntrain\
    \ algorithms to classify data or forecast outcomes, \nfor example—detecting spam-like\
    \ emails. The two most \ncommon supervised learning tasks are classification \n\
    (predicting a label) and regression (predicting a quan-\ntity) analysis, discussed\
    \ briefly in our earlier paper Sarker \net al. [81]. Navies Bayes [42], K-nearest\
    \ neighbors [4], \nSupport vector machines [46], Decision Trees - ID3 [71], \n\
    C4.5 [72], CART [15], BehavDT [84], IntrudTree [82], \nEnsemble learning, Random\
    \ Forest [14], Linear regres-\nsion [36], Support vector regression [46], etc.\
    \ [81] are \nthe popular techniques that can be used to solve various \nsupervised\
    \ learning tasks, according to the nature of the \ngiven data in a particular\
    \ problem domain. For instance, \nto detect various types of cyber-attacks the\
    \ classification \nmodels could be useful, while cyber-crime trend analysis \n\
    or estimating the financial loss in the domain of cyberse-\ncurity, a regression\
    \ model could be useful, which enables \nenterprises to assess and manage their\
    \ cyber-risk.\n• Unsupervised learning This is referred to as a ‘data-\ndriven\
    \ method’, in which the primary goal is to uncover \npatterns, structures, or\
    \ knowledge from unlabeled data. \nClustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction,\
    \ find-\ning association rules, and anomaly detection are some of \nthe most common\
    \ unsupervised tasks, discussed briefly \nin our earlier paper Sarker et al. [81].\
    \ The popular tech-\nniques for solving unsupervised learning tasks are clus-\n\
    tering algorithms such as K-means [55], K-Mediods [64], \nCLARA [45], DBSCAN [27],\
    \ hierarchical clustering, \nsingle linkage [92] or complete linkage [93], BOTS\
    \ [86], \nassociation learning algorithms such as AIS [2], Apriori \n[3], Apriori-TID\
    \ and Apriori-Hybrid [3], FP-Tree [37], \nand RARM [18], Eclat [105], ABC-RuleMiner\
    \ [88] as \nwell as feature selection and extracting techniques like \nPearson\
    \ Correlation [81], principal component analysis \n[40, 66], etc. that can be\
    \ used to solve various unsuper-\nvised learning-related tasks, according to the\
    \ nature of \nthe data. An unsupervised clustering model, for example, \ncould\
    \ be useful in customer segmentation or identifying \ndifferent consumer groups\
    \ around which to build market-\ning or other business strategies.\n• Other learning\
    \ techniques In addition to particular super-\nvised and unsupervised tasks, semi-supervised\
    \ learning \ncan be regarded as a hybridization of both techniques \nexplained\
    \ above, as it uses both labeled and unlabeled \ndata to train a model. It could\
    \ be effective for improv-\ning model performance when data must be labeled \n\
    automatically without human interaction. For instance, \nclassifying Internet\
    \ content or texts, a semi-supervised \nlearning model could be useful. Reinforcement\
    \ learn-\ning is another type of machine learning training strategy \nthat rewards\
    \ desired behaviors while punishing unwanted \nones. A reinforcement learning\
    \ agent, in general, is capa-\nble of perceiving and interpreting its surroundings,\
    \ tak-\ning actions, and learning through trial and error, i.e., an \nenvironment-driven\
    \ approach, in which the environment \nis typically modeled as a Markov decision\
    \ process and \ndecisions are made using a reward function [10]. Monte \nCarlo\
    \ learning, Q-learning, Deep Q Networks, are the \nmost common reinforcement learning\
    \ algorithms [43]. \nTrajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic path-\n\
    ing, and scenario-based learning policies for highways \nare some of the autonomous\
    \ driving activities where \nreinforcement learning could be used.\nFig. 3  A\

    \ both the training and testing phase\n \nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158\
    \ \nPage 6 of 20\nSN Computer Science\nOverall, machine learning modeling [81]\
    \ has been employed \nin practically every aspect of our lives, including health-\n\
    care, cybersecurity, business, education, virtual assistance, \nrecommendation\
    \ systems, smart cities, and many more. \nBlumenstock et al. [12], for example,\
    \ provides a machine \nlearning strategy for getting COVID-19 assistance to peo-\n\
    ple who need it the most. Sarker et al. highlight numerous \nsorts of cyber anomalies\
    \ and attacks that can be detected \nusing machine learning approaches in the\
    \ domain of cyber-\nsecurity [78, 89]. Saharan et al. [76] describe a machine-\n\
    learning-based strategy to develop an effective smart parking \npricing system\
    \ for smart city environments. In our earlier \npaper, Sarker et al. [81] we briefly\
    \ discussed various types \nof machine learning techniques including clustering,\
    \ feature \nlearning, classification, regression, association analysis, etc. \n\
    highlighting their working principles, learning capabilities, \nand real-world\
    \ applications. In Table 1, we have outlined the \nabove-mentioned machine learning\
    \ techniques, emphasiz-\ning model building procedures and tasks. Overall, machine\
    \ \nlearning algorithms can build a model based on training data \nof a particular\
    \ problem domain, to make predictions or deci-\nsions without having to be explicitly\
    \ programmed to do so. \nThus, we can conclude that machine learning approaches\
    \ can \nplay a crucial part in the development of useful models in \na variety\
    \ of application areas, based on their learning capa-\nbilities and the nature\
    \ of the data, and the desired outcome.\nNeural Networks and Deep Learning\nDeep\
    \ learning (DL) [80] is known as another popular AI \ntechnique, which is based\
    \ on artificial neural networks \n(ANN). Nowadays, DL has become a hot topic in\
    \ the \ncomputing world due to its layer-wise learning capabil-\nity from data.\
    \ Multiple hidden layers, including input and \noutput layers, make up a typical\
    \ deep neural network. Fig-\nure 4 shows a general structure of a deep neural\
    \ network \n( hidden layer = N and N ≥ 2) comparing with a shallow \nnetwork (\
    \ hidden layer = 1 ). DL techniques can be divided \ninto three major categories,\
    \ highlighted in our earlier paper \nSarker et al. [80]. These are as below:\n\
    • Deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning \nIn supervised or classification\
    \ applications, this type of \nDL approach is used to provide a discriminative\
    \ function. \nDiscriminative deep architectures are often designed to \nprovide\
    \ pattern categorization discrimination by charac-\nterizing the posterior distributions\
    \ of classes conditioned \non observable data [20]. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\
    \ \n[67], Convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet) \n[53], Recurrent neural\
    \ networks (RNN) [24, 57], and \ntheir variants can be used to build the deep\
    \ discriminative \nlearning models to solve the relevant real-world issues.\n\
    • Deep networks for unsupervised or generative learn-\ning This category of deep\
    \ learning approaches is com-\nmonly used to identify high-order correlation qualities\
    \ \nor features for pattern analysis or synthesis, as well as \nTable 1  Various\

    \ distributions of visible data and their \nassociated classes [20]. The key notion\
    \ of generative \ndeep architectures is that specific supervisory informa-\ntion,\
    \ such as target class labels, is unimportant through-\nout the learning process.\
    \ Techniques in this category are \nmostly employed for unsupervised learning,\
    \ as they are \ncommonly used for feature learning or data generation \nand representation\
    \ [19, 20]. Thus, generative modeling \ncan also be utilized as a preprocessing\
    \ step for super-\nvised learning tasks, ensuring discriminative model accu-\n\
    racy. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [32], \nAutoencoder (AE) [31],\
    \ Restricted Boltzmann Machine \n(RBM) [58], Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [50], and\
    \ \nDeep Belief Network (DBN) [39], as well as their vari-\nants, can be used\
    \ to build the deep generative learning \nmodels to solve the relevant real-world\
    \ issues.\n• Deep networks for hybrid learning Generative models are \nversatile,\
    \ learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. \nIn contrast, discriminative\
    \ models are unable to learn \nfrom unlabeled data yet outperform their generative\
    \ ver-\nsions in supervised tasks. Hybrid networks are motivated \nby a paradigm\
    \ for simultaneously training deep genera-\ntive and discriminative models. Multiple\
    \ (two or more) \ndeep basic learning models make up hybrid deep learning \nmodels,\
    \ with the basic model being the discriminative or \ngenerative deep learning\
    \ model outlined previously. For \ninstance, a generative model followed by a\
    \ discriminative \nmodel, or an integration of a generative or discriminative\
    \ \nmodel followed by a non-deep learning classifier, may be \neffective for tackling\
    \ real-world problems.\nFigure 5 shows a taxonomy of these DL techniques that\
    \ can \nbe employed in many application areas including health-\ncare, cybersecurity,\
    \ business, virtual help, smart cities, \nvisual analytics, and many more. For\
    \ example, Aslan et al. \n[9] offer a CNN-based transfer learning strategy for\
    \ COVID-\n19 infection detection. Islam et al. [41] describes a com-\nbined deep\
    \ CNN-LSTM network for the identification of \nnovel coronavirus (COVID-19) using\
    \ X-ray images. Using \ntransferable generative adversarial networks built on\
    \ deep \nautoencoders, Kim et al. [48] propose a method for detect-\ning zero-day\
    \ malware. Anuradha et al. [8] propose a deep \nCNN-based stock trend prediction\
    \ utilizing a reinforcement-\nLSTM model based on large data. Wang et al. [100]\
    \ offer a \nreal-time collision prediction technique for intelligent trans-\n\
    portation systems based on deep learning. Dhyani et al. [22] \nproposed an intelligent\
    \ Chatbot utilizing deep learning with \nBidirectional RNN and attention model.\
    \ Overall, deep learn-\ning approaches can play a crucial role in the development\
    \ of \neffective AI models in a variety of application areas, based \non their\
    \ learning capabilities and the nature of the data, and \nthe target outcome.\n\

    SN Computer Science\nData Mining, Knowledge Discovery and Advanced \nAnalytics\n\
    Over the last decade, data mining has been a common word \nthat is interchangeable\
    \ with terms like knowledge mining \nfrom data, knowledge extraction, knowledge\
    \ discovery from \ndata (KDD), data or pattern analysis, etc. [79]. Figure 6 \n\
    shows a general procedure of the knowledge discovery pro-\ncess. According to\
    \ Han et al. [36], the term “knowledge min-\ning from data” should have been used\
    \ instead. Data mining \nis described as the process of extracting useful patterns\
    \ and \nknowledge from huge volumes of data [36], which is related \nto another\
    \ popular term “Data Science” [79]. Data science \nis typically defined as a concept\
    \ that unites statistics, data \nanalysis, and related methodologies to analyze\
    \ and investi-\ngate realities through data.\nIn the area of data analytics, several\
    \ key questions such \nas “What happened?”, “Why did it happen?”, “What will \n\
    happen in the future?”, “What action should be taken?” are \ncommon and important\
    \ [79]. Based on these questions, four \ntypes of analytics such as descriptive,\
    \ diagnostic, predictive, \nand prescriptive analytics are highlighted below,\
    \ which can \nbe used to build the corresponding data-driven models.\n• Descriptive\
    \ analytics It is the analysis of historical data \nto have a better understanding\
    \ of how a business has \nchanged. Thus, descriptive analytics answers the ques-\n\
    tion, “What happened in the past?” by describing histori-\ncal data such as sales\
    \ and operations statistics, marketing \ntactics, social media usage, etc.\n•\
    \ Diagnostic analytics It is a type of sophisticated analyt-\nics that explores\
    \ data or content to figure out “Why did it \nhappen?” The purpose of diagnostic\
    \ analytics is to assist \nin the discovery of the problem’s root cause.\n• Predictive\
    \ analytics This type of advanced analytics \ntypically explores data to answer\
    \ the question, “What \nwill happen in the future?” Thus, the primary purpose\
    \ \nof predictive analytics is to identify and, in most cases, \nanswer this question\
    \ with a high degree of confidence.\n• Prescriptive analytics This focuses on\
    \ advising the \noptimal course of action based on data to maximize the \ntotal\
    \ outcomes and profitability, answering the question, \n“What action should be\
    \ taken?”\nTo summarize, both descriptive and diagnostic analyt-\nics examine\
    \ the past to determine what happened and \nwhy it happened. Predictive and prescriptive\
    \ analytics \nemploy historical data to foresee what will happen in \nthe future\
    \ and what actions should be made to mitigate \nsuch impacts. For a clear understanding,\
    \ Table 2 shows \na summary of these analytics that are applied in various \n\
    application areas. For example, Hamed et al. [35] build \ndecision support systems\
    \ in Arabic higher education \ninstitutions using data mining and business intelligence.\

    \ \nPage 9 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\nAlazab et al. [5] provide a data\
    \ mining strategy to maxi-\nmize the competitive advantage on E-business websites.\
    \ \nFrom logs to stories, Afzaliseresht et al. [1] provide \nhuman-centered data\
    \ mining for cyber threat information. \nPoort et al. [70] have described an automated\
    \ diagnostic \nanalytics workflow for the detection of production events-\napplication\
    \ to mature gas fields. Srinivas et al. [94] pro-\nvide a prescriptive analytics\
    \ framework for optimizing \noutpatient appointment systems using machine learning\
    \ \nalgorithms and scheduling rules. Thus, we can conclude \ndata mining and analytics\
    \ can play a crucial part to build \nAI models through the extracted insights\
    \ from the data.\nRule‑Based Modeling and Decision‑Making\nTypically, a rule-based\
    \ system is used to store and modify \nknowledge to understand data in a meaningful\
    \ way. A rule \nbase is a sort of knowledge base that has a list of rules. \n\
    In most cases, rules are written as IF-THEN statements \nof the form:\nIF < antecedent\
    \ > THEN < consequent >\nSuch an IF-THEN rule-based expert system model can \n\
    have the decision-making ability of a human expert in \nan intelligent system\
    \ designed to solve complex prob-\nlems and knowledge reasoning [85]. The reason\
    \ is that \nthe rules in professional frameworks are easily under-\nstood by humans\
    \ and are capable of representing relevant \nknowledge clearly and effectively.\
    \ Furthermore, rule-\nbased models may be quickly improved according to the \n\
    demands by adding, deleting, or updating rules based \non domain expert information,\
    \ or recency, i.e. based on \nrecent trends [83].\nPreviously, the term “rule-based\
    \ system” was used to \ndescribe systems that used rule sets that were handcrafted\
    \ \nor created by humans. However, rule-based machine \nlearning approaches could\
    \ be more effective in terms of \nautomation and intelligence, which include mainly\
    \ clas-\nsification and association rule learning techniques [85]. \nSeveral popular\
    \ classification techniques such as deci-\nsion trees [72], IntrudTree [82], BehavDT\
    \ [84], Ripple \nDown Rule learner (RIDOR) [101], Repeated Incremen-\ntal Pruning\
    \ to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) [102], \netc. exist with the ability of\
    \ rule generation. Based on \nsupport and confidence value, association rules\
    \ are built \nby searching for frequent IF-THEN pattern data. Com-\nmon association\
    \ rule learning techniques such as AIS \n[2], Apriori [3], FP-Tree [37], RARM\
    \ [18], Eclat [105], \nABC-RuleMiner [88], and others can be used to build \n\
    a rule-based model utilizing a given data set. Sarker \net al. [88], for example,\
    \ provide a rule-based machine \nlearning strategy for context-aware intelligent\
    \ and adap-\ntive mobile services. Borah et al. [13] propose a method \nfor employing\
    \ dynamic rare association rule mining to \nfind risk variables for unfavorable\
    \ illnesses. Using case-\nbased clustering and weighted association rule mining,\
    \ \nBhavithra et al. [11] offer a personalized web page sug-\ngestion. Xu et al.\
    \ [103] introduced a risk prediction and \nearly warning system for air traffic\
    \ controllers’ risky \nbehaviors utilizing association rule mining and random\
    \ \nforest. Thus, we can conclude that rule-based modeling \ncan play a significant\
    \ role to build AI models as well as \nintelligent decision-making in various\
    \ application areas \nto solve real-world issues.\nFuzzy Logic‑Based Approach\n\
    Fuzzy logic is a precise logic of imprecision and approxi-\nmate reasoning [104].\
    \ This is a natural generalization of \nstandard logic in which a concept’s degree\
    \ of truth, also \nknown as membership value or degree of membership, can \nrange\
    \ from 0.0 to 1.0. Standard logic only applies to con-\ncepts that are either\
    \ completely true, i.e., degree of truth 1.0, \nor completely false, i.e., degree\
    \ of truth 0.0. Fuzzy logic, \non the other hand, has been used to deal with the\
    \ concept \nof partial truth, in which the truth value may range from \ncompletely\
    \ true to completely false, such as 0.9 or 0.5. For \ninstance, “if x is very\
    \ large, do y; if x is not very large, do \nz”. Here the boundaries of very big\
    \ and not too big may \noverlap, i.e. fuzzy. As a result, fuzzy logic-based models\
    \ can \nrecognize, represent, manipulate, understand, and use data \nand information\
    \ that are vague and uncertain [104]. Figure 7 \nshows a general architecture\
    \ of a fuzzy logic system. It typi-\ncally has four parts as below:\n• Fuzzification\
    \ It transforms inputs, i.e. crisp numbers into \nfuzzy sets.\nFig. 7  A general\
    \ architecture of fuzzy logic systems\n \nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158\
    \ \nPage 10 of 20\nSN Computer Science\n• Knowledge-base It contains the set of\
    \ rules and the IF-\nTHEN conditions provided by the experts to govern the \n\
    decision-making system, based on linguistic information.\n• Inference engine It\
    \ determines the matching degree of \nthe current fuzzy input concerning each\
    \ rule and decides \nwhich rules are to be fired according to the input field.\
    \ \nNext, the fired rules are combined to form the control \nactions.\n• Defuzzification\
    \ It transforms the fuzzy sets obtained by \nthe inference engine into a crisp\
    \ value.\nAlthough machine learning models are capable of differen-\ntiating between\
    \ two (or more) object classes based on their \nability to learn from data, the\
    \ fuzzy logic approach is pre-\nferred when distinguishing features are vaguely\
    \ defined and \nrely on human expertise and knowledge. Thus, the system \nmay\
    \ work with any type of input data, including imprecise, \ndistorted, or noisy\
    \ data, as well as with limited data. It is a \nsuitable strategy to use in scenarios\
    \ with real, continuous-\nvalued elements because it uses data acquired in surround-\n\
    ings with such properties [34]. Fuzzy logic-based models \nare used to tackle\
    \ problems in a variety of fields. Reddy \net al. [74], for example, use a fuzzy\
    \ logic classifier for heart \ndisease detection, with the derived rules from\
    \ fuzzy classi-\nfiers being optimized using an adaptive genetic algorithm. \n\
    Krishnan et al. [51] describes a fuzzy logic-based smart irri-\ngation system\
    \ using IoT, which sends out periodic acknowl-\nedgment messages on task statuses\
    \ such as soil humidity \nand temperature. Hamamoto et al. [34] describe a network\
    \ \nanomaly detection method based on fuzzy logic for deter-\nmining whether or\
    \ not a given instance is anomalous. Kang \net al. [44] proposed a fuzzy weighted\
    \ association rule min-\ning approach for developing a customer satisfaction product\
    \ \nform. Overall, we can infer that fuzzy logic can make rea-\nsonable conclusions\
    \ in a world of imprecision, uncertainty, \nand partial data, and thus might be\
    \ useful in such scenarios \nwhile building a model.\nKnowledge Representation,\
    \ Uncertainty Reasoning, \nand Expert System Modeling\nKnowledge representation\
    \ is the study of how an intelligent \nagent’s beliefs, intents, and judgments\
    \ may be expressed \nappropriately for automated reasoning, and it has emerged\
    \ \nas one of the most promising topics of Artificial Intelli-\ngence. Reasoning\
    \ is the process of using existing knowledge \nto conclude, make predictions,\
    \ or construct explanations. \nMany types of knowledge can be used in various\
    \ application \ndomains include descriptive knowledge, structural knowl-\nedge,\
    \ procedural knowledge, meta-knowledge, and heuris-\ntic knowledge [87]. Knowledge\
    \ representation is more than \njust storing data in a database; it also allows\
    \ an intelligent \nmachine to learn from its knowledge and experiences to \nact\
    \ intelligently as a human. As a result, in designing an \nintelligent system,\
    \ an effective method of knowledge rep-\nresentation is required. Several knowledge\
    \ representation \napproaches exist in the fields that can be utilized to develop\
    \ \na knowledge-based conceptual model, including logical, \nsemantic network,\
    \ frame, and production rules [95]. In the \nfollowing, we summarize the potential\
    \ knowledge represen-\ntation strategies taking real-world issues into account.\n\
    • Ontology-based In general, ontology is “an explicit \nspecification of conceptualization\
    \ and a formal way \nto define the semantics of knowledge and data” [56]. \nAccording\
    \ to [56], formally, an ontology is represented \nas “ {O = C, R, I, H, A} , where\
    \ {C = C1, C2, … , Cn} rep-\nresents a set of concepts, and {R = R1, R2, … , Rm}\
    \ rep-\nresents a set of relations defined over the concepts. I rep-\nresents\
    \ a set of instances of concepts, and H represents a \nDirected Acyclic Graph\
    \ (DAG) defined by the subsump-\ntion relation between concepts, and A represents\
    \ a set of \naxioms bringing additional constraints on the ontology”. \nOntology-based\
    \ knowledge representation and reason-\ning techniques provide sophisticated knowledge\
    \ about the \nenvironment for processing tasks or methods. Figure 8 \nshows an\
    \ example of ontology components for the entity \nUniversity [26]. By defining\
    \ shared and common domain \ntheories, ontologies help people and machines to\
    \ commu-\nnicate concisely by supporting semantic knowledge for a \nparticular\
    \ domain. In the area of semantic data mining, \nsuch ontology-based approaches\
    \ like classification, min-\ning with association rules, clustering, finding links,\
    \ etc. \ncan play a significant role to build smart systems.\nFig. 8  An example\
    \ of ontology components for the entity University \n[26]\nSN Computer Science\
    \ (2022) 3:158 \nPage 11 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\n• Rule-base It typically\
    \ consists of pairs of the condi-\ntion, and corresponding action, which means,\
    \ “IF \n< condition > THEN < action > ” [85]. As a result, an \nagent checks the\
    \ condition first, and if the condition \nis satisfied, the related rule fires.\
    \ The key benefit of a \nrule-based system like this is that the “condition” part\
    \ \ncan select which rule is appropriate to use for a given \nscenario. The “action”\
    \ portion, on the other hand, is \nresponsible for implementing the problem’s\
    \ solutions. \nFurthermore, in a rule-based system, we can easily insert, \ndelete,\
    \ or update rules as needed.\n• Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning Probabilistic\
    \ \nreasoning is a method of knowledge representation in \nwhich the concept of\
    \ probability is used to signify the \nuncertainty in knowledge, and where probability\
    \ theory \nand logic are combined to address the uncertainty [65]. \nProbability\
    \ is the numerical measure of the possibil-\nity of an event occurring, and it\
    \ can be defined as the \nchance that an uncertain event will occur. To deal with\
    \ \nuncertainty in a model, probabilistic models, fuzzy logic, \nBayesian belief\
    \ networks, etc. can be employed.\nA knowledge-based system, such as an expert\
    \ system for \ndecision-making, relies on these representations of knowl-\nedge.\
    \ The inference engine and the knowledge base are two \nsubsystems of the expert\
    \ system, as represented in Fig. 9. \nThe information in the knowledge base is\
    \ organized accord-\ning to the knowledge representation discussed above. The\
    \ \ninference engine looks for knowledge-based information \nand linkages and,\
    \ like a human expert, provides answers, \npredictions, and recommendations. Such\
    \ a knowledge-based \nsystem can be found in many application areas. For instance,\
    \ \nGoel et al. [29] present an ontology-driven context-aware \nframework for\
    \ smart traffic monitoring. Chukkapalli et al. \n[16] present ontology-driven\
    \ AI and access control sys-\ntems for smart fisheries. Kiran et al. [49] present\
    \ enhanced \nsecurity-aware technique and ontology data access control \nin cloud\
    \ computing. Syed et al. [97] present a conceptual \nontology and cyber intelligence\
    \ alert system for cyber-\nsecurity vulnerability management. An ontology-based\
    \ \ncyber security policy implementation in Saudi Arabia has \nbeen presented\
    \ in Talib et al. [98]. Recently, Sarker et al. \n[90] explores an expert system\
    \ modeling for personalized \ndecision-making in mobile apps. Thus, knowledge\
    \ repre-\nsentation and modeling are important to build AI models as \nwell as\
    \ intelligent decision-making in various application \nareas to solve real-world\
    \ issues.\nCase‑Based Reasoning\nCase-based reasoning (CBR) is a cognitive science\
    \ and AI \nparadigm that represents reasoning as primarily memory-\nbased. CBR\
    \ is concerned with the “smart” reuse of knowl-\nedge from previously solved problems\
    \ (“cases”) and its \nadaption to new and unsolved problems. The inference is\
    \ \na problem-solving strategy based on the similarity of the \ncurrent situation\
    \ to previously solved problems recorded in \na repository. Its premise is that\
    \ the more similar the two \nissues are, the more similar their solutions will\
    \ be. Thus, \ncase-based reasoners handle new problems by obtaining pre-\nviously\
    \ stored ’cases’ that describe similar earlier problem-\nsolving experiences and\
    \ customizing their solutions to meet \nnew requirements. For example, patient\
    \ case histories and \ntreatments are utilized in medical education to assist\
    \ diag-\nnose and treating new patients. Figure 10 shows a general \narchitecture\
    \ of case-based reasoning. CBR research looks at \nthe CBR process as a model\
    \ of human cognition as well as \na method for developing intelligent systems.\n\
    CBR is utilized in a variety of applications. Lamy et al. \n[52], for example,\
    \ provide a visual case-based reasoning \nstrategy for explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence for breast \ncancer. Gonzalez et al. [30] provide a case-based\
    \ reason-\ning-based energy optimization technique. Khosravani et al. \n[47] offers\
    \ a case-based reasoning application in a defect \ndetection system for dripper\
    \ manufacturing. Corrales et al. \n[17] provide a case-based reasoning system\
    \ for data clean-\ning algorithm recommendation in classification and regres-\n\
    sion problems. As the number of stored cases grows, CBR \nbecomes more intelligent\
    \ and thus might be useful in such \nscenarios while building a model. However,\
    \ as the time \nFig. 9  A general architecture of an expert system\nFig. 10  A\
    \ general architecture of case-based reasoning\n \nSN Computer Science (2022)\
    \ 3:158\n158 \nPage 12 of 20\nSN Computer Science\nrequired to find and process\
    \ relevant cases increases, the \nsystem’s efficiency will decline.\nText Mining\
    \ and Natural Language Processing\nText mining [7], also known as text data mining,\
    \ similar to \ntext analytics, is the process of extracting meaningful infor-\n\
    mation from a variety of text or written resources, such as \nwebsites, books,\
    \ emails, reviews, docs, comments, articles, \nand so on. Information retrieval,\
    \ lexical analysis to investi-\ngate word frequency distributions, pattern recognition,\
    \ tag-\nging or annotation, information extraction, and data mining \ntechniques\
    \ such as link and association analysis, visualiza-\ntion, and predictive analytics\
    \ are all part of text analysis. \nText mining achieves this by employing several\
    \ analysis \ntechniques, such as natural language processing (NLP). NLP \nis a\
    \ text analysis technique that allows machines to interpret \nhuman speech. NLP\
    \ tasks include speech recognition, also \nknown as speech-to-text, word segmentation\
    \ or tokenization, \nlemmatization and stemming, part of speech tagging, pars-\n\
    ing, word sense disambiguation, named entity recognition, \nsentiment analysis,\
    \ topic segmentation and recognition, and \nnatural language generation, which\
    \ is the task of convert-\ning structured data into human language [21]. Fake\
    \ news \nidentification, spam detection, machine translation, question \nanswering,\
    \ social media sentiment analysis, text summariza-\ntion, virtual agents and chatbots,\
    \ and other real-world appli-\ncations use NLP techniques.\nAlthough many language-processing\
    \ systems were built \nin the early days using symbolic approaches, such as hand-\n\
    coding a set of rules and looking them up in a dictionary, \nNLP now blends computational\
    \ linguistics with statistical, \nmachine learning, and deep learning models [80,\
    \ 81]. These \ntechnologies, when used together, allow computers to pro-\ncess\
    \ human language in the form of text or speech data and \ncomprehend its full\
    \ meaning, including the speaker’s or \nwriter’s intent and sentiment. Many works\
    \ have been done \nin this area. For example, using the feature ensemble model,\
    \ \nPhan et al. [68] propose a method for improving the perfor-\nmance of sentiment\
    \ analysis of tweets with a fuzzy senti-\nment. Using weighted word embeddings\
    \ and deep neural \nnetworks, Onan et al. [62] provide sentiment analysis on \n\
    product reviews. Subramaniyaswamy et al. [96] present sen-\ntiment analysis of\
    \ tweets for estimating event criticality and \nsecurity. In [60], the efficacy\
    \ of social media data in health-\ncare communication is discussed. Typically,\
    \ learning tech-\nniques rather than static analysis is more effective in terms\
    \ \nof automation and intelligence in textual modeling or NLP \nsystems. In addition\
    \ to standard machine learning algorithms \n[81], deep learning models and techniques,\
    \ particularly, \nbased on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recur-\nrent\
    \ neural networks (RNNs) enable such systems to learn \nas they go and extract\
    \ progressively accurate meaning from \nlarge amounts of unstructured, unlabeled\
    \ text and speech \ninput. Thus various deep learning techniques including \n\
    generative and discriminative models can be used to build \npowerful textual or NLP\
    \ model according to their learning \ncapabilities from data, discussed briefly\
    \ in our earlier paper \nSarker et al. [80], which could also be a significant research\
    \ \ndirection in the area. Overall, we can conclude that by com-\nbining machine\
    \ and deep learning techniques with natural \nlanguage processing, computers can\
    \ intelligently analyze, \nunderstand, and infer meaning from human speech or\
    \ text, \nand thus could be useful for building textual AI models.\nVisual Analytics,\
    \ Computer Vision and Pattern \nRecognition\nComputer vision [99] is also a branch\
    \ of AI that allows com-\nputers and systems to extract useful information from\
    \ digi-\ntal images, videos, and other visual inputs and act or make \nrecommendations\
    \ based on that data. From an engineering \nstandpoint, it aims to comprehend\
    \ and automate operations \nthat the human visual system is capable of. As a result,\
    \ this \nis concerned with the automated extraction, analysis, and \ncomprehension\
    \ of relevant information from a single image \nor a series of images. In terms\
    \ of technology, it entails the \ncreation of a theoretical and algorithmic foundation\
    \ for \nachieving autonomous visual understanding by processing \nan image at\
    \ the pixel level. Typical tasks in the field of visual \nanalytics and computer\
    \ vision include object recognition or \nFig. 11  A general architecture of a\
    \ convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet)\nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\
    \ \nPage 13 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\nclassification, detection, tracking,\
    \ picture restoration, feature \nmatching, image segmentation, scene reconstruction,\
    \ video \nmotion analysis, and so on.\nPattern recognition, which is the automated\
    \ recognition \nof patterns and regularities in data, is the basis for today’s\
    \ \ncomputer vision algorithms. Pattern recognition often \ninvolves the categorization\
    \ (supervised learning) and group-\ning (unsupervised learning) of patterns [81].\
    \ Although pat-\ntern recognition has its roots in statistics and engineering,\
    \ \ndue to the greater availability of huge data and a new wealth \nof processing\
    \ power, some recent techniques to pattern rec-\nognition include the use of machines\
    \ and deep learning. \nConvolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet) [53, 80]\
    \ \nhave recently demonstrated considerable promise in a vari-\nety of computer\
    \ vision tasks, including classification, object \ndetection, and scene analysis.\
    \ The general architecture of a \nconvolution neural network is depicted in Figure 11.\
    \ Large \ndatasets of thousands or millions of labeled training samples \nare\
    \ typically used to train these algorithms. However, the \nlack of appropriate\
    \ data limits the applications that can be \ndeveloped. While enormous volumes\
    \ of data can be obtained \nfast, supervised learning also necessitates data that\
    \ has been \nlabeled. Unfortunately, data labeling takes a long time and \ncosts\
    \ a lot of money. In this area, a lot of work has been \ndone. Elakkiya et al.\
    \ [25] develop a cervical cancer diag-\nnostics healthcare system utilizing hybrid\
    \ object detection \nadversarial networks in their paper. Harrou et al. [38] present\
    \ \nan integrated vision-based technique for detecting human \nfalls in a residential\
    \ setting. Pan et al. [63] demonstrated \na visual recognition based on deep learning\
    \ for navigation \nmark classification. Typically, learning techniques rather\
    \ \nthan static analysis is more effective in terms of automation \nand intelligence\
    \ in such visual analytics. In addition to stand-\nard machine learning algorithms\
    \ [81], various deep learning \ntechniques including generative and discriminative\
    \ models \ncan be used to build powerful visual model according to \ntheir learning\
    \ capabilities from data, discussed briefly in our \nearlier paper Sarker et al.\
    \ [80], which could also be a signifi-\ncant research direction in the area. Thus,\
    \ this is important to \nbuild effective visual AI models in various application\
    \ areas \nto solve real-world issues in the current age of the Fourth \nIndustrial\
    \ Revolution or Industry 4.0, according to the goal \nof this paper.\nHybrid Approach,\
    \ Searching, and Optimization\nA “hybrid approach” is a blend of multiple approaches\
    \ or \nsystems to design a new and superior model. As a result, a \nhybrid strategy\
    \ integrates the necessary approaches outlined \nabove depending on the demands.\
    \ For instance, in our earlier \npublication, Sarker et al. [85], we have used\
    \ a hybridization \nof machine learning and knowledge-base expert system to \n\
    build an effective context-aware model for intelligent mobile \nservices. In this\
    \ hybrid context-aware model, context-aware \nrules are discovered using machine\
    \ learning techniques, \nwhich are used as the knowledge base of an expert sys-\n\
    tem rather than traditional handcrafted static rules to make \ncomputing and decision-making\
    \ processes more actionable \nand intelligent. Similarly, in another hybrid approach\
    \ [68], \nthe concepts of fuzzy logic, deep learning, and natural lan-\nguage\
    \ processing were integrated to improve Twitter senti-\nment analysis accuracy.\
    \ The authors in [33] present a deep \nconvolutional neural network-based automated\
    \ and robust \nobject recognition in X-ray baggage inspection, where deep \nlearning\
    \ is integrated with computer vision analysis. Kang \net al. [44] proposed a fuzzy\
    \ weighted association rule min-\ning strategy to produce a customer satisfaction\
    \ product form. \nMoreover, Sarker et al. discussed various machine learning \n\
    [81] and deep learning [80] techniques and their hybridiza-\ntion that can be\
    \ used to solve a variety of real-world prob-\nlems in many application areas\
    \ such as business, finance, \nhealthcare, smart cities, cybersecurity, etc. Thus,\
    \ hybridiza-\ntion of multiple techniques could play a key role to build an \n\
    effective AI model in the area.\nMoreover, many AI problems can be solved theoretically\
    \ \nby searching through a large number of possible solutions, \nand the reasoning\
    \ process may be reduced down to a sim-\nple search. Thus, search strategies,\
    \ also known as universal \nproblem-solving approaches in AI, can also play a\
    \ signifi-\ncant role to solve real-world issues such as gaming, ranking \nweb\
    \ pages, video, and other content in search results, etc., \ndue to the properties\
    \ of its completeness, optimality, time \ncomplexity, and space complexity. Depending\
    \ on the nature \nof the problems, search algorithms can be uninformed search\
    \ \n(a.k.a. blind, brute-force) or informed search (a.k.a. heuristic \nsearch).\
    \ Uninformed search [75] refers to a group of general-\npurpose search algorithms\
    \ that generate search trees without \nrelying on domain information, such as\
    \ breadth-first, depth-\nfirst, uniform cost search, etc. Informed search [75]\
    \ algo-\nrithms, on the other hand, use additional or problem-specific \nknowledge\
    \ in the search process, such as greedy search, A* \nsearch, graph search, etc.\
    \ For example, when searching on \nGoogle Maps, one needs to provide information\
    \ such as a \nposition from the current location to precisely traverse the \n\
    distance, time traveled, and real-time traffic updates on that \nspecific route.\
    \ Informed search can solve a variety of com-\nplicated problems that cannot be\
    \ handled any other way. Fur-\nthermore, evolutionary computation employs an optimiza-\n\
    tion search technique, such as genetic algorithms, which has \na great potential\
    \ to solve real-world issues. For instance, in \nthe domain of cybersecurity,\
    \ a genetic algorithm is used for \neffective feature selection to detect anomalies\
    \ in fog comput-\ning environment [61]. In [28], genetic algorithm is used for\
    \ \noptimized feature selection to detect Android malware using \nmachine learning\
    \ techniques. With AI-powered search, the \nplatform learns from the data to provide\
    \ the most accurate \n \nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n158 \nPage 14 of 20\n\
    SN Computer Science\nand relevant search results automatically. Thus, searching\
    \ \nas well as optimization techniques can be used as a part of \nhybridization\
    \ while building AI models to solve real-world \nproblems.\nOverall, we can conclude\
    \ that the above explored ten \npotential AI techniques can play a significant\
    \ role while \nbuilding various AI models such as analytical, functional, \ninteractive,\
    \ textual, and visual models, depending on the \nnature of the problem and target\
    \ application. In the next \nsection, we summarize various real-world application\
    \ areas, \nwhere these AI techniques are employed in today’s inter-\nconnected\
    \ world towards automation, intelligent and smart \nsystems.\nReal‑World Applications\
    \ of AI\nAI approaches have been effectively applied to a variety of \nissues\
    \ in a variety of application areas throughout the last \nseveral years. Healthcare,\
    \ cybersecurity, business, social \nmedia, virtual reality and assistance, robotics,\
    \ and many \nother application areas are common nowadays. We have \noutlined some\
    \ potential real-world AI application areas in \nFig. 12. Various AI techniques,\
    \ such as machine learning, \ndeep learning, knowledge discovery, reasoning, natural\
    \ lan-\nguage processing, expert system modeling, and many oth-\ners, as detailed\
    \ above in “Potential AI techniques” are used \nin these application domains.\
    \ We have also listed several \nAI tasks and techniques that are utilized to solve\
    \ in several \nreal-world application areas in Table 3. Overall, we can con-\n\
    clude from Fig. 12 and Table 3 that the future prospects of \nAI modeling in real-world\
    \ application domains are vast and \nthere are several opportunities to work and\
    \ conduct research. \nIn the following section, we discuss the future aspect of\
    \ AI \nas well as research issues towards automation, intelligent \nand smart\
    \ systems.\nFuture Aspect and Research Issues\nArtificial intelligence is influencing\
    \ the future of almost \nevery sector and every person on the planet. AI has acted\
    \ \nas the driving force behind developing technologies for \nindustrial automation,\
    \ medical applications, agriculture, \nIoT applications, cybersecurity services,\
    \ etc. summarized \nin “Future Aspect and Research Issues”, and it will continue\
    \ \nto do so for the foreseeable future. This interdisciplinary sci-\nence comes\
    \ with numerous advancements and approaches \nthat are possible with the help\
    \ of deep learning, machine \nlearning algorithms, knowledge-base expert systems,\
    \ natu-\nral language processing, visual recognition, etc. discussed \nbriefly\
    \ in “Potential AI techniques”. Thus, by taking into \naccount the capabilities\
    \ of AI technologies, we illustrate \nthree essential terms, mentioned in “Introduction”\
    \ within \nthe scope of our study. These are\nFig. 12  Several potential \nreal-world\

    \ 3:158 \nPage 15 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\n• Automation One of the main\
    \ themes of today’s applica-\ntions is automation, which encompasses a wide range\
    \ of \ntechnologies that reduce human interaction in operations. \nA program,\
    \ a script, or batch processing are commonly \nused in computing to automate tasks.\
    \ AI-based automa-\ntion takes the insights gained through computational ana-\n\
    lytics to the next level, allowing for automated decision-\nmaking. As a result,\
    \ we can describe automation as the \ndevelopment and implementation of technology\
    \ to manu-\nfacture and deliver products and services to increase the \nefficiency,\
    \ dependability, and/or speed of various jobs \ntraditionally handled by humans.\
    \ In customer service, \nfor example, virtual assistants can lower expenses while\
    \ \nempowering both customers and human agents, resulting \nin a better customer\
    \ experience. Artificial intelligence \ntechnology has the potential to automate\
    \ almost any \nindustry and every person on the planet.\n• Intelligent computing\
    \ It is also known as computational \nintelligence, and it refers to a computer’s\
    \ or system’s \nability to extract insights or usable knowledge from data \nor\
    \ experimental observation, or to learn a specific task. \nIntelligent computing\

    \ AI techniques, discussed in \n“Potential AI techniques” are the main drivers\
    \ for per-\nforming intelligent computing as well as decision-mak-\ning.\n• Smart\
    \ computing The word “Smart” can be described \nas self-monitoring, analyzing,\
    \ and reporting technology \nin smart computing, and the word “Computing” can\
    \ be \ndefined as computational analysis. As a result, it can be \nthought of\
    \ as the next generation of computing, which is \nused to create something self-aware,\
    \ that is, something \nthat can sense the activities of its environment, massage\
    \ \nthe gathered data, perform some analytics, and provide \nthe best decisions\
    \ while also predicting future risks and \nchallenges. In other words, it is a\
    \ significant multidisci-\nplinary area in which AI-based computational methods\
    \ \nand technologies, as explained in “Potential AI tech-\nniques”, are integrated\
    \ with engineering approaches to \nproduce systems, applications, and new services\
    \ that suit \nsocietal demands. Overall, it strives to construct a smart \nsystem\
    \ by monitoring, analyzing, and reporting data in \na faster and smarter manner,\
    \ with AI-based modeling \nplaying a vital part in system intelligence and decision-\n\
    making.\nThe above terms are also the key focus of the current \nfourth industrial\
    \ revolution (Industry 4.0). Business, health \ncare, energy, transportation systems,\
    \ environment, secu-\nrity, surveillance, industrial systems, information retrieval\
    \ \nand publication, entertainment and creativity, and social \nactivities can\
    \ all benefit from automation, intelligence, and \nsmart computer systems. For\
    \ example, chatbots, consumer \npersonalization, image-based targeting advertising,\
    \ and \nwarehouse and inventory automation are all examples of \nhow AI will continue\
    \ to drive e-commerce. The potential \nbenefits of using AI in medicine are now\
    \ being investi-\ngated. The medical industry has a wealth of data that may \n\
    be used to develop healthcare-related predictive models. \nManufacturing, notably\
    \ the automobile industry, will \nbe significantly impacted by AI. AI will have\
    \ an impact \non sales operations in a range of industries. Marketing \ntactics,\
    \ such as business models, sales procedures, and \ncustomer service options, as\
    \ well as customer behavior, \nare predicted to be significantly influenced by\
    \ AI. AI and \nmachine learning will be key technologies in cybersecu-\nrity for\
    \ identifying and forecasting threats [77, 89]. AI \nwill be a vital tool for\
    \ financial security because of its \nability to analyze large amounts of data,\
    \ foresee fraud, \nand identify it. In the near future, interacting with AI will\
    \ \nsurely become commonplace. Artificial intelligence can be \nused to solve\
    \ incredibly difficult problems and find solu-\ntions that are vital to human\
    \ well-being. These develop-\nments have enormous economic and societal implications.\
    \ \nThus, we can say, AI’s potential is limitless and its future \nwill be shaped\
    \ by our decisions and actions. While our \ndiscussion has established a solid\
    \ foundation on AI-based \nsystems and applications, hence we outline the below\
    \ ten \nresearch issues.\n• Several potential AI techniques exist in the area\
    \ with \nthe capability of solving problems, discussed in “Poten-\ntial AI techniques”.\
    \ To understand the nature of the \nproblem and an in-depth analysis is important\
    \ to find \na suitable solution, i.e., detecting cyber-anomalies or \nattacks\
    \ [78]. Thus, the challenge is “Which AI tech-\nnique is most suited to solving\
    \ a specific real-world \nproblem, taking into account the problem’s nature?”\n\
    • One promising research direction for AI-based solu-\ntions is to develop a general\
    \ framework that can handle \nthe issues involved. A well-designed framework and\
    \ \nexperimental evaluation are both a crucial direction and \na significant challenge.\
    \ Thus, the question is “How can \nwe design an effective AI-based framework to\
    \ achieve \nthe target outcome by taking into account the issues \ninvolved?”\n\
    • The digital world contains a wealth of data in this age \nof the Fourth Industrial\
    \ Revolution (Industry 4.0 or \n4IR), including IoT data, corporate data, health\
    \ data, \ncellular data, urban data, cybersecurity data, and many \nmore [79].\
    \ Extracting insights using various analytical \nmethods is important for smart\
    \ decision-making in a \nparticular system. Thus, the question is “How to extract\
    \ \nuseful insights or knowledge from real-world raw data \nto build an automated\
    \ and intelligent system for a par-\nticular business problem?\n• Nowadays, data\
    \ are considered as the most valuable \nresource in the world and various machine\
    \ learning \n[81] and deep learning [80] techniques are used to learn \nfrom data\
    \ or past experience, which automates analyti-\ncal model building. The increase\
    \ in data and such data-\ndriven analytical modeling have made AI the highest\
    \ \ngrowth in history. Thus, it’s important to do some data \npre-processing tasks\
    \ to feed into the ultimate machine \nlearning model, so the data behaves nicely\
    \ for the model. \nTherefore, the question is “How to effectively feed data \n\
    to a machine or deep learning model to solve a particular \nreal-world problem?”\n\
    • The traditional machine learning [81] and deep learning \n[80] techniques may\
    \ not be directly applicable for the \nexpected outcome in many cases. Thus, designing\
    \ new \ntechniques or their variants by taking into account model \nSN Computer\
    \ Science (2022) 3:158 \nPage 17 of 20 \n158\nSN Computer Science\noptimization,\
    \ accuracy, and applicability, according to \nthe nature of the data and target\
    \ real-world application, \ncould be a novel contribution in the area. Therefore\
    \ the \nquestion is—“How to design an effective learning algo-\nrithm or model\
    \ allowing the application to learn auto-\nmatically from the patterns or features\
    \ in the data?”\n• In the domain of today’s smart computing, the term \n‘context-awareness’\
    \ typically refers to a system’s capac-\nity to gather information about its surroundings\
    \ at any \ngiven time and adapt its behavior accordingly. Thus, the \nconcept\
    \ of context-aware machine learning can play a \nkey role to build an intelligent\
    \ context-aware applica-\ntion, highlighted in our book Sarker et al. [85]. Thus,\
    \ \nthe question is “How to effectively incorporate context-\nawareness in an\
    \ AI-based smart system that can sense \nfrom the surrounding environment and\
    \ make intelligent \ndecisions accordingly?”\n• Decision rules, represented as\
    \ IF-THEN statement, can \nplay an important role in the area of AI. Expert systems,\
    \ \na core part of AI, are typically used to solve many real-\nworld complex problems\
    \ by reasoning through knowl-\nedge, which are mostly represented by such IF-THEN\
    \ \nrules rather than traditional procedural code [85]. Thus, \na rule-based system\
    \ can manipulate knowledge and inter-\npret information in a useful way.  Therefore,\
    \ the question \nis “How can we design an automated rule-based system \nemulating\
    \ the decision-making ability of a human expert \nthrough discovering a concise\
    \ set of IF-THEN rules from \nthe data?\n• A decision support system is a type\
    \ of information \nsystem that aids in the decision-making process of a \nbusiness\
    \ or organization. AI techniques discussed in \n“Potential AI techniques” can\
    \ play a key role to pro-\nvide intelligent decisions across a wide range of sectors\
    \ \n(e.g., business, education, healthcare, etc.) rather than \nthe traditional\
    \ system, according to the nature of the \nproblem. Thus, the challenge is “How\
    \ can we design \nan AI-assisted decision-support system that aids a team \nor\
    \ organization in making better decisions?”\n• Uncertainty refers to an event’s\
    \ lack of confidence or \ncertainty, e.g., information occurred from unreliable\
    \ \nsources. Several strategies, such as the probability-\nbased model or fuzzy\
    \ logic, discussed in “Potential AI \ntechniques” allow for the processing of\
    \ uncertain and \nimprecise knowledge while also providing a sophisti-\ncated\
    \ reasoning framework. The ability of AI to iden-\ntify and handle uncertainty\
    \ and risk is essential for \napplying AI to decision-making challenges. Thus,\
    \ the \nquestion is “How to manage uncertainty in AI-enabled \ndecision-making\
    \ applications”.\n• With the widespread availability of various IoT ser-\nvices,\
    \ Internet of things (IoT) devices are becoming \nmore common in mobile networks.\
    \ It is essential \nnowadays to have a lightweight solution that promises \nhigh-performing\
    \ artificial intelligence applications for \nmobile and IoT devices. Thus, the\
    \ question is “How \nto design AI-enabled lightweight model for intelligent \n\
    decision-making through IoT and mobile devices”.\nTo summarize, AI is a relatively\
    \ open topic to which aca-\ndemics can contribute by inventing new methods or\
    \ refin-\ning existing methods to address the issues raised above and \nsolve\
    \ real-world problems in a range of application areas. \nAI will be employed in\
    \ any context where large amounts \nof data are needed to be handled fast and\
    \ accurately, and \ncost savings are required. AI will affect the planet more\
    \ \nthan anything else in human history. One important thing \nis that AI-powered\
    \ automation does not pose a threat to \njobs in the workplace for individuals,\
    \ businesses, or coun-\ntries with the appropriate skills. AI-certified professionals\
    \ \nhave access to a wide range of job prospects. AI Engineer, \nArtificial Intelligence\
    \ Programmer, AI System Developer, \nData Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer,\
    \ Data Analyst, \nAI Architect, Deep Learning Engineer, AI Software Engi-\nneer,\
    \ and many other employment opportunities are avail-\nable to these professionals.\n\
    Overall, AI technologies are driving a new wave of \neconomic progress, resolving\
    \ some of the world’s most \nchallenging issues and delivering solutions to some\
    \ of \nhumanity’s most significant challenges. Many industries, \nincluding information\
    \ technology, telecommunications, \ntransportation, traffic management, health\
    \ care, education, \ncriminal justice, defense, banking, and agriculture, have\
    \ \nthe potential to be transformed by artificial intelligence. \nWithout compromising\
    \ the significant characteristics that \nidentify mankind, we can assure that\
    \ AI systems are delib-\nerate, intelligent, and flexible with adequate security.\
    \ Gov-\nernments and decision-makers of a country need to focus \npublic policies\
    \ that promote AI innovation while minimiz-\ning unexpected societal consequences\
    \ to realize its full \npotential in real-world scenarios.\nConcluding Remarks\n\
    In this article, we have provided a comprehensive view of \nAI-based modeling\
    \ which is considered a key component \nof the fourth industrial revolution (Industry\
    \ 4.0). It begins \nwith research motivation and proceeds to AI techniques and\
    \ \nbreakthroughs in many application domains. Then in numer-\nous dimensions,\
    \ the important techniques in this area are \nexplored. We take into account ten\
    \ categories of popular \nAI techniques in this thorough analysis, including machine\
    \ \nlearning, deep learning, natural language processing, knowl-\nedge discovery,\
    \ expert system modeling, etc., which can be \n \nSN Computer Science (2022) 3:158\n\
    158 \nPage 18 of 20\nSN Computer Science\napplied in a variety of applications\
    \ depending on current \ndemands. In terms of machine intelligence, complex learn-\n\
    ing algorithms should be trained using data and knowledge \nfrom the target application\
    \ before the system can help with \nintelligent decision-making.\nOverall, AI\
    \ techniques have proven to be beneficial in a \nvariety of applications and research\
    \ fields, including busi-\nness intelligence, finance, healthcare, visual recognition,\
    \ \nsmart cities, IoT, cybersecurity, and many more, as explored \nin the paper.\
    \ Finally, we explored the future aspects of AI \ntowards automation, intelligence,\
    \ and smart computing sys-\ntems, highlighting several research issues within\
    \ the scope of \nour study. This can also aid researchers in conducting more \n\
    in-depth analyses, resulting in a more reliable and realistic \noutcome. Overall,\
    \ we feel that our study and discussion on \nAI-based modeling points in the right\
    \ direction and can be \nused as a reference guide for future research and develop-\n\
    ment in relevant application domains by academics as well \nas industry professionals.\n\

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12010127\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\

    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\
    Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.\n\
    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\
    \ 4 compares the efﬁciency of several smart agricultural techniques.\nAgronomy\

    -\nFor the recognition and detection of olive diseases, such as peacock spot,\
    \ anthracnose,\nand canker, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) dubbed\
    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\
    \ technique is 99.11%, which is the best possible score.\nFurthermore, it possesses\
    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\

    Abstract: Smart Farming (SF) is an emerging technology in the current agricultural
    landscape. The

    aim of Smart Farming is to provide tools for various agricultural and farming
    operations to improve

    yield by reducing cost, waste, and required manpower. SF is a data-driven approach
    that can

    mitigate losses that occur due to extreme weather conditions and calamities. The
    inﬂux of data from

    various sensors, and the introduction of information communication technologies
    (ICTs) in the ﬁeld

    of farming has accelerated the implementation of disruptive technologies (DTs)
    such as machine

    learning and big data. Application of these predictive and innovative tools in
    agriculture is crucial

    for handling unprecedented conditions such as climate change and the increasing
    global population.

    In this study, we review the recent advancements in the ﬁeld of Smart Farming,
    which include novel

    use cases and projects around the globe. An overview of the challenges associated
    with the adoption

    of such technologies in their respective regions is also provided. A brief analysis
    of the general

    sentiment towards Smart Farming technologies is also performed by manually annotating
    YouTube

    comments and making use of the pattern library. Preliminary ﬁndings of our study
    indicate that,

    though there are several barriers to the implementation of SF tools, further research
    and innovation

    can alleviate such risks and ensure sustainability of the food supply. The exploratory
    sentiment

    analysis also suggests that most digital users are not well-informed about such
    technologies.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture is an indispensable ﬁeld of study, as the continued survival of the
    human

    race depends on it. New and updated technology has been implemented throughout
    the

    ages in order to improve agricultural output and sustainability. The world’s population
    is

    expected to grow to approximately 9.7 billion by the year 2050 [1]. To keep up
    with this

    increase in population, food production needs to go up by 70%. However, the resources

    available to produce the required food output are steadily decreasing due to climate
    change

    and an increase in the number of settlements. Water levels are receding, arable
    lands are

    shrinking, and the environment is being rapidly degraded. The agricultural industry
    is

    also one the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases. The strain on the availability
    of

    food across the world is predicted to increase drastically with the increase in
    the world

    population over the next few decades [2,3]. Agriculture 4.0, or the fourth agricultural

    revolution, was discussed by the World Government Summit in 2018 in the report
    titled

    ‘Agriculture 4.0—The Future of Farming Technology’ [4]. The report highlights
    the need for

    more efﬁcient food production practices that can overcome the increasing food
    demand in

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4, 424–460. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering4020029

    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    coming years. It would be nearly impossible to keep up with this increase in demand
    with-

    out the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and disruptive

    technologies (DTs) such as remote sensing, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning,
    big

    data, etc., into the agricultural industry. Smart Farming is of great interest
    to researchers

    and scientists as it has yielded great results in reducing the ecological footprint
    of farm-

    ing [5], improving production efﬁciency [6], reducing human labor through unmanned

    vehicles [7,8], detecting diseases through image processing [9,10], and more.

    Precision farming is an approach that utilizes ICTs to monitor resources such
    as

    crops, ﬁelds, and animals [11]. It aims to maximize resource usage and crop yield
    while

    minimizing associated costs. The agricultural sector consumes a signiﬁcant amount
    of

    resources in the form of water, land, fertilizer, and energy. Precision farming
    is concerned

    with calculating the exact amount of resources required to grow plants and sustain
    livestock.

    Smart Farming (SF), which could be considered an extension of precision farming,
    focuses

    on utilization of data obtained from precision farming in an intelligent way and
    making crop

    production more efﬁcient by predicting crop yield [12,13], reducing wastage of
    resources,

    automating tasks [14], and providing agricultural management support [15]. It
    can also

    be used to perform soil analysis [16], so that crops of optimal quality can be
    grown. There

    have been several calamities in recent years that occurred due to climate change
    [17]. In

    light of these calamities, there is great need for smart farming to help manage
    agricultural

    activities. Due to the various risks and external factors associated with farming,
    such as

    weather extremities and plant diseases, implementation of data-driven predictive
    tools,

    which can be used to provide insights into farming operations such as crop yield,
    feed

    intake, weather conditions, soil conditions, etc., is crucial for mitigation [18].
    Decisions can

    thereby be made based on real-time data rather than heuristic, thumb-rule data.

    The availability of huge amounts of data from Internet of things (IoT) devices
    has

    allowed for application of big-data tools. The development of Artiﬁcial Intelligence
    (AI)

    tools has impacted the efﬁciency of a number of tasks associated with farming,
    suggesting

    that data-driven agriculture is a good approach to ensure agricultural sustainability.
    Cli-

    mate change is predicted to disproportionately impact smallholder farmers [19].
    Even a

    temperature variation of a few degrees will drastically affect smallholder farmers
    who are

    not adequately prepared for the situation. A substantial amount of crop losses
    occur due to

    weather events, which can be greatly mitigated through predictive weather modeling.
    This

    approach can help farmers navigate the agricultural risks that arise from the
    unprecedented

    deterioration of the environment, social and economic changes in the industry,
    and the

    increase in demand for food production. The availability of big data has the potential
    to

    revamp the entire food supply chain [20]. A global connectivity chain in farming
    will allow

    for the use of correctly priced products, better market positioning, and improved
    means of

    production. The use of ICT in farming will provide greater insight and advice
    on agricul-

    tural practices to farmers. The increase in visibility that comes with inter-connectivity
    of

    the supply chain is also likely to improve the productivity and conﬁdence of farmers
    in

    such practices.

    Agricultural tasks such as fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,
    seed

    planting, etc., can be automated through the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

    and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) [21]. Robots can be trained to autonomously

    plant saplings and move heavy pots, thus complementing human effort in the agricultural

    industry and reducing the farmer’s workload [22]. Autonomous vehicles never tire
    and can

    work around the clock. They also provide better accuracy and speed to improve
    the size of

    yields. With computer vision, autonomous vehicles can identify if the crops are
    ripe, ready,

    and disease-free. Lightweight sensors can be deployed on aerial vehicles to collect
    detailed

    information about crops and soil parameters through hyper-spectral imaging [23].
    Sensors

    can also be used to map various parameters such as type of land, crop, vegetation
    index,

    chlorophyll index, and water index [24]. Drones can help to create a precision
    map of a ﬁeld

    so that each part can precisely receive the resources it needs [25]. IoT is a
    major enabling

    technology that allows communication between the various sensors installed on
    the farm.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    426

    IoT makes use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), which can collect a large amount
    of

    data about the environment, crop production, cattle monitoring, and more [26].
    Information

    generated by IoT devices allows farmers to track farm operations and performance,
    and

    make informed decisions to improve farm productivity and yield. The massive amounts
    of

    data collected from the WSNs can be analyzed through technologies such as big
    data and

    deep learning. These technologies provide the added advantages of predictive modeling,

    real-time decision making, and adaptability to external factors. With the number
    of smart

    devices increasing steadily, the implementation of IoT in farms will increase
    interoperability,

    decrease losses due to human errors, and provide seamless uniﬁcation of information.

    Vertical farming, which is the practice of growing crops in a vertically stacked
    layer within

    a controlled environment for maximum growth, is one way to grow crops independently

    of local soil and climate conditions [27].

    The widespread implementation of smart farming tools faces several limitations

    and challenges depending on the geographical location of the project. One prominent

    barrier is the lack of internet connectivity, especially in rural areas. Such
    technology is not

    affordable for everyone. Without a stable internet connection agricultural sensors
    cannot

    communicate with each other. The initial cost of installation is high for any
    SF project,

    making it especially difﬁcult for smallholder farms to accept the risks. Further,
    the farmers

    implementing smart farming technologies may not fully understand the operation,
    ﬁnd the

    system too complex to use, or may be skeptical about its beneﬁts. Older farmers
    usually

    prefer traditional farming and are unwilling to learn to operate new technology
    [28]. The

    security and privacy of the data generated by sensors is also a concern, as there
    has to be

    an accountable party in case of mishandling or misuse [6]. This review paper highlights

    the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs that are applicable to the agricultural
    sector. The

    practical implementation of these technologies in particular projects across the
    world has

    also been covered, along with the limitations of the approaches and their potential
    to

    alleviate signiﬁcant concerns faced by farmers. Exploratory sentiment analysis
    has also

    been performed on comments collected from YouTube videos relevant to smart farming

    in order to determine public opinion regarding the implementation of these tools.
    This

    work aims to serve as a reference and motivation for further research in the adoption
    of

    technological tools in the agricultural industry.

    2. Motivation

    In this study, an in-depth exploration of recent advancements in the ﬁeld of smart

    farming is performed. It has always been a human endeavor to revolutionize agriculture

    by domesticating animals, planting crops in rotations, using pesticides and fertilizers,
    etc.

    The advent of ICTs has brought about the fourth agricultural revolution, or Agriculture

    4.0, which focuses on the use of limited resources on targeted areas. As discussed
    in

    the previous section, this is achievable with the help of sophisticated technologies
    such

    as unmanned vehicles, satellite imagery, sensors, and more. DTs such as AI have
    also

    greatly impacted the agricultural sector by improving efﬁciency, providing predictive

    analysis of yield, and mitigating production and market risks. Studies have shown
    several

    beneﬁts of using smart solutions in farming practices, such as reduction of necessary

    manpower, increase in yield, effective management of livestock, monitoring of
    crops and

    weather conditions, predictive analysis, and cost reduction. Several initiatives
    have been

    undertaken across the world that support the use of precision farming and smart
    farming

    while also providing insight on the speciﬁc limitations that were encountered.
    It is crucial

    that the ever-increasing global food demand is met, as the survival of the human
    race

    depends on it. Smart farming is capable of providing essential assistance to farmers
    to

    ensure sustainable food production. It can help farmers manage risks by providing
    speciﬁc

    weather forecasts, yield projections, likelihood of diseases, and more. It can
    thereby also

    increase proﬁts for the farmer, as the availability of data on risk assessment
    and external

    conditions can allow for optimal cultivation of crops. The motivation for conducting
    this

    study is to streamline the current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs applicable to
    the farming

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    427

    sector, analyze components of various smart farming projects, discuss potential
    uses of

    such components, and list the common challenges that face the large-scale adoption
    of such

    techniques. The considerations for using smart farming in different geographical
    regions

    also needs to be discussed. The general attitude of people towards the adoption
    of any

    new technology is a great indicator of its perceived beneﬁts. To determine the
    consensus of

    the opinion on smart farming, we have performed a surface-level sentiment analysis
    on

    comments collected from YouTube channels relevant to smart farming. Thus, this
    work can

    serve as a point of reference for future research in the area of smart farming
    and can help

    researchers explore diverse technologies that are relevant to the topic.

    During this exploratory study, we formed the following two hypotheses, each with

    their respective research questions for further investigation:

    Hypothesis 1. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications. The following research question was crafted
    to accept or

    reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Hypothesis 2. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.
    The following

    research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming
    tools?

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regards
    to smart

    farming?

    For this study, Google Scholar was used to perform exploratory analysis. Speciﬁc
    key-

    words, such as ‘plant disease detection’, ‘unmanned ground vehicles’, ‘precision
    livestock’,

    ‘big data’, etc., were selected. The searches were performed in the format [technology][smart

    farming]. For example, in order to search for articles that provided an overview
    of big-

    data applications in farming, the search phrase was ‘big data smart farming’.
    A total of

    30 keywords were grouped into six groups to analyze the number of citations for
    the top

    ﬁve results for each search. We attempted to exclude review papers that covered
    a few or

    all of the keywords. The number of citations for the top ﬁve results for each
    keyword is

    graphed in Figure 1 in six groups. The average number of citations for the top
    ﬁve results

    was calculated. The documents where the number of citations was greater than the
    average

    for that keyword were considered for the study.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 3 covers the various
    ICTs and

    DTs, such as big data, IoT, cloud computing, AI, unmanned vehicles, blockchain,
    and

    decision support systems, that enable smart farming initiatives. Research efforts
    and

    projects that utilize such technologies in the agricultural sector are also discussed.
    Section 4

    covers state-of-the-art smart farming projects that have been launched and completed
    in the

    European Union and across the world. A brief overview of user sentiment towards
    smart

    farming technologies is conducted through comments collected from YouTube videos
    about

    smart farming in Section 5, in order to better encapsulate user perception towards
    such

    tools. Section 6 highlights the various challenges present in the widespread adoption
    of

    precision and smart agricultural practices. In Section 7, we discuss the ﬁndings
    of our study

    with respect to the two hypotheses formulated, followed by the conclusion in Section
    8.

    3. Technologies

    This section provides a thorough discussion of the key technologies that assist
    in the

    evolution of smart farming. These technologies include sensing systems, wireless
    sensor

    networks, IoT, unmanned vehicles, decision support systems, blockchain, and more.
    One

    or more of these tools has been used in collaboration for smart farming projects
    worldwide.

    The development of new sensors with improved sensitivity has allowed for the collection

    of higher-quality spatial and temporal data, which can be be analyzed for more
    timely and

    efﬁcient decision making. The advancements in remote sensing translate to reducing
    human

    time and effort, as less human intervention is required. Over the past few years,
    UAVs

    and UGVs have drastically improved in precision and have become more lightweight
    and

    cheaper, allowing for their easy adaption on large-scale farms. Wireless sensor
    networks

    can help the seamless functioning of sensors, autonomous vehicles, and decision-support

    systems to impact production at all stages. IoT platforms can allow control of
    daily farm

    activities through remote devices. Figure 3 classiﬁes the technologies implemented
    in smart

    farming, along with their most common applications. Table 1 provides a brief description

    of each technology along with some related works and applications.

    3.1. Sensors

    The implementation of ICTs and DTs in farming is dependent on the availability
    of

    wireless connectivity. Remote sensing is crucial for IoT devices to function.
    Sensors serve

    as the basic building block in a wireless sensor network (WSN), which then handles
    the

    seamless communication between IoT devices. The advancements in sensing technology

    translate to the use of additional wavelengths in the light spectrum to remotely
    monitor

    crops, manage weeds, capture imagery, and more. Satellites and UAVs are equipped
    with

    thermal, visual light (RBG), and near infrared (NIR) cameras to capture multi
    or hyper-

    spectral images of the crop ﬁeld [24]. Hyper-spectral imaging divides light into
    thousands

    of smaller bands, which captures a lot of detail. Lightweight, hyper-spectral
    cameras can

    be used to monitor crop health, water and nutrient levels, and symptoms of a disease
    over

    large areas, which can be difﬁcult to access by other means. The availability
    of detailed and

    precise data also allows for spot application of resources and better decision
    making.

    The choice of technology to be used in a project relies heavily on the available
    band-

    width, transmission distance, and energy requirements. Wireless technologies that
    have

    been utilized in smart farming operations over the years include Bluetooth Low
    Energy

    (BLE), ZigBee, WiFi, 3G/4G/5G, LoRa, and more. Cellular networks (3G/4G/5G) serve

    the purpose of aggregating data from various sensors in a smart farming environment.

    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) provides coverage of 100 m and consumes less power
    than

    Bluetooth. It can be implemented in systems for livestock positioning [52], greenhouse

    monitoring [30], and more. BLE is not suitable for transferring large amounts
    of data [53].

    ZigBee is a WSN protocol that provides a smaller coverage area and low energy
    con-

    sumption. It can be used for scenarios such as solar power monitoring [54], greenhouse

    monitoring, etc. WiFi is beneﬁcial where high bandwidth and large amounts of data
    trans-

    fer is required. Cellular 3G/4G/5G networks offer wide coverage and low latency,
    but

    they drive up the cost and power consumption. LoRa can cover an area of 20 km
    and

    consumes less energy. Specialized sensors have been introduced for tasks such
    as pest

    identiﬁcation and control, plant health monitoring, resource level monitoring,
    etc. Bug

    detection and classiﬁcation can be performed using acoustic sensing devices and
    cameras,

    which capture factors such ﬂight behavior and humming sound [55]. Similarly, parasite

    detection was performed in study [56] using a spectral sensor that measures light
    waves.

    The difference in the reﬂected light pattern can be an indicator of infestation
    in the plant.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    431

    López et al. [57] propose an autonomous monitoring system that uses a low-cost
    image

    sensor for visually inspecting bug traps deployed across the ﬁeld. Bioacoustic
    sensors

    have also been deployed to detect red palm weevil infestation in palm trees [58].
    Wireless

    sensors can be installed on leaves to monitor parameters such as humidity, water
    content,

    temperature, etc., to estimate the plant’s health and required amount of resources
    [59]. The

    growth rate of the plant stem and trunk can also be used to determine its health.
    Various

    sensors, such as the stem micro variation sensors, sap ﬂow relative rate sensors,
    stem ﬂux

    relative rate sensors, auxanometers, and trunk dendrometer, are used for this
    purpose [60].

    Environmental factors such as atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed,
    rainfall,

    temperature, and humidity can also be measured by wind speed and direction sensors,

    ambient seismic energy sensors, precipitation sensors, etc. [61]. Global navigation
    satellite

    systems (GNSS) can help increase efﬁciency in smart dairy farming. Smart collars
    can be

    worn by cows and can be used to collect data on the health and well-being of livestock
    [29].

    Farmers can program GPS collar trackers to keep cattle in a certain area. The
    cattle can then

    be sent to autonomous milking robots when their udders are full. The amount and
    quality

    of milk is then analyzed by the robots. Virtual fences can also prevent cattle
    from getting

    hurt on electric fencing and allow for rotational grazing [62].

    3.2. IoT Platforms

    IoT can enable devices and sensors to collect data about physical parameters of
    a

    farm. The functionalities provided by IoT, such as smart processing of data and
    real-time

    communication between devices, enable it to optimize agricultural practices [63].
    IoT

    blends the usage of physical devices such as actuators and sensors with a WSN
    to allow for

    seamless communication [26]. Sensors can serve as the peripheral devices that
    can gather

    information over a WSN which can then be analyzed with an IoT platform. There
    are

    currently several commercially available IoT platforms that aim to greatly reduce
    manual

    labor. They are utilized in various functions of crop monitoring. Zhang et al.
    [31] propose

    a monitoring system for wheat diseases, pests, and weed. The system collects data
    from

    IoT terminals and attempts real-time monitoring and management of crops. Lee et
    al. [64]

    implement a predictive system for effective pest control and proper utilization
    of pesticides

    and fungicides. Correlation is calculated between the pests and weather data relevant
    to

    the control of pests. Chieochan et al. [32] implement IoT sensors to monitor the
    humidity

    of a mushroom farm. The system controls sprinklers and fog pumps and provides
    push

    notiﬁcations to the user. Benaissa et al. [33] implement Wireless Body Area Networks

    (WBANs) in conjunction with IoT to monitor the health of dairy cows. Timely detection
    of

    health issues in the cattle is a costly and challenging task that was automated
    in the study

    through the use of a Long-Range (LoRa) off-body wireless channel and IoT. Garcia
    et al. [65]

    implement WSNs to monitor the presence of pests such as snails. The system is
    also capable

    of predictive analysis based on environmental factors such as temperature and
    humidity.

    Giri et al. [34] introduce an automation framework called AgriTech for adequate
    uti-

    lization of water, fertilizer, and pesticides. AgriTech allows the farmer to monitor
    the ﬁeld

    and perform actions such as spraying through the use of a mobile device. Kodali
    et al. [66]

    present the model of an IoT-based smart greenhouse that automatically carries
    out irri-

    gation, temperature and air humidity control, and water management with the help
    of

    sensors. In the study done by Na et al. [35], an IoT-based remote monitoring system
    is

    implemented to monitor soil characteristics such as pH, temperature, and moisture
    content

    using a DS18B20 sensor. Accurate measurement of such parameters can enable better

    analysis and decisions regarding fertilizer usage and crops sown. Kamilaris et
    al. [36]

    introduce Agri-IoT, a framework for analyzing real-time data streams from heterogeneous

    sensors that also supports decision making. It supports integration for data streams
    from

    multiple domains, data analytics, and interoperability for smart farming applications.

    Akkas et al. [37] implement a prototype of a wireless sensor network made up of
    MicaZ

    motes that monitor environmental variables such as temperature, light, pressure,
    and

    humidity in a greenhouse. The study highlights the advantages of implementing
    a WSN

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    432

    over traditional cabling within an IoT platform, such as costs, vulnerability,
    and inability to

    relocate the wiring system. Nayyar and Puri [67] propose the use of an IoT-based
    agricul-

    tural stick integrated with Arduino technology and Solar technology to capture
    live data

    on physical factors such as temperature and soil moisture. The system provided
    accuracy

    of 98% in live feeds when tested on live agricultural ﬁelds.

    3.3. Decision Support Systems (DSS)

    Decision support systems (DSSs) add value to the smooth functioning of farming

    practices by providing support to farmers, guiding them to correct information,
    assist-

    ing in decision making, and laying out the best course of action for a given scenario.

    The farm-wide availability of production rules and expertise can drastically improve
    efﬁ-

    ciency. Canadas et al. [38] propose a real-time decision support system implemented
    for

    greenhouse tomatoes that facilitates better decision making by identifying sensor
    faults,

    maintaining climate variables, and performing disease identiﬁcation on crops.
    The study

    highlights the effectiveness of the DSS in climate control and minimizing crop
    wastage

    due to diseases. Taylor et al. [68] perform a case study on web of things that
    highlights

    other useful applications of support systems such as environmental and livestock
    moni-

    toring. Dos Santons et al. [39] present AgriPrediction, an IoT-based support system
    that

    utilizes LoRa wireless network range system and the ARIMA predictive model to
    better

    manage crop dysfunctions. The system presents promising results, and is also shown
    to

    be applicable in rural areas with sparse connectivity. Kukar et al. [40] present
    AgroDSS,

    a novel cloud-based decision support system that allows farmers to perform predictive

    analysis on their own farm data. The system was implemented to study pest population

    and provide a better understanding of interdependencies of various parameters
    in a sim-

    ulated environment. The study done by Antonopoulou et al. [41] provides an approach

    for continued sustainability by allowing farmers to select alternate crops for
    a region. The

    system can be accessed through mobile devices to increase adoptability amongst
    farmers,

    and supports the farmer throughout the cultivation process. Thakare et al. [69]
    provide

    a DSS for remote monitoring that integrates smart sensing and smart irrigation
    systems

    to monitor parameters such as temperature, moisture content, and efﬁcient water
    use.

    The study emphasizes the importance of smart farming with hydroponics, which allows

    farming in unsuitable soil and water conditions.

    3.4. Unmanned Vehicles

    The advancement in robotics has led to the development of autonomous vehicles,

    which are used extensively in farming for mechanical weeding, fertilizer spraying,
    and

    harvesting. Unmanned vehicles have shown to decrease human labor, improve productiv-

    ity, reduce costs, and increase accuracy of measurements. They could be further
    classiﬁed

    into UAVs and UGVs. UAVs are aircraft embedded with wireless sensors, transmitters,

    and/or cameras that can function autonomously or be controlled remotely. UGVs,
    on

    the other hand, are autonomous machines that operate while in contact with the
    ground.

    The use of lightweight cameras with autonomous aerial vehicles can allow for remote

    monitoring of crops, which can allow for better decision making. Bareth et al.
    [70] per-

    formed a study to examine the usability of UAV-based multi-temporal crop surface
    models

    for estimating plant height, estimating the biomass through height measurement,
    and

    combining vegetation indices for more accurate estimation. The results obtained
    from

    ﬁeld experiments imply that UAV-based RGB imaging can provide accurate modeling
    of

    physical parameters of the plant. The review study done by Roldan et al. [71]
    highlights

    the advancement of robots in smart farming for automation of labor-intensive tasks
    such as

    planting, harvesting, monitoring, inspection, and treating crops. Unmanned vehicles
    are

    able to collect information about the environment and navigate it by using machine
    vision

    systems. They implement Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies
    [72] to

    navigate precisely. UAVs provide an added advantage for remote sensing in the
    form of

    timely control and high spatial ground resolution. Remote imaging can capture
    several

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    433

    characteristics through different types of cameras, such as multispectral, thermal,
    and high

    spatial resolution RGB camera, as demonstrated in the study done by Matese et
    al. [73] to

    measure intra-vineyard variability and leaf temperature and to perform analysis
    of missing

    plants. UAVs possess the potential to obtain high spatial resolution imagery without
    being

    too affected by weather conditions.

    Lu et al. [74] perform species classiﬁcation in tall grassland with the use of
    high spatial

    resolution imagery obtained from a UAV, and show that the method obtains higher
    accuracy

    than other data from satellites. Tripicchio et al. [75] present a novel implementation
    of an

    RGB-D sensor integrated with UAVs to differentiate between different plowing techniques

    used on a ﬁeld. The system provides the functionality of computer vision, navigation,

    and data analysis and was shown to be a feasible technique for determination of
    soil

    characteristics. Moribe et al. [76] provide an effective and synchronized technique
    for

    measuring leaf temperature. Infrared thermometers attached to drones and sensor
    nodes

    integrate seamlessly with the WSN. Lottes et al. [77] propose a system that utilizes
    a UAV

    to detect vegetation, such as sugar beets, and performs feature extraction and
    maps the

    distribution of weeds and crops. UAVs provide an autonomous solution for monitoring

    large areas of agricultural land covering crops, livestock, and more. Unmanned
    vehicles

    function through the use of technologies such as robotics, IoT, remote sensing,
    and big

    data, and can automate labor-intensive tasks such as spraying, data collection,
    water

    management, weed mapping, irrigation, fertilization, crop monitoring and management,

    and ﬁeld-level phenotyping.

    3.5. Cloud/Edge Computing

    Given the vast amount of incoming data from various sources, a centralized approach

    to storing and managing large amounts of data is essential. A cloud-based architecture

    can allow for the necessary computation power to analyze the plethora of data
    obtained

    from the different types of sensors installed on a farm. Cloud computing facilitates
    ﬂexible

    storage and availability of data and resources, making them suitable for real-time
    implemen-

    tation. Rupanagudi et al. [42] propose a novel solution to pest control in tomatoes
    by crop

    monitoring using video processing, cloud computing, and robotics. Zhou et al.
    [43] present

    a cloud-computing-enabled spatio–temporal cyber–physical infrastructure (CESCI)
    to per-

    form comprehensive surface soil moisture monitoring, which can help reduce costs,
    increase

    agricultural productivity, and boost farmers’ net income. FIWARE is an open-sourced
    cloud

    platform that has shown potential in many smart farming applications. Kaloxylos
    et al. [44]

    present a cloud-based farm management system that utilizes the FIWARE architecture
    and

    was shown to be acceptable by farmers during evaluation. Corista et al. [45] introduce

    an IoT-based smart farming system built upon FIWARE that aims to control fruit
    quality

    during the entire fruit production chain. The system is developed using the vf-OS
    (virtual

    factory Operating System) platform, which integrates various applications and
    allows

    external producers and consumers to interact.

    Another IoT platform based on cloud and edge computing is proposed by

    Zamora et al. [46] and works in three tiers: the local plane collects data on
    crops, the

    edge plane monitors and manages the main precision agriculture (PA) tasks, and
    the cloud

    platform maintains records and performs data analytics. Fog computing, also called
    edge

    computing, is a decentralized computing architecture between the cloud and connected
    pe-

    ripheral devices and aims to enhance speed and performance [78]. Edge computing
    systems

    provide a decentralized approach to automation of tasks by using pre-loaded ﬁeld
    data

    from edge locations [79]. Thus, fog computing is a promising architecture for
    smart farming

    solutions, since it provides low latency and increased reliability for support
    systems [80].

    In case of real-time operational decision making, time is of the essence. Malik
    et al. [47]

    introduce a simulation platform that leverages fog computing to allow users to
    under-

    stand sensor deployment and data collection in a complete farming ecosystem. Thus,

    a cloud platform is essential if real-time analysis is to be performed. Use of
    additional

    data-driven approaches can be invaluable depending on the application. Cloud computing

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    434

    architecture can be used to manipulate large amounts of heterogeneous data arising
    from

    several sources. It can provide the necessary storage and computation resources,
    making it

    complementary to big data tools.

    3.6. Blockchain

    Blockchain technology provides new modes of interaction between parties in a supply

    chain. It is a distributed, immutable ledger that keeps a record of all transactions
    of digital

    assets over a network. It also has the capacity to improve food safety by providing
    traceabil-

    ity for purchased food products and monitoring for contamination. In order to
    avoid bias in

    the data collected from ICT and DT devices, it is important that data manipulation
    is made

    difﬁcult or impossible. The addition of a new record in a blockchain requires
    veriﬁcation

    from a peer-to-peer network, ensuring its legitimacy. Similarly, the majority
    should agree

    while making changes to records, making it difﬁcult for unauthorized individuals
    to alter

    the data. Thus, blockchain-based technologies for smart farming ensure that the
    data is

    correct, transparent, and traceable. In conjunction with smart contracts, which
    are protocols

    that are activated without human intervention when the terms of an agreement are
    met,

    blockchain technology can ensure timely payments [81]. Vangala et al. [48] propose
    an

    authenticated key agreement mechanism for smart farming that is based on smart
    contracts.

    The system is shown to provide more security and functionality than other authentication

    protocols. Patil et al. [50] present a security framework that combines blockchain
    technol-

    ogy with IoT devices and allows sharing of a digital ledger of transactions among
    the nodes

    on an IoT network. Lin et al. [51] introduce an ecological food traceability system
    that

    incorporates blockchain technology and IoT and aims to improve food safety while
    also

    establishing trust between the parties involved. The use of smart contracts is
    also consid-

    ered for the timely management of problems in the system. An ICT and DT e-agricultural

    system with blockchain technology that distributes water quality data over a network

    is proposed by Lin et al. [49]. They also present an evaluation tool that can
    be used to

    determine the speciﬁc requirements and suitability of this technology. A simulated
    model

    of blockchain technology is proposed by Widi Widayat et al. [82] and can be implemented

    in a smart farming environment. The parties in a smart farming system, namely
    farmers,

    food suppliers, and customers, are connected to a global blockchain network and
    appear

    as a node account in the smart contract. Another potential application of blockchain
    tech-

    nology is for providing agricultural insurance. Nguyen et al. [83] present a smart
    contract

    developed on NEO to provide drought-based crop insurance. This could be invaluable

    to farmers who work in extreme weather conditions, as it can reduce their damages
    and

    vulnerability while also avoiding excess evaluation costs.

    3.7. Big Data and Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    IoT devices and sensors capture various types of data from all over the ﬁeld that
    can

    then be analyzed through big data tools. Big data refers to larger and more complex
    datasets

    that consist of a greater variety of data from multiple data sources and can also
    be mined

    for opinions and information [84]. Data modeling techniques such as machine learning
    and

    deep learning can help enhance the entire food production cycle by performing
    predictive

    analysis, providing real-time decision making, and reﬁning the business model
    of the farm

    to cut loses. AI is a research sub-ﬁeld of computer science that utilizes robust
    datasets to

    solve problems by performing classiﬁcation or predictions based on the input data
    [85].

    Machine learning is a sub-ﬁeld of AI that allows models to learn from experience
    without

    being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a sub-ﬁeld of machine learning that
    further

    eliminates some of the human intervention required in training by automating feature

    extraction from larger datasets [86]. Currently, there are also several types
    of state-of-the-

    art conversational systems being used to assist farmers in agricultural operations
    [87].

    Table 2 summarizes some notable research works in smart farming that have performed

    image processing using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a class
    of

    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) that are used to perform classiﬁcation tasks
    on images

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    435

    by adjusting learnable weights and biases [88]. Table 3 provides a summary of
    various

    studies that have utilized other AI models in smart farming, along with their
    respective

    outcomes.

    AI can help reduce resource wastage through monitoring and predictive modeling.

    Varghese and Sharma [89] propose a hardware-based system that helps monitor factors

    such as moisture content in soil, humidity, and atmospheric conditions. The system
    also

    determines the appropriate crops for given soil and environmental conditions through
    the

    use of IoT and machine learning. Arvindan et al. [90] introduce an automated irrigation

    system that measures moisture content in the soil and provides remote control
    through

    an Android smart phone. This can help with the sustainable and automatic farming
    of

    certain crops that require different degrees of irrigation depending on their
    growth stage.

    Khaki et al. [91] introduce WheatNet, which is a CNN that collects ﬁeld observational
    data,

    such as wheat head counts. The system achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
    Root

    Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.85 and 5.19, respectively, in the wheat head counting
    task

    with fewer parameters, implying that the approach is robust and crucial for observation
    and

    decision making. Deep learning algorithms are used extensively to reduce crop
    wastage

    and optimize crop yield. The development of systems for accurate prediction of
    crop yield

    is essential, especially in developing countries, as it can secure food availability,
    prevent

    famine, and provide further assistance to the sustainable development of agriculture.
    Crop

    yield can depend on several factors, such as genotype, environment, etc. Wang
    et al. [12]

    present a deep-learning-based system for predicting soybean crop yields based
    on data

    collected from remote sensing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells were trained
    and

    tested on 4 years of Argentinian soybean harvest data. The model’s transferability
    was

    then tested by using soybean harvest results from Brazil. Khaki et al. [13] implemented

    Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for yield prediction of maize. The dataset consisted
    of

    the genotype and yield performance of 2267 maize hybrids. The best-performing
    model

    provided an RMSE of 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation
    for the

    validation dataset in imperfect weather conditions.

    Alfred et al. [92] provide a survey of the implementation of big data and machine
    learn-

    ing on paddy rice production in the Asia–Pacific region. The integration of sensors,
    satellites,

    and drones complements machine learning tools in improving productivity. Machine
    learn-

    ing tools utilize the big data collected from these devices for estimating rice
    yield [93,94],

    monitoring growth [94], and providing a smart irrigation system [95]. Kiruthika
    et al. [96]

    propose a system to detect paddy rice crop diseases such as leaf blast disease,
    brown spot

    disease, and bacterial blight disease. A Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
    is used to

    recognize disease from the input image; two classifiers are used for recognition:
    ANN and

    Support Vector Machine (SVM). ANN performs better than SVM, with a precision of
    90.60%

    and accuracy of an 93.33%. Dahane et al. [97] propose a novel EDGE–fog–IoT–cloud-based

    architecture that utilizes WSNs to support farming activities in three steps:
    data collection

    from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water level, etc.), data cleaning
    and

    storage, and predictive analysis through AI tools. Performance of Gated Recurrent
    Unit

    (GRU) and LSTMs on live data from three parameters is compared, with varying results.

    Jhuria et al. [9] propose a tool that utilizes ANNs to identify diseases in grapes
    and apples.

    Image processing is performed on an image dataset, and an accuracy of 90% is obtained
    based

    on color and texture. The study also provides a tool to determine the quality
    of fruit by

    weight. Bhange et al. [98] present a web-based tool for identification of fruit
    diseases trained

    on images of pomegranate fruit. The system processes an image uploaded by the
    user for

    parameters such as color and morphology, and classifies it as infected or non-infected
    using

    SVMs. Accuracy of 82% was recorded using the ‘morphology’ parameter in the experiment.

    Guo et al. [10] propose a system for identification of plant diseases through
    the use of deep

    learning. The model identifies black rot, bacterial plaque and rust diseases by
    implementing

    a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for leaf localization, the Chan–Vese algorithm
    for leaf

    segmentation, and VGG-13 [99] architecture for disease identification. This method
    provides

    an accuracy of 83.57%. In the study by Ferentinos [100], image classification
    through a VGG

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    436

    CNN is performed on a database of 87,848 photographs of leaves of healthy and
    infected

    plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, and a
    success rate of

    99.53% is achieved. Similarly, smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis is performed
    by

    Mohanty et al. [101] on the PlantVillage dataset consisting of 54,306 images of
    plant leaves.

    The GoogleNet architecture performed the best out of all models tested, resulting
    in an

    accuracy of 99.35% on 14 crop species and 26 diseases. The prevention of fruit
    tree diseases

    can also significantly impact overall agricultural production. Li et al. [102]
    conducted a study

    comparing the performance of three ensemble learning classifiers and two deep
    learning

    classifiers. The stacking ensemble learning classifier provides the highest validation
    accuracy

    of 98.05% and test accuracy of 97.34% on a dataset of 10,000 images of pear black
    spot, pear

    rust, apple mosaic, and apple rust. Figure 4 displays a generalized example of
    plant disease

    identification through the use of CNNs. The network takes input in the form of
    segmented

    images and classifies them as ‘Diseased’ and ‘Not Diseased’.

    Figure 4. Disease identiﬁcation through image processing.

    Due to the rapid increase in global meat consumption, technologies such as precision

    livestock farming [103] have become essential to ensure the quality of meat products
    and

    reduction of the environmental impact. AI tools can also prove beneﬁcial in livestock

    management by monitoring cattle health and behavior. Xu et al. [104] propose a
    system for

    individual identiﬁcation of cattle through face detection, performed using the
    RetinaNet

    object detection algorithm. Fine-tuning was performed on seven different CNN models,

    and transfer learning was used for this study. RetinaNet incorporating the ResNet
    50

    provided the highest average accuracy of 99.8% and an average processing time
    of 0.0438 s.

    Gjergji et al. [105] evaluated the following neural networks for the regression
    task of cattle

    weight prediction: CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)/CNN networks, recurrent

    attention models, and recurrent attention models with CNNs. CNNs were shown to

    provide the best performance with MAE of 23.19 kg, signiﬁcantly outperforming
    the top

    linear regression models, which reached an error of 38.46 kg. Jung et al. [106]
    present a

    deep learning-based system for classiﬁcation of cattle vocals and real-time monitoring
    of

    livestock. The voice parameter of cattle can signal valuable information such
    as gender

    of cattle, distress, and disorders in the cattle [107]. The voice was converted
    to Mel-

    frequency cepstral coefﬁcients (MFCCs) and given as input to a CNN for classiﬁcation

    with an accuracy of 91.36%. The accuracy increased to 94.18% when short-time Fourier

    transform-based noise ﬁltering was used to reduce background noise. In the context
    of

    smart farming practices, deep learning has also been shown to be widely beneﬁcial
    in

    the ﬁeld of aquaculture. Fish production contributes to a great portion of the
    food source

    in any area. Zhang et al. [108] propose the use of DNNs for ﬁsh identiﬁcation,
    species

    classiﬁcation, analysis of ﬁsh behavior, feeding decisions, and water quality
    prediction. The

    method provided an accuracy of 96% and recognition rate of 98% when trained on
    the Fish 4

    knowledge dataset, which contains 8487 images of ﬁsh with different conditions.
    The study

    done by Rohani et al. [109] proposes a model consisting of multi-layer perceptron
    (MLP)

    and SVM for classiﬁcation of rainbow trout as dead or alive. Both classiﬁers provided

    an average accuracy of 100% during the training phase and average of 99.45% during

    the testing phase. Zambrano et al. [110] propose the use of machine learning tools
    to

    forecast water quality variables such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and pond temperature.
    A

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    437

    comparison is performed between Random Forests (RF), ANNs, and multivariate linear

    regression, out of which RFs performed the best.

    CNNs can also be used to perform object detection and pattern recognition on images

    collected by aerial vehicles to detect anomalies such as weed clusters, standing
    water, etc.

    Chiu et al. [111] introduce ‘Agriculture-Vision’, a large-scale dataset of aerial
    farmland

    images, designed for semantic segmentation of agricultural pattern recognition.
    The dataset

    consists of 94,986 high-quality aerial images consisting of RGB and near-infrared
    (NIR)

    channels. The study proposed a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)-based model with
    a

    ResNet encoder to classify 9 ﬁeld anomaly patterns. The mean intersection-over-union

    (mIoU) was 43.40% for the validation set and 43.66% for the test set. The ﬁrst
    Agriculture-

    Vision Challenge [112] encouraged further development of novel algorithms for
    pattern

    recognition in agriculture. The challenge dataset consists of 21,061 aerial and
    multi-spectral

    farmland images, and six anomaly patterns were to be recognized in the task. The
    best-

    performing model, Residual DenseNet with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, introduced

    by Team DSCC, achieved a modiﬁed mIoU of 63.9%. The study by Kussul et al. [113]

    performs classiﬁcation of crops using MLPs, RFs, and CNNs. The dataset consisted
    of

    19 multitemporal scenes acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A RS satellites, and
    the

    highest classiﬁcation accuracy of 94.6% was achieved by 2-D CNNs. Another crop
    vision

    dataset for species classiﬁcation and detection is the CropDeep [114] dataset,
    which consists

    of 31,147 images and at least 1500 samples for each of the 30 classes. A baseline
    study

    showed the best performing model was ResNet50, with an accuracy of 99.81%. The
    study

    further suggests the YOLOv3 network with modiﬁcation to achieve higher accuracy
    on

    the dataset. Anand et al. [115] present ‘AgriSegNet’, which is a multi-scale hierarchical

    attention network for semantic segmentation using UAV-acquired aerial images for
    IoT-

    assisted precision agriculture. The mIoU on the test set of the Agriculture-Vision
    dataset

    for the six anomaly classes are: Background: 78.10%; Double Plant: 46.40%; Planter
    Skip:

    8.60%; Standing Water: 61.20%; Waterway: 44.90%; Weed Cluster: 50.20%.

    In this subsection, we emphasize several points regarding the opportunities provided

    by AI in the ﬁeld of smart farming. Image processing is of great importance to
    the agricul-

    tural sector. Images captured by UAVs, UGVs, satellites, and sensors need to be
    analyzed so

    that relevant insight can be extracted from them to assist in farm operations.
    Depending on

    the requirements, different types of cameras, such as visible spectrum, NIR, hyperspectral,

    or multispectral may be used. In conjunction with several ICTs, AI can efﬁciently
    perform

    functions such as crop monitoring, livestock monitoring, disease detection, pest
    detection,

    etc. Predictive modeling can help farmers to prepare for extreme weather conditions
    and

    market ﬂuctuations, thereby lowering their vulnerability. Current state-of-the-art
    models

    have provided promising results, implying that further research in the area with
    more

    advanced AI tools can help to bridge the gap in food production.

    4. Initiatives Worldwide

    This section includes the various research initiatives that have been undertaken
    in

    smart farming in the European Union [119] and across the world. The initiatives
    usually

    employ several of the ICTs and DTs discussed in Section 3. The European Union
    has

    funded many projects to allow for the integration of ICTs and DTs into the agricultural

    sector. Crop monitoring is one of the major functions performed in farms that
    utilize

    smart farming tools. Table 4 provides an overview of the recent projects concerning
    the

    implementation of SF tools for crop monitoring that have been undertaken in the
    European

    Union. Table 5 lists the projects that perform other functions such as harvesting,
    water

    management, satellite imagery, and more. The corresponding technologies for each
    project

    have also been listed along with their application. The Echord++ [120] project,
    which

    lasted from 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2018, involved various ﬁeld operations
    such as

    monitoring, harvesting, and grafting for crops such as tomatoes, asparagus, and
    peppers.

    Cloud computing is utilized by many projects that require monitoring operations.
    These

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    439

    include Vinbot [121] (crop monitoring and yield prediction in a vineyard), Ermes
    [122] (crop

    monitoring for rice), Fractals [123] (monitoring, disease detection, and fertilization
    of olive

    trees), and more. The importance of UAVs and UGVs is apparent, as they have been
    utilized

    in several projects. Implementations of UGVs include Vinerobot [124] for a vineyard,

    Sweeper [125] for harvesting peppers, Flourish [126] for monitoring and spraying
    sugar

    beets and sunﬂowers, PANtHEOn [127] for monitoring hazelnuts and water management,

    and Romi [128] for crop monitoring and weed management. UAVs are utilized for
    crop

    monitoring of rice in Ermes [122], potatoes and vineyard in Mistrale [129], and
    more.

    Seamless communication between different technologies has been executed through
    the use

    of WSNs, such as Water-Bee [130] and Figaro [131], for the purpose of water management.

    There have been several research projects on smart farming taken up all over the

    world, in part inspired by the positive outcomes of the EU projects. Table 6 provides
    a

    summary of government projects and start-ups that focus on the development of
    innovative

    solutions for smart farming. Some projects, such as the Villages of Excellence
    (VoE),

    have been launched in collaboration between two governments to ensure the sharing
    of

    technology and expertise and provide better outcomes for both. Smart irrigation
    plays

    an important role in ensuring crop sustainability in dry areas. Startups such
    as Madar

    Farms [141] and Responsive drip irrigation [142] aim to provide smart irrigation
    solutions

    to tackle water challenges and food security in the United Arab Emirates and the
    United

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    440

    States respectively. SunCulture [143] is a Kenyan AgriTech company that provides
    solar-

    powered irrigation systems for smallholder farms, and also provides the option
    of a drip

    irrigation system. In Morocco, the government introduced the Green Generation
    2020–2030

    strategy [144], which focuses on the digitization of agriculture through initiatives
    such as

    the installation of solar pumps for irrigation. Food security and sustainability
    are of great

    concern worldwide. Startups such as AbyFarm [145] in Singapore aim to implement
    urban

    farming by employing ICT and DT tools such as IoT and blockchain. Lack of resources

    in rural areas could be a hindering factor in crop yield. Ossian Agro Automation
    [146] is

    an Indian company working towards rural automation and the development of wireless

    automation systems. All year round production of crops can be achieved by vertical

    farming, which is the practice of growing crops in many layers in a controlled
    environment.

    Ground vertical farming [147] in Lebanon implements vertical farming and aims
    to reduce

    water wastage by re-circulation. Figure 5 displays the various smart farming projects
    taken

    up across the world, classiﬁed according to their primary function.

    Figure 5. Smart Farming initiatives worldwide

    In several developing countries, there is a lack of government-funded projects.
    The

    initiative is rather taken up by individual startups, with the goal to provide
    assistance to

    farmers, conduct further research, and educate farmers and learners about the
    potential

    of agricultural technology. There is an increased interest amongst consumers,
    who want

    to ensure that the end product they receive is unadulterated. Public opinion in
    Europe

    skews in favor of healthy products grown with minimum pesticides. Consideration
    of the

    socio–economic impact of smart farming projects is also necessary. Certain participating

    farms have reported average cost savings of over €5000 and reduction of climate
    impact by

    10% [148]. Thus, these initiatives have been greatly beneﬁcial to farming operations
    by de-

    creasing costs, reducing greenhouse emissions, and improving soil conditions.
    The projects

    contributed signiﬁcantly to their objectives of reducing resource wastage, environmental

    impact, and energy consumption, and demonstrated measures to mitigate issues resulting

    from climate change and the shortage of skilled labor.

    5. Sentiment Analysis

    In order to ensure successful integration of new tools and technologies available
    for

    smart farming, it is necessary to understand how knowledgeable the general public
    is

    about the topics and how the innovations are perceived. Public sentiment can be
    a strong

    determinant of whether or not a project is approved for implementation in an area
    [166].

    It can also be indicative of the various socio–economic, behavioral, and cultural
    issues

    that arise by the advancement and implementation of such technology [28,167].
    In light of

    this, we performed sentiment analysis on the comments of YouTube videos pertaining
    to

    smart farming technologies. This section provides details about the dataset, experimental

    methodology, and the results and analysis of the experiment.

    5.1. Dataset

    The dataset was constructed by scraping YouTube comments left by users on 16 YouTube

    videos that were relevant to our study [168–172]. The videos were selected by
    searching

    the relevant keywords, such as ‘smart farming IoT’, and then ﬁltering the ones
    with most

    views and comments. Table 7 provides a list of the video titles, the channels,
    upload date,

    and the total number of likes and views on each video. For this study, only comments

    in English were considered. A total of 7311 comments were included in the dataset
    from

    videos about smart farming.

    5.2. Experiment

    Two approaches were used for performing sentiment analysis. In the first approach,
    two

    annotators assigned one of the following six labels to the comments: ‘Praising’,
    ‘Queries’,

    ‘Suggestions’, ‘Undefined’, ‘Hybrid’, and ‘Opinion’. Cohen’s kappa coefficient,
    which is a

    measure of inter-rater agreement, was calculated on the ratings of the two annotators.
    The

    value of the kappa statistic ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 implying only a chance
    agreement and 1

    implying perfect agreement between the two annotators. The formula to calculate
    Cohen’s

    kappa for two raters is:

    κ = po − pe

    1 − pe

    = 1 − 1 − po

    1 − pe

    (1)

    where: po = the relative observed agreement among raters, and pe = the hypothetical

    probability of chance agreement.

    A brief description of these labels is given in Table 8, along with the total
    number of

    comments for each label, and an example of the label from the dataset. Table 9
    gives the total

    counts of each of the six labels that were assigned to the comments collected
    from the videos.

    The second approach was to apply transfer learning to perform surface level sentiment

    analysis using the pre-trained Pattern library for Python. Pattern library can
    be used to

    perform various natural language processing tasks such as parsing, N-gram generation,

    and more. Polarity of a given text ranges from 1 to −1, with 1 representing a
    highly positive

    sentiment and −1 representing a highly negative sentiment. The subjectivity ranges
    from

    0 (Objective) to 1 (Subjective). It provides a measure of factual information
    or personal

    opinion in the comments, with 1 being subjective and 0 being objective. For example,
    for

    the following comment in our dataset: ’Fantastic. We need a lot of that here in
    Australia;

    suffering from drought; really bad water management by those in authority etc.’
    , the

    polarity was calculated as −0.1499 and subjectivity was 0.7833. The negative value
    of

    polarity indicates that the sentiment expressed by the comment was negative, whereas
    the

    value of subjectivity is closer to 1 suggesting that the comment was mostly subjective.

    5.3. Results and Analysis

    In this section, we detail the results of our experiment and analyze our ﬁndings.

    Evaluation has been conducted separately for the two approaches through user-based

    analysis and transfer-learning-based analysis. Table 10 records the number of
    comments

    under a video and the results obtained from sentiment analysis. The value of mean
    polarity,

    mean subjectivity, and Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient is listed for each corresponding
    video

    serial number.

    5.3.1. User-Based Analysis

    In user-based analysis, the mean Cohen’s kappa was calculated to be 0.9617, which

    shows high inter-rater reliability. Figure 6 displays the Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    for each

    video with respect to the mean value. The value is highest at 1 for videos no.
    5, 9, and 12,

    indicating perfect agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The
    value

    is lowest at 0.8141 for video no. 2 titled ‘Europe has the best regenerative farmers
    in the

    world’, implying a slight disagreement between the assigned labels. The high value
    of

    kappa coefﬁcient implies that the categories assigned by the annotators are correct.

    Figure 7 plots the correlation matrix between the frequency of the six labels.
    We can

    see the highest degree of correlation is 0.96 between the following labels: ‘Opinion’
    and

    ‘Suggestion’, and ‘Queries’ and ‘Hybrid’, indicating that the frequency of one
    increases

    with the other. The lowest degree of correlation is 0.81 between ‘Hybrid’ and
    ‘Undeﬁned’,

    suggesting that all labels show a relatively positive correlation amongst each
    other.

    A word cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data
    where

    the frequency or importance of each word is indicated by its size. It can help
    us highlight

    and analyze signiﬁcant textual data points. Pre-processing of the comments was
    performed

    to remove stop words and punctuation from the text. Figure 8 displays the word
    clouds

    for the comments collected from videos of serial number 1–8. We can see that on
    the word

    cloud in Figure 8a, which is for the video titled ‘How Japan Is Reshaping Its
    Agriculture By

    Harnessing Smart- Farming Technology’, ‘Japan’ is one of the most frequent and
    important

    words in the text. Similarly, for Figure 8g for video no. 7 on the bottom left
    titled ‘7 Israeli

    Agriculture Technologies’, the most signiﬁcant word is ‘Israel’. Figure 9 displays
    the word

    clouds for the comments collected from videos of serial number 9–16. The word
    9b on the

    top left for the video titled ‘Singapore’s Bold Plan to Build the Farms of the
    Future’ has

    ‘Singapore’ as the most prominent word. This indicates that several comments for
    these

    videos included some text about the country in which the technology was implemented.
    For

    videos demonstrating a particular technology, such as No. 7: ‘Solar Panels Plus
    Farming?

    Agrivoltaics Explained’; No. 8: ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept
    (Full

    Version)’; and No. 14: ‘RIPPA The Farm Robot Exterminates Pests And Weeds’, the
    name of

    the technology (solar, tractor, robot, respectively) is of great prominence. Table
    11 provides

    a list of the top ﬁve most-relevant words in the comments dataset for each video,
    along

    with their respective frequencies.

    5.3.2. Transfer-Learning-Based Analysis

    The results of sentiment analysis using the Pattern library are discussed in this
    sub-

    section. Mean polarity and mean subjectivity are plotted opposite each other in
    Figure 10.

    The overall polarity for all 7311 comments is 0.2092, suggesting that the overall
    sentiment

    is slightly positive. The overall subjectivity of all comments is 0.4352, implying
    that the

    comments were close to being neutral. Subjective statements generally contain
    personal

    opinion, emotion, or judgment, whereas objective comments are factual information.

    larity determines the degree of positive or negative sentiment in the text. The
    highest

    mean subjectivity score was 0.5480 for video no. 13 titled ‘Simply Fresh—India’s
    Largest

    State Of The Art Precision Farm’, followed by 0.5369 for video no. 11 titled ‘Smart
    Vertical

    Farms in Sharjah’. This shows that the comments were of a more opinionated nature,
    rather

    than being factual. The lowest mean subjectivity score was 0.2915 for video no.
    9 titled

    ‘IOT Smart Plant Monitoring System’, indicating that mostly facts were discussed
    in the

    comments for this video. The score suggesting higher objectivity could be because
    the video

    is discussing technical details about an IoT platform rather than explaining widespread

    innovative concepts such as precision farms and vertical farms. The comments collected

    from video no. 8 titled ‘The CNH Industrial Autonomous Tractor Concept (Full Version)’

    resulted in the lowest mean polarity of 0.0919, indicating that the user sentiment
    was

    generally neutral. The highest mean polarity of 0.4460 was achieved for video
    no. 13 titled

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    ‘Simply Fresh—India’s Largest State Of The Art Precision Farm’, showing that user
    attitude

    was generally positive towards the state-of-the-art precision farm highlighted
    in the video.

    In the investigation of user sentiment towards smart farming and precision agriculture,

    the main objective was to analyze user opinion, which is the voice of masses.
    During

    compilation of the dataset, it was observed that videos providing more in-depth
    and

    case-study-based information about smart farming tools did not receive many views
    and

    comments. This could be because the general public is not well-informed about
    novel

    technology in the farming sector, as asserted in Section 6. The majority of the
    comments

    were collected from videos about broader topics. The Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient
    indicated

    that the labels assigned by the two annotators were mostly in agreement and valid.
    The

    mean values of polarity and subjectivity in the comments was calculated through
    the

    Pattern library, and the results suggest that there is a varying degree of subjectivity
    amongst

    the comments. The polarity suggests that user opinion was mostly positive in the
    comments

    analyzed. Thus, it can be safely inferred that training and education programs
    can increase

    the visibility of innovations in smart farming, allowing the general population
    to form a

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    449

    well-informed opinion on the risks and beneﬁts. Positive user sentiment can then
    serve as

    a catalyst towards faster adoption of such tools.

    6. Challenges

    There has been a signiﬁcant increase in the number of smart farming initiatives
    being

    taken up around the world, with promising results. However, with the advent of
    new,

    innovative technologies there are always some unseen risks and associated challenges.

    The agricultural sector has greatly impacted the environment by taking up about
    40% of

    the world’s available land [173] and consuming approximately 70% of the water
    [174].

    Climate change and the growing population further exacerbate food and water scarcity,

    making sustainable food production a challenging task. Thus, it is critical that
    current

    agricultural practices need to evolve to ensure the efﬁcient use of land and water
    resources.

    To elaborate further on Research Question 2, we discuss the various challenges
    that hamper

    the adoption of smart farming in the following bullet points:

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    450

    1.

    Training and awareness: Lack of technical expertise by the farmers implementing

    new technology is a major setback to smart farming. Das et al. [28] conducted
    a

    study to understand the views of Irish farmers towards adoption of cloud computing

    and smart farming technologies. Surveys and interviews conducted with 32 farmers

    revealed that the rate of adoption was higher among younger farmers and lower

    amongst older farmers, who were hesitant to use new technology and preferred

    traditional farming. The digital divide has to be reduced by providing guidance

    and training to the farmers [175]. Lack of knowledge about the technology results

    in greater skepticism towards its adoption amongst farmers, who may not realize

    the value of the tool or consider it an unsuitable ﬁt for their farm. In this
    current

    study, we formed a dataset of YouTube comments related to smart farming operations

    and performed surface level sentiment analysis of them. During the data collection

    process, it was observed that very few comments were left under videos that provided

    a technical and detailed framework for a smart farming project. Comments were

    mostly collected from videos explaining broader topics, such as ‘Vertical Farming’.

    This indicates that there is a general lack of awareness about these technologies
    and

    their applicability to farming.

    2.

    Technical considerations: Fixed and moving sensing technologies require further

    improvements to be able to withstand extreme weather conditions in order to remain

    fully functional [176,177]. Edge node devices may be battery dependent and run
    out

    of power during operation [178,179]. Data is collected from various sensors and
    can be

    analyzed through IoT platforms. There is a requirement for data storage, as there
    is a

    huge amount of data being generated from IoT devices. IoT has improved connectivity

    of all operations by leaps and bounds, but it does come with the added concern
    of

    data privacy and security [180]. It also exposes the smart farming environment
    to

    cybersecurity threats, which could result in signiﬁcant loses [181]. Data encrypting

    in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) also presents a signiﬁcant challenge
    for

    farmers [182].

    3.

    Costs: The costs associated with sensors needs to reduced so that they can be
    imple-

    mented in small-scale farms as well. The solution needs to be designed speciﬁcally

    for the project in question, and also needs regular updates and management. Farmers

    may hesitate in implementing such technologies as they could create issues and
    cause

    further losses instead of providing beneﬁts. Research and development costs for
    the

    implementation of such tools are also steep. There is also a signiﬁcant amount
    of cost

    associated with data transmission within a smart farm [183]. Market uncertainty
    adds

    substantial risk to ensuring a sustainable income for farmers, as proﬁt margins
    are

    getting increasingly smaller. Farmers in small-scale agricultural ﬁelds are hesitant

    to use upgraded technology because of the high initial costs, perceived risks,
    and

    complexity of the system.

    4.

    Government support: The laws and regulations in the area where smart farming is

    being considered for implementation play a huge role in its eventual success or
    failure.

    The local governments are responsible for taking initiatives and providing funding

    and support training programs for the adoption of such tools [184]. Several successful

    initiatives taken up in the European Union [119] and across the world [144] have

    highlighted the importance of the effort taken up by regulatory bodies.

    5.

    Ethical considerations: Human safety is also a concern in the operation of unmanned

    vehicles [185]. Collisions with the ground or other objects may also cause damage

    to the vehicle. It is also essential that the UAVs be ﬂown in unrestricted areas.
    Cur-

    rently, it is not clear where the accountability for the actions taken by autonomous

    vehicles lies. Data need to be uploaded to cloud systems in a secure manner, keeping

    regulations in mind. It is necessary for smart farming operations to be transparent
    so

    that they are more trusted and accepted. The ownership of agricultural data is
    a huge

    liability that needs to be kept in mind. There are also legal and ethical considerations

    with the potential mishandling and misuse of these data [186]. Animal welfare
    is

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    451

    also a concern while making use of autonomous robots to perform functions such
    as

    milking [187].

    6.

    Regional considerations: Lack of proper infrastructure, such as roads, can be
    a major

    hurdle towards the advancement of smart farms, as the necessary resources and

    technology will not be successfully transported. There is limited availability
    of inter-

    net in rural areas, where smart farming could be of greater signiﬁcance. Standard

    protocols and frameworks for wireless communication cannot be deﬁned, as the

    requirements rely heavily on the speciﬁc use case [188]. Further, communication

    protocols implemented within the smart farm may only provide coverage over small

    areas [189].

    7. Discussion

    This review study was conducted to assess the challenges and opportunities in
    smart

    farming by exploring current state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs, analyzing global projects,
    and

    understanding the perception of the general public towards such innovative practices.
    The

    two hypothesis stated at the beginning of the study have been supported by the
    ﬁndings of

    the research questions, which have been answered as follows:

    Hypothesis 3. ICTs and DTs can be used in the agricultural sector to make signiﬁcant
    improve-

    ments in several farming applications.

    The following research question were crafted to accept or reject the hypothesis:

    1.

    What are the state-of-the-art ICTs and DTs currently used in smart farming?

    Over the last decade, several smart farming projects have been launched across
    the

    world that were powered by technologies such as IoT, wireless sensor networks,

    unmanned vehicles, etc., as detailed in Section 3. The potential use cases for
    each

    technology are discussed in Section 4, although several projects utilize more
    than one.

    Several research projects in the European Union [18] and worldwide have also been

    discussed. The development of precise sensors enables the capture of data with
    higher

    accuracy, thus enabling better quality analysis and decision making [14]. Decision

    support systems can guide the farmer with operational decisions about choice of
    crop,

    frequency of fertilizer use, better utilization of resources, and more [69]. Autonomous

    vehicles take care of labor-intensive tasks, thus freeing up farmers for other
    important

    tasks [77]. Communication between various IoT devices through a WSN can allow

    for effective monitoring of the farm throughout the day, making it easier for
    the

    farmer to make operational decisions [36]. Blockchain technology can ensure that
    the

    supply and raw materials purchased are of good quality and there is no adulteration

    taking place [48]. DTs such as artiﬁcial intelligence also have an array of potential

    applications in smart farming, building upon the availability of massive amounts

    of heterogeneous data from sensors [20]. We have discussed the use of machine

    learning and deep learning for disease identiﬁcation in crops, fruits, and cattle
    in

    Section 3.7. AI has also shown great potential in optimizing resource utilization
    by

    automating timely irrigation, performing preemptive actions if a certain parameter

    crosses a threshold, and predictive analysis of weather and crop conditions [188].
    AI

    can also be used to identify optimal conditions for growing crops and preventing
    crop

    wastage. Image processing is of great relevance in smart farming, as there have
    been

    several studies that implement CNNs [98]. Image processing can be used for livestock

    management, guiding the decision-making processes of harvesting robots and pest

    and weed elimination drones. It can also enable precision farming by collecting
    data

    from sensors and deploying resources accordingly [9].

    Hypothesis 4. There are certain signiﬁcant challenges to the widespread adoption
    of smart farming

    tools, such as lack of awareness about the topic amongst the general population.

    AgriEngineering 2022, 4

    452

    The following research questions are explored in this context:

    1.

    What are the challenges associated with the widespread adoption of smart farming

    tools?

    Despite the increasing number of smart farming projects being launched all over

    the world, there still exist many factors that hinder the widespread implementa-

    tion of such tools [6,188]. As we have discussed in Section 6, the limitations
    can be

    broadly categorized as lack of training and awareness, technical considerations,
    costs,

    government support, ethical considerations, and regional considerations. Technical

    difﬁculties arise due to the inability of current systems to withstand extreme
    weather

    and atmospheric conditions, being too bulky and costly to implement, and not provid-

    ing up-to-the-mark accurate data [176]. Another challenge is the proper infrastructure

    required for storing and processing large amounts of data collected from sensors
    [181].

    The privacy and security of this data is of great importance. Regional limitations

    could be the lack of infrastructure and connectivity. Smaller farms in rural areas
    could

    beneﬁt greatly from the use of smart farming tools. However, most smart farming

    practices require the use of internet connectivity, which is sparse in rural areas.
    Other

    factors that hamper the development of smart farming may include lack of techni-

    cal expertise by farmers, insufﬁcient incentives provided by the government for
    the

    implementation of such practices, and skepticism of farmers towards the beneﬁts
    of

    smart farming [28]. General awareness amongst farmers is generally low and can
    be

    increased through training programs. Although smart farming tools are generally

    black-box techniques, farmers making use of them still need to understand their

    operations so that they can consider the process reliable. Cost considerations
    could

    also make farmers skeptical towards installing new tools, as the upfront expenditure

    may be too much [183].

    2.

    What are the current opinions and expectations of the digital user with regard
    to

    smart farming?

    In order to better understand user perception of smart farming technologies [166],

    we performed sentiment analysis on relevant English comments collected from

    YouTube [168], as detailed in Section 5. The comments were collected from 16 different

    videos that detailed innovative farming solutions. Then, two different approaches

    to observe user sentiment were utilized. In the ﬁrst approach, comments were man-

    ually labeled by two annotators into one of the following six categories: Praising,

    Queries, Suggestions, Undeﬁned, Hybrid and Opinion. Cohen’s Kappa coefﬁcient,

    which is the measure of inter-rater reliability, was calculated as 0.9617. This
    shows a

    high rate of agreement between the labels assigned by both annotators. The labels

    also show high positive correlation with each other, as depicted in Figure 10.
    Word

    clouds created for each video in Figures 8 and 9 highlight signiﬁcant words, such
    as

    ‘technology’, ‘farming’, ‘solar’, etc. In the second approach, polarity and subjectivity

    were calculated for each comment using Pattern library for Python. The polarity

    score ranges from −1 (negative) to 1 (positive) and indicates whether the sentiment

    is positive or negative. The overall polarity was calculated as 0.2092, indicating
    a

    slightly positive sentiment. The subjectivity score ranges from 0 (objective)
    to 1 (sub-

    jective) and indicates the degree of factual information or opinion in the statement.

    The overall subjectivity was calculated as 0.4352, suggesting that the comments
    were

    slightly objective. This implies that the comments discussed were fact-based rather

    than opinionated. However, only a rudimentary study was performed to determine

    user sentiment, and better results can be achieved using state-of-the-art models
    for

    sentiment analysis. In the brief overview of user sentiment conducted in the study,

    we noticed lack of user comments on informative and technical videos about smart

    farming platforms, indicating that a knowledge gap and a digital divide exists
    for

    such technologies [175], which can be detrimental to their widespread adoption.
    The

    general attitude of users towards smart farming technologies is superﬁcial, as
    the

    public is not well-informed about these topics.

    8. Conclusions

    Ensuring a sustainable food supply for the ever-increasing global population has

    become a necessity due to the unprecedented changes in the environment. The agricultural

    sector must update its practices in light of the worsening strain on land and
    water resources,

    and data-driven approaches provide such an opportunity to ensure sustainability.
    This

    study provided an overview of ICTs and DTs in automating and streamlining farming

    operations, and demonstrated how smart farming can improve crop yields by monitoring,

    disease prevention, automation of sowing and harvesting, etc. Examples of primary

    technological tools available for smart farming are IoT, unmanned vehicles, remote
    sensing,

    predictive analysis through big data, and so on. This shift towards data-driven
    approaches

    enables farming facilities to utilize available resources for maximum yield. The
    study also

    presents various challenges that are associated with large-scale implementation
    of smart

    farming practices, such as poor connectivity in rural areas, insufﬁcient funds
    and skilled

    labor, skepticism from farmers, concerns with data privacy, and more. To analyze
    the

    attitude of the public towards implementation of smart farming, we performed sentiment

    analysis on comments from YouTube channels related to smart farming. Preliminary

    ﬁndings in both user-based and transfer-learning based opinion mining suggest
    that a

    better understanding of smart farming tools would help the public in forming an
    informed

    opinion. Further advances are required to improve precision, cost, and efﬁciency
    of robots,

    sensors, and unmanned vehicles before they are readily adopted. Keeping the barriers

    to adoption for smart farming techniques in mind, the future scope of research
    would

    be to develop techniques that provide greater adaptability, ensure food sustainability,

    reduce cost, and counter the harmful affects of climate change on agriculture.
    Greater

    connectivity in rural areas could accelerate the integration of ICTs in smallholder
    farms,

    allowing them to prepare for unprecedented changes in farming conditions. Further

    research and investigation of the possible uses of DTs and ICTs is necessary to
    understand

    the challenges and opportunities in smart farming. A detailed sentiment analysis
    using

    advanced language models and inclusion of non-English comments can also provide
    greater

    insight into the expectations and opinions of digital users towards innovative
    farming

    solutions. Multidisciplinary research also needs to be conducted to elucidate
    other socio–

    economic, environmental, and technical factors that impede development and adoption
    of

    such innovations.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart

    irrigation system

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    2 Related work

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 2: Components of the proposed system.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    639

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Pi that acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the
    actuators. For example,

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    from sensors and the second one is for controlling the actuators in the ﬁeld.
    Depending on the sensor type

    with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling

    Arduino uno joins with actuators in the ﬁeld and controls (turn on/oﬀ) them in
    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when
    it does not host the

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

    \ With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources\
    \ of data generation have increased\nexponentially. The use and processing of\
    \ this generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The\
    \ concept\nof a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making\
    \ in the various aspects of daily life and also\nimprovement in the traditional\
    \ systems. In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include\
    \ devices used for\ndata collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis,\
    \ and decision making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital\n\
    role in smart city applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many\
    \ challenges when dealing with such voluminous\nand high-speed generated data,\
    \ such as semi-structured or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time\
    \ responses, and so on.\nProbabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved\
    \ as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete this\n\
    tedious task of handling big data with real-time response. PDS has been used in\
    \ many smart city domains, including healthcare,\ntransportation, the environment,\
    \ energy, and industry. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review\
    \ of PDS and its\napplications in the domains of smart cities. The prominent domain\
    \ of the smart city has been explored in detail; origin, current\nresearch status,\
    \ challenges, and existing application of PDS along with research gaps and future\
    \ directions. The foremost aim of\nthis paper is to provide a detailed survey\
    \ of PDS in smart cities; for readers and researchers who want to explore this\
    \ ﬁeld; along\nwith the research opportunities in the domains.\nKeywords: Smart\

    \ in the ﬁeld of computing and data was the new term. There was\nan evolution\
    \ of relational databases between the 1980s and 1990s. The internet and IoT are\
    \ clusters of unstructured,\nsemi-structured, and structured data. In the 1990s,\
    \ there was slow or no internet in most cities. These were ordinary\ncities. Generally,\
    \ ordinary cities are deﬁned as human settlements without the use of the latest\
    \ technology at all.\nThe need for processing, storage, and analysis is required\
    \ beyond the human and technical infrastructure. This huge\nvolume and variety\
    \ of unstructured data and untapped information is spread across the networks.\
    \ The core part of\nApache Hadoop is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),\
    \ consisting of the storage part, and the MapReduce\n*Corresponding author. E-mails:\

    \ [4]. As the data is increasing day by day, to access this data in an efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwell-structured manner, the government and public sector require technologies\
    \ and expertise to convert urban cities\nto smart cities. The research interest\
    \ in smart cities has continuously increased in the current and coming years and\n\
    it is economically justiﬁed by the progress of state-of-the-art technologies [21].\
    \ New inventions like the internet, the\ncloud, and IoT have increased data generation\
    \ speed as well as introduced a variation in data. The smart city impacts\ntowns\
    \ and cities around the world with the evolution of the internet and the use of\
    \ new technologies. But in the\ncurrent context, rapid population growth is creating\
    \ challenges for the government and its services. So, smart cities\nare the most\
    \ acceptable solution to such situations of better metropolitan living conditions\
    \ [146]. The emergence of\na smart city has the potential to manage all these\
    \ issues (Fig. 1). But, expeditious urbanization also quickly presents\na major\
    \ challenge worldwide. Though movement from rural to metropolitan areas is unavoidable,\
    \ that’s why cities\npersist in facing many challenges like transport, healthiness,\
    \ air quality, agriculture, and many more [87]. Smart\ncities face many issues\
    \ like pollution, health assistance, overburden on both public and private sectors,\
    \ trafﬁc, etc.\ndue to the rapid growth in population in metropolitan cities [126].\
    \ In this connection, the problems associated with\nthese issues in cities require\
    \ ingenious solutions. They include human strength, ingenuity, and collaboration\
    \ with\ndifferent stakeholders [117].\nIn a recent survey, the United Nations\
    \ estimated that the world’s population will grow by 32% from 2015 to\n2050 and\
    \ that the population will grow by 63% in the metropolitan area. Several researchers\
    \ also stated that by\n2030, more than 60% of the population will be living in\
    \ cities, with the southeast United States experiencing the\ngreatest growth [74,275].\
    \ The extensive and rapid growth of information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\
    has provided possible solutions and mechanisms to various problems in metropolitan\
    \ areas [13] this approach can\nbe used as a tool [267] to increase the effectiveness\
    \ of the city system. In this regard, the thinking or mentality of\nhumans is\
    \ required to be changed, like a smart mind, to raise the standard of living for\
    \ sustainability in the smart\ncity. Furthermore, remote monitoring and management\
    \ systems are being used to improve energy efﬁciency in smart\ncities [316].\n\
    Since the advent of the coronavirus and its declaration as a worldwide epidemic,\
    \ all public and private sectors have\nbeen affected. This virus has affected\
    \ daily routines and activities like education, communication, daily movement,\n\
    labor, and many more. Some public and private sectors have worked with 50% manpower\
    \ on alternative days. Many\nsectors, like IT companies, schools, etc. have run\
    \ Work From Home (WFH). Even doctors have their OPD or patients\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n231\ndiagnosed online.\
    \ The key solution to this epidemic’s key problems for daily life can be solved\
    \ through the smart\ncity. Jasim et al. [129]made a wise decision to help society\
    \ and expand the resources available to individuals in areas\nsuch as healthcare,\
    \ communication, transportation, education, and many others.\nThe Government of\
    \ India (GoI) has a long-term vision for smart cities. GoI deﬁnes smart cities\
    \ as a mission\nto conduct monetary growth and improve the quality of life by\
    \ allowing the development of regional zones and\nutilizing technology that directs\
    \ to smart results. They also designed a workbook “Making a City Smart: Learnings\n\
    from the Smart Cities Mission” with activities in each section to help cities\
    \ plan their smart city journeys. Creating\na smart city incorporates lessons\
    \ from the smart city mission to clarify what, why, and how a smart city works.\n\
    Consolidated at the national level, 100 smart cities have proposed to undertake\
    \ 5,151 projects worth Rs. 2,05,018\ncrores in 5 years from their selected dates.\
    \ New ﬁnancial innovations are built on investment plans. The distribution\nis\
    \ estimated to be from a variety of sources as follows: 6480 projects worth Rs.\
    \ 185,905 Cr are tendered, 5845\nprojects worth Rs. 157,369 are in work order\
    \ stages and 3145 projects worth Rs. 53,256 Cr are completed. The\ncities like\
    \ Gwalior, Thiruvananthapuram, Satna, Udaipur, New Town Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar,\
    \ and Ahmedabad are\ncovered under various smart city projects [183].\n1.1. Role\
    \ of big data in smart city\nBig Data basically stands for velocity, volume, and\
    \ variety of information, which includes complexity in terms\nof speed of data\
    \ generation, the structure of data (variety), and the amount of data to be generated.\
    \ Big data has\na number of deﬁnitions and’V’ principles to make big data processing\
    \ clear and accurate [118]. Anything beyond\nthe human and traditional infrastructure\
    \ and techniques required to store, process, and analyze big data provides\nthe\
    \ solutions for it. With the advent of new technologies such as IoT, ICT, sensors,\
    \ and so on, big data systems are\nbecoming more efﬁcient in sophisticated data\
    \ infrastructures [170].\nThe role of big data in smart cities is heavily inﬂuenced,\
    \ particularly in recognizing patterns, analyzing, and\nprocessing data collected\
    \ from various IoT devices (Fig. 2). Every city is evolving towards being a smart\
    \ city. These\ncities combine basic needs with high technology for a carefree\
    \ and basic lifestyle. To extract important information\nfrom such huge data sets,\
    \ big data analysis is the key [7]. The data collected from different sensors\
    \ and devices in\na smart city’s various gates installed in the city is used for\
    \ better decisions. This growth in data requires efﬁcient\nstorage and handling,\
    \ which is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96]. Big data has different\
    \ effects in\ndifferent parts of the city.\nThe protection of the general public:\
    \ The security and privacy of citizens is the main concern in smart cities.\n\
    To protect their citizens from anything mishappening within the city, various\
    \ analyses of geographical data can be\ndone. This can all be recorded through\
    \ Close Circuit Televisions (CCTVs) and sensors installed on street lights or\n\
    trafﬁc lights. An enormous amount of data is developed and signiﬁcant expansion\
    \ is required when the desired data\ntransforms the city into a considerably safer\
    \ location.\nUrbanism: Cities are investing heavily in transforming to become\
    \ smart cities. The current needs of the city\ncan be identiﬁed through the effective\
    \ use of data, which can aid in identifying areas that require development and\n\
    improvement. As a result, cities can invest by volunteering in areas where they\
    \ are needed.\nFig. 2. Inﬂuence of big data in smart cities.\n232\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nTransportation: After\
    \ Covid-19 both public and private transportation are affected after COVID-19.\
    \ Most people\nrely on their own reasoning to get to work and so on. The congestion\
    \ on the roads is increasing, so the risk of\naccidents or anything else going\
    \ wrong has also increased. To handle or manage trafﬁc on roads, the system requires\n\
    big data and well-structured data. Large data sets will also help reduce risks.\n\
    Sustainable Growth: This is also the main part of a smart city. For sustainable\
    \ growth, a huge amount of past and\npresent data is required. Likewise, storing\
    \ this data is one of the challenges for the smart city. This data is updated\n\
    on a daily basis. Data is a special factor in determining the impact of improvement\
    \ in the city.\nInfrastructure: To maintain sustainability, smart city infrastructure\
    \ needs to improve consistently. Obviously, for\nthis data, a smart city is required\
    \ and used in a good manner to improve or maintain the infrastructure.\nSo, the\
    \ role of big data in smart cities is signiﬁcant for efﬁcient and quick results.\
    \ Big data is the brain of the\nsmart city. The main challenge is the lack of\
    \ awareness of using this data to create smart solutions to fulﬁll the\nrequirements\
    \ of citizens. Citizens are the main stakeholders of smart cities. So, to improve\
    \ the standard of living,\nthe developer needs new data processing tools and techniques.\
    \ There is computational, time, and space complexity\nby using the deterministic\
    \ data structure. Probabilistic Data Structures are one of the key solutions for\
    \ smart storage\nand searching of data in real-time scenarios.\nThe traditional\
    \ methods may also produce accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off\
    \ in space and time,\nwhich is not acceptable due to the massive amount of data.\
    \ Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional\ndata structure is\
    \ shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation solution,\
    \ which may be\nor may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction.\
    \ Since PDSs have some probabilistic compo-\nnents, they are efﬁcient in reducing\
    \ the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,\n\
    storing nonstructural data, helping with fast retrieval, and making approximate\
    \ predictions. Hash functions are used\nto represent these data structures [246].\
    \ The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\ntesting,\
    \ and cardinal counting. Low memory requirements and good processing speed are\
    \ two distinct features of\nPDS [136].\nThe extensive review of this paper has\
    \ found the key challenges faced during the handling of big data in smart\ncities.\
    \ In this regard, the PDS and its variants have provided the key solutions to\
    \ these challenges and also found new\npossibilities. In this paper, the importance\
    \ of big data in smart cities, generation (Section 2), architecture (Section 4),\n\
    and the detailed application (Section 7) of smart cities, worldwide running smart\
    \ city projects (Section 5) and\ncommonly used PDS (Section 6) have been discussed.\
    \ During the survey, it was found that big data has a high\ninﬂuence on smart\
    \ cities. PDS has evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart\
    \ cities to complete\nthis tedious task of handling big data with real-time response.\
    \ PDS has been used in many smart city domains,\nincluding healthcare, transportation,\
    \ the environment, energy, and industry. This paper has thoroughly investigated\n\
    the prominent domain of smart cities, including the origin, current research status,\
    \ and existing applications of PDS,\nas well as research gaps and challenges (Section\
    \ 10).\n2. Generations of smart cities\nTo improve the standard of living there\
    \ is a need to change from rural to urban. Governments and citizens are\nincreasing\
    \ their attention in terms of technologies and new startups in smart cities. The\
    \ concept of a smart city for\nurban transformation has radically changed over\
    \ the years. The generation of smart cities has been concise (Table 1).\nBased\
    \ on analysis and study, several researchers have divided the technical advancement\
    \ in smart cities into different\ngenerations (generations 1.0–5.0) (Fig. 3) [140,265]:\n\
    Generations 1.0: – When the technology vendors started implementing their own\
    \ solutions in cities, it was deﬁned\nas the ﬁrst technology-driven smart city.\
    \ Due to the inﬂuential role of big corporations like IBM and Cisco, they\nare\
    \ criticized for their technology concerns. To improve the efﬁciency of public\
    \ and private services, the creators of\ntechnology development are encouraged\
    \ to use their own solutions in cities.\nGenerations 2.0: – Indirectly concerned\
    \ with citizens, issues like healthcare, transport, air quality, and water qual-\n\
    ity are arising. The technology and tools were developed to address such issues\
    \ in generation 2.0. The participation\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    \ in decision-making in cities [276]. The quality of life and local administration\
    \ was mea-\nsured by modern technology. For this, cities presented agendas and\
    \ schemes that support the execution of trendy\ntechnology.\nGenerations 3.0:\
    \ – Thus, the modern city represents the whole connected ecosystem that integrates\
    \ ICT into a\nsmart city. The modern city building programs were organized and\
    \ the local public participated. It was the time\nwhen the government acted as\
    \ a facility providing services to citizens. Here also, citizens are competent\
    \ to represent\ntheir thoughts and innovative ideas [251]. Here also, the urban\
    \ space is designed for users and their engagement.\nGenerations 4.0: – By adopting\
    \ 4.0 industrial transformation, the beneﬁts of smart cities are valued to outweigh\n\
    city costs through city establishment [298]. This generation of smart cities illustrates\
    \ the most useful parts of the\npast; for example, technology generation 1.0,\
    \ individual performance 2.0, and 3.0 engagement. Smart City Genera-\n234\nM.\

    \ by Industry Revolution 4.0, and they develop new technologies. In this, control\
    \ is over the use\nof existing resources and infrastructure.\nGenerations 5.0:\
    \ – In this generation 5.0, the concept of cognitive computing is introduced for\
    \ developing cities.\nIt is purely based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Systems\
    \ are self-learned from past and present knowledge that\nreﬂects changes in real-time\
    \ like interest, barriers, etc [228]. Each public and private service can be handled\
    \ by an\nindependent agent, which gives fast and efﬁcient results. Generations\
    \ 5.0 is the main focus on decision-making for\nurban development by using behavioral\
    \ analysis and AI [264].\n3. Ranking of smart city\nWorldwide, there are different\
    \ ranking systems based on distinct parameters. Out of these, the most popular\
    \ are,\n“Liveable City Index (LCI)” [204],“intelligent cities” [292], “sustainable\
    \ cities” [28], “global cities” and “competi-\ntiveness cities” [266].\nThe center\
    \ smart city index is used for ranking by researchers’ organizations such as Smart\
    \ City Observatory, in\ncollaboration with IMD competitiveness [44]. To manage\
    \ the infrastructure of smart cities like transportation, trafﬁc,\nstreet light\
    \ etc. the technologies like AI and IoT may be used. Muhammad A.R. Tariq et al.\
    \ [266] tries to identify\nthe preferences of people living with different city\
    \ ranking systems, and the top ﬁve cities in the last three years are\ngiven in\
    \ Table 2. Another ranking criteria is that Juniper Research, an analyst ﬁrm based\
    \ in the UK, has ranked the\ncities as smart cities on various factors like transportation,\
    \ energy, healthcare, connectivity between urban areas, etc.\nShanghai, Seoul,\
    \ Barcelona, Beijing, and New York are among the top ﬁve global cities considered.\
    \ These cities\nmainly work on real-time data, which helps in managing the assets\
    \ and future-prooﬁng them. They also cover the\ndowntown to provide 5G and 99%\
    \ of ﬁber coverage across the city. To fully ﬁll, the needs of residents, these\
    \ smart\ncities are using the “Citizen Cloud App”, which uses ambient technologies\
    \ like AI, Cloud Computing, and Big Data,\nwhich come under Smart City Generation\
    \ 5.0 [20].\n4. Architecture of smart city\nSmart city development includes the\
    \ integration and implementation of digital and IoT. IoT provides essential\n\
    elements of smart cities like data production, data management, and application\
    \ management. The number of smart\ncity architectures proposed over time [226].\
    \ In Fig. 4 the most generic architecture has been represented with four\nlayers.\
    \ All these four layers are integrated with security modules because of sensitive\
    \ data.\nSensing layer: – The bottom-most layer of the architecture represents\
    \ the sensing layer or data collection layer.\nIoT devices are used to build this\
    \ layer. This layer uses various IoT devices like actuator, Zigbee, Radio Frequency\n\
    Identiﬁcation (RFID) sensors etc. to sens these various parameters like humidity,\
    \ temperature, pressure, etc. Data\ncollection on mobile devices is a huge burden\
    \ on the sensor layer, which resides under the structure. This layer\ncaptures\
    \ real-time data from sensors [26,192].\nTransmission layer: – With a variety\
    \ of communication technologies, the transfer layer carries data to higher\nlevels.\
    \ This layer acts as the spine of any smart city architecture. In this layer,\
    \ the various communication networks\nlike 3G, 4G, LTE, the internet, and satellite\
    \ also help in mobile networks. Fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication\nis embedded\
    \ in the base station for transferring huge wireless trafﬁc [100].\nData management\
    \ layer: – This layer resides between the transmission and application layers\
    \ and is the brain of\na smart city. The functions of this layer are deception,\
    \ editing, analysis, storage, and decision-making [195]. The\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n235\nFig. 4. Layered architecture\
    \ of a generic smart city [243].\nstored information in this layer is used to\
    \ provide services to various applications in the top layer. The primary role\n\
    of this layer is to preserve data integrity, data puriﬁcation, expansion, and\
    \ optimization [285]. As the ﬁnal function\nof the data management layer, the\
    \ conclusions obtained are transferred to the application layer for proper use.\n\
    Application layer: – An application layer is required to connect the data management\
    \ layer with urban residents.\nThis is the topmost layer of this architecture.\
    \ This layer provides assistance to the users. It operates applications\nthat\
    \ use IoT, for example, smart homes, grid distribution, smart transport, weather\
    \ forecasting, etc., and intelligent\nhealth [317]. As this layer is directly\
    \ connected to the end-users, the satisfaction of users may increase with the\n\
    improvement of services provided.\n5. Projects contributions related to smart\
    \ city\nThe research on smart city buildings has been accomplished worldwide.\
    \ Hence, the concept of smart cities was\nintroduced. The research was conducted\
    \ by various international organizations, universities, and businesses. Various\n\
    countries, like the US and China, have also accomplished research in intelligent\
    \ urban design [156]. The smart city\nencourages the planning of metropolitan,\
    \ oversight through ICT, IoT, CC etc [157]. The evaluation method proposed\nby\
    \ IBM is very focused on building standards and relevant standards. So far, the\
    \ various initiatives, contributions,\nachievements, and projects in smart cities\
    \ are listed in Table 3 [106].\n6. Probabilistic data structure\nThe exponential\
    \ increase in data production services is most evident in the last decade, due\
    \ to the emergence\nof ICT, IoT, etc. The traditional methods may also produce\
    \ accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off in\nspace and time,\
    \ which is not acceptable for a massive amount of data. Due to the huge and limitless\
    \ evolution, the\ntraditional data structure is shifted to PDS for retrieval and\
    \ storage. PDS has given an approximation solution, which\nmay be or may not be\
    \ the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction. Since PDSs have some\
    \ probabilistic\ncomponents, they are efﬁcient in reducing the time or space trade-offs.\
    \ PDS also plays a key role in big data\nprocessing, storing nonstructural data,\
    \ helping in fast retrieval, and making approximate predictions. In general,\n\

    \ are widely\nused by various researchers in their design and development. These\
    \ are very useful for handling and storing large\namounts of data in an appropriate\
    \ and efﬁcient manner. Hash functions are used to represent these data structures\n\
    [246]. The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\
    \ testing, and cardinal counting. Low\nmemory requirements and good processing\
    \ speed are two distinct features of PDS [136].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n237\nFig. 5. Overview of PDS [246].\n6.1. Bloom\
    \ ﬁlter\nIn 1970, the concept of Bloom Filter (BF) was introduced by Burton H.\
    \ Bloom [36]. The BF is a probabilistic\nmodel, a highly efﬁcient random data\
    \ structure. It is used to reduce space problems and is an effective way to query\n\
    the membership of any item in an extensive set. The BF consists of an array with\
    \ m-bits which is initialized to 0 and\nk hash functions. The hash function k\
    \ is used to query an element. To ﬁnd the position of elements in the array, put\n\
    them into the k hash functions.\nFor insertion into BF, the ﬁrst element has been\
    \ added using a hash function (Fig. 6). For elements to be inserted,\nhash functions\
    \ are computed and the corresponding bit is set with that index. In the query\
    \ process, an element is\nchecked to see whether it is a member of the set or\
    \ not. For querying, check all bits correspond to indexes. If all the\nbits are\
    \ set high, then the answer is “maybe” and if at least 1 bit is not set, then\
    \ the answer is “deﬁnitely not”.\nProperties of BF:\n– It is impossible to false\
    \ negative, but if the queried locations are set to 1, then a false positive is\
    \ possible (in\nstandard BF).\n– To process an element, the query time is O (k),\
    \ where k is the hash function.\n– The size of the union and intersection of BF\
    \ is the same and to implement hash functions, the operations bitwise\nOR and\
    \ AND are used.\nFig. 6. Insertion in bloom ﬁlter [246].\n6.2. Count min sketch\n\
    Count-min sketch (CMS) was introduced by G.Cormode and S.Muthukrishna in 2003\
    \ [64]. It is a streaming algo-\nrithm for probabilistic sub-linear space [244].\
    \ Its functionality is also hashing-dependent like BF. CMS is different\nfrom\
    \ BF in only that it uses a 2-dimensional array to handle a given data set, while\
    \ BF uses a 1-dimensional array\nfor representing hashed data.\n238\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 7. Count min\
    \ sketch [246].\nThe basic data structure of CMS consists of a 2-D array (d *\
    \ w) where w is used for storing the counts and it\ndepends on the maximum outputs\
    \ given by hash functions, and d is the hash function h(1 . . . d) and it is pairwise\n\
    independent. To update the counts, calculate the hash positions with the d-hash\
    \ functions. The values determined\nby the hash function are used to get the actual\
    \ occurrence of an item in an array. The minimum of the determined\nvalues by\
    \ the hash function is the actual occurrence of an item (Fig. 7). The space used\
    \ by CMS is equal to the count\nof (d * w). With the use of CMS and appropriate\
    \ values of d and w, we get efﬁcient results with very few errors.\nUse more hash\
    \ functions for more accurate results.\nProperties of Count-Min sketch:\n– It\
    \ supports union operations on cells.\n– The query time to process is O (k), where\
    \ k is a hash function.\n– The accuracy improves when an item appears multiple\
    \ times, with a higher frequency, or with heavy hitters.\n– CMS also has various\
    \ applications like compressed sensing, stream processing, frequency tracking,\
    \ etc.\n6.3. Locality sensitive hashing\nIn 1998, Indyk and Motwani introduced\
    \ the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [123]. LSH works on the principle\nof using\
    \ low-dimensional space for high-dimensional data. The hash functions are selected\
    \ very carefully, which\nhas more chances of collusion in the hash bucket. The\
    \ LSH has three phases. These are: the ﬁrst phase is the\npreprocessing phase\
    \ where different measures are used for mapping data, in the second phase, hash\
    \ tables are\ncreated, and in the ﬁnal phase, these hash tables are used for recognizing\
    \ identical items (Fig. 8). The similar items\nare located in the same bucket,\
    \ so the whole data is located in buckets [104].\nFig. 8. Locality-sensitive hashing\
    \ framework [246].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n239\nA LSH family lshF() is deﬁned with probabilities P1 and P2, an approximation\
    \ factor c ⩾ 1, a threshold R ⩾ 0,\nand for a metric space M = (M, d). This function\
    \ lshF() maps the metric space to buckets sϵS with a set of functions\nh: M →\
    \ S [287]. The following conditions must be satisﬁed for p, qϵM and hash function\
    \ h chosen uniformly at\nrandom from F :\n– if d(p, q) ⩽ R, then h(p) = h(q) (i.e.,\
    \ p and q collide) with probability at least P1,\n– if d(p, q) ⩾ cR, then h(p)\
    \ = h(q) with probability at most P2.\nA family is interesting when P1 ⩾ P2. Such\
    \ a family lshF() is called (R, cR, P1, P2)-sensitive.\nProperties of Locality\
    \ Sensitive Hashing:\n– The same items are hashed to the same buckets as different\
    \ items, so LSH hashes the items a number of times.\n– Cosine, similarity, and\
    \ hammering distances are examples of item LSH functions.\n– The functions of\
    \ LSH are not limited to the same standard measures commonly used for data retrieval,\
    \ overlap,\nand dice coefﬁcient [54].\n6.4. Quotient ﬁlter\nMichael Bender et\
    \ al. proposed a quotient ﬁlter (QF) in 2011 [30]. It uses less memory to sample\
    \ an element that\nis a member or not of the set. Basically, it has performed\
    \ four operations add, delete, is a member, is not a member\non the set. QF uses\
    \ the single hash function for ﬁngerprint generation with a size of p (in bits).\
    \ For insertion of\nelement in QF, remainder fr ← (fp(x) mod 2r) and quotient\
    \ fp ← (⌊fp(x)2r⌋) are calculated, where fp is the\nindex of bucket and fr is\
    \ value inserted in fp bucket. QF gives the speciﬁc result to the query that is\
    \ either probably\nyes or deﬁnitely not the element of the set. There is some\

    \ city application\nThe smart city needs to majorly focus on activities like healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, street lights. Intelligent technologies\nlike ICT, IoT, sensors etc.\
    \ and analysis of data are the key requirements to improving the citizen’s standard\
    \ of life.\nThe important application of smart city (Fig. 10) are smart healthcare,\
    \ smart trafﬁc management system, smart\nemergency system, smart street light,\

    \ job opportunities, education, and many more to move from one city to\nanother\
    \ even in an epidemic like Covid-19. In smart cities data is fetched and analyzed\
    \ through IoT devices like\nsensors, actuators etc. [102]. Further, this data\
    \ is used to improve social services, infrastructure, and decision-\nmaking. This\
    \ information plays an essential role in real-time application and services in\
    \ urban areas [202].\nFig. 10. Applications of smart city.\n7.1. Smart healthcare\n\
    Healthcare is an important service to the growth and development of any smart\
    \ city. In recent years, smart health-\ncare has emerged with the growth of ICT.\
    \ It is a process of managing one’s health by a couple of doctors themselves\n\
    or virtually [112]. The traditional medical system needs to be transformed into\
    \ smart healthcare in order to become\nmore efﬁcient and convenient for patients.\
    \ With the emergence in technologies like ICT, IoT, AI etc. the healthcare\nindustry\
    \ have transformed from old-fashioned like interaction between doctor-patient\
    \ to new i.e. remote health mon-\nitoring [113]. IBM (Armonky, NY, USA) came up\
    \ with the idea of smart healthcare in 2009 [269]. There are some\nchallenges\
    \ while transformation into smart healthcare, these are: healthcare systems, equipment\
    \ are under enormous\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in\
    \ smart city\n241\npressure, healthcare data is growing exponentially, inform\
    \ decision-making process with detailed information, ad-\nditional wisdom for\
    \ nurses, challenges in consolidating and resolving legal issues, making the patients\
    \ run from\none department to another for collecting reports, accurate precision\
    \ diagnostics, and right measurements. With the\nincrease of population, these\
    \ challenges are also heightened with demanding health services. The preponderance\
    \ of\nindustrialized nations is facing vital difﬁculties regarding the quality\
    \ and cost of numerous healthcare and wellbeing\nservices [3]. Due to limited\
    \ resources, some cities are deprived of proper healthcare services. In view of\
    \ this, there is\na need for new systems, smart healthcare. In the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ healthcare, devices, the internet, and IoT can connect\npeople with each other,\
    \ as well as manage healthcare activities and resources. Smart healthcare is one\
    \ of the highest\nlevels of knowledge building in the medical ﬁeld [108]. To collect\
    \ information dynamically, liking between insti-\ntutions and healthcare, smart\
    \ healthcare is used to take advantage of advanced technologies, devices like\
    \ wearable,\nmobile internet, and the IoT. Smart healthcare can reduce workload\
    \ at the information desk, and also Help patients\nand their wards.\n7.1.1. Evolution\
    \ of healthcare\nVarious authors and researchers in their studies are categories\
    \ the healthcare system in different generations\n(Fig. 11) (Healthcare 1.0–Healthcare\
    \ 5.0). The different functionality evolution of healthcare system are discussed\n\
    as:\nHealthcare 1.0: – In the year between 1970–1990 the ﬁrst evolution ‘Healthcare\
    \ 1.0’ was introduced. Due to\nlimited digital resources, it was restricted to\
    \ paper documentation. It was mainly focused on improving the efﬁciency\nof health\
    \ services and a reduction in paperwork. The revolution transformed the home remedy\
    \ system and the\nuntrained physicians who provide paternal care into a more sophisticated,\
    \ intelligent, and data-driven system that\ncan be called the “medical complex”.\
    \ In the 1830s the British government start piping the water to homes, when\n\
    the plague was caused due to drinking of polluted water [114,171]. Shortly thereafter,\
    \ the scientiﬁc vaccine theory\nwas established [48]. In the 19th century, a better\
    \ environment for healthy living integrated measures for sanitation,\ninfection\
    \ control, vaccination, and epidemiology surveys have been created.\nHealthcare\
    \ 2.0: – The era of Healthcare 2.0 was between 1991–2005, the main focus was to\
    \ combine with digital\ntechnology. Industrial machinery kept working and changing.\
    \ In the 20th century to increase the productivity of\ncheap products, the automobile\
    \ industry introduces the concept of mass production [120]. The healthcare system\n\
    also follows the same. At the end of the 19th century, few large pharmaceutical\
    \ companies were formed [214]. A few\nyears later various antibiotics were introduced,\
    \ with the advent of mass-industrial manufacturing technology [299].\nAlso at\
    \ that time in medical education importance was given to both clinical training\
    \ and basic science education\n[93]. Hospitals are expanding, being provided by\
    \ more specialists, and doctors are being trained to deal with more\npatients\
    \ with complex conditions. The main focus is on building a part of healthcare\
    \ 2.0 [58]. The second version of\nhealthcare is aimed at improving productivity\
    \ and data sharing. The focus on information sharing is not limited to\nwithin\
    \ the organization but among a group of other healthcare providers. The new version\
    \ is entrenched in response\nto the symptoms, illness, and needs of the individual.\
    \ Information was shared with other organizations with privacy\nand security.\
    \ It was electrical energy-oriented.\nHealthcare 3.0: – The era of healthcare\
    \ 3.0 was between 2006–2015. In this evolution, Electronic Health Records\n(EHRs)\
    \ were introduced. It helps the doctors in accessing patient records through cloud\
    \ gateway. It was a step\ntowards creating a value-based model based on Telecommunication\
    \ and information communication technology\n(TICT), which provides database enhancement\
    \ and additional data efﬁciency to prevent medical-related problems\n[1]. The\
    \ advent of microcontrollers in the 1980s allowed for the production of small\
    \ computers and fast-tracking\nenvironments, as well as large data storage [127,255].\
    \ With advanced computer technology, tomography jumped\nfrom single images to\
    \ redesigned images, and doctors could diagnose ulcers with more information and\
    \ diagnose\ndiseases earlier. Doctors are provide evidence-based medicine after\
    \ diagnosis disease [85]. They have additional\ninformation gathered from e-libraries\
    \ using fast computer technologies. Healthcare 3.0 focused on providing emer-\n\
    gency care and was able to ensure preventive care before the onset of illness\
    \ or symptoms of the disease. Internet\nchanges learning because much medical\
    \ literature is available at e-libraries. In Healthcare 3.0 major concern is to\n\
    use technologies like BDA and IoT-based wearable devices along with advanced E-Medical\
    \ record databases.\nHealthcare 4.0: – From 2016 to 2020, the era of Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 was introduced with patient-centric healthcare\nservices with the advent\
    \ of new technologies and IoT devices [261]. This healthcare evolution is inspired\
    \ by ‘In-\n242\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\nFig. 11. Health generation.\ndustry 4.0’ by establishing personalized\
    \ healthcare platforms and augmented virtualization [271]. It was focused on\n\
    smart devices, involving capabilities of empowering data analytics with ML, DL,\
    \ AI, and IoT for the detection of\ndiseases, [151]. It is the successive approach\
    \ of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Patients get medicine from suppliers by using their\n\
    websites and also get medical assistance through blogs [240]. In this case, patient\
    \ records are shared with healthcare\nprofessionals via an e-Health record over\
    \ the cloud or on the LAN, where many patients and healthcare workers\ncan be\
    \ connected. It helps the physician to access patient records anywhere and also\
    \ communicate with fellow doc-\ntors for better treatment. However, data sharing\
    \ has introduced new challenges such as authentication, security, and\nauthority,\
    \ and so on, [280]. New hands & a new brain, which includes robots, mini-laboratories,\
    \ wearable devices,\nand 3D printers. Every device works faster and more efﬁciently;\
    \ illnesses can be quickly diagnosed using a drop of\nblood; custom-designed surgery\
    \ of body joints can be performed, and bone framework can be prepared using 3D\n\
    printing [280]. Healthcare 4.0 also involves technologies like robotic surgery,\
    \ CC, CPS, information security, and\nmany more.\nHealthcare 5.0: – The era of\
    \ healthcare 5.0 began in 2020 and is going on. This machine includes AI features\n\
    such as a robot nurse, a smart IoT device, and a 6G network speed. [186]. With\
    \ latency (10–100 ms) and reliability\n(99.9999%) [150], and based on ultra-high\
    \ accuracy for remote connections [314], 6G communication addresses\nreliability\
    \ and latency issues in smart cities. Why not 5G? According to [141] 5G will fall\
    \ short of meeting future\ndemands for big data connections such as holographic\
    \ communications (e.g., 3D video conferencing), games, and\ntelesurgery. This\
    \ evolution comes up with device-to-device, machine-to-machine, and human-to-machine\
    \ commu-\nnication. The human-machine cooperation and participation improve the\
    \ diagnosis system and fast results. This\nsystem is more secure than its predecessors.\
    \ A blockchain-based architecture for healthcare applications that auto-\nmatically\
    \ collects data and removes unreliable systems from external companies. The system\
    \ is not dependent on a\nsingle-point failure due to a decentralized network [150].\n\
    The evolution of the healthcare system has also been succinct in Table 4.\nM.\

    \ in smart healthcare are research institutes and hospitals,\npatients, and doctors.\
    \ Smart healthcare has many beneﬁts, like disease prevention and monitoring, diagnosis\
    \ and\ntreatment, hospital management, health decision-making, and medical research.\
    \ ICT, IoT, AI, 5G internet, big data,\nand modern biotechnology are the foundations\
    \ of the intelligent healthcare room, according to [108]. Doctors use\nLaboratory\
    \ Information Management system, Electronic medical record etc. for managing health\
    \ data [207].\n7.1.2. Challenges in smart healthcare\nTrusted Communication: –\
    \ Many medical devices experience network failure, which is unacceptable when\
    \ real-\ntime data access is required. It is challenging to maintain connections\
    \ on mobile devices such as wearable devices\nwhile moving anywhere a patient\
    \ walks, crossing boundaries, and covering areas. In mobile devices, switching\n\
    the network to the most powerful available signal also affects data generation.\
    \ The different amounts of data are\ngenerated while switching to the network,\
    \ which is dependent on the roaming relationship between the SIM provider\nand\
    \ the location of the feed. As there are many subcategories for mobile connectivity,\
    \ we should also adjust the\nnetwork type and location to the value, speed, audio,\
    \ and video required by our device.\nCyber security: – Cyber security is one of\
    \ the challenges when we talk about smart healthcare. As it requires\ninternet\
    \ access and IoT devices, the data may be stolen or attackers may attack data\
    \ or modify the data. So the ﬁrst\npriority of the healthcare system is to ensure\
    \ the privacy of patients and their data. There are some private IoT-based\nnetworks\
    \ (e.g. APNs, VPNs, and IPsec protocol) that are available, which create private\
    \ areas only accessible by\nauthorized users or devices.\nScalable Platforms:\
    \ – The smooth functioning of a smart healthcare system, a scalable platform is\
    \ required. For\nthe effectiveness of a smart healthcare system to be enhanced,\
    \ it must be integrated and supported seamlessly with\npatients and their big\
    \ data. So, the authorized professionals, physicians, and patients use the devices\
    \ and system\neasily for monitoring remotely.\nCost: – Meet, the requirements\
    \ of the healthcare system are also cost-effective. The healthcare system may\
    \ take\nless time for decision-making and information gathering. So, it must require\
    \ new tools and techniques for efﬁcient\nstorage and retrieval.\n244\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nData Availability:\
    \ – The availability of data is facing some issues like resource management and\
    \ device identiﬁ-\ncation. Systems don’t need any redundancy; they only need consistent\
    \ data. So it requires identifying the resources\nand storage management with\
    \ new technologies in healthcare systems.\nData Security: – While accessing the\
    \ data, it is mandatory that only the authorized user can access the concerned\n\
    data. It still needs to be improved.\nUnique Identiﬁcation: – In the healthcare\
    \ system, it is required to uniquely identify patients by their doctor and\nvice\
    \ versa. This is required for providing or getting the best and correct treatment.\n\
    Privacy Issue: – This is one of the major issues while we are talking about big\
    \ data and IoT devices in a smart\ncity. Many kinds of research provide many tools\
    \ and techniques. But still, it needs to be improved.\nDevice Communication: –\
    \ Machine to machine, a device to machine, and human to machine communication\
    \ is\nchallenging. Patients need a quick response to their records, medical tests,\
    \ and medical reports. A 5G/6G network\nis required for the smooth transformation\
    \ of data communication. It is cost-effective, and also required some tools\n\
    and algorithms for privacy and data exchanges.\nData Integrity: – Ensuring the\
    \ integrity of healthcare data is also challenging because it is important for\
    \ providers\nto use it in making decisions about patient care. It is also required\
    \ for information exchange between doctors and\npatients.\n7.1.3. Application\
    \ of PDS in smart healthcare\nDue to the rapid growth in the population and an\
    \ epidemic, hospitals are overburdened and overcrowded. Patients\nare struggling\
    \ to ﬁnd the doctor’s ofﬁce and pre-body check-up center. Patients and their guardians\
    \ also face the\nissue of understanding medical terms, and they need someone’s\
    \ help to get the proper information. For that, a\nproper healthcare system is\
    \ required with the use of new technologies like sensors, IoT, ICT, etc. On one\
    \ hand, the\nIoT has beneﬁted patients, physicians, hospitals, and health insurance\
    \ companies. On the other hand, challenges\nhave increased. Because sensors and\
    \ IoT have produced massive amounts of data, To handle this data, the following\n\
    is the application of PDS which may be used in smart healthcare systems:\nData\
    \ Processing: – The data generated by devices is homogeneous or heterogeneous,\
    \ semi-structured or unstruc-\ntured, which will result in the trafﬁc load on\
    \ switches. The storage capacity of switches is limited, so the perfor-\nmance\
    \ of routing may be compromised. A scheme ‘BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom Filter-based\
    \ Secure rule-space\nmanagement’ is proposed for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\
    \ [245]. The scheme uses two self-dependent hash\nfunctions for security checks\
    \ and also manages the network resources to handle the trafﬁc in data. Smart healthcare\n\
    systems provide system-assistance analysis for dedicated medical care to patients.\
    \ The security of this data is in dan-\nger. The data security features are improved\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access to information in healthcare systems.\nBF is\
    \ also useful in data transmission elimination [300].\nData Sharing: – The Garbled\
    \ Bloom ﬁlter is used to support authentic search results and secure data sharing\
    \ for\nmultiple users [260] in the Veriﬁable Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (VMKSE).\
    \ This scheme supports single-\nkeyword search. The author also compares his programme\
    \ with a modern solution to evaluate its effectiveness. This\nscheme helps in\
    \ doctor-patient data sharing. The multi-keyword search veriﬁcation mechanism\
    \ is introduced based\non pseudo-random and it is IoT-cloud-enabled for healthcare\
    \ data systems [283]. The mechanism also takes care\nof authentication and advanced\
    \ encryption with advanced privacy of data. BF is used in a secure two-dimensional\n\
    calculation protocol, to compare a unit of characters and record [277].\nData\
    \ Security and Privacy-Preserving System: – The use of IoT in smart cities plays\
    \ a big role in smart healthcare.\nA huge amount of data is exchanged between\
    \ machines, humans, and devices. This big data can be encrypted and\nthen stored\
    \ on a cloud so that only authenticated users can access it. There are also privacy\
    \ issues. A scheme for\nefﬁciently sharing data is proposed to address this issue.\
    \ The author uses attribute-based encryption with attribute BF\nto control access.\
    \ While transforming data or sharing sensitive information, a lot of privacy concerns\
    \ may arise. Xu\net al. propose a scheme using BF, which is privacy-preserving\
    \ for patient health information for sharing information\n[293]. The author uses\
    \ an encrypted search method that allows numerical search for encrypted data.\
    \ The BF and\nmessage veriﬁcation code are used to ﬁlter patient data and check\
    \ the accuracy of search results. Liu et al. design\ncooperative privacy preservation\
    \ for wearable devices that ensure authenticity and consideration for controlling\
    \ data\naccess in the context of space and time information [162]. In space-aware,\
    \ they use MinHash-based authentication,\nand in time-aware, attribute-based encryption\
    \ is applied. They adopted BF to determine the existence of sensitive\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n245\nFig. 12. Status\
    \ ledger’s block size with and without using BF. [11].\ndata in storage without\
    \ exposing secret information, and for secure data interaction, positive and negative\
    \ ﬁlters\nare used. Seham A., et al. [11] introduce a system for infection control\
    \ with the use of Blockchain for privacy-\npreserving. In this system, one leader\
    \ elected by authority updates the two BFs, one for infected users and the other\n\
    for close contact users. Two BF are used for infected and suspected users, which\
    \ reduces the storage space. The\nblock size of the COVID-19 status ledger with\
    \ and without using BF is also compared (Fig. 12).\nFast Response and Congestion\
    \ control: – The number of connected devices in the network (like trafﬁc lights,\n\
    vehicles, laptops, smartphones, etc.) is increasing exponentially. For resource\
    \ sharing and effective communication,\nall devices with different conﬁgurations\
    \ have to be integrated into the same network. Due to the rapid growth of\nthese\
    \ devices, the trafﬁc in the network also increases, causing difﬁculty in predicting\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. G. S. Aujla\net al. propose an approach to handle these issues.\
    \ “Blockchain-as-a-Service for Software Deﬁned Network (SDN)\nin Smart City Applications”\
    \ is mentioned [23]. Multiple etiquette ﬁrmware can be integrated into a single\
    \ network\nusing the SDN controller [22].\nIn “Software-deﬁned Content Dissemination\
    \ Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-19 like Sce-\nnarios”, [111]\
    \ introduces a new way to ﬁnd the right online distribution channel described\
    \ in the healthcare ecosys-\ntem software. Internet of Healthcare Vehicle (IoHV)\
    \ is an emerging concept that depends on smart transport, includ-\ning ambulances\
    \ and additional healthcare vehicles (testing Covid-19 immediately). To connect\
    \ to the internet, espe-\ncially when possible, for testing COVID-19 immediately\
    \ and contact tracing, this IoHV is helpful and is deployed\nacross a smart city\
    \ setup. All healthcare vehicles are connected to each other through different\
    \ types of links: vehicle-\nto-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), infrastructure-to-infrastructure\
    \ (I2I), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),\nand cellular links [147]. To overcome\
    \ congestion and improve response, the global information of devices is stored\n\
    in the deletable BF in the proposed framework. While implementing in the real\
    \ world, there are many ambient\nintelligence challenges. Some of them related\
    \ to healthcare are listed below:\nAdopting Advance healthcare technology: Almost\
    \ all medical devices are connected to IoT devices. The man-\nagement systems\
    \ like appointments, patient administration, laboratory information, etc. are\
    \ now handled by ML and\nAI. So it is necessary to develop a connected network\
    \ of healthcare leaders, clinics, manufacturers, and software\ndevelopment companies.\
    \ which enhances the new business models and also helps adopt the new technologies.\n\
    Integration between healthcare services: The massive amount of data is generated\
    \ while using medical devices\nand AI-integrated applications. Many top healthcare\
    \ companies lack data management systems and new architec-\nture.\nRising Healthcare\
    \ cost: The rising costs of healthcare are always a serious issue, which includes\
    \ the manufac-\nturing cost of healthcare vehicles and disease detection and testing\
    \ processes. Due to this, many patients skip lab\ntests and do regular follow-ups.\n\
    246\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nPayment\
    \ Veriﬁcation: – In this digital world and epidemic, the maximum number of transactions\
    \ is done digitally\nand payment veriﬁcation is required. In this lieu, Pratim\
    \ et al. a lightweight payment veriﬁcation based on the\nblockchain using BF is\
    \ proposed as IoT-Assisted e-Healthcare [223]. If BLWN simply asks for the full\
    \ location of\na small set of blocks/topics, there may be a chance for privacy\
    \ leaks as the full area can peer into BLWNs’ assets. It\nmay allow the full site\
    \ to call for Denial of Services (DoS) and the insigniﬁcant liaison service for\
    \ funds available\nfrom BLWN. Therefore, it may be completely overwhelmed by the\
    \ great difﬁculty in its ability to make a computer\nwhile crashing its system.\n\
    Real Time Analysis/Support: – Wearable devices are mainly used in real-time Electronic\
    \ Health Records (EHR)\ncollection. Obviously, encryption is required for searching\
    \ targeted EHRs by medical institutions. In this reference,\nYuan et al. [259]\
    \ propose a scheme in which medical institutions can search and access EHRs in\
    \ the cloud. They\nimprove the search accuracy and privacy of users in EHRs. To\
    \ improve search efﬁciency, the Cuckoo ﬁlter is used\nand gives a facility to\
    \ data owners for modiﬁcation (insert and delete) in their EHRs in the cloud.\n\
    7.2. Smart transportation\nFor moving from one place to another, horses and camels\
    \ were used for a long time in society. The world has\nentered the next phase\
    \ of the movement, namely smart transport, with the advent of new technologies\
    \ and smart\ntransportation systems [180]. “Moving smarter is not our future –\
    \ it is already our present”, says Lisa Jerram, senior\nanalyst at Pike Research,\
    \ simply to make sure the easy journey is acceptable as cities become more populous\
    \ and\nface potential budget crises by building new infrastructure, as is the\
    \ case in Europe, North America and Japan, [38].\nAccording to [274], the population\
    \ of the world’s urban areas increased from 29% to 50% between 1950 and 2008,\n\
    and it is expected to increase to 70% by 2050.\n7.2.1. Application of smart transportation\n\
    To meet the increased demand of citizens, the easy option is to provide then better\
    \ transport services. With this\nthe growth in supply of automobile is increases,\
    \ due to that the trafﬁc congestion is also increases. The attraction to\nthe\
    \ development of smart transport system took a lot of attention to addressing\
    \ trafﬁc congestion and rapid urban\ngrowth [71]. It is identiﬁed that the implementation\
    \ of smart technologies is the key factor in gaining intelligence\nand stability\
    \ [107,233]. Also several researchers shown that how this sustainability achieving\
    \ the environmental and\neconomic efﬁciency [71,115]. Therefore, sustainable transportation\
    \ is very important in today’s society. There are\nvarious application under smart\
    \ transportation are discussed as follows:\nSmart Street Light: – Smart city should\
    \ also needs to upgrade Road street light to smart street light. It helps in\n\
    reducing the energy consumption by dimming the lights. This saved energy are then\
    \ used for other services like\npollution monitoring, update about whether, GPS\
    \ etc. and also help in signing available parking in nearby area.\nBut smart street\
    \ lights are depending on its feature and requirements, and involve a combination\
    \ of cameras and\nsensors. Sensors and Cameras are collecting the data can either\
    \ process locally if street light have computing device\nor propagate through\
    \ network. These devices can detect the movement which enable dynamic lighting\
    \ and dimming\n[102]. Chen et al. present a system which used for controlling\
    \ the street lights using TX2 device and also help in\nupdating the parking status\
    \ to users (Fig. 13).\nIntelligent Transportation System (ITS): – Today, the state-of-the-art\
    \ transport system is heavily inﬂuenced by\nMachine Learning (ML) and Dynamic\
    \ Range Learning (DRL) based strategies to detect autonomous vehicles,\ndispatch\
    \ passengers in a safe manner and ensure the safety of vehicles. ITS uses the\
    \ various advance technologies\nlike senros, IoT devices, ICT and many more [302].\
    \ The huge amount of data is being generated by these IoT devices\nand sensors\
    \ which contributes to the concept of intelligent cities and the future of ITS\
    \ [312]. The techniques like\nAI, ML, and especially DRL play an important role\
    \ as an integral part of sustainable in precisely monitoring and\nmeasuring real-time\
    \ data trafﬁc ﬂow in an urban area [301,305].\nThe various applications of ITS\
    \ are discussed by [302] like: The intelligent highway in Britain, which reduces\n\
    the trafﬁc and accident rate, The CRITER system in Lyon, France, offers transportation\
    \ workers a schematic plan\nlike a map and also predicts the bottleneck points.\
    \ In Japan, electronic toll collections (ETC) measure the physical\ncharacteristics\
    \ of vehicles and check and deduct charges automatically if they are in ETC. It\
    \ is useful to avoid\nillegal entry into the city. Include IoT in ITS to build\
    \ a system where communication between road facilities,\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n247\nFig. 13. Smart street light\
    \ scenario [59].\nvehicles, and management equipment is done without barriers.\
    \ The Global Positioning System (GPS) is replaced by\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) in the IoT to become the Smart Transportation System (STS). The author\n\
    also discusses the services for passengers on public transport, like service range,\
    \ charging, security control, and\nadministration.\nAvailability of Parking: –\
    \ With the rapid growth of vehicles in the city, it is a trick for drivers to\
    \ ﬁnd available\nparking. This dilemma is seen as an opportunity to increase the\
    \ efﬁciency of parking facilities, thereby decreasing\nroad accidents and taking\
    \ less time to ﬁnd free space in a smart city. The troubles related to parking\
    \ and trafﬁc\ncongestion could be solved if drivers were aware in advance of the\
    \ availability of parking in the area and surround-\ning areas [39]. A smart and\
    \ automated system that can detect empty parking spaces can reduce search time,\
    \ by\nﬁnding out where parking is available and bypassing lawful information to\
    \ drivers. Maria et al. proposed an image\nprocessing system that takes video\
    \ as input from a drone and feeds it into a frame extraction block [176]. These\n\
    frames are then preprocessed to reduce complexity. These systems may be improved\
    \ if the availability of data and\nthe techniques to manage this data were improved\
    \ or changed with new technologies.\nStreet lights can also play an important\
    \ role in detecting empty parking spaces in open environments. Traditional\nparking\
    \ (sensor-based) occupancy systems are more expensive, as demonstrated by [59].\
    \ They use Jetson TX2, an\nNVIDIA’s Computer Uniﬁed Device Architecture embedded\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence supercomputer, which has high\npower efﬁciency. This\
    \ system works both day and night with an on-off street parking smart control\
    \ system. Parking\nspace is detected by marker-based image processing using the\
    \ onboard camera of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) [67].\nTrafﬁc Control: –\
    \ The authorities are facing chaos trying to manage the trafﬁc with an increase\
    \ of vehicles on the\nroads. Because of a lack of human resources, authorities\
    \ are moving toward smart trafﬁc control to manage the city’s\ntrafﬁc. To reduce\
    \ congestion in the context of VANETs, robots can play a key role. The aim of\
    \ smart robots is to give\ninformation to avoid ideal roads and manage trafﬁc\
    \ congestion in urban areas. To detect illegal trafﬁc behaviour or\ntrafﬁc violations,\
    \ the system uses street cameras [66]. But it is not possible to install street\
    \ cameras everywhere in\nthe city. Modern cars with video storage cameras have\
    \ been introduced to control trafﬁc violations in the city. These\ncars capture\
    \ the videos in the city and report any violations that happen to the authorities.\
    \ Rathore et al. propose a\nsystem to detect the front car and road line using\
    \ the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Hough transform\nfor self-driving.\
    \ A violation detection algorithm is designed for the fog device smart to identify\
    \ driving violations,\nU-turns, and driving central dividers [222]. Steve Mazur\
    \ has also presented a trafﬁc control system (Fig. 14) in\n[180].\nAutomated Toll\
    \ Collection: – To decrease the fuel consumption used in automobiles, the use\
    \ of the cream road\nis required. The government and road contractors are working\
    \ on making the new highways and ﬂyovers in the\ncities, and contractors are installing\
    \ their toll on those roads to complete their expenses. Motorists and commuters\n\
    are spending their valuable time at the toll plazas paying the amount of tax.\
    \ Due to this, the parking problem, trafﬁc\n248\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nFig. 14. Smart trafﬁc control [180].\ncongestion,\
    \ and pollution are increasing near the toll plaza. Commuters are also facing\
    \ delays, which increases\nthe travel time for their journey [34]. Automatic toll\
    \ collection is on the rise nowadays, both by governments and\nresearchers. The\
    \ main concern with this automated toll collection system, the RIFD tag, is that\
    \ it is installed on\nthe windshield of vehicles. To collect the required amount,\
    \ the vehicles pass through the sensor system before the\ntollgate [134]. Regular\
    \ user may also have facility of prepaid smart cards. So that the trafﬁc at tollgates\
    \ can be\navoided. M.A. Berlin et al. propose an alert message based toll collection\
    \ system using smart Road Side Unit (RSU)\n[34]. This system also helps in stopping\
    \ the payment violation by send the alert message if the any vehicle violate\n\
    the toll payment. This system is totally man free and barricade free, which also\
    \ help in rush hours to handle the\ntrafﬁc [34]. As the use RIFD tags not only\
    \ the time is saved but also eliminate the corruption in toll plazas [8].\nSmart\
    \ Mobility: – Smart mobility is also the main concern in smart transportation\
    \ as it is consistent with the\ndevelopment of a sustainable world [101]. In particular,\
    \ either ICT is the initiative to smart mobility or a complete\nfailure [31].\
    \ Smart Mobility is providing solutions to users by using new technologies like\
    \ IoT, ICT etc. Some\ntourists use apps to plan their journey, but they get limited\
    \ information and priorities for travel recommendations\n[205]. Smart mobility\
    \ is also helpful for citizens to roam and move freely in the vicinity of a smart\
    \ city. Smart\nmobility also helps in improving the trafﬁc control system by giving\
    \ access to other routes in emergencies or trafﬁc\njams. Intelligent navigators\
    \ facilitate providing routes and navigating to essential services like ambulances\
    \ and\ngovernment. can be facilitated by intelligent navigation. In the coming\
    \ year, smart mobility transform into mobility\nas a service paradigm, like car-sharing\
    \ [205].\n7.2.2. Beneﬁts of smart transportation\nFigure 15 explores a picture\
    \ of smart transportation in the city. Smart transportation has many beneﬁts,\
    \ some of\nthem are discussed as.\nSmart Transportation is safer: – In smart transport\
    \ the integration of ML with IoT, 5G help in reducing trafﬁc\nand road accidents.\
    \ In these IoT devices, cameras and other safety devices help in monitoring the\
    \ trafﬁc situation\nand intimate the same to users for improving road safety.\n\
    Smart Transportation is better managed: – Smart transportation facilitates the\
    \ public administration by allowing\nto monitor the performance of road safety\
    \ and trafﬁc. It also gives information on critical sources of problems and\n\
    tracks where maintenance is required.\nSmart Transport is very effective: – With\
    \ better management of resources in smart transport gives more efﬁcient\nresults.\
    \ If we are having quality data, then easily identify the areas where improvement\
    \ is required. It also provides\nbetter-quality ﬁlling rates.\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n249\nFig. 15. Smart transportation\
    \ [180].\nSmart Transportation is more cost-effective: – Smart transportation\
    \ also helps in reducing the cost by providing\nthe best shortest routes, giving\
    \ information regarding facilities available with approx distance and price, and\
    \ many\nmore. Commuters also take beneﬁt if they get affordable public transport\
    \ as compared to hiring a private CAB.\nSmart Parking Management: – In smart parking\
    \ the driver or car owner can’t face the problem of ﬁnding the avail-\nable space\
    \ for parking. The system provides the information by collecting real-time data\
    \ from connected devices\nand sensors.\nSmart Trafﬁc Management: – With the smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system users can get information about conges-\ntion on road.\
    \ So that they can plan their journey accordingly.\nSmart Transportation provides\
    \ instant information: – Smart transport system can also provide information in-\n\
    stantly regarding the issue in the city, trafﬁc congestion, and problem areas\
    \ using trafﬁc management centers. They\nalso ensure public safety and provide\
    \ information on affordable insurance plans.\nIntegrated Ticket Systems: – It\
    \ will also provide diverse services to citizens by providing the intelligent\
    \ ticket\nsystem in some local services.\n7.2.3. Challenges in smart transportation\n\
    A large number of vehicles in major cities around the world has posed major transportation\
    \ and stability chal-\nlenges, like air pollution, trafﬁc congestion and energy\
    \ problems [284]. Following are some challenges to smart\ntransportation.\nSecurity:\
    \ – Vulnerable to cyberattacks is one of the biggest fears among smart city dwellers.\
    \ Cyber attacks are\nmore common to criminals as the world’s connectivity to the\
    \ internet increases. The data ﬂow during the smart\ntransport management system\
    \ are may be hacked or used to thief the vehicle if there is no secure communication.\n\
    The security of data used in toll collection systems is also in danger. During\
    \ ﬁnding the available parking space user\nshare their location, this also may\
    \ create problems in user security.\nData Privacy: – User data cannot be retrieved\
    \ without their knowledge. The user’s personal identity must not be\nidentiﬁed\
    \ or traced. Data privacy in smart transport is the main concern. Under the new\
    \ law, data processing must\nhave legitimate.\nSupply Chain: – Due to epidemics\
    \ like Covid-19 the global supply chain is affected. While transportation may\n\
    face various problems during this epidemic. Due to that many businesses are affected.\
    \ When the drivers may ill and\nmove from one region to another it may cause public\
    \ health.\nEnvironmental Problem: – With the rapid growth in the automobile industry\
    \ the trafﬁc on roads also increases.\nThis may affect the air quality and water\
    \ pollution in nearby residential areas. The environmental problems caused\nby\
    \ the IoT devices are currently serious and need to be addressed urgently [180].\n\
    Health Concern: – Health concern is also one of the challenges to smart transportation.\
    \ If the transport system is\nnot connected to hospitals, then it may cause major\
    \ problems or may loss their lives in road accidents. The system\nneeds to improve\
    \ its service on road, and proper intimation of the concerns (hospitals and police\
    \ stations).\n250\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n7.2.4. Applications of PDS in smart transport\nThe trafﬁc on roads in\
    \ both rural and urban areas is increasing day by day. It needs to smartly manage\
    \ the trafﬁc\nand distribute the trafﬁc load by making the transport system to\
    \ be smart. It includes smart parking, smart street\nlights, violation check on\
    \ the roads, trafﬁc control system etc.\nData Dissemination: – It means the statistical\
    \ data is transmitted or distributed to end-users. In Pursuing a\nPub/Sub Internet(PURSUIT)\
    \ project use BF to store the path information in source routing. The main scenario\n\
    of this project is general data dissemination [16].\nPrivacy Preserving: – The\
    \ IoT devices and sensors are used to collect and exchange a huge amount of data,\
    \ to\nimprove the transport system. As Cloud Computing progressed, more sensitive\
    \ information (like vehicle registration\nnumber, chassis number, insurance detail,etc.)\
    \ was released to the cloud. The most accurate way to protect data\nprivacy is\
    \ to encrypt data before extracting it [253]. Enabling keyword searches directly\
    \ over encrypted data is a\ndesirable way to make the best use of encrypted data.\
    \ Wang et al. has proposed a brand new idea for acquiring\nmultiple keywords (compound\
    \ keywords) in random search [282]. Unlike most existing keyword search programs,\n\
    the program eliminates the requirement of a predeﬁned keyword dictionary.\n7.3.\
    \ Smart environment\nMany developed cities suffer from poor air quality as population\
    \ and industry growth rapidly. Increasing accep-\ntance of smart transport data\
    \ in smart cities around the world has provided unprecedented opportunities to\
    \ improve\nair quality management in transportation [284]. Government agencies\
    \ and residents are increasingly concerned with\nair grade, which contributes\
    \ to a wide range of human environments and human development. The most common\n\
    methods of predicting air pollution especially utilize low-level simulations.\
    \ These standards produce disappointing\neffects that have led to aspects inﬂuencing\
    \ the measurement of air corrosion based on the overall structure of the\nbuilding.\
    \ Estimating air quality using atmospheric scattering standards is time-consuming.\
    \ Modeling incorporated\ntesting is a new expansion to measure air pollution and\
    \ conservatory gases in an intelligent environment. Normally,\nmaximum houses\
    \ in a smart city are used solar and wind turbines for green energy [140]. Liu\
    \ et al. suggested a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in planning smart environment\
    \ in smart cities, which predict air quality\nthat assists Staked Auto-Encoder\
    \ (SAE) [165]. LSTM is used to evaluate air quality forecasts in smart cities.\
    \ The\ninternal components that occur due to air pollution are removed by optimizing\
    \ SAE. The total error rate is 0.46 and\nthe class accuracy of 91.22% is shown\
    \ by this model, it still needs to be improved.\nJovanovska et al. proposed and\
    \ air quality system based on IoT and Cloud computing [130]. They visualize and\n\
    control air pollution using mobile applications. Sulfur oxide (SO2), Ozone(O3),\
    \ Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and most\nimportant PM10 and PM2.5 are common indicators\
    \ of contamination that cause health risks like heart and lung\ndiseases. So,\
    \ improving the quality of air is a good effort by everyone for the weather and\
    \ health of every citizen.\n7.3.1. Challenges in smart environment\nThe major\
    \ challenges for the environment are water pollution, air quality, and radiation.\
    \ To achieve sustainable\ngrowth by maintaining a healthy society proper vigilance\
    \ is needed in the world. With the development of IoT and\nsmart sensors, Smart\
    \ Environmental Monitoring (SEM) is the system for environmental monitoring, in\
    \ the latest\nyears [273]. Figure 16 shows various issues of environment like\
    \ temperature, radiation, dust, humidity, ultraviolet\nsignal etc. For establishing\
    \ the system Silvia et al. used the WSN which provides an interface between smart\
    \ sensors\nand IoT Devices [273].\nAir quality Monitoring: – Due to the rapid\
    \ increase in trafﬁc and industries, air pollution is one of the primary\nconcerns\
    \ of our epoch. The earth is becoming increasingly polluted due to the emissions\
    \ of harmful gases like CO,\nNO2, SO2, and CO2. These toxic gases can’t be predicted\
    \ because there are dissolve in the air. So, the air quality\nneeds to be checked,\
    \ and for that, an IoT-based tool is required. An IoT device can collect and analyze\
    \ the data\nto predict the air quality either good or bad. Sensors using Raspberry\
    \ Pi/ Arduino and IoT devices can monitor\nthe local air quality [175]. Dhingra\
    \ et al. develop an application i.e. “IoT-Mobair”, which is mobile-based use to\n\
    monitor and detect the air pollution of the concerned area [76]. This mobile-based\
    \ application has various features\nlike air quality, daily forecasts, health-related\
    \ tips, and risks, air quality map generations etc. But, when dealing with\nbig\
    \ data generated from sensors, then this application has faced some computational\
    \ complexity problems. For that\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\n251\nFig. 16. Challenges in smart environment.\nDhingra et al.\
    \ have suggested using fog computing instead of cloud computing. The IoT is a\
    \ global system of “smart\ndevices” which can detect and communicate with the\
    \ environment and interact with users and other applications.\nQian et al. found\
    \ that due to low sensitivity and low accuracy the exiting monitoring system does\
    \ not work well and\nit also requires laboratory analysis [218]. The data is highly\
    \ correlated in the case of air pollution monitoring, where\nthese systems are\
    \ leads to a lot of obsolete information. To the data delivery cost and to alleviate\
    \ data neglect Qian\net al. the system i.e. ‘Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution\
    \ Monitoring (CIAM)’. In CIAM, the content method\nis used to compile and integrate\
    \ air pollution data.\nWater quality Monitoring: – Monitoring of water quality\
    \ is important in determining water safety and related pub-\nlic health [256].\
    \ Water quality parameters are determined by the same factors as physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological.\nBacterial contamination, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, dispersion,\
    \ free chlorine, and pH are the typical parameters\nof water quality [215,219].\
    \ The various research papers have been studied in terms of intelligent water\
    \ pollution\ncontrol systems using ML, IoT, and smart sensors. The pollution of\
    \ water in the lake can be predicted using an\nML-based neural network for machine-reading\
    \ which analyzes the sensed image [160]. The water is classiﬁed as\npure or polluted,\
    \ and we studied the separation of water pollution with the use of ML methods\
    \ and IoT devices [61].\nThe prediction of water quality parameters using AI and\
    \ neural networks and the amounts of sulfate or chloride\npresent in water were\
    \ studied [220]. In order to separate the pollutants in water using SVM, the analysis\
    \ of big data\nand problems faced during the separation of water pollution were\
    \ discussed [46]. AI-SVM is a classiﬁcation system\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ and technology used for testing and its separation from non-drinking water [41,128].\n\
    Video-based monitoring of water quality and pollution was investigated, which\
    \ used IoT video surveillance and\nML tools to separate dirty and clean water\
    \ [208]. To predict the future and quality of water before use, another\nfunction\
    \ which is a feature-based model, also helped in analyzing the water suggested\
    \ [311]. Different ML models\nwere used to test the concentration of chlorophyll-A\
    \ in pond water and were also recommended for real-time water\nmanagement system\
    \ [163].\nAgriculture Monitoring System: – The growth of industrial and robust\
    \ agricultural production methods has ac-\ncelerated to ensure the quality and\
    \ quantity of the growing demand for food [249]. In “smart or green agriculture”,\n\
    Smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) plays an important role as agriculture is the\
    \ relevant growth factor for any\nnation [210]. It also helps in product development\
    \ and sustainable growth to handle major challenges in the agricul-\nture sector\
    \ [196,239]. Ullo et al. refer to the smart agriculture scenarios (Fig. 17), where\
    \ the SEM system is a smart\nagricultural monitoring system in real. In the agriculture\
    \ sector, various factors are very important for achieving\nsustainable production,\
    \ like water level, water pollution level, moisture analysis, soil health etc.\
    \ These features are\nincluded in the smart agricultural monitoring system, which\
    \ is monitored and controlled using IoT devices, smart\nsensors for agriculture\
    \ data capturing, and WSN to transmit data into the cloud [273].\n252\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 17. Smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system using IoT devices and sensors.\nIn the new agricultural era,\
    \ there is a growing market for IoT that offers a few creative solutions. The\
    \ various\nstudies and research on Smart Agricultural Monitoring systems (SAM)\
    \ are discussed, which include fertilizer con-\ntrol, crop monitoring measures,\
    \ pest control, etc. Kumar et al. propose a system for plant growth monitoring\
    \ i.e.\n‘gCrop’ using IoT, ML and WSN [148]. They use a 3rd-degree regression\
    \ model and provide a prediction with a\nhigh computational complexity of 98%\
    \ accuracy. Shinde and Pathak et al. performed a crop quality test to monitor\n\
    the quality of paddy rice using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data [242]. In the\
    \ rice quality test, SVMs were used\nwith limited sample size and back distribution\
    \ features. The land and its size play an important role in checking the\ngrowth\
    \ level of different crop species that are either satisfactory or not. To measure\
    \ the leaf index Hosseini et al.\npropose a system with a Gaussian process model\
    \ [91] and using SVM as ML method and reported 89% with a lim-\nited sample size\
    \ [119]. To determine the level of fertilizer, pesticides, and water quantity\
    \ used for plant irrigation, an\nexpert system using AI was developed [78] using\
    \ the Naive Bayes [17] method and studying ML using sensory data\ntaken from agriculture.\
    \ UAV is used [77] to investigated the crop quality tests [230] and soil health\
    \ for phenological\ndata of soybean crop [49]. Smart farming [42], pest monitoring\
    \ [164], and crop monitoring [311] are important in\nthe various uses of SEM systems.\
    \ Weather and the environment also affect the health and growth of plants. Ullu\
    \ et\nal. propose a technique that checks the condition of the soil, moisture,\
    \ air, and water quality, temperature etc. in the\ncontext of SEM using IoT devices,\
    \ AI, and smart sensors [273]. The data analysis is performed while smart agricul-\n\
    ture provides estimation, assisting protection, decision making, and storage management\
    \ [249]. The data is moving\nwhile performing the techniques to achieve smart\
    \ agriculture, and various challenges are faced by both farmers and\nresearchers.\
    \ Some of them are addressed below.\n7.3.2. Challenges in smart agriculture\n\
    To increase food production, farmers will face many challenges. The production\
    \ will increase 70% by the year\n2050 [122]. Various challenges in agriculture\
    \ have been discussed (Fig. 18) as.\nIrrigation management: – One of the objectives\
    \ of an irrigation system is to calculate the water requirement for\ncrops based\
    \ on collected data and water ﬂow without interference from humans. Irrigation\
    \ systems use dispersed\nsensors to monitor the different soils, water bodies,\
    \ vegetation, and microscopic elements. Climate is one of the\nmost important\
    \ variables in estimating agricultural water requirements. A farmer can adjust\
    \ his irrigation system in\na variety of ways according to soil and weather conditions\
    \ [216]. The entire farm can track, manage, and forecast\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n253\nFig. 18. Challenges in smart\
    \ agriculture.\nweather from almost anywhere. IoT will help in developing the\
    \ new infrastructure for irrigation in a very exciting\nway. Smart IoT-operated\
    \ irrigation systems use embedded sensors in the ﬁeld to monitor soil structures,\
    \ climate,\nand agricultural irrigation conditions.\nSoil management: – Soil monitoring\
    \ is one of the most challenging agricultural activities for both businesses and\n\
    farmers. Various soil parameters like pH, humidity, etc. are involved in soil\
    \ management and IoT sensors can be\nused to calculate these parameters. Soil\
    \ management helps in ﬁnding the right kind of plants and helps to identify\n\
    fertilizer requirements in the soil. Crop production can be affected by soil testing\
    \ due to a number of environmental\nconcerns. The process and patterns of farming\
    \ can easily be understood, if these types of problems are well deﬁned.\nCrop\
    \ production may improve and fertilization practices can be promoted based on\
    \ ﬁndings of a soil survey study for\nfarmers [37]. The moisture and humidity\
    \ sensors can monitor the moisture in the soil, and IoT technology identiﬁes\n\
    the contaminated soil and shields the ﬁeld from over-fertilization and damage\
    \ to crops. Agricultural productivity\nand quality may increase, pollution can\
    \ be avoided, and input costs may be reduced due to soil management.\nClimate\
    \ management: – Climate has a profound effect on crop production. With the use\
    \ of an IoT-enabled weather\nforecast system, farmers can determine the best time\
    \ to plant, irrigate, and harvest. With the help of distant sensors\nattached\
    \ to the ﬁeld, farmers can learn about natural conditions like humidity, soil\
    \ moisture, and air temperature.\nOn the basis of historical results, to maximize\
    \ the yield, farmers should properly prepare and market the harvest and\nirrigation\
    \ season. By editing and updating the collected data, farmers should take immediate\
    \ steps to ensure a safe\ncrop yield. Many of the right things are put together\
    \ to maintain and establish a good plant environment while living\nunder stringent\
    \ limits like airﬂow, temperature, CO2, and O2 levels. With the use of IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, where for\nadvanced decisions data can be exchanged between intelligent\
    \ sensors and devices, this can be achieved [288].\nAccurate farming: – The traditional\
    \ method of farming to increase yields and preserve crops was based on phys-\n\
    ical examination. If any issue was found, then it was resolved by trial and error\

    \ data structures in smart city\nincident on the farm. Farmers will face various\
    \ different types of challenges while farming, like less water, ﬂoods,\nlack of\
    \ suitable planting space, and cost control. Productivity can be improved with\
    \ the use of IoT in agriculture.\nWith the use of gathered information, farmers\
    \ can organize their farming activities, including what seeds they should\nsow,\
    \ what crop yields should be expected, the time to harvest, and how much fertilizer\
    \ to use. Example: The natural\nsoil diversity of a ﬁeld is an accurate agricultural\
    \ practice. The plants can be planted thicker and the irrigation can\nbe used\
    \ sparingly if the soil in a certain area holds more water. Alternatively, if\
    \ the site is used for grazing, we can\ntake more cattle than an equivalent area\
    \ with a lower level of the soil.\nNutritional management: – As the human body\
    \ needs proper nutrition to grow, the same plants may require\naccurate nutrition.\
    \ Nutrients help to produce the best yield when given at the right prices and\
    \ at the right times.\nToo much and too limited nutrients for plants will affect\
    \ the environment. For example, too much phosphorus,\nammonia, or nitrogen may\
    \ reduce water levels. To grow in one place, the selection of the best crop cycle\
    \ allows\nfor balancing soil fertility. While reducing environmental degradation\
    \ and economic costs, achieving sustainable\nagriculture, nutrition, and technology\
    \ are essential [6].\nGarbage Management: – The wastage of water, soil, and seeds\
    \ is common during farming. This needs to be\ncontrolled, but in an intelligent\
    \ manner. For garbage collection, create smart trash cans using IoT sensors, which\n\
    can smartly sense and collect the garbage. The collected data related to network\
    \ disposal is used to read, store and\ntransmit with the help of these smart trash\
    \ cans. Garbage management can be done with the help of some smart and\nsystematic\
    \ algorithms [10].\nLivestock monitoring: – Livestock plays an important role\
    \ in agriculture, so they need intention, proper care,\ntimely feeding, etc. It\
    \ is a growing worldwide issue to provide enough food to the world’s people with\
    \ the grow-\ning agricultural production. As a result, the importance of livestock\
    \ management on farms is crucial to survival.\nTo improve the quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products, new technology like IoT advances is important. It\n\
    also improves the quality of livestock by allowing farmers to make decisions based\
    \ on data-driven. To monitor the\nlivestock’s welfare remotely and identify their\
    \ habitats, cloud-based technologies are used with power communica-\ntion sensors\
    \ [50]. The health condition of livestock like respiratory rate, digestion, blood\
    \ pressure, heart rate, and\nother day and night vital signs can be checked by\
    \ farmers using connected sensors. But the data ﬂow between these\nsensors and\
    \ smart devices is interrupted or tempered, so it needs to be secure and well\
    \ managed to get efﬁcient\nresults.\nFarm Management System (FMS): – Smart farming\
    \ promotes productivity while minimizing environmental in-\nﬂuences, but this\
    \ smart agriculture technique is merely possible with the help of FMS [97]. With\
    \ the help of WSN\nand GSM in FMS, farmers can track the entire farm and capture\
    \ the data with a small controller [199]. With the\nuse of sensors and smart devices\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the identiﬁer is used to provide appropriate awareness of soil,\
    \ fertility,\nand weather, to the farmers. The data collection and storage, monitoring,\
    \ and analysis of the farm operations can\nbe automated using an IoT-based farm\
    \ management system. It can also help in managing agricultural budgets and\nbusiness\
    \ operations. The irrigation scheme helps in protecting the farms from animals\
    \ and pests. But also automatic\nirrigation systems can increase the water consumption\
    \ [105,137].\nTracing and tracking: – Satyanarayana et al. [236] develop the structures\
    \ to remotely track soil structure and\nits status in accordance with the needs\
    \ of plant culture. The different agricultural areas and locations are tracked\n\
    using GPS devices and wireless network connections. The real-time data processing\
    \ is tracked and approved by\nconnecting WSN and ZigBee to other devices like\
    \ the Central Monitoring Station (CMoS), GSM, and GPRS. The\nGPS also enables\
    \ the farmer to take actions based on notiﬁcations sent to the farm manager through\
    \ SMS or MMS.\nIt is often used in agriculture to detect precise location and\
    \ control capacity, despite it having high operating and\nmaintenance costs.\n\
    Plant management: – The growth of a farmer’s crop is most important in farming.\
    \ Farmers use good seeds,\norganic fertilizers, proper watering etc. for best\
    \ results. For farmers to protect themselves from them, they use\nchemical medicines\
    \ and fertilizers, which may later affect the human body. So, it required an intelligent\
    \ system that\nprotects the crop from insects and does not affect the human body.\
    \ This can be done by plant management, which\ninvolves monitoring and recording\
    \ the welfare of the crop. The plant and its diseases can be detected using RFID\n\
    chips and IoT sensors. The farmers can process the data remotely and take necessary\
    \ steps like keeping the insects\nfrom plants. The production of rice for a speciﬁc\
    \ country with a Chinese monitoring station using SVM [152].\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n255\nFarmers can also prevent\
    \ the risk and plan their farming practices by demonstrating an effective calculation\
    \ strategy\nfor coffee fruit [68].\nWater Management: – The major challenge in\
    \ greenhouses is to determine how much water is required i.e. wa-\nter management\
    \ [281]. Intelligent sensors are installed to control the waste of water and operate\
    \ them by using a\nvariety of IoT techniques. Automated drip irrigation is used\
    \ to control the soil moisture in irrigation and storage of\nwater in greenhouses.\
    \ The farmers are checking the water levels in a water tank with their Android\
    \ phones. With\nthe use of IoT devices and sensors, the whole water management\
    \ is done like the motor is automatically started and\nstopped by checking the\
    \ level water level. Due to over-irrigation in conventional irrigation systems,\
    \ up to 50% of\nwater is lost [241]. A smart Irrigation system(SIS) provides a\
    \ system to overcome this issue. This system helps the\nfarmers to avoid water\
    \ wastage and improve the quality of their crops through timely irrigation. SIS\
    \ also transmits\nthe knowledge of the ﬁeld to the farmer using temperature and\
    \ soil sensors. Farmers may also plan and modify their\nirrigation according to\
    \ the local weather information. For Water Distribution System (WDS) an architecture\
    \ WD-\nSchain’, which is blockchain-based in MATLAB, is proposed [172]. For security,\
    \ various consensus mechanisms\nare used, and results show a trade-off is required\
    \ between data validation and system complexity (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19. Water distribution\
    \ systems chain architecture [172].\nBlockchain with Agricultural IoT: – To improve\
    \ agricultural intelligence, data-driven technologies can be allowed\na secure\
    \ data storage system. The data collection is often very costly where the inventory,\
    \ agricultural contracts, and\ninformation about farm conditions from a reliable\
    \ source can be provided. Developing the trust between providers\nand consumers\
    \ and establishing a reliable food supply chain, the blockchain technology helps\
    \ in tracking the food\nfor timely payments to stakeholders [191].\nTo monitor\
    \ the farm and collect the data remotely, smart sensors and cameras were used.\
    \ To adopt the current\ncondition of agricultural land, farmers can use IoT devices\
    \ as they use smartphones anywhere in the world. New\ntechnologies like IoT have\
    \ the potential to increase global productivity and reduce the cost of crop production.\
    \ To\nface the challenges on the farm, the agricultural sector can be restructured\
    \ by providing different IoT-based tools\nand techniques. A massive amount of\
    \ unstructured data has also been generated and the PDS has the potential to\n\
    solve issues like handling big data with real-time response.\n7.3.3. Applications\
    \ of PDS in smart environment\nEnergy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness: – To improve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness. Yousef et al.\npropose a scheme in underwater\
    \ WSN for water pollution monitoring [297]. BF is used in the preprocessing step\
    \ to\nreduce the number of transmissions and eliminate redundancy to save precious\
    \ energy. This type of project is mainly\nused in deep water like the sea and\
    \ ocean. Mahmoud et al. use BF for customer’s identity and privacy-preserving\n\
    of transferred data in WDS [173]. They also suggest the optimal parameters of\
    \ BF i.e. for 200 customers with 2000\n256\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nnumbers of bits and 7 hash functions. In WDSchain,\
    \ BF is used to match the authentication of network nodes in\nproof-of-authentication(PoAuth).\n\
    High-performance communication networks: – IoT devices contain many sensors, routers,\
    \ actuators, and base sta-\ntions that need communications between them and send\
    \ millions of data that need to deliver with high-performance\ncommunication networks.\
    \ IoT devices that may have limited power resources or limited integration areas\
    \ have an\nimportant research challenge. To increase the performance of IoT communication\
    \ networks alassery et al. propose\nan efﬁcient mechanism based on BF [12]. BF\
    \ is used to store the routing information after aggregating packets to\nsend\
    \ receiving packets to upstream routers.\nQuery Optimization: – Under the big\
    \ data domain has been developed an air monitoring system, which poses\nmajor\
    \ challenges to data analysis. Peng et al. proposed a scheme for query optimization\
    \ of air quality big data using\nBF index [211]. The efﬁciency of data collected\
    \ in the air quality monitoring system is improved. They create a\nHive data repository\
    \ in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) ﬁle format and the Row Group Index (RGI).\
    \ For basic\ndata types 64-bits ThomasWang’s hash function is used and Murmur3\
    \ 64-bit hash algorithm for string and binary\ntype by BF in ORC.\nPrivacy-preserving\
    \ Data Aggregation and Analysis: – A data aggregation algorithm is proposed using\
    \ BF for\nprivacy data analysis in mobile crowdsensing system [212].\n7.4. Smart\
    \ industry\nIn world development, industrial growth plays an important role. When\
    \ the word comes to mind ‘Industry’, then\nmost people probably think that it\
    \ is a noisy and big place. The growth of the industry has increased by 18th century.\n\
    Due to the lack of technologies owned by the industry, it faces various challenges\
    \ like production, distribution,\nsupply chain management etc [279]. By the year\
    \ 2050, technology will have progressed to the level of autonomy\n[80]. The industries\
    \ are categorized into three economic sectors: primary, secondary, and tertiary\
    \ [24].\nPrimary industry: – This sector is concerned with the general people,\
    \ means to sell and supply the products.\nThis sector is place dependent because\
    \ the raw material is extracted from the earth. The operation of this sector for\n\
    economic growth revolves around minerals, earth water, vegetation etc. The example\
    \ of these sectors are farming,\nmining, and ﬁshing and they extract the raw material\
    \ like coal, foods, corn etc. There are two types of industries\nunder the primary\
    \ sector: The genetic industry and the Extractive Industry.\nSecondary industry:\
    \ – After the collection of raw material by primary industries the secondary industries\
    \ used this\nmaterial for construction and manufacturing the products. These industries\
    \ are used to make products like steel for\nautomobiles, textiles for cloths,\
    \ wood for furniture, etc. For manufacturing these products heavy machinery is\
    \ used\nin the production plant and also required manpower for packaging and distribution.\
    \ The example of these sectors\nare consumer goods, craft & fashion, construction,\
    \ manufacturing etc. There are two types of industries under this\nsector: Heavy\
    \ industry and Light industry.\nTertiary industry: – The product is manufactured\
    \ from raw material in the above sector and is now ready for use\nby consumers.\
    \ Tertiary industries generally they are not making any products but only provide\
    \ services to consumers\nand local industries & markets. The main feature of this\
    \ sector is discussion, experiences, access, etc. The ﬁnancial\nand education\
    \ sectors are two groups of tertiary sectors one for making money (ﬁnancial) and\
    \ the other (education)\nis non-proﬁtable. Examples of these sectors are banking,\
    \ educators, administrative, medical, ﬁnancial, insurance,\ntransportation retail,\
    \ wholesale, real estate, hotels, police, defense services, media and information\
    \ technology and\nso on. There are three types of industries under the tertiary\
    \ sector: Telecommunication, Professional, and Franchises.\nThese industries help\
    \ in growing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate of the country.\n7.4.1. Industry\
    \ evolution\nThe farming and handicraft economizing processes changed to be monopolized\
    \ by industry and manufacturing\nmachines in the Industry Revolution. These changes\
    \ transformed society fundamentally in terms of living and\nworking styles. In\
    \ the 18th century Britain began this process and spread all over the world. The\
    \ production of\nmanufactured goods and the use of natural resources have increased\
    \ after these technological changes [294]. The\nindustrial evolution has been\
    \ categorized in Fig. 20 and succinct as given in Table 5.\nIndustry 1.0: – In\
    \ the years 1760–1850, the ﬁrst revolution was introduced with the mechanical\
    \ theme [225].\nIt used steam, coal, and water mechanization for the manufacturing\
    \ process. Production through machines had\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n257\nFig. 20. Industry 1.0–5.0.\nincreased, so\
    \ the rate of production had increased by eight times for conventional methods\
    \ [270]. It also increased the\nstandard of life by creating various goods in\
    \ massive amounts. Human productivity was increased by the use of steam\npower\
    \ [83]. Machines, stream power, and water power played an important role in the\
    \ ﬁrst industrial revolution’s\ngrowth. If we talk about the developing sectors\
    \ in this revolution, textile manufacture, chemicals, paper machines,\ncement,\
    \ iron industry, gaslighting, transportation, agriculture, railways, and many\
    \ more are existing there [291].\nIndustry 2.0: – In the year 1880–1973 this revolution\
    \ was introduced with industrialization [131]. With the adop-\ntion of new technologies\
    \ like telephone, electric power, sewage, internal combustion engine, etc. this\
    \ revolution\nmanufactured mass production. The sectors that are developed in\
    \ Industry 2.0 through technology are steel, paper\nmaking, petroleum, automobile,\
    \ fertilizer, Iron, chemical, rubber, electriﬁcation, machine tools, telecommunica-\n\
    tions, and many more. Mainly this revolution occurs in America, Britain, and Germany\
    \ [193].\nIndustry 3.0: – In the year 1989–2013, the industrial revolution ‘Industry\
    \ 3.0’ was started. In this industry the\nproduction was automatically done without\
    \ human interference so, the production sector grew in the engineering\nﬁeld.\
    \ The automation was fully computerized, which increases the efﬁciency and reliability\
    \ of the industrial system.\nBut automation also affects employment. With the\
    \ growth in technology, many industries start using robots and\nreducing manpower.\
    \ Industry robots are designed with programmable integrated circuits and give\
    \ accurate and efﬁ-\ncient results. Robots can do painting, welding, testing,\
    \ labeling, etc. It is estimated by the International Federation of\nRobotics\
    \ there are 1.64 million robots used in industry worldwide [51].\nIndustry 4.0:\
    \ – In 2011 the industrial revolution ‘Industry 4.0’ was ﬁrst proposed by the\
    \ German government. In\nthis revolutionary trend, computerization is used in\
    \ manufacturing [149]. The cyber-physical system was developed\nand all systems\
    \ are communicated using IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning [272,278].\
    \ These IoT\ndevices help ‘Industry 4.0’ for providing services and also in manufacturing.\
    \ This industry transform information\nthrough Industrial IoT (IIoT) [190]. The\
    \ key components of this revolution include IoT, Cloud Computing, Big\nData, Cyber\
    \ Security, Cognitive computing, etc. [286]. German was initiative the Industry\
    \ 4.0 as “smart manufac-\nturing for the future” [155]. This revolution has emerged\
    \ with the aim of achieving mass production and increasing\nproductivity using\
    \ innovative technologies i.e. similar to previous revolutions [25,213].\nIndustry\
    \ 5.0: – This revolution in the industry is declared by the European Commission,\
    \ after discussions with\nvarious funding agencies, and organizations in Research\
    \ and Innovation workshops in January 2021. To provide\nservices to humanity this\
    \ industry focuses on and highlights innovation and research. It uses the blockchain\
    \ concept\nto integrate the generated data from different industries. To achieve\
    \ social goals like employment, the standard of\nliving and development this industry\
    \ plays a key role [43].\nIndustry 5.0 is not entirely new it is the upgrade version\
    \ of industry 4.0. With growing technology, artiﬁcial\nintelligence uses in industries\
    \ also improved. The capability of humans, interaction with computers, and robot\n\
    workers gives efﬁcient and effective results [279]. This industry proposed the\
    \ 3D techniques (like 3D printing or\nadditive manufacturing is used for creating\
    \ 3D objects) with the use of IoT [80].\n258\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    Data Security: – As the rapid growth of technologies in the smart industry a huge\
    \ amount of data is moving\nbetween IoT devices. The security of data is also\
    \ a major challenge in the smart industry. The data protected and\nsafe from unauthorized\
    \ access is also a challenge to the industry.\nData Management: – This is also\
    \ the major challenge when a huge amount of data is following over the network\n\
    and between devices. Data need to be well structured and in a good manner to access\
    \ and get efﬁcient results.\nStorage: – Storage of industrial big data is very\
    \ tough both for users and developers. Data generated from various\nresources\
    \ IoT devices are scattered and not ﬁltered. The storage of that type of data\
    \ is not easy.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n259\n7.4.3. Applications of PDS in smart industry\nRemove ambiguity: –\
    \ The data generated in the smart industry is ambiguous. Wang et al. proposed\
    \ a technique\n“Fingerprint Summary” for cluster data de-duplication which is\
    \ time and space-efﬁcient. They use BF in this tech-\nnique in each node, for\
    \ reducing data duplication. For efﬁcient detect and remove duplicate data [57]\
    \ proposed a\nnew data structure i.e. ‘Improved Streaming Quotient Filter (ISQF)’.\n\
    Validation: – BF is used for data validation. BF is used to reduce memory consumption\
    \ and bypass the unneces-\nsary comparisons in the validation process [109]. This\
    \ process is space-efﬁcient.\n7.5. Smart energy\nSmart energy plays an important\
    \ role in solving the various issues of past, present, and future like healthcare,\n\
    agriculture, the environment, sustainable development, and many more [79]. The\
    \ energy-saving systems have al-\nready been developed in various cities and buildings,\
    \ in the last few years. A lot of studies for efﬁcient energy have\nalready been\
    \ done [142]. Instead of using the word “smart grid”, a broader approach is to\
    \ use the terms “Smart\nEnergy” or “Smart Energy Systems” (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21.\
    \ Smart energy.\nThe energy system is also facing various challenges like stability,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, cost control, operational\nefﬁciency, environmental issue,\
    \ service management etc. [90]. By achieving smart energy management big data\
    \ an-\nalytics provide new opportunities to deal with these challenges [18]. The\
    \ innovative storage solution and distributed\nresources for efﬁcient power transmission,\
    \ clean power generation, dynamic power distribution, and rational elec-\ntricity\
    \ consumption have been proposed [188]. Smart grid achieves the energy transmission\
    \ and data collection at\nthe same time by integrating energy and information\
    \ ﬂow [187]. The primary focus of smart grids is on electricity\n260\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nsectors like cooling,\
    \ heating, electricity, transportation, industry, building etc. It also provides\
    \ affordable, achievable\nsolutions for sustainable and renewable energy [168].\
    \ In the last few years, due to the huge growth in industry,\nenergy consumption\
    \ has also increased. It also increases data generation. With the emergence of\
    \ ICT, the energy\nsystems are being digitized [309]. The massive amount of generated\
    \ data from energy-related sources needs to be\nwell structured for efﬁcient and\
    \ fast results [177]. Due to the rapid increase in the population, energy consumption\n\
    has also increased. Renewable energy like wind and solar power is also in its\
    \ developing stage and has brought\nchallenges like energy security and the adoption\
    \ of new technologies [262]. Industries are using more than one-third\nof the\
    \ total electrical energy used by the country, for production, construction, and\
    \ mining. So in order to gather\nvaluable information, they have collected a big\
    \ database. This data is being used to raise the standard of living [231].\nThe\
    \ variety of big data, like the status of the device, consumption of electricity,\
    \ and interaction with the user, is\nbeing collected by the smart grid. To process\
    \ this big dataset, various techniques like analysis, optimization [310],\nclustering\
    \ [232], classiﬁcation [307] and forecasting [88] have been applied. So, the accurate\
    \ prediction of electricity\ndemand and consumption, the operation and generation\
    \ of power in real-time can be optimized, and also effectively\ndevelop the pricing\
    \ mechanism. With the use of big data analytics, the smart grid gives more control\
    \ over the use\nof energy to the customer, supplies economic and reliable energy,\
    \ responds quickly to the demand for electricity,\nand also quickly restores and\
    \ detect the failure and many more facilities [124]. This also helps in taking\
    \ decision\nfor customers, producers, operators, and regulators in the smart grid\
    \ [308]. Energy management uses emerging\ntechnologies like ICT (Fig. 22).\nFig.\
    \ 22. Energy management (energy cloud) [197].\nThe pattern of consumption and\
    \ production of energy is changed due to involving of big data. The energy big\n\
    data has involved 3Es and 4Vs energy, empathy, exchange, value, velocity, volume,\
    \ and variety [308].\n7.5.1. Challenges in smart energy\nThere are various opportunities\
    \ and some challenges brought by energy big data. Some challenges are listed here:\n\
    Effectively collection of energy big data: It is very difﬁcult to collect data\
    \ from energy resources for giving\nefﬁcient and effective decision-making and\
    \ quick responses.\nManagement storage of energy big data: This is also one of\
    \ the major challenges for energy big data to provide\nbetter services to customers.\n\
    M. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n261\nMining\
    \ and analyzing of energy big data: The mining of data for cleaning big raw data\
    \ and analysis is a very\ntough job.\nLack of effective and efﬁcient decision\
    \ making: The decision making is one of the impotent key points of a smart\nenergy\
    \ system, it also needs to be improved by joining efﬁcient techniques like PDS.\n\
    Privacy preserving of energy big data: This is one of the major concerns to giving\
    \ security to energy big data.\nWith the use of IoT devices, a huge amount of\
    \ data is ﬂowing without any security measures.\nTo achieve the above-discussed\
    \ challenges efﬁcient and effective tools and techniques like PDS are required.\n\
    7.5.2. Applications of PDS in smart energy\nPrivacy Preserving: Zhang et al. proposed\
    \ a mechanism Cuckoo-RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and\nLossy Networks)\
    \ to defend from Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) network from blackhole\
    \ attack. Cuckoo-\nRPL is also useful to defend from other attacks like version\
    \ number and gray hole attack [303].\nNetwork trafﬁc management: Chaudhary et\
    \ al. designed a “SDN-enabled multi-attribute-based secure communi-\ncation protocol”\
    \ in the Smart Grid environment for their entity communication. They use a cuckoo\
    \ ﬁlter for fast\nforwarding of data [56].\nLoad Balancing: Debnath et al. present\
    \ a scheme i.e. ‘BloomFlash for ﬂash storage device. This scheme also\nachieved\
    \ the load balancing of elements across the BF component. This scheme proves that\
    \ the BF is useful in load\nbalancing techniques [72].\n7.6. Smart governance\n\
    Smart governance means accessing the government services free and in a better\
    \ manner using various free data\nprojects. With the emergence of ICT in smart\
    \ cities, smart governance can improve the services provided by the\ncities [159].\
    \ Developing the businesses of the individual smart economies can play an important\
    \ role in providing a\ncollaborative platform. A smart economy also emphasizes\
    \ economic competitiveness in the development of the city,\non the competitive\
    \ edge economic and human activity [143].\nSmart Economy: – Smart economy that\
    \ is for success with high social welfare, sustainability, and resource-\nefﬁcient,\
    \ is based on innovative technologies. It also helps in improving the quality\
    \ of life by adopting new inno-\nvative ideas and building new entrepreneurs,\
    \ and start-ups, which increase competitiveness and productivity [263].\nThis\
    \ whole system is based on technologies and ICT for urban planning and economic\
    \ advancement. For social\nbeneﬁts smart economy is also expected to deliver more\
    \ products and services without compromising energy and\npollution [144].\nSmart\
    \ Government: – Smart government is the timely demand of the 21st century and\
    \ smart governance is its\nkey tool. The key pillar of smart governance is to\
    \ use technology. The public administration is required to update\nitself with\
    \ the emergence of technology. No one can oppose adopting smart governance as\
    \ it is the new face of\npublic administration, governance, and political process\
    \ [237]. The e-government adopts the electronic process in\nthe administration\
    \ system and political system and it is the starting face of smart government.\
    \ There is a trend of\nusing modern technologies in public administration for\
    \ smart governance systems by developed countries and their\nresearchers, academicians,\
    \ politicians, and practitioners [182]. The role of smart government is presented\
    \ in Fig. 23.\nAn intelligent network is created in the sector of governance and\
    \ it is directly related to the internet where people\ncan connect with each other\
    \ for communication even in remote areas. Better communication with real-time\
    \ objects in\nthe intelligent network is done through the distributed network\
    \ [234]. As it is not an automated decision-maker so\nit is not artiﬁcial intelligence.\
    \ It only connects to the people for gathering information and making the decision\
    \ and\nuse it in the future. Due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and digital\
    \ applications, a lot of data is produced. The\nsource of big data is social networking\
    \ websites, mobile phones, daily household appliances, various private and\ngovernment\
    \ websites, and smart devices being used by various researchers.\nBig data plays\
    \ an important role in transforming traditional governance into smart governance.\
    \ Researchers,\nacademicians, and policymakers argued about the transformation\
    \ of traditional public administration to modern and\nsmart administration in\
    \ point of big data. For developing the public administration and government sector\
    \ a large\namount of data is required. It also helps in developing new models\
    \ [238]. Big data also help in effective decisions,\nfast and efﬁcient results,\
    \ and expert users, increasing their accountability and transparency. It also\
    \ helps in solving\n262\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\nFig. 23. Role of smart government.\ncomplex tools for reforming\
    \ the government but some researchers have doubts about future technologies. Many\n\
    countries have adopted big data for smart governance, but some public administrations\
    \ are still not ready to adopt\nbig data as full ﬂedge. It happens because, for\
    \ implementation of these technologies, data collection, production and\nprocessing\
    \ require a big investment. And those public administrations who implement impulsive\
    \ faces threats and\nchallenges like reducing the productivity, efﬁciency, and\
    \ capacity in governing system [248].\nThe solutions to these challenges, problems,\
    \ and threats are big data-driven technologies [75] like PDS. The\ngovernment\
    \ agencies taking future and proper decisions, and identify criminals and corruption,\
    \ with the help of\nproper use of big data. The government is generating and managing\
    \ the knowledge with their major responsibility\n[5].\n7.6.1. Challenges in smart\
    \ governance\nAdopting Big data technologies: Some developing countries are already\
    \ adopting big data technologies in smart\ngovernance. But many are facing problems,\
    \ due to their bad handling and management, lack of knowledge, cost-\neffectiveness,\
    \ and data available being either unstructured or semi-structured.\nData Privacy:\
    \ Much conﬁdential data is uploaded by people and used by public administration.\
    \ So, it needs to be\nprotected from malicious users.\nApplications of PDS in\
    \ Smart Governance: As such, we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart\
    \ gover-\nnance. So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. PDS\
    \ is an efﬁcient data structure for managing\ndata storage and is also compatible\
    \ with new technologies. PDS also helps in protecting data.\n7.7. Smart society\n\
    A smart society means to promote the satisfaction of citizens satisfaction and\
    \ the well-being of metropolitan\nresidents. In this reference, a smart society\
    \ includes a large number of smart: people, infrastructure, education,\nliving;\
    \ water and waste management systems and many more [243]. Society 4.0 faces the\
    \ challenge with information\nsharing and related knowledge, while in society\
    \ 5.0 the increased process complexity and assured sustainability due\nto the\
    \ massive amount of data combined with environment and human physical investigation.\
    \ The major challenge\nwith big data is to take real-time decisions [94].\nM.\
    \ Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n263\nFig.\
    \ 24. Society evolution 1.0–5.0 [95].\n7.7.1. Society evolution\nSociety is coexistence\
    \ with nature, and according to ethnographers, society 1.0 had begun with the\
    \ birth of humans\nknown as the hunting society (Society 1.0). In 13,000 BC the\
    \ settlements had been ﬁrmly established and irrigation\ntechniques had been developed\
    \ known as an agrarian society (Society 2.0). At the end of the 18th century,\
    \ the steam\nlocomotives were invented and mass production had started, it was\
    \ the industrial society (Society 3.0). In the latter\n20th century computers\
    \ were invented and the distribution of information was started, this is the information\
    \ society\n(Society 4.0). At the beginning of the 21st century, “super-smart society”\
    \ has introduced and known as (Society\n5.0). The social evolution has categorized\
    \ and concise as given below (Fig. 24).\nSociety 1.0: – This society’s evolution\
    \ begins with the birth of humans. This society is also called a hunting\nsociety.\
    \ People used simple tools for full ﬁll their daily needs including food. People\
    \ have changed their habits on\nthe availability of resources [138].\nSociety\
    \ 2.0: – In 13000 BC this social evolution was introduced with new developing\
    \ agriculture techniques\nand it is also known as an agrarian society. With the\
    \ advancement of technology and demographical changes, this\nrevolution is transformed\
    \ from the earlier society revolution [29]. In Mesopotamia, the hand-made pottery\
    \ and the\ncultivation of barley and wheat were found at early stages [14].\n\
    Society 3.0: – This societal revolution begin at the end of the 18th century,\
    \ when modern physics, gravity law, and\nthe invention of the steam engine had\
    \ discovered and also called Industrial Society. This society changes the face\n\
    of the earth forever. As already discussed industry revolutions are one of the\
    \ growing ﬁelds in terms of economy\nas well as academia [254]. This also builds\
    \ the relationship through transportation, environment, society, and many\nmore.\n\
    Society 4.0: – This is the Information Society, initially planned in 1972 in Japan.\
    \ This society aims for a new\nera after the post-industrial revolution in the\
    \ year 1985 [179]. Here the production of information promotes human\ncreativity,\
    \ and the transition, and development of society.\nSociety 5.0: – At the beginning\
    \ of the 21st century this revolution was introduced with a vision of a “super-\n\
    smart society”. This society provides solutions to many social problems through\
    \ technologies because it is human-\ncentered. This also improves the quality\
    \ of life, the use of robots also increases, and also environment-friendly\n[14].\n\
    7.7.2. Applications of smart society\nThe smart society is directly concerned\
    \ with citizens and daily lives. The main applications are discussed below\n(Fig.\
    \ 25).\nSmart Home/Houses: – To increase the quality of life and independence,\
    \ the homes are equipped with technolo-\ngies called “smart home” [73]. Smart\
    \ homes include home appliances like television, air conditioners, smart fans\n\
    264\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 25. Applications of smart society.\nand lights, etc. are connected with IoT\
    \ devices to effectively deliver the services. To achieve the goals of providing\n\
    the services efﬁciently, the Smart Home Reasoning System (SHRS) plays an impotent\
    \ role to make decisions [181].\nReducing environmental emissions, energy management,\
    \ and increasing home automation is the primary objective\nof smart home [229].\n\
    Smart Living/People: – Smart living gives new opportunities to citizens to increase\
    \ their standard of living. It\nneeds to follow an inclusive strategic approach\
    \ across all age groups and demographics [203]. It provides solutions\nthat are\
    \ controllable, productive, sustainable, economical, and efﬁcient. Smart living\
    \ is changing people’s lives\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Yan et al.\
    \ propose an architecture that controls home lighting using a\nBluetooth-based\
    \ Android smartphone [295]. Peoples are safer in their homes, if they have to\
    \ face any problem, they\ncall independently also the objective of smart living\
    \ [153].\nSmart Buildings: – Smart building is deﬁned as it is efﬁcient energy\
    \ management, a convenient and comfort-\nable environment with reasonable investment,\
    \ and is designed to provide service and management [169]. A smart\nbuilding also\
    \ includes automated processes like security, heating, lighting, air conditioning,\
    \ ventilation, and many\nmore [221]. To develop the smart building the things\
    \ required are future-proof devices, IT skilled team, and robust\nwireless infrastructure.\
    \ The basic components of smart building for security includes CCTV system, access\
    \ control,\nintrusion system, gate automation etc [184].\nSmart Education: – With\
    \ the advancement of technologies everything may be interconnected, instrumented\
    \ with\nAI [313]. Smart education is also an emerging area nowadays and also needs\
    \ attention from both researchers and\nacademics [135]. Various smart education\
    \ projects [121] have already been performed in recent years, in which the\nﬁrst\
    \ smart education project is carried out by Malaysia in 1997 [52]. Smart education\
    \ [62] faces certain issues like\naccessing student knowledge, comparing behavioral\
    \ patterns of a student, data integration, data mining, detecting\neffective and\
    \ emotional state of the student, and many more [60].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh /\
    \ Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n265\n7.7.3. Challenges in smart\
    \ society\nEfﬁciency: – All resource uses in a smart society have their limits\
    \ like battery power, memory storage, and\nbandwidth required for communication.\
    \ They directly affect efﬁciency, which also increases with the rapid growth\n\
    in data.\nHeterogeneous data: – The data generated in the super-smart city is\
    \ heterogeneous, which leads to challenges in\nprocessing, analyzing, and mining\
    \ data. Getting adequate information from big data in heterogeneous information\n\
    networks is also a big challenge.\nPrivacy preserving: – On increasing of smart\
    \ technologies in a smart society the issue of security, and privacy is\nthe main\
    \ concern. Challenges in all aspects like access control, authentication, policy\
    \ enforcement etc.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Society: As such we have not\
    \ found any existing use of PDS in the smart society.\nSo here the scope of use\
    \ of PDS is highly recommendable. In lieu of the above challenges, there are many\
    \ studies\nand researches available that PDS and its variants give an efﬁcient\
    \ result with memory management, and storage,\nalso to handle heterogeneous data.\
    \ PDSs also provide security to the data.\n7.8. Smart sustainability\nThe idea\
    \ of sustainability was introduced in 1987. Sustainability deﬁne that the to meet\
    \ today’s needs without\nsacriﬁcing the future ability to fulﬁll their requirements\
    \ like social, economic, and environmental [19]. Emerging\ntechnologies and digital\
    \ governance are also part of smart sustainability [178]. It also requires a balance\
    \ between\nthe technology, policy, and management by local government [235]. The\
    \ main pillars of sustainability are environ-\nmental, economic, and social. Smart\
    \ sustainability has the potential for solving the problems of urban areas [296].\n\
    In sustainable development, governance plays an impotent role [84]. In sustainable\
    \ development’s planning and\nimplementation, the stakeholder and policymakers\
    \ lack practical research knowledge. To achieve this new technolo-\ngies like\
    \ ICT, IoT and cloud are being used in a smart city. Modern technology and creativity\
    \ are being focused\non the framework of smart cities as compared to sustainability\
    \ cities depending on the data-driven identiﬁcation\nof the dynamic changes in\
    \ the broadcast relationship [258]. To achieve the required level of sustainability\
    \ the data\ncame from various sources in smart cities are need to be well structured.\
    \ The IoT technologies measures in smart\nsustainable cities are air and water\
    \ quality, green urban areas, tourism and culture, energy, digital transformation,\
    \ le-\ngality, and security (Fig. 26). Sustainable economic advancement includes\
    \ all the factors that are included in a smart\ncity. These factors are green\
    \ building, smart education, social responsibility, water management, sustainable\
    \ energy,\nsmart health, smart governance, natural resource management, sustainable\
    \ transportation, and waste management\n(Fig. 27).\nFig. 26. Smart sustainable.\n\
    7.8.1. Challenges in smart sustainability\nCollection of data: – For developing\
    \ sustainability a huge amount of big data is required at a place.\nStorage management:\
    \ – The management of this data in a proper manner is a big challenge.\nPrivacy\
    \ and Security: – Security and privacy of this data is also the main concern.\n\
    266\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 27. Smart sustainable city.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Sustainability: As\
    \ such we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart city\nsustainability.\
    \ So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. The PDS and its variant\
    \ are very much\neffective in data collection with less time and efﬁcient storage\
    \ management. It also provides security to the data\nmovement in smart sustainability.\n\
    8. Comprehensive analysis of PDS in smart city\nIn the smart city, the data, and\
    \ information are the entrance to instantly bounded competitive beneﬁts. Today,\n\
    billions of people are accessing and releasing huge amounts of data via the internet,\
    \ and social networks. This\ngrowth in data required efﬁcient storage and handling\
    \ of data is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96].\nTo improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of data access and testing, the storage of monthly or annual data\
    \ production from various\ncompanies, hospitals, institutions, and forests is\
    \ at data centers [118]. The variants of data structures in PDSs are\nimportant\
    \ for big data and live streaming systems. A BF is a probabilistic randomized\
    \ data structure given by Burton\nBloom, for efﬁciently storing information of\
    \ static sets to support membership queries [36]. Presently BF is widely\nused\
    \ in many networking and security algorithms [201]. After studying the existing\
    \ uses of PDS in smart cities, it is\nfound that many researchers have used BF\
    \ in healthcare for efﬁcient storage of patient data, privacy-preserving etc.\n\
    in various applications Some of the existing applications of PDS in a smart city\
    \ are recapitulated in below (Table 6).\n9. Generational data management\nA massive\
    \ amount of data is ﬂowing in a smart city. Obviously, this data needs to be managed\
    \ for their well-being\nto be used for both personal and civic data services.\
    \ The use of WEB 3.0 for data management is also important.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\

    \ – May be applicable in smart city applications.\nIslam et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ mechanism using bloom ﬁlter which provides protection from cyber threats\nin\
    \ the healthcare system [125]. In this concern, Liu et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ distributed data storage\nscheme with enabled edge computing. The counting bloom\
    \ ﬁlter is used when the storage checking fails to locate\nthe error data and\
    \ to realize data dynamics [161]. Similarly, Nie et al. propose a secure and privacy-preserving\n\
    blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. For secure proﬁle matching, the ‘Key-policy\
    \ attribute-based encryption’\nalgorithm is used, and to verify the authenticity\
    \ of ciphertext, a bloom ﬁlter with hash functions is designed [200].\nA secure\
    \ framework in a sustainable city environment is proposed by Singh et al. for\
    \ smart parking that is energy\nefﬁcient and blockchain-enabled. For secure communication\
    \ of parking zone data, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n(ECC) algorithm is used\
    \ at the transport layer to encrypt and decrypt the data [247].\n10. Research\
    \ opportunities and challenges in smart city\nAs discussed in Section 1.1, big\
    \ data analysis, retrieval, and processing have very high importance from the\n\
    perspective of smart cities. As storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured\
    \ data, especially when responses\nare required in real-time, remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge for researchers. From the extensive LR done, some of the\nidentiﬁed\
    \ research areas are:\nFiltering and processing of sensor data: – The data generated\
    \ by various sensors and wearable devices have\nsome limitations like security,\
    \ privacy, ethics, data format, user acceptance, and big data concerns. Also,\
    \ have\nincompatibility issues between data and information. The information collected\
    \ by these devices may contain some\nnoise. This sensor data may be also corrupted\
    \ by the signals antiques like missing value and noise issues, which\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ reduce phase performance. Before using data for any future analysis, this issue\
    \ needs to be addressed.\nDifﬁcult to monitoring user’s social networking data:\
    \ – It is difﬁcult to monitor users’ data on social network-\ning sites. In smart\
    \ healthcare, doctors can’t rely on data from social media. But still, a system\
    \ for detecting the\npsychological disturbance in patients is presented named\
    \ emotional healthcare. Some techniques used to detect de-\npressive and stressful\
    \ content are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),\
    \ and\nBi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Also proposed recommendation\
    \ systems for patients to get a\ntext-based on the results while they had been\
    \ monitored.\nLack of efﬁcient computational models and data structures: – The\
    \ expansion of massive data has generated\nlarge and complicated data sets. Traditional\
    \ methods used for storage and retrieval of data, increase the computation\noverhead\
    \ in big processing and hence are unable to meet the requirements of the users.\
    \ For big data handling some\nadvanced data, models are required which produce\
    \ results in minimum time with minimum computation overhead.\nOne of the basic\
    \ problems of massive data is to style efﬁcient computational models and data\
    \ structures for solving\nthese problems in big data.\nThe need for energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data processing: – The rise of uses of IoT devices concept paved the way for\
    \ a\nsmart city. Energy management has become a major issue resource as IoT devices\
    \ are constantly consuming huge\namounts of energy. These concerns must be considered\
    \ in order to establish an effective mechanism. The efﬁcient use\n272\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nof power aims to\
    \ promise a sustainable city. In addition, IoT devices produce a larger amount\
    \ of data which is needed\nfor optimal processing. Enforcing another challenge\
    \ in securing smart cities is the sharing of data and access control.\nData storage\
    \ and processing: – Smart Cities take hold of the relative advantage of being\
    \ robust for storing\ndata and processing it in the information world. The applications\
    \ of smart cities have generated a continuous huge\namount of data from different\
    \ sources. The existing traditional methods are insufﬁcient to manage this volume\n\
    of data and they have restricted processing speed and effective storage expansion\
    \ costs. To overcome this issue,\nefﬁcient computational models and data structures\
    \ are required.\nVolume data: – Although it is difﬁcult to quantify this challenge\
    \ because data sets are typically very big like hun-\ndreds of terabytes or more.\
    \ The traditional storage system like Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n\
    and new big data technologies like Hadoop are developed to efﬁciently count the\
    \ data that must be kept and pro-\ncessed. The new data structures are also required\
    \ to handle and produce results at run time.\nReal time response: – The Response\
    \ Time (RT) in the smart city is very important in term of service, results, data\n\
    transmission etc. The RT directs to the fact that the data transmission and business\
    \ data infrastructure at elevated cost\nand should be considered with fewer delays.\
    \ In this case, various techniques have been used which are depending\non the\
    \ situation and difﬁculty of analysis. In smart cities where responses need to\
    \ be given after processing huge\ndata or by handling streaming data, then traditional\
    \ techniques and approaches are not efﬁcient. So some new data\nhandling techniques/data\
    \ structures are required to provide results in real-time.\nVariety of Data: –\
    \ In the smart city the source of a variety of data is also a major issue. The\
    \ smart city data\nis available in different data sets for different applications\
    \ of smart city and with different format styles like audio,\nvideo, images, text\
    \ etc. The data collected from a variety of sources are ambiguous, unstructured,\
    \ or semi-structured.\nThis data needs to be in a well-structured manner for effective\
    \ and efﬁcient results. The traditional methods are not\nsufﬁcient or even do\
    \ not provide accurate results in the real-time scenarios. For this data management,\
    \ a new data\nstructure like PDS is required.\nSearching and Retrieving for a\
    \ data item from the big data: – In huge data, the task of efﬁciently searching\n\
    and retrieving appropriate data for review in the petabyte and exabyte ranges,\
    \ in a variety of formats, is a major\nchallenge. In some applications when deadlines\
    \ are associated, this challenge becomes more tedious.\nStream Processing(Data\
    \ Collection and Distribution Analysis): – The streaming of big data in smart\
    \ cities is a\nbig challenge. There is a huge amount of data is ﬂow in the smart\
    \ city. The processing and analysis of this set of\ndata are required. When raw\
    \ data is combined like vehicle and road, geolocation sensor and social media,\
    \ weather\ndata, then the streaming of data may cause some issues like a too long\
    \ time in result, access problem etc. Also\nsome problems in development like\
    \ it is still dependent. Various decisions and predictions are based on this type\
    \ of\ndata like trafﬁc, future power consumption, etc. Some traditional systems\
    \ are proposed but with various limitations.\nA new mechanism is required to design\
    \ for efﬁcient and effective results.\nIntegration of Heterogeneous Data Sources\
    \ (Diversity Consolidation): – The data coming from different sources\nis not\
    \ in proper sequence, maybe in a different format, or ambiguous. The operation\
    \ on these data sets is difﬁcult to\napply like validation, authentication, updating,\
    \ alteration etc. This data is need to be well structured and organized.\nNatural\
    \ Text Analysis and Communication(social media analysis): – The analysis of natural\
    \ text from social\nnetworks is available through mobile devices like smartphones\
    \ is also challenging. This data is used for monitoring\nthe behavior and emotions\
    \ of citizens in real life. The information on location from various social networking\
    \ sites is\nnot in a proper format. The data include the comments and statements\
    \ about the user’s feelings, thoughts, interests,\nrelations etc. are integrated\
    \ with sensor data. The reliability of this data is also a big challenge.\nAmbient\
    \ Intelligence issues/challenges (speciﬁc to the current generation of smart city\
    \ domains): – The ex-\npeditious growth of conversion from rural to urban areas\
    \ and urban to smart cities is increasing rapidly. It also\nincreases the usage\
    \ and deployment of smart technologies in everything and everywhere in the city.\
    \ So, smart cities\nmay also face some ambient intelligence issues. The main concern\
    \ in smart cities is AI, and privacy when combine\nwith automation and autonomous\
    \ system [257]. This may also create some design trade-offs like:\nHuman control\
    \ vs. automation: Fail to recognize the speed limit sign or fooled by scam stickers\
    \ on road by\nautonomous driving [86]. Autonomous car driving (Uber) had met a\
    \ deadly accident with a woman walking at night\n[185]. Hard Behavior is also\
    \ one of the problems in autonomous systems. An example of this is conversations\
    \ of\ncustomers with fully automated call centers, and online shopping without\
    \ the involvement of humans. In AI-based\nbehavior, there are missing traceability,\
    \ transparency, and incomprehensible decisions.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n273\nPrivacy vs. smartness: There is also a trade-off\
    \ between privacy and intelligence. To provide smartness, the data\nshould be\
    \ provided to smart services. For this, blockchain is used, which is also cost-effective.\n\
    Infrastructure: To improve the standard of citizens, sensor technology is used\
    \ for analyzing and gathering in-\nformation. These sensors generally collect\
    \ the data like air quality, crime rates, rush hour stats, etc. To install these\n\
    types of sensors a complicated and costly infrastructure is involved [224].\n\
    Hackers vs Security: The threat level to security has also increased, as the uses\
    \ of sensors and IoT technology\nhave expanded.\nBeing Socially Inclusive: The\
    \ programs like ‘smart transit’ which is a great idea for the bustling city for\
    \ real-time\nupdates. This may also raise some issues like: some people in smart\
    \ cities can’t afford to take transit, all elderly\ngrowing people do use smart\
    \ mobile devices or apps, and how it is possible to use and reach technology to\
    \ these\ngroups of people?\n11. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper, we have\
    \ discussed the role of big data in Section 1.1, where we emphasize the importance\
    \ of big\ndata in smart cities. In Section 2 the generations of smart cities have\
    \ been discussed. There are various architectures\nthat have been discussed by\
    \ many researchers, but the most appropriate architecture for the smart city is\
    \ elaborated\nin Section 4. Los Angeles took the ﬁrst action or made the ﬁrst\
    \ contribution to smart city projects in 1974. They\nanalyze the urban big data.\
    \ In Section 5 listed various projects to date and also future plans regarding\
    \ smart cities.\nThe role of big data in smart cities is crucial in a smart city.\
    \ Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) have been discussed\n(Section 6) as a key\
    \ solution to many applications of smart cities. This paper also emphasizes the\
    \ various applications\nof smart cities, such as smart healthcare, smart transportation,\
    \ smart environment, agriculture, smart governance\nand economy, smart society,\
    \ people, education, and smart sustainability (Section 7). It has been found,\
    \ after going\nthrough various proposed techniques in the area of smart cities;\
    \ that there is an inﬂuence of big data in a smart\ncity. Generated data is inconsistent,\
    \ semi-structured, or unstructured, lack of efﬁciency in retrieval and storage\n\
    management of data, privacy, and security has major concerns. In the smart city,\
    \ the collection of data itself is a big\nchallenge. The data collected using\
    \ IoT devices, records (medical history), social media, and web pages are too\
    \ large.\nObviously, this data is redundant and unstructured. Various monitoring\
    \ systems in smart cities also have issues in the\nanalysis and representation\
    \ of this big data with low dimensions. Many researchers have put their sincere\
    \ endeavors\ninto extracting information from a huge amount of knowledge databases.\
    \ The main challenge in this effort is that\nthere is no standard approach to\
    \ efﬁciently map and keep the big data on consistent data structures. The existing\n\
    tool and techniques cannot work efﬁciently and satisfactorily in data management.\
    \ To store and processing of data\nfor optimal recovery and exploring procedures,\
    \ data structures like PDS is one of the adequate standards to use. In\nthe conclusion\
    \ of this paper after reviewing related work, we have listed the exiting and scope\
    \ of PDS in various\napplications of smart cities in Table 7.\nTable 7\nDomain\

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁelds\nof IoTA based CACC and DF challenges as listed below.\n–\

    \ con-\ncluded in Section 5.\n2 Review Selection Method\nIn this article, we have\
    \ followed the article selection method-\nology using the method Systematic Literature\
    \ Review (SLR)\nshows a representation in Fig 1. The ﬁrst step was to choose\n\
    reputed journals for selecting articles from there. The second\nphase of SLR was\
    \ the article published between 2011-2022.\nThe third step was to include articles\
    \ related to IoT/IOTA\nonly. The fourth phase was to check articles related to\
    \ IoTA\nor IoT architecture, security, CACC and DF challenges. All\nthe articles\
    \ fall in these categories that have been included\nin the systematic review.\
    \ The search focused on the scientiﬁc\nresearch publishers like Elsevier, IEEE\
    \ Xplore, Springer, Wi-\nley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor, Francis and UGC care-listed\n\
    journals. We considered the articles which were published\nbetween 2011 and 2021.\
    \ We have also considered a few\nwhitepapers, statistical survey papers and websites\
    \ to refer\nIoTA based tools. We have considered various IoTA relevant\nkeyword\
    \ search to ﬁnd relevant articles. The keywords were\n(\"Internet of Things\"\
    \ OR \"IoTA\" OR \"AIoT\" OR \"IoT based\nAgriculture Tools OR Appliance\" OR\

    ) AND (\"Dig-\nital Forensic in IoT\" OR \"Challenges OR Issue in IoT\").\nIn\
    \ this SLR method, we could identiﬁed 111 articles\nfor the study. In these articles\
    \ 91 were journal papers, 12\nconference papers and 8 book chapters. We have referred\
    \ 3\nwhite papers and 10 websites additionally. The selected pa-\npers were analyzed,\
    \ considered and classiﬁed for IoTA and\nfarming applications of the method used\
    \ in this review for\narticle selection.\n3 IoT Based Agriculture (IoTA)\nIoTA\
    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\
    \ layer is responsi-\nble for data aquisition via sensors. The communication layer\n\
    \ \nPhysical Layer\nSensor                      Actuator                     \

    \ the network. The control\nlayer works as a decision maker and performs analysis\
    \ of\nthe acquired data.\n[37] proposed IoTA architecture based on the holistic\n\
    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\
    \ work there is given lay-\nered architecture based on 5 layers as physical layer,\
    \ edge\nlayer, fog layer, application layer and cloud layer. Each lay-\ners described\
    \ in the cronological way are as follows:\nPhysical Layer: The Physical Layer\
    \ consists of physi-\ncal devices like sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Com-\n\
    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\
    \ type of sensor, the col-\nlected data is about location, temperature, orientation,\
    \ mo-\ntion, vibration, acceleration, humidity and chemical changes\nin the air.\
    \ The information is then passed to the Network\nlayer for its secure transmission\
    \ to the information [39]. The\n5\nTable 1: Comparision of Different IoTA Architectures\n\

    \ environment\nCollaboration\nand\nprocess\nlayer\nIncludes people and business\
    \ processes\n6\nPhysical Layer is also known as the Device Layer/ Percep-\ntion\
    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\
    \ assess-\nment is impossible. The absence of a complete trust zone can\nbe detected\
    \ in the microcontrollers used for IoTA devices.\n[76], ForeScout IoT Enterprise\
    \ Risk Report clearly sug-\ngests that by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will\
    \ experience\nIoT security breaches. It has captured a broader spectrum of\nthe\
    \ security vulnerabilities and attacks in IoT systems. Their\nclassiﬁcation is\
    \ unique compared to the other classiﬁcations\nas it divides the different attacks\
    \ into four distinct classes;\nPhysical, Network, Software, and Encryption attacks.\
    \ The\nsame statement is true for an IoTA system, where the IoTA\ndevices can\
    \ be attacked physically or at its network or to the\napplications. Similarly,\
    \ the attacks can be tried on encryp-\ntion schemes, as IoTA is implemented using\
    \ various existing\nnetwork technologies.\n8\nTable 2: IoTA Solutions and Techniques\n\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\
    \ also in-\nherits properties of DF challenges belong IoT. We have in-\ncluded\
    \ a few articles to discuss various DF challenges and\nissues in IoTA. According\
    \ to the principle of exchange given\nin 1934 by Dr. Edmond Locard (1877-1966),\
    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\
    \ equally applicable in\nthe IoTA.\n11\nTable 3: Emerging CACC and Its Consequences\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

    on a workbench of real-world BPMN processes. Abstract Fog Computing is especially
    appealing to the Internet of Things (IoT) because it provides computing, storage,
    and communication resources at the edge of the network, near the physical world
    (PW). Thus, IoT located in the PW can have interesting properties such as low
    latencies, real-time operations, and data privacy. The Fog, however, is unstable
    because it is constituted of billions of devices in a dynamic environment. Moreover,
    the Fog is cyber-physical and devices are thus subjected to external PW conditions
    which increase the occurrence of failures. When failures occur in such an environment,
    the resulting consequences on the PW can be hazardous and costly. This paper presents
    F3ARIoT, a framework for autonomic resilience of IoT applications in the Fog.
    This framework recovers from failures as well as maintains consistency and safety
    with respect to the PW during the recovery procedure. F3ARIoT was implemented
    and evaluated on a smart home application. A performance evaluation showed that
    it has a negligible overhead and recovers from failures in a very short delay
    with respect to end-users. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) can be described as a network of devices
    (or objects) having a cyber-physical existence as they lie at the frontier between
    the digital and the physical world. The physical world refers to spaces with the
    presence and interaction of living things as opposed to data-centers and software
    elements which are located in the digital space. The IoT is thus composed of devices
    which have an existence both in the physical and digital world, having processing
    and communicating capabilities, and interact with both spaces: sensors report
    information on the physical world and actuators act on the physical world by automating
    physical actions. This network of devices may be of varying spread (e.g., a personal,
    local, or wide area network and potentially the internet). One of the major drawbacks
    of IoT devices is that they suffer from constrained capabilities. These limitations
    imply that the functions of these devices cannot be extended (e.g., firmware,
    APIs), their processing units are not accessible to carry out unintended computations,
    and their storage capacities are limited or not accessible. Fog Computing [1],
    [2], [3] is a continuum ranging from the IoT devices in the Physical World (PW),
    to the datacenters of the cloud, that provides computing, storage and communication
    resources. Telcos infrastructures are typical examples of this continuum. At the
    edge and near the IoT devices, millions of ISP boxes serve as a gateway for IoT
    devices and can host local tasks as described in [4]. Thousands of base stations
    that provide mobile connectivity, can run Fog tasks in a neighborhood perimeter
    as can do thousands of street hubs that provide wired connectivity (xDSL, optical
    fiber). In addition, some local micro-datacenters can be deployed as illustrated
    in [4]. Further, hundreds of Points of Presence (PoPs) interconnect networks of
    hubs, base stations and other PoPs at a regionnal level [5]. Therefore, the Fog
    does not only provide necessary resources for IoT applications, but it also meets
    the latencies, privacy, QoS, location awareness which the cloud fails to resolve.
    For this reason, the deployment of IoT applications in the Fog has become increasingly
    popular and finds application in many fields such as smart homes and cities, agriculture,
    healthcare, transportation, and many more [6]. The Fog-IoT ecosystem, however,
    suffers from a low stability and is prone to failures because of bulk production
    of devices and cheap design. Devices in the Fog are prone to many types of failures
    due to power (e.g., accidental unplugging, battery drain), to hardware (e.g.,
    hardware malfunction, overheating), or to software (e.g., bugs). IoT devices are
    commonly connected by wireless network links because it brings convenience and
    flexibility to end users. Such networks are however volatile because the propagation
    of radio signals are easily obstructed and the reflection of the signals on obstacles
    (e.g., door, wall, furniture) causes interference [7]. Motion of wireless devices
    causes fluctuations and attenuations in the level of received signals [8]. Moreover,
    cyber-physical devices suffer from environmental conditions of the physical world
    which cause wear-out and increase the occurrence of failures. IoT devices may
    also suffer from accidental damages from human interactions and even vandalism.
    When a software or an IoT device fails, it loses its volatile memory (i.e., its
    state of execution). If it is restarted/rebooted, its state of execution becomes
    inconsistent with the rest of the application because it processes events differently.
    It has consequently an unexpected and inconsistent behaviour. This can cause disruptions
    within the application that can induce more failures and potentially cause the
    failure of the whole application. The resulting service downtime can be very costly
    for large corporations. Since the Fog-IoT ecosystem is cyber-physical, failures
    may have impacts on the PW by inducing unsafe and life-threatening situations.
    For instance, if the failure of the autopilot software in an autonomous car or
    the failure of a connected drug injection device of a patient is not repaired,
    it may be fatal. Even failures which are a priori insignificant, such as the failure
    of a lamp, may prove to be hazardous in the context of a smart home for elderly
    and medicated people. In a crop irrigation application, the reboot of the application
    or negligent recovery procedures may deliver additional pesticides to the crops
    since the information on the amount of pesticide already delivered may be lost.
    In this case, additional cost is incurred and the impact on the physical world
    includes the damage and contamination of the crops. We refer to these types of
    impact on the physical world as a cyber-physical inconsistency. The Fog-IoT environment
    brings new challenges regarding resilience since applications are stateful and
    cyber-physical. Stateful applications have, at any given time instant, internal
    states characterised by the execution conditions, input parameters, environment
    variables, stored data, etc. Since applications are cyber-physical, devices can
    interact with the PW and thus they can change the state of the PW. The state of
    the PW relates to what we can perceive around us (temperature, humidity, light
    intensity) and is given by sensors and actuators. Therefore, after a failure,
    the recovery procedure should repair the application and restore its state taking
    into account the changes in the context of the PW as well as the impact of the
    state restoration procedure on the PW. These considerations ensure that the state
    of the application is consistent with the state of the PW so that cyber-physical
    inconsistencies are avoided. However, maintaining cyber-physical consistency (CP-consistency)
    is complex because cyber-physical events, unlike applicative events, are non-deterministic
    and depend on the PW time, space, and context. For instance, the events provoking
    the turning off of a lamp in an office (e.g., because of an increase in light
    intensity at noon) may no longer be valid a few hours later. Furthermore, the
    output devices that interact with the PW can act on the latter in a definitive
    way and the state of the PW cannot be rolled back. For example, the delivery of
    pesticides on crops by a smart irrigation system cannot be reverted. For these
    reasons, care should be taken when restoring the states of devices. The technique
    for restoring the state (e.g., a basic replay of events) of a device may introduce
    intermediary states that can have undesirable or even dangerous consequences on
    the PW and thus break CP-consistency. For instance, replaying messages on an injection
    device of a patient may inject already administered doses of a drug. In this work,
    we propose F3ARIoT (Framework For Autonomic Resilience of the Fog and IoT), an
    autonomic failure management approach for IoT applications in the Fog which maintains
    CP-consistency when recovering from failures. The approach focuses on Smart Home
    / Building environments. F3ARIoT is based on four functional steps: (i) state
    saving, (ii) monitoring, (iii) failure notification, and (iv) recovery. Each step
    implements a collection of similar roles taking into account the specificities
    of the ecosystem (e.g., heterogeneity, resource limitations, cyber-physical interactions).
    State saving aims at saving data concerning the state of the managed application.
    These include runtime parameters and the data in the volatile memory, as well
    as messages exchanged and functions executed by the application. This is done
    through uncoordinated checkpoint, message logging, and function call recording
    techniques [9]. Monitoring aims at observing and reporting information on the
    lifecycle (e.g., restarted, stopped, failed, recovered) of the application. It
    is particularly useful for failure detection. When a failure is detected, failure
    notifications are propagated to the part of the application which is affected
    by that failure. The propagation of failure notifications aims at limiting the
    impact of the failure and providing a partial service. In order to recover from
    a failure, the application is reconfigured and the data saved during the state
    saving step are used to restore a cyber-physical consistent state of the application.
    Cyber-physical consistency aims at maintaining a consistent behaviour of the application
    with respect to the physical world, as well as avoiding dangerous and costly circumstances
    (e.g., drug injection, elderly people surveillance, crop irrigation, ...). F3ARIoT
    was implemented and evaluated on a smart home application. The results showed
    the feasibility of deploying F3ARIoT on real Fog-IoT applications as well as its
    good performances in regards to end user experience. Our evaluation showed that
    F3ARIoT is able to recover from failures in less than one second. To sum up, the
    contributions of this paper are as follows: • A model of the Fog-IoT ecosystem
    is proposed. This model defines the devices constituting the Fog infrastructure
    and the applicative entities that run on this infrastructure. • The design of
    an autonomic end-to-end failure management approach, which is composed of the
    following four functional steps: state saving mechanisms, monitoring for detection
    of failures, failure notifications for limiting the impact of failures, and recovery
    which involves the reconfiguration and restoration of a consistent state of the
    application. • State saving policies which describe various combinations of state
    saving techniques in order to cope with the specificities of the Fog-IoT ecosystem.
    • A recovery procedure that is consistent within the application and with respect
    to the physical world (i.e., cyber-physical consistency). • The implementation
    of the failure management approach (F3ARIoT framework) and its evaluation on a
    smart home testbed. The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 defines
    a model of IoT applications in the Fog. Section 3 describes the architecture of
    F3ARIoT and details the different failure management steps involved in the proposed
    approach. Section 4 reports the implementation of F3ARIoT and its evaluation on
    a smart home application. Section 5 discusses related work. Finally, Section 6
    concludes and explores future work. 2. Models F3ARIoT relies on a model of IoT
    applications which is presented in this section. The model describes the characteristics
    of the different entities involved in the Fog-IoT ecosystem. The failure management
    mechanisms involved in F3ARIoT are based on this proposed model in order to manage
    the entities of the application with respect to their characteristics. To this
    end, the application is defined by different types of applicative entities hosted
    on infrastructure entities. Applicative entities participate in the execution
    of the application through their functions and services which are described by
    their corresponding behavioural models. The behavioural model describes how the
    state of an applicative entity changes upon interaction with other entities and
    with the physical world. Infrastructure entities provide execution resources to
    run the application. In the following, we give a formal definition of the Fog-IoT
    ecosystem. 2.1. Behavioural model The behavioural model (BM) describes the behaviour
    of an application as a set of states and how these states change with respect
    to the operations that are executed by the entities of the application. The information
    provided by the behavioural model is used in failure management to compute a consistent
    target state in order to restore the application during a recovery procedure (see
    Section 3.5). The information available to construct the behavioural model of
    an entity may be given by the manufacturer of a device or the developer of a service
    (e.g., Bosch [10]), or be extracted from runtime contextual observations of an
    entity [11]. The execution state, or state for short, of an entity is characterised
    by a set of variables such as input parameters, execution conditions, environment
    variables, and stored data. Definition 1 (State) The State of an entity is defined
    as a set of couples (vari, valuei) where vari is a variable identifier and valuei
    is its corresponding value. The state of an entity changes upon the reception
    and emission of events as well as internal computations which are independent
    of received/emitted events (e.g., an action executed periodically such as a lamp
    switching on every day at 6 p.m.). A change in state is modelled by a transition
    function which takes as input a state, a set of parameters and defines the invariants
    for each parameter. Two types of BM are defined according to the information available
    on the behaviour of an entity: a Default Behavioural Model (DBM) and an Enriched
    Behavioural Model (EBM). The DBM characterises entities for which building a complete
    BM is not feasible because the necessary information is lacking or impossible
    to retrieve (e.g., hidden APIs or obfuscated proprietary APIs). Therefore, a DBM
    defines the behaviour of an entity for which only the incoming/outgoing events
    of the entity can be observed and therefore can be defined. However, the subsequent
    changes in state induced by these events cannot be characterised. In this case,
    we refer to the set of states as a single macro-state. Definition 2 (DBM) A Default
    Behavioural Model is defined by the following tuple, where the set of states is
    a singleton containing one macro-state {ms}; Σ is a finite set of events; Tdbm⊆{ms}
    × Σ × Act × VΣ × InvV × {ms} is a finite set of transitions such that: • Act ∈
    {?, !} where ? characterises the reception of an event and ! characterises the
    emission of an event. • VΣ corresponds to a set of expressions (e.g., a set of
    values) received or emitted. • InvV defines the invariants associated to the values
    VΣ. The invariants characterise the range of correct values of the variables in
    VΣ. A transition is executed if the invariants are satisfied. In this case, a
    transition is denoted as . An EBM characterises applicative entities for which
    the behaviour specification is provided by the administrator of the entity (e.g.,
    manufacturer of a device, the developer or provider of a service) or can be built
    from the observation of the entity. In this case, the set of states can be made
    explicit, as well as the events that cause the changes of states. Definition 3
    (EBM) An Enriched Behavioural Model is defined by the following tuple, where S
    is a finite set of states; s0 ∈ S is the initial state; Σ is a finite set of events;
    is a finite set of transitions such that: • Act ∈ {?, !, σ} where ? characterises
    the reception of an event, ! characterises the emission of an event, and σ characterises
    an internal computation. • corresponds to a set of expressions (e.g., a set of
    values) emitted or a set of variables allocated in the case of a received event.
    • InvV defines the invariants associated to the values VΣ. In this case, a transition
    is denoted as . The two types of BM are illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 (a) illustrates
    the DBM of a face recognition software element. It is represented with a macro-state.
    In this case, the inputs and outputs based on events received and emitted are
    known. However, the variables describing the state of the software element and
    how these events affect its state are unknown (for e.g., images stored and how
    they are processed). The software element receives the event faceRecognition?recognised
    such that the variable recognised indicates whether the person is recognised or
    not. Thus, the invariant of the parameter recognised is as follows, recognised
    ∈ {true, false}. The software element emits the event status! to indicate that
    a person is recognised. Therefore, the invariant defined for this transition is
    recognised ∈ {true}. Fig. 1 (b) illustrates the EBM of a connected lamp. The lamp
    has two states that are described by the variables on and intensity. The lamp
    receives events for its actuation. The transition setOn?i represents the reception
    of an event to turn on the lamp at a given brightness intensity i. The variable
    on takes the value true and the variable intensity takes the value of the parameter
    i in the received event. The transition setI?i modifies the intensity of the lamp.
    Both transitions define the invariants for the value of the parameter i which
    can take the values in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Thus, the lamp can be turned on
    with five levels of intensity. Note that if the invariants are not satisfied,
    the transition is not executed. Executing the transition setOff? turns off the
    lamp. In this case, the variable intensity is set to 0 and the variable on to
    false. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. EBM and DBM models. It is possible
    to make use of these behavioural models for verification purposes as it is done
    for instance in [12], [13], but this is not the goal of this work. 2.2. Application
    model The PW plays an important role in cyber-physical IoT applications because
    devices such as sensors and actuators interact with the PW. A model of the PW
    which describes how the application interacts with PW and how it changes the state
    of the PW is useful because it allows the observation of the state of the PW and
    thus a recovery procedure that is consistent with respect to the PW can be implemented.
    In the following, we first define the PW and then we define the entities involved
    in an IoT application. The physical world is defined with respect to geographical
    spaces. These spaces are zones delimited by physical boundaries and defining the
    scope of action of sensors and actuators. For instance, in a smart home, the geographical
    spaces represent the different rooms in the home and the external spaces such
    as the porch or the garden. These geographical spaces can be given by the BIM
    (Building Information Modelling) [14]. Each geographical space is characterised
    by a state consisting of a set of sensor and actuator events. Definition 4 (Geographical
    Space) A Geographical Space is defined as where id identifies gs uniquely; G is
    an Euclidean space; the set characterises the state of gs where ei is a sensed
    or actuated event and vti is the time duration for which the event is maintained
    and valid. Definition 5 (Physical World) The Physical World is modelled as a finite
    set of n geographical spaces such that where gsi is a geographical space. An IoT
    application is composed of the following entities: appliances, software elements,
    fog nodes, and logical bindings. An appliance is an entity that provides a fixed
    set of services that are only operable through its exposed APIs. They have no
    accessible hosting capabilities and are usually cyber-physical entities that provide
    sensing and actuating services over a geographical space. An appliance has a behaviour
    and a corresponding current state at any given point in its execution. Definition
    6 (Appliance) An appliance is defined by the tuple where id is an identifier;
    gs is a geographical space; I is a finite non-extensible set of interfaces through
    which its services are accessible; bm is the behavioural model of the appliance,
    and cs is its current state. A software element is a unit of software to be executed.
    It participates in the execution of the application through its corresponding
    functions and services. A software element has a behaviour and a corresponding
    current state at any given point in its execution. Definition 7 (Software Element)
    A Software Element is defined by where id is an identifier; I is a finite set
    of interfaces exposed by the software element through which its services are accessible;
    bm is the behavioural model of the software element, and cs is its current state.
    Software elements can interact with each other and with appliances. These interactions
    are achieved thanks to communications through logical bindings. Logical bindings
    are directed according to the dependencies between interacting entities. An entity
    e1 is said to be functionally dependent on another entity e2 (denoted e1 → e2)
    if e1 implements its services by using other services that are implemented by
    e2. The dependency between e1 and e2 can be mandatory or optional. A mandatory
    dependency means e1 requires e2 to be functionally operable whereas e1 can be
    functionally operable even if an optional dependency is not satisfied. Definition
    8 (Logical Binding) A Logical Binding is defined by where id is an identifier;
    se is a software element; e is a software element or an appliance; dir ∈ { → ,  ←
    } gives the direction of the dependency, that is, se → e or se ← e, and dep indicates
    whether the dependency is mandatory or optional. Note that there are no bindings
    between appliances. An appliance, therefore, always has at least one binding to
    a software element. If a logical binding exists between se and e, they are said
    to be neighbours, that is, se ∈ neigh(e) and therefore e ∈ neigh(se). Also, the
    number of neighbours of an applicative entity e is given by . Software elements
    are hosted by fog nodes. The fog node provides access to the underlying physical
    resources and the runtime environment for the execution of software elements.
    A fog node also hosts a special software element called Fog Agent which is responsible
    for lifecycle management (setup, installing runtime, reconfigurations) of local
    software elements and neighbouring appliances. Definition 9 (Fog Node) A Fog Node
    is denoted by where id is an identifier; SE is a finite set of software elements
    hosted on the fog node, and fga is a fog agent. Definition 10 (Application) An
    IoT Application, or Application for short, is modelled as a directed acyclic graph,
    . Each vertex represents a software element se ∈ SE or an appliance apl ∈ APL
    such that . Logical bindings are represented by the set of edges Eapp. The application
    graph is connected, that is for an application with more than one software element/appliance,
    ∀v ∈ Vapp, deg(v) ≠ 0. 2.3. Infrastructure model The Fog infrastructure is composed
    of the following three types of physical entities: physical nodes, appliances,
    and network links. Since the services (software) provided by the appliance are
    tied to the device (hardware), we refer to an appliance as both an infrastructure
    and applicative entity. In the following, all identifiers are unique. A physical
    node is a device that provides physical resources (computing, storage, and communication)
    and is fully administrable (resource allocation, deployment, reconfiguration,
    lifecycle management, etc.). Definition 11 (Physical Node) A Physical Node is
    denoted by where id is an identifier and fgn is a unique fog node hosted by the
    physical node. A network link provides the transmission medium between a couple
    of physical nodes or a physical node and an appliance. Definition 12 (Network
    Link) A Network Link is denoted by where id is an identifier; pn is a physical
    node, and e is a physical node or an appliance. If a network link exists between
    two infrastructure entities pn and e, they are said to be neighbours, that is,
    pn ∈ neigh(e) and e ∈ neigh(pn). The number of neighbours of an infrastructure
    entity e is given by . Definition 13 (Infrastructure) A Fog Infrastructure, or
    Infrastructure for short, is modelled as an undirected graph, . Each vertex represents
    a physical node pn ∈ PN or an appliance apl ∈ APL. Thus, . Each edge represents
    a network link. The infrastructure graph is connected, that is for an infrastructure
    with more than one physical node/appliance, ∀v ∈ Vinfra, deg(v) ≠ 0. In order
    to run an application, it has to be deployed on the infrastructure according to
    a placement [15] that maps Gapp to Ginfra. Fig. 2 illustrates the placement and
    deployment of an application onto an infrastructure. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Mapping of the application on the infrastructure. In this example,
    the application is composed of two fog nodes fgn1 and fgn2. The fog node fgn1
    hosts one software element se1 and the fog agent fga1. Both software elements
    se2 and se3, and the fog agent fga2 are hosted on fgn2. The behaviour of the respective
    software elements are given by and . The software elements se2 and se3 depend
    on se1. They communicate with se1 through the logical bindings lb21 and lb31,
    respectively. The software element se3 is connected to and depends on the appliances
    appl1 and appl2. This is illustrated by the bindings lba31 and lba32. se3 has
    an optional dependency on appl2 which is depicted by a dashed arrow. All the other
    dependencies are mandatory. The behaviour of the two appliances are given by and
    . The appliances are located in two distinct geographical spaces gs1 and gs2.
    The infrastructure is composed of two physical nodes, two appliances, and three
    network links. The physical nodes pn1 and pn2 host and provide the execution resources
    to the fog nodes fgn1 and fgn2, respectively. The network link nl12 provides the
    transmission medium between the two physical nodes. It provides the resources
    for the implementation of the bindings between the remote software elements. nla21
    is a wireless network link between pn2 and appl1 whereas nla22 is a cabled network
    link between pn2 and appl2. These two network links, nla21 and nla22, allow the
    interactions between the software element se3 and the appliances appl1 and appl2,
    respectively. 2.4. Failure model F3ARIoT aims at repairing crash failures that
    affect both infrastructure and applicative entities. A crash failure occurs when
    an entity which was executing its correct behaviour deviates from its expected
    behaviour by halting unexpectedly. The failure model is motivated by real case
    failures that can be observed in the Fog-IoT environment. Devices are usually
    connected via wireless networks which are unstable and volatile. Physical nodes
    and appliances can fail because of a power failure (e.g., temporary outage, accidental
    unplugging, battery drain). When this happens, the hosted fog node and software
    elements also fail. Software elements can crash due to lack of resources for their
    execution, unhandled exceptions, design/development errors, etc. Fig. 3 shows
    the causality between infrastructure and applicative failures. The failure of
    a network link induces the failure of the binding(s) implemented over that network
    link. The failure of a physical node results in the failure of the hosted fog
    node and software element(s). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Causality
    between failures. 3. Failure management approach and architecture The goal of
    failure management is to detect the occurrence of a failure and to implement a
    recovery procedure which suits the type of failure that occurred. This end-to-end
    failure management is rather complex and should be completely automated. It should
    not require any manual intervention in order to eliminate any human errors and
    increase efficiency in terms of time and cost. F3ARIoT makes use of the models
    presented in Section 2 to provide autonomic failure management. In the following,
    Section 3.1 gives an overview of the steps involved in the approach. Section 3.2
    details the failure managers implementing these steps as well as their architecture.
    3.3 State saving, 3.4 Monitoring and failure notification propagation, and 3.5
    successively presents the state saving, failure detection and notification, and
    recovery steps of the failure management approach. 3.1. Autonomic failure management
    Our failure management approach is based on the principle of autonomic computing
    which advocates for self-management [16] of applications. The approach consists
    of four functional steps. Each functional step implements a set of similar roles
    ensured by the failure managers involved in F3ARIoT. These failure managers are
    presented in the next subsection. (i) State saving: This step aims at saving the
    state of the application in an uncoordinated way through techniques of checkpoint,
    message logging, and function call logging [9], [17], [18], [19]. The current
    state of each applicative entity is continuously saved and stored during the running
    phase of its lifecycle. A state of the physical world is also captured and is
    constructed by the events given by sensors and actuators (see Section 3.3). (ii)
    Monitoring: This step aims at observing and reporting information on infrastructure
    and applicative entities relative to the different phases of their lifecycle.
    Monitoring allows the detection of failures of both infrastructure and applicative
    entities. It also gives information on the recovery of these entities. Monitoring
    is carried out by using the following techniques: heartbeat, ping-acks, local
    system observation, and applicative messages observation. Multiple techniques
    are required because of the heterogeneous nature of the ecosystem. In order to
    cope with the limited capacities of the Fog infrastructure, a monitoring technique
    is chosen with respect to the overhead and interference induced by the technique.
    Thus, a monitoring technique is selected with the objective of having a minimum
    overhead on the network and avoiding interference with the application (see Section
    3.4.1). (iii) Failure notification: When a failure is detected and confirmed,
    the state saving step of the failed entity stops. Failure notifications are propagated
    to notify the failure to dependent entities that are impacted by the failure.
    The impacted entities are those that have a mandatory dependency on the failed
    entity, as well as, recursively, the entities that have a mandatory dependency
    on the impacted entities. Upon the reception of failure notifications, the dependent
    entities move to the degraded phase of their lifecycle to adapt their behaviour
    with respect to the failed entity. Degraded mode can take different forms depending
    on the type of dependency on the failed entity such as restricting access to the
    APIs of the encapsulation, discarding incoming/outgoing operations or transferring
    them to another failure-free entity, and pausing the behaviour of the encapsulation
    in the case of a mandatory dependency. Thus, in a degraded mode, an entity provides
    only part or none of its services (see Section 3.4.5). (iv) Recovery: This is
    the final step which aims at repairing and restoring the state of the application.
    It is based on reconfiguration and state restoration. Reconfiguration aims at
    performing operations on the architecture of the application so as to change or
    re-establish its structure with respect to the failed entity. Reconfiguration
    is followed by state restoration where the pre-failure state of the application
    is restored by retrieving the data stored during its state saving step. When recovery
    is achieved, the dependent entities are notified through the propagation of recovery
    notifications so that they can resume their nominal behaviour (see Section 3.5).
    Fig. 4 illustrates how these failure management steps are performed on an applicative
    entity and how it affects the application over time. When an applicative entity
    is running and is fully operational, two failure management steps are performed:
    state saving and monitoring. A failure of the applicative entity at time t1 is
    detected by the monitoring step. The state saving step of the entity subsequently
    stops. A failed entity impacts the services provided by the application. Thus,
    the application is no longer fully operational. The subsequent steps, failure
    notifications and recovery are engaged. Failure notifications are propagated to
    the part of the application impacted by that failure. These entities move to a
    degraded mode so that a partial service is provided. The recovery step, composed
    of a reconfiguration and state restoration of the application, is then performed
    in order to re-establish the functions of the application. The monitoring step
    detects that the recovery step is completed (i.e., at t2). The application is
    fully operational again and the state saving step of the recovered entity can
    then be resumed. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Failure management
    steps of an applicative entity. F3ARIoT implements autonomic failure managers,
    which continuously retrieve information about the application for state saving
    and monitoring, and execute reconfigurations and recovery procedures based on
    the interpretation of the information retrieved. These failure managers and their
    architecture are presented in the next subsection. 3.2. F3ARIoT architecture This
    section highlights the failure managers (FMs) involved in F3ARIoT, their roles,
    and how they interact with each other to implement the failure management steps.
    They are placed and interact with each other as illustrated in Fig. 5. The FMs
    are composed of local and global managers. Local FMs are (i) Wrappers which encapsulate
    software elements/appliances, and (ii) Fog Agents which set up wrappers and monitor
    fog nodes. Local FMs are deployed on each fog node. The global FMs are composed
    of the Global Decision Manager (GDM) which analyses the information reported by
    the local FMs when failures occur and plans the recovery actions to perform. F3ARIoT
    also relies on the following global managers: the Application Lifecycle Manager
    (ALM), a Stable Storage (SSG), and Thing’in [23] which is an object registry.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. F3ARIoT architecture. 3.2.1. Local
    failure managers A wrapper acts as a membrane [20] by encapsulating software elements
    and appliances. A wrapper intercepts incoming/outgoing operations of software
    elements and appliances. It can also control their behaviour and perform reconfiguration
    operations on them. A wrapper encapsulates one local software element and its
    neighbouring appliances because the latter have no accessible hosting capabilities.
    Each entity encapsulated by the wrapper is referred to as an encapsulation. Definition
    14 (Wrapper) A wrapper is defined by the tuple where id is the identifier of the
    wrapper; fgn is the fog node on which the wrapper is deployed; se is the software
    element encapsulated by the wrapper; APL is a finite set of encapsulated appliances
    such that ∀apl ∈ APL, apl ∈ Neigh(se); Dep defines the set of dependencies of
    each encapsulation; Req defines a set of entities which depends on each encapsulation
    of the wrapper; Policy describes the failure management strategies for state saving,
    monitoring, failure notification and recovery of each encapsulation in . A wrapper
    has multiple roles involving the four failure management steps described in Section
    3.1. For each encapsulation, the wrapper defines the policies for these steps:
    • State saving: The wrapper defines and applies the policies for saving and storing
    the state of its encapsulations. These policies are based on uncoordinated checkpoint,
    message log, and function call record. To do so, the wrapper intercepts incoming/outgoing
    operations as well as piggybacks additional information on these operations as
    part of its state saving role. The wrapper also saves all variables and corresponding
    values that characterise the state of an entity as defined by its behavioural
    model. The state saving step is further discussed in Section 3.3. • Monitoring:
    The wrapper defines and applies the monitoring policies for failure and recovery
    detection of its encapsulations. To do so, the wrapper monitors local software
    elements through local system observation to avoid influence on the network traffic.
    Remote encapsulations are monitored by observing applicative messages and implementing
    ping-acks. The monitoring step is further described in Section 3.4.1. • Failure
    notification: The wrapper notifies the GDM of the failure of its encapsulations.
    It also receives failure notifications concerning failures that impact the execution
    of its encapsulations. When it receives such notifications, it moves the impacted
    encapsulations into a degraded mode. For instance, this can take the form of filtering
    of events and restrictions to the access of the encapsulation’s APIs so it can
    operate in a degraded mode. The wrapper also propagates the failure notifications
    to the neighbours which have dependencies on the impacted encapsulations. The
    propagation of failure notification is further discussed in Section 3.4.5. • Recovery:
    The wrapper defines and applies the local rules for recovery of its encapsulations.
    Recovery policies describe these rules and are detailed in Section 3.5. The wrapper
    reconfigures (architecture and placement) its encapsulations during the recovery
    procedure. It also retrieves the saved data for restoring the state of its encapsulations.
    Fog agents are involved in the initialisation phase of the application. They work
    together with the ALM for lifecycle management (setup, installing runtime, reconfigurations)
    of local software elements and neighbouring appliances. A fog agent has in addition
    two roles with respect to failure management: • Monitoring: A fog agent monitors
    each of its neighbouring physical nodes for failure detection by implementing
    a heartbeat mechanism. It detects the recovery of a physical node using the same
    mechanism. • Wrapper management: The fog agent manages local wrappers, that is,
    it sets up the wrappers and assigns the software elements and appliances to be
    encapsulated by the wrappers. 3.2.2. Global failure managers The global FMs have
    a global view of a subset of applicative and infrastructure entities, and subsequently
    participate in their failure management. This subset of entities is generally
    grouped with respect to geographical, functional, applicative, performance or
    other constraints. In the following, it is assumed that the global FMs are involved
    in a single application. Each global FM is subsequently treated as a single functional
    unit. Global FMs can be deployed on the infrastructure dedicated to the application
    or in the Telcos’ infrastructure. F3ARIoT relies on the following global managers:
    a Stable Storage (SSG), the ALM, Thing’in, and the GDM. The role of the SSG is
    to provide a reliable storage service that is unaffected by applicative failures
    so that wrappers can store and retrieve state data of their encapsulations. During
    the state saving step, the wrapper stores the state data on the SSG. When the
    encapsulation fails, it retrieves these data to restore a pre-failure state of
    the entity. The implementation of a stable storage may take various forms [21]
    such as a replicated file system on fog nodes or a RAID storage system [22]. In
    this work, we assume a reliable storage medium on the Telco’s Fog infrastructure
    which is dedicated to storage of state data. Thing’in [23] is a registry of the
    entities involved in an IoT application. It is implemented as a graph database.
    It defines ontologies that describe the properties of these entities as well as
    their relationships with each other and with the physical world. Thing’in also
    integrates a building information model (BIM) [14] which gives a virtual representation
    of geographical spaces (e.g., a home or building) with semantic and topological
    information such as appliances’ location and their scope of action on a geographical
    space. Thing’in exposes a set of APIs for querying the database. It can be queried
    for appliances having equivalent features to those of another appliance in a given
    geographical location. For instance, it can be queried for sensors capable of
    detecting the same changes in the environment (e.g., temperature, motion) and
    actuators capable of acting on the environment in similar ways (e.g., lamps, heaters).
    Thing’in is therefore particularly useful to find the replacement of a failed
    appliance. The GDM is a decision making entity. It receives failure notification
    messages from fog agents and wrappers. It keeps a record of the failed/recovered
    entities and updates Thing’in accordingly. When a failure occurs, the GDM and
    the wrappers propagate failure notifications to dependent entities impacted by
    the failure. The GDM also decides the steps for recovery (see Section 3.5). For
    instance, this usually involves sending requests to Thing’in to find replacement
    appliances or a new placement for software elements. The following sections give
    a more detailed presentation of each failure management step and explain how they
    are carried out by the local and global FMs. 3.3. State saving The objective of
    the state saving step of the failure management approach is to save information
    on the state of the running application. State saving is done in an uncoordinated
    way. The data characterising the state of an entity participating in an application
    are given by its behavioural model. The state data are composed of (i) the variables
    and corresponding values characterising the state of each applicative entity,
    as well as (ii) the transitions the entity executes. The state data are important
    in order to restore the state of the application so that a consistent behaviour
    can be maintained after recovery. The Fog-IoT ecosystem is highly heterogeneous
    in terms of communication model, functional constraints, and resource capacities
    (e.g., storage, processing). In order to cope with the heterogeneous nature of
    the Fog-IoT ecosystem, the state saving approach cannot rely on a single technique.
    For instance, the Fog-IoT implements multiple communication model based on messaging
    (e.g., MQTT, message buffers) and function calls (REST and SOAP APIs). In this
    case, state saving should implement techniques based on both message logging and
    function call logging. This section discusses the state saving approach, the chosen
    techniques for saving the state of an application, and how they are implemented
    in order to cope with the specificities of the Fog-IoT ecosystem. The state saving
    step of software elements and appliances is performed by wrappers. A wrapper saves
    the data from which the current state of its encapsulations can be resumed after
    a failure. These data are referred to as the state data of the encapsulation and
    is composed of checkpoints, message logs, and function call logs. A checkpoint
    consists in saving and storing the set of couples of variables and corresponding
    values, that characterise the state of an encapsulation at a given time in its
    execution. The data to save in a checkpoint are thus given by the corresponding
    EBM model of the encapsulation. Message logging and function call logging consist
    in saving the transitions that are executed by the entity upon emission/reception
    of events and execution of internal/remote computations/functions. These transitions
    are given by the EBM or DBM model of an encapsulation. 3.3.1. State saving policy
    A wrapper assigns a state saving policy for each of its encapsulations. This policy
    describes the strategy that is most suited to save the state of an encapsulation
    with respect to its properties and those of its runtime environment. To do so,
    the wrapper embeds a description file of the state saving policy for each of its
    encapsulation which describes the locally stored data to save on the stable storage,
    the state saving technique, the frequency of checkpoints, the storage location
    of the state data, and the additional data to include when saving events. Fig.
    6 illustrates the structure of the description file generated for each encapsulation.
    It gives an overview of the different parameters of the state saving policy before
    describing them in more details in Section 3.3.2. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Description of the state saving policy of an encapsulation. EncapsulationId
    gives the identifier of a software element or appliance encapsulated by the wrapper.
    The state saving policy defined in this description file applies to the identified
    encapsulation. As for appliances, LocalData indicates the data that are stored
    on the local storage as well as the filesystem path to access these data. It corresponds
    to configuration files of appliances. For instance, for a temperature sensor it
    can be the configured frequency of sending temperature data. It can also be local
    configuration files such as information on passwords or ports so that the appliance
    can connect to a service or a network. In the case of software elements, localData
    indicates the files that are needed for the initialisation and running phase of
    the software element, such as binaries, libraries and scripts. These are needed
    if the software element has to be recovered on a different fog node. StateSavingApproach
    details how the state of the encapsulation is saved. Technique specifies the adopted
    state saving technique based on checkpoint, message logging, and function call
    logging. The chosen technique for an entity can be one of these techniques or
    a combination of multiple techniques. ER specifies whether logging is performed
    at reception only or at both emission and reception. OP indicates whether a pessimistic
    or an optimistic approach is adopted for logging. In the pessimistic approach,
    each event is logged synchronously on the stable storage before delivering it
    to the encapsulation. In the optimistic approach, a set of events are temporarily
    stored locally before sending them all at once on the stable storage. The information
    defined in CkptParams are used to compute the frequency of checkpoints. A maximum
    time elapsed between two checkpoints is defined by ckptInterval. The checkpoint
    frequency is also based on the cost of processing events. To this end, Weight
    gives information on the cost of processing an event (e.g., time to compute) by
    the encapsulation. When the total cost exceeds Nckpt, a checkpoint is performed.
    A checkpoint can be stored on the stable storage or both locally and on the stable
    storage. Storage specifies the access to the local and stable storage. Local gives
    the local filesystem path to temporarily store state data. StableStorage details
    how to access the stable storage. For instance, state data can be pushed to the
    stable storage via REST API or by publishing events on a communication bus. The
    choice for storing state data on the local or stable storage depends on the state
    saving approach. VT defines the validity time vtValue for each type of event evtType.
    It indicates the time duration for which the event is valid and therefore should
    be used to compute a consistent state of the application during recovery. A wrapper
    automatically generates this description file for each of its encapsulations.
    The parameter StateSavingApproach of the description file is automatically assigned
    based on the characteristics of an encapsulation and of its runtime environment
    as discussed in the following subsection. The filesystem paths to access the local
    storage as well as the access to the stable storage have to be specified by the
    developer and/or operator (DevOps) of the application. The Weights and VT of events
    have also to be specified by the DevOps of the application. Note that values for
    the weight ( ) and VT ( ) are automatically assigned by default. This avoids the
    DevOps to manually report the values for each event. The Weights and VT can also
    be automatically inferred as discussed in the future work of this paper. The following
    subsection further describes how the state saving techniques are chosen. 3.3.2.
    State saving techniques The state saving approach is built upon three strategies:
    uncoordinated checkpoint, message logging, and function call logging. The wrapper
    performs uncoordinated checkpoint for encapsulations which are characterised by
    an EBM. This is because the variables and their corresponding values to be included
    in a checkpoint are given by the EBM model. The checkpoint technique can further
    be coupled with message logging and/or function call logging in order to save
    the operations that are executed after a checkpoint. In this way, the current
    state of the application can be restored based on the transitions executed after
    a checkpoint. An encapsulation which is characterised by a DBM cannot rely on
    the checkpoint technique since the details of its set of states are unknown. In
    this case, the state saving technique is based on message and/or function call
    logging depending on the communication model implemented. Message and function
    call logging can further be based on an optimistic or a pessimistic approach.
    Logging can also take place at the reception or emission. Table 1 illustrates
    how these different strategies are chosen with respect to the following three
    criteria: the communication model, the properties of the local storage, and the
    type of the destination entity. Table 1. State saving techniques. Communication
    model. The communication model implemented between two interacting entities can
    be based on messaging (e.g., message buffers, message oriented middleware) or
    function calls (e.g., REST and SOAP APIs). The communication model thus determines
    whether the state saving technique is based on message logging or function call
    logging. Function call logging can also be used to save the internal computations
    executed by an encapsulation. An entity can interact with multiple other entities
    and can thus implement both communication models. In this case, the technique
    for saving its state is based on both message logging and function call logging.
    In order to log received messages, the wrapper intercepts incoming messages before
    delivering them to the encapsulation. Emitted messages are also intercepted before
    forwarding them to the destination entity. Likewise, function calls are intercepted
    before calling the original function. Function call logging can also be achieved
    at the caller or at the callee (we refer to the former as emission and to the
    latter as reception, respectively). The intercepted messages and function calls
    are saved at emission and/or at reception depending on the type of destination
    entity. Destination entity. A message can be logged either by the emitting or
    by the receiving wrapper. The choice of which wrapper saves the message or function
    call is done according to the nature of the destination entity. If the destination
    is a software element, logging is done at the receiving wrapper independently
    of whether an appliance or a software element has emitted the event. However,
    the wrapper associated to an appliance is deployed on the neighbouring fog node
    because of the lack of hosting capabilities on the appliance itself. In this case,
    it means that the wrapper has to save the emitting events intended for an appliance
    because logging cannot be done at the receiving end. Therefore, a wrapper that
    encapsulates only a software element will save receiving events only. On the other
    hand, a wrapper that encapsulates both a software element and an appliance has
    to log events that are received for the software element and events that are emitted
    to the encapsulated appliance. Local storage properties. In order to determine
    if the state data can be stored locally on the fog node, the nature of the local
    storage infrastructure is characterised as persistent or unstable. An unstable
    local storage means that data stored locally can be lost or become inaccessible
    at any time instant because of failures. Thus, state data cannot be stored locally,
    even temporarily, because if a failure occurs, the state data can no longer be
    retrieved. Appliances have an unstable storage and do not have additional disk
    storage capacities. This limitation implies that their state data cannot be stored
    on the appliance itself. The storage of physical nodes can be classified as unstable
    or persistent depending on the capacities and stability of the device. A physical
    node has an unstable local storage if it cannot be rebooted after a failure and
    the data stored locally become inaccessible. For instance, a physical node powered
    by a battery cannot be automatically rebooted if it fails because of a battery
    drain. In this case, the local storage of such a physical node is classified as
    unstable. A physical node having a persistent storage implies that state data
    such as checkpoint and logs can be stored locally. The logs can be grouped locally
    and later be flushed all at once on the stable storage. This gives rise to the
    logging techniques based on an optimistic or a pessimistic approach. Therefore,
    optimistic logging is suitable for a persistent local storage whereas pessimistic
    logging is done for encapsulations which are deployed on an infrastructure entity
    which has an unstable local storage. Checkpoint parameters The wrapper defines
    the frequency at which an encapsulation is checkpointed. The frequency of checkpoint
    is based on the execution time since the last checkpoint as well as the number
    and types of events processed by the encapsulation. A maximum time interval between
    two checkpoints is first set. It is denoted Tckpt. If where Tcurrent is the current
    local timestamp of the encapsulation and TlastCkpt is the timestamp of the last
    checkpoint performed, then the wrapper performs a checkpoint of the encapsulation.
    A checkpoint can be performed before the expiration of Tckpt based on the events
    that are processed by the encapsulation. Nckpt denotes the maximum number of events
    processed after which a checkpoint has to be performed. To this end, events are
    classified with respect to three weights w ∈ {0, 1, 2} according to how the event
    is processed by the encapsulation. An event that does not affect the state of
    the encapsulation has a weight and is therefore not taken into account in the
    calculation of Nckpt. For instance, events that are received by a stateless software
    element are assigned a weight . In this particular case, the software element
    is never checkpointed. Events that are costly in terms of resources and induce
    a long processing by the encapsulation are assigned a weight . For example, an
    event that induces a hot patching (e.g., version update) of a software element
    is assigned a weight . A checkpoint is immediately performed after the encapsulation
    has finished processing the event so as to optimise the state restoration time.
    It is not processed again during the recovery procedure. All other events are
    assigned, by default, a weight . When the total weight of the processed events
    exceeds Nckpt, that is, ∑wi ≥ Nckpt, a checkpoint of the encapsulation is performed
    by the wrapper. Algorithm 1 shows how checkpoints are triggered. Upon reception
    of an event (l.1), the wrapper saves the event according to the state saving policy
    and then delivers the event to the corresponding encapsulation ( ). If the weight
    of the event is equal to two (l.4), the wrapper requests the checkpoint of the
    encapsulation and resets the number of processed events Nevt ( ). The checkpoint
    request is processed by the encapsulation after processing evt. If the weight
    of the event is equal to one (l.7), Nevt is incremented by one (l.8). Since the
    default value of w is one, Nevt is also incremented by one if the weight of the
    event is unknown (l.7). In this way, only particular events having weights equal
    to zero or two may be defined. If the resulting Nevt after processing an event
    is greater than or equal to the maximum total weights of events processed before
    checkpoint (i.e., Nckpt), then the wrapper requests the checkpoint of the encapsulation.
    Nevt is subsequently reset ( ). Finally, if the weight of the event is zero, Nevt
    is not incremented ( ). Download : Download full-size image Algorithm 1. Frequency
    of Checkpoint based on Events Processed. Validity time (VT) A wrapper also associates
    contextual information upon saving messages. More precisely, a wrapper associates
    a validity time (vt) for each message saved as described by the state saving policy
    (see Fig. 6). The vt indicates whether a message should be taken into account
    for the state restoration procedure. The expiration of the vt implies that the
    message is no longer valid and should not be used in the computation of the target
    consistent state to restore the application. In the case of cyber-physical events
    from appliances, the vt indicates the time duration for which the event is valid
    and should be maintained in the PW. For instance, the event sent to open a connected
    door lock may have a validity time of one minute. A indicates an immediate expiration,
    that is, the event should never be taken into account for state restoration. A
    indicates that the event does not expire and should always be taken into account
    during the state restoration procedure. By default, events are assigned a . In
    this way, only events that have a temporary validity time have to be defined by
    the DevOps. 3.4. Monitoring and failure notification propagation The monitoring
    step of the failure management approach reports information on entities that have
    failed. When this happens, failure notifications are propagated to entities having
    dependencies on the failed entity so that they can move to a degraded mode. 3.4.1.
    Failure detection Monitoring is an important step of failure management because
    it gives information about the lifecycle phases of the infrastructure and applicative
    entities. More specifically, the information reported by the monitoring step allows
    the detection of failures as well as the detection of the entities that have recovered
    from a failure. The failure management approach thus relies on this information
    to notify dependent entities that a failure has occurred or that a failed entity
    has recovered. The reconfiguration and recovery actions with respect to the identified
    failure can then be planned. The monitoring step is carried out by the local failure
    managers: fog agents and wrappers. A wrapper monitors each of its encapsulations.
    A fog agent monitors the neighbouring physical/fog nodes. In order to ensure their
    monitoring roles, the wrappers and fog agents implement multiple monitoring techniques
    based on local system observation, applicative message observation, heartbeats,
    and ping-acks (Table 2). Multiple techniques are required because of the heterogeneous
    nature of the ecosystem. In order to cope with the limited capacities of the Fog
    infrastructure, a monitoring technique is chosen with respect to the overhead
    and interference induced by the technique. Thus, a monitoring technique is selected
    with the objective of having a minimum overhead on the network and avoiding interference
    with the application. Table 2. Monitoring techniques by wrappers and fog agents.
    3.4.1.1. Software element A wrapper monitors its locally encapsulated software
    element by periodically requesting to the fog node the list of processes running
    on the local node. The wrapper is thus able to determine if a software element
    has failed by inspecting this list and mapping it to the corresponding processes
    of a software element. An important property of this local monitoring technique
    is that it avoids a wrong suspicion of a software element because there are no
    uncertainties due to message delays on the network. Local monitoring also avoids
    influence on the network traffic. Finally, it avoids interfering with the execution
    of the application by interrogating software elements on a regular basis. If the
    wrapper and its encapsulated software element are located on remote fog nodes,
    local monitoring is no longer possible. In this case, the wrapper implements a
    combination of applicative message observation and ping-ack to monitor the remote
    software element. The combination of these two techniques aims at avoiding, as
    much as possible, additional network traffic due to monitoring. To this end, the
    wrapper configures two timeouts: Tperiod and Treponse. Tperiod corresponds to
    the frequency of monitoring. More specifically, it is the frequency at which the
    wrapper sends ping-ack messages to the encapsulated software element. At each
    expiration of the timeout, a ping request is sent to the software element. Tresponse
    is the maximum duration the wrapper waits for a response from the encapsulated
    software element before suspecting its failure. 3.4.1.2. Appliance The monitoring
    technique preferred for appliances is applicative message observation because
    it limits the influence on the network traffic. No additional messages for monitoring
    the appliance are emitted by the wrapper. However, this technique can only be
    chosen if the appliance communicates at regular interval (e.g., a light intensity
    sensor that reports values every five seconds). To do so, the wrapper observes
    the applicative messages reported by the appliance. The wrapper sets a timeout
    where Tmsg is the time interval at which messages are emitted by the appliance
    and tε is an additional time to account for variability in the network delay.
    The timer is reset at each message reception. If the timer expires before the
    interception of a message emitted by the appliance, the wrapper suspects the failure
    of the appliance. If the appliance does not communicate at regular interval, the
    technique based only on applicative message observation is not possible. In this
    case, the wrapper uses the same technique as the monitoring of a software element
    when it is remote to its wrapper. Some appliances have constrained functionalities
    and do not implement any monitoring APIs. The monitoring of such appliances, if
    they do not communicate at regular interval, is complicated since they can not
    be monitored using ping-acks or heartbeats mechanisms. In this case, the wrapper
    has to rely on external tools (e.g., wireshark and Zniffer) to observe the data
    packet exchanged on the network link for monitoring purposes. Such data packets
    are exchanged regularly between appliances connected on the same network even
    when there are no applicative messages exchanged. The timeout to suspect the failure
    of the appliance is then based on the frequency of the control packets exchanged
    on the network link. When such packets are no longer observed from an appliance,
    the wrapper suspects a failure. 3.4.1.3. Physical/Fog node The fog agents monitor
    their neighbouring physical nodes. Since the lifecycle of a fog node is tied to
    that of the physical node on which it is hosted, the information reported about
    physical nodes is also valid for fog nodes. For this purpose, the fog agents implement
    a heartbeat mechanism to monitor each other. Each fog agent receives and sends
    heartbeats towards their neighbouring fog agents. A fog agent associates two timeouts
    to each neighbouring fog node Thbe and Thbr. The timeout Thbe is used to send
    heartbeat messages to the neighbouring fog agent at a given frequency so as to
    indicate to the neighbouring fog agent that the local physical node is failure-free.
    Thbr is used to monitor the neighbouring physical node by analysing the reception
    of heartbeat messages. The value of the timeouts are configured according to the
    network delays between the two physical nodes on which the fog agents are hosted.
    If Thbr expires before the reception of a heartbeat message, the fog agent suspects
    the failure of the neighbouring fog/physical node. When the fog agent or wrapper
    suspects the failure of an entity, it adds the entity to its local list of failed
    encapsulations. It then pushes a failure notification to the GDM. Then, if the
    failure is confirmed by the GDM, failure notifications should be propagated to
    the entities that have dependencies on the failed entity so that they can move
    to a degraded mode. It is worth noting that in this paper we sometimes refer to
    failures as failure suspicions. The GDM may confirm a failure suspicion which
    is actually not a failure. This false positive may be due to a transient failure.
    In such a case, the device will be added to the pool of available devices, and
    integrated again to the running application if no equivalent replacement has been
    found. 3.4.2. Failure notification propagation The propagation of failure notifications
    aims at notifying the failure to the part of the application impacted by that
    failure. The impacted entities are those that have a mandatory dependency on the
    failed entity, as well as, recursively, the entities that have a mandatory dependency
    on the impacted entities. All the entities impacted by a failure should move to
    a degraded mode. The degraded mode of an encapsulation is implemented by its wrapper.
    It can take different forms depending on the type of dependency on the failed
    entity such as restricting access to the APIs of the encapsulation, discarding
    incoming/outgoing operations or transferring them to another failure-free entity,
    and pausing the behaviour of the encapsulation in the case of a mandatory dependency.
    In a degraded mode, an encapsulation provides only part or none of its services.
    Thus, failure notification avoids making dependent entities unresponsive, generating
    the re-emission of events that cannot be delivered because of the failure, and
    creating a cascading failure where the whole application fails [24]. Failure notifications
    are propagated as illustrated in Fig. 7. The failure notification received by
    a wrapper wrp1 can come from another wrapper wrp2 (i.e., if one of its encapsulations
    has failed or one of its encapsulations is affected by a failure) or from the
    GDM in the case of a physical node failure (i.e., because in this case, the wrapper
    also has failed). Therefore, when a wrapper receives a failure notification that
    impacts one of its encapsulations, it behaves as follows: • If there are no other
    entities that are dependent on the impacted encapsulation, then the failure notification
    is not further propagated. This is because the failed encapsulation does not impact
    other failure-free entities. The wrapper intercepts and buffers all the forthcoming
    incoming events to the failed encapsulation. • If the impacted encapsulation has
    dependent neighbours, a failure notification is sent to each one of them (i.e.,
    to their wrappers). This is done for both mandatory and optional dependencies.
    The wrapper of the failed encapsulation intercepts and buffers all the forthcoming
    incoming events to the failed encapsulation. These events are used during the
    recovery procedure. For instance, in the case of a failed software element, the
    events can be delivered after the software element has been restarted. In the
    case of a failed appliance, these events can be forwarded to a replacement appliance.
    This is discussed in more details in Section 3.5. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Reception of failure notification from GDM or wrapper of failed
    encapsulation. 3.5. Recovery The recovery procedure repairs the failed entity
    and restores the state of the application. As soon as an entity has failed ①,
    the GDM plans the recovery actions to implement as illustrated in Fig. 8. Failure
    notifications ② are first sent to dependent applicative entities as discussed
    in the previous section. The recovery procedure relies on two main steps: (i)
    Architectural Reconfiguration where the architecture of the application is rebuilt
    ⑤, and, (ii) State Restoration where a CP-consistent state of the application
    is restored ⑥. CP-consistency aims at restoring a consistent state of the application
    with respect to the PW so that dangerous and costly situations are avoided. To
    reestablish consistency, we reuse the state saved by state saving mechanisms,
    we reset the failed entity with that state, and we finally start the application
    from the same state where it was before failure. In the worst case (e.g., failed
    applicance that cannot be replaced), the application keeps working in degraded
    mode. Note that the mechanisms implemented during these two steps depend on the
    type of entity that has failed. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Global
    decision manager recovery workflow. 3.5.1. Architectural reconfiguration Architectural
    reconfiguration ⑤ involves the rebuilding of the applicative architecture. In
    the case of a software element failure, architectural reconfiguration may be as
    simple as a restart of the software element by the wrapper. Architectural reconfiguration
    is more complex in the case of a fog node failure. In this case, the ALM determines
    a failure-free fog node to host the set of failed software elements. When an appliance
    fails, it is replaced by another functionally equivalent one that meets the geographical
    constraints of the failed one. An appliance apl1 is said to be functionally equivalent
    to another appliance apl2 if apl1 can provide at least a subset of the functionalities
    of apl2. This functionally equivalent appliance is given by Thing’in ③ and can
    be a temporary or a permanent replacement according to the set of services provided
    by the replacement compared to the failed one. If no replacement appliance is
    found, architectural reconfiguration fails and the application has to continue
    its execution with less features in a degraded mode ④. 3.5.2. State restoration
    and CP-Consistent recovery Once architectural reconfiguration is completed, the
    saved states of the failed entities are used to restore a CP-consistent state
    of the application. The state restored upon recovery is said to be CP-consistent
    if the states of the geographical spaces in the PW are not different from their
    pre-failure states, taking into account expired events and the generated events
    during the recovery procedure. Definition 15 (CP-Consistency) Let us denote gs(S)
    the state of a geographical space gs where (see Definition 4). A state restoration
    procedure is said to be CP-consistent if where gs is a geographical space in the
    PW; gs(Srec) is the state of gs after recovery; gs(Spf) is the pre-failure state
    of gs; is the expired state of gs which is composed of a set couples (evti, vti)
    where the values of vti have expired, and gs(Safbr) is a set of couples (evtj,
    vtj) representing the set of events that occurred over gs after the failure but
    before recovery. The technique for state restoration is chosen according to the
    data saved during the state saving phase. For instance, state restoration technique
    usually involves replaying a set of saved messages after a checkpoint. However,
    during the state restoration process, the entity transits through a set of intermediary
    states before reaching the target state. When transiting through intermediary
    states, a software element can re-emit messages already delivered. In the case
    of an actuator, the device will act on the PW and therefore change its state through
    each intermediary state. This result in a violation of CP-consistency. In order
    to ensure CP-consistency, a wrapper defines a recovery policy for each of its
    encapsulations. The recovery policy (a) makes use of the EBM of the encapsulated
    appliances and validity times of operations for CP-consistent state restoration,
    (b) makes use of the EBM or DBM of software elements for state restoration and
    indicates the outgoing events that should be intercepted and discarded during
    this procedure, (c) specifies the number of restart trials (nrt) of a software
    element on the local fog node before requesting a new placement and redeployment
    (default value is set to 3), (d) defines an external administrator (extAdmin)
    where a notification is pushed when an appliance or a physical node fails (this
    is particularly useful to notify service providers or care-givers in smart homes
    for medicated people). In order to illustrate CP-consistent recovery, let us consider
    the saved state of an entity composed of a checkpoint sckpt as well as a sequence
    of transitions executed during the runtime of the entity with their associated
    validity time, . The state restoration procedure based on an EBM is illustrated
    in Fig. 9 (a). E is first processed by a filter function so that the events having
    an expired validity time are discarded and the remaining sequence of non-expired
    transitions Treplay is returned as output. The target state st is determined by
    the EBM by executing the transitions in Treplay. The entity can then be set to
    this target state avoiding intermediary states. In the case of appliances, this
    procedure maintains CP-consistency by avoiding the impacts of intermediary states
    that may make the PW unsafe. Since software elements do not interact with the
    PW, this procedure provides an optimisation of state restoration because it avoids
    the replay of the set of operations on the software element that can be computation
    intensive as well as avoid the re-emission of already delivered events. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. State restoration using BM. In the case of
    failures of software elements characterised by a DBM, the details of the state
    space are unknown. The set of events are thus replayed directly on the software
    element, after filtering expired events if they are known, as illustrated in Fig.
    9 (b). The outgoing events emitted during the state restoration are considered
    as obsolete and are not delivered again. They are intercepted by wrappers and
    discarded according to each recovery policy. 3.6. Ensuring service continuity
    The EBM of appliances aims at achieving CP-consistency, but also to preserve the
    continuity of the service provided by the replacement appliance after state restoration.
    The data available to restore the state of a replacement appliance may have been
    produced by another appliance, albeit functionally equivalent, having different
    API implementations or data formats. This is the case of appliances produced by
    different manufacturers (e.g., Awox and Philips Hue lamps). In this case, the
    target state, st, is first computed by the EBM of the failed appliance. Then,
    the corresponding equivalent state, in the EBM of the replacement appliance is
    determined according to the ontological equivalences computed by Thing’in. Once
    is determined, the set of transitions to reach this target state from an initial
    state can be computed from the EBM model of the replacement appliance and therefore
    it can be restored in the state . After state restoration, incoming events intended
    for the failed appliance can be dynamically adapted before being transferred to
    the replacement appliance. Algorithm 2 illustrates the part of the behaviour of
    the wrapper to ensure the continuation of the services of a replacement appliance.
    Download : Download full-size image Algorithm 2. Ensuring Service Continuity of
    Replacement Appliances. Several cases are identified depending on the types of
    APIs implemented by the appliances and whether they are encapsulated by the same
    wrapper ( ). If the failed and replacement appliances are encapsulated by the
    same wrapper (l.7) and implement the same APIs (l.8), then the wrapper saves the
    event according to the state saving policy and delivers the event to the replacement
    appliance ( ). The event does not have to be adapted. However, if the failed and
    replacement appliances have different API implementations (l.11), then the format
    of the events have to be adapted before sending it to the replacement appliance.
    In this case, Thing’in provides a transformation function (l.12) for adapting
    events, which gives for each event intended to the failed appliance, eapl, the
    corresponding event to actuate the replacement appliance, eadp. The adapted event
    is computed based on the EBM models of the two appliances and the ontologies defined
    in Thing’in. The wrapper then sends eadp to the replacement appliance after saving
    the event according to its policy ( ). Otherwise, if the replacement appliance
    is encapsulated by another wrapper, the event is forwarded to the wrapper that
    encapsulates the replacement appliance which also handles its state saving ( ).
    If no replacement appliance is found, then the event is discarded ( ). The application
    keeps working in a degraded mode and offers fewer features. 4. Implementation
    and evaluation of f3ARIot F3ARIoT is a framework designed for DevOps of IoT applications.
    The framework provides the following failure managers as described in the previous
    section: the SSG, the Global Decision Manager (GDM), the fog agents, and the wrappers.
    The SSG was implemented as a MongoDB database. The other failure managers were
    developed in Node.js because it is lightweight (i.e, low memory footprint) and
    its packet manager, npm, handles effectively the management of runtime dependencies.
    Moreover, the failure managers are completely portable and can run on heterogeneous
    physical nodes independently of the underlying operating system. This makes its
    integration simple in the Fog-IoT environment. Note that the Application Lifecycle
    Manager (ALM) [4] and the Object Registry (Thing’in) [23] are provided by other
    platforms at Orange Labs. This section aims at presenting the implementation of
    F3ARIoT and its evaluation on a smart home application. To this end, Section 4.1
    details how the framework is implemented and configured. Section 4.2 reports the
    experimental environment. Section 4.3 describes the results of this evaluation.
    4.1. Configuration of the F3ARIoT Each failure manager (GDM, fog agent, wrapper)
    embeds a configuration file based on a json format. The GDM is generic and independent
    of the use case application. Its configuration file indicates how it communicates
    (e.g., MQTT or Socket.IO [25]) with the other failure managers. The configuration
    file of the fog agent specifies the configuration for monitoring neighbouring
    physical nodes. For instance, it defines the frequency of emitting and receiving
    heartbeat messages to/from its neighbours. These values are adjusted by the IoT
    DevOps so that the detection of a failure of a physical node is more/less reactive
    with respect to their use case applications. The configuration file of wrappers
    defines the relevant information (e.g., state saving policy, recovery policy,
    BM) about its encapsulations. For example, the configuration file of a wrapper
    is composed of four components as illustrated in Fig. 10. Architecture defines
    the local and neighbouring architecture, that is, the entities that the wrapper
    encapsulates and the dependencies of these encapsulations. Monitoring defines
    the monitoring technique for each encapsulation. Policies defines the state saving
    policy and the recovery policy for each encapsulation. BM defines the behavioural
    model of the encapsulations. The monitoring technique as well as the policies
    for state saving and recovery are automatically assigned based on the properties
    of the encapsulations. The wrapper generates a configuration file for each encapsulation
    which details these four components. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    10. Components of configuration files of wrappers. 4.2. Experimental environment
    The target experimental environment for evaluating F3ARIoT is a smart home application
    inspired from an industrial project at Orange Labs [4]. The testbed is composed
    of infrastructure and applicative entities that can be found in real-life smart
    homes. For instance, the Connected Home Service [26], [27] by Orange includes
    the appliances involved in this testbed. The smart home use case application is
    light automation and physical intrusion detection. Fig. 11 depicts the smart home
    testbed with the location of the appliances in the home as well as the placement
    of the software elements hosted on fog nodes. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 11. Smart home Testbed. The physical nodes of the testbed are PC1, rpi1,
    rpi2, and rpi3 which are respectively a PC (x 4GB RAM, Windows 7), and three Raspberry
    Pi Model 3 Type B (64-bit, 1.2Ghz, quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, 1 GB RAM,
    16GB microSD storage, Raspbian GNU/Linux 8.0 jessie). These devices are representative
    of the physical resources and capacities that are available at the edge of the
    network and more specifically in a smart home. The appliances are as follows:
    two Philips Hue lamps, a Hue Go lamp (bedside lamp), a Hue Tap (a set of four
    connected push-release buttons), a Fibaro Multipurpose Sensor (motion, light,
    temperature and vibration sensors), an analog wired Speaker, an Awox StriimLight
    lamp (lamp with integrated speaker), a Wemo Motion Sensor, and a Fibaro Door Opener
    Sensor. The Philips Hue devices use the wireless protocol Zigbee. The Fibaro devices
    uses Z-wave protocol. Awox StriimLight and Wemo Motion are connected through Wi-Fi.
    The application consists of four fog nodes fgn1, fgn2, fgn3 and fgn4 which are
    hosted on the physical nodes. The software elements running on these fog nodes
    are: • MQTT Broker: a Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) based on a publish-subscribe
    communication pattern. It is an implementation of a MQTT broker based on Mosquitto
    [28]. • Orchestrator: it subscribes to all the events published on the MQTT Broker.
    It defines the corresponding scenarios and user stories (set of actions) that
    should be triggered based on the patterns of events reported by sensors. It sends
    messages to other software elements according to the scenarios defined. • NodeHueSense:
    it retrieves the button events from the Hue Tap Buttons device and publishes them
    onto the MQTT Broker. The event published contains the pressed button number and
    the local time it was pressed. • FibaroAdapter: it retrieves events sensed by
    the Fibaro Multipurpose Sensor and Door Opener Sensor and publishes them on the
    MQTT Broker. It also configures the frequency of reported events from the devices.
    For instance, an event is sent each time the door is opened and closed. • WemotionSense:
    it reports motion events sensed by the Wemo Motion device and published them onto
    the MQTT Broker. A motion event is sent when motion is sensed and when the motion
    subsequently stops. • NodeHueActuate: it accepts messages for the control of the
    Hue lamps (e.g., turning on/off, changing colour/intensity). The lamps are controlled
    via the REST API they expose. • AwoxActuate: it accepts messages for the control
    of the Awox StriimLight lamp and its integrated speaker. The lamp is controlled
    via its SOAP API. • SoundPlayer: it accepts messages for the actuation of the
    Speaker. It is based on the open-source audio player mpg123. The application was
    developed in Node.js and Go as they consume low resources. They are therefore
    suitable for running on Raspberry Pis. A set of user stories corresponding to
    this use case are identified. These user stories are defined at the software element
    Orchestrator which recognises patterns of events and triggers the corresponding
    events for actuation of the IoT devices. A set of user stories was chosen so as
    to illustrate the different types of state restoration and recovery that F3ARIoT
    implements. For instance, the first user story is based on indoor light automation
    where the Hue Tap buttons are used to control the Hue lamps. The Hue Tap device
    is composed of four buttons to turn on/off the lamps with different intensities.
    This is useful because it allows the software elements and the lamps to move to
    different states. This allows the design of experiments that can be repeated which
    involves the same software elements and appliances but with different states to
    be restored for each experiment. In this way, any bias can be eliminated when
    evaluating consistent state restoration since the experiment involving the same
    entities is repeated with different inputs and outputs. In order to carry out
    the evaluation of F3ARIoT on this smart home application, a fog agent was deployed
    on each fog node of the application. Eight wrappers were deployed. Each wrapper
    encapsulates a software element and the neighbouring appliances. Table 3 summarises
    the wrappers and their encapsulated software element and appliances. For instance
    the wrapper wrp1 encapsulates the software element NodeHueActuate as well as both
    the Hue lamps and the Hue Go lamp. Each wrapper embeds a DBM of its encapsulated
    software element and an EBM of its encapsulated appliances. Table 3. Wrappers

    Performance evaluation This section presents a performance evaluation of the recovery
    process performed by F3ARIoT. More specifically, it aims at showing that the time
    taken for F3ARIoT to implement PW-consistent recovery is performed within an acceptable
    time with respect to end users. To do so, we developed a Random Failure Injector
    (RFI) which randomly injects failures on the application at a specified frequency.
    A Measurement Logger (ML) tool was also developed for logging information during
    the experiments. The first experimental campaign aims at evaluating F3ARIoT for
    single software element failure at a given frequency. The RFI is thus set to provoke
    one random failure every five seconds. The experiment is stopped after provoking
    five thousand failures on each software element. The state restoration procedure
    of the software element consists in replaying events before loading a checkpoint.
    The mean time to recover a failed software element is given by the ML tool and
    computed as follows, where Trestart is the mean time taken to restart the software
    element and Trestore is the mean time taken to retrieve the data and restore its
    state. Fig. 12 illustrates the average values of Trestart of the software elements
    where se1, se2, se3, se4, se5, se6, and se7 are respectively AwoxActuate, WemotionSense,
    FibaroSense, NodeHueActuate, NodeHueSense, SpeakerActuate, and Orchestrator. It
    shows that the time taken for a software element to be functional varies, but
    takes less than one second. The heterogeneous restart times are mainly due to
    the implementation and the runtime dependencies of the software elements. The
    figure also illustrates the corresponding mean time taken for state restoration
    of each software element. It shows that the percentage overhead introduced by
    F3ARIoT for state restoration is almost negligible compared to the time for the
    software element itself to restart. Thus, the time for recovery is mostly dependent
    on the nature of the software element rather than the mechanisms implemented by
    F3ARIoT. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Time to recover software
    elements failures. Complementarily to these data, we have also collected minimum
    and maximum times during our experiments. The software element which restarted
    and was functional with a minimum delay is se1 (422ms). The software element with
    the observed maximum time to restart is se7 (1141ms). The minimum times to restore
    the state of the software elements range from 15ms (for se2) to 23ms (for se6).
    The observed maximum times to restore range from 118ms (for se2) to 271ms (for
    se6). These ranges of values are mainly due to the instability of wireless networks
    involved in such environments. Note, however, that the time for state restoration
    may be higher if there is a costly processing following the replay of an event.
    This is why the frequency of checkpoints defined at a wrapper should not only
    be based on the number of processed events or execution time, but also on the
    weights of events such that a checkpoint can be performed after an event that
    causes a costly processing. The optimal frequency of checkpoint is a subject of
    future work. In a second experimental campaign, the frequency of RFI is modified
    such that the number of failures in the five-second intervals is increased up
    to five failures. The aim is to analyse the performance of F3ARIoT under stress.
    The time to restore the state of individual software elements is computed each
    time and is depicted in Fig. 13. The horizontal axis defines the number of failures
    of software elements in a five-second interval. The vertical axis describes the
    average time taken to restore the state of each software element. In the case
    of two failures in the five-second interval, the average time to restore the state
    of each software element is less than 100ms. In the case of five failures, the
    average time to restore the state of each software element is less than 120ms.
    It shows a slight increase in the state restoration overhead as the number of
    failures increases which remains, however, rather below the restart time of the
    software elements which can be up to 900ms as illustrated in Fig. 12. This increase
    accounts for the repeated solicitation of the stable storage within small time
    intervals. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Time to restore state
    of software elements for multiple failures. The objective of the experiments targeting
    appliances is to measure the time taken for restoring a CP-consistent state of
    appliances by using their EBM models. The time to restore consists of the time
    for the wrapper of the appliance to retrieve the state data, feed the set of events
    into its EBM, restore the resulting target state of the appliance and receive
    an acknowledgement from the appliance. The experiment is repeated one thousand
    times for each appliance at five seconds interval. Fig. 14 depicts the time to
    restore the state of appliances appl1, appl2, appl3, appl4 and appl5 which are
    respectively Awox StriimLight, Speaker, livingroom Hue lamp, bedroom Hue Go and
    bedroom Hue lamps. The time taken to restore a CP-consistent state of the appliance
    remains close to 100ms for the Awox StriimLight and is less than 150ms for the
    Speaker. In the case of the Hue lamps, the state restoration time is always below
    200ms. The time for state restoration of appliances are expectedly higher than
    those of software elements because the appliance and the wrapper are, unlike software
    elements, delocalised and connected over a wireless network. Thus, a higher time
    to restore the state of appliances is due to network communication. The time for
    restoring a CP-consistent state is always below 200ms and is therefore acceptable
    from a user point of view in a smart home. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 14. Time to restore state of appliances. The performance evaluation presented
    in this section aimed at evaluating whether the recovery procedure is done in
    an acceptable delay with respect to end users. According to [29], [30], one second
    is the limit in response time for the user’s flow to stay uninterrupted. Moreover,
    [30] estimates that in case of failures, recovery should be done in less than
    15 seconds to avoid annoyance and disruption of the user. The performance evaluation
    showed that the overhead for state restoration is negligible compared to the restart
    time of software elements. The time to recover, including the time for state restoration,
    does not exceed one second. The time for restoring a CP-consistent state of appliances
    is achieved in less than 200ms. To sum up, these results are satisfactory and
    show that recovery is done within short delays, even in the case of high frequency
    of failures, that is completely acceptable from an end user point of view. 5.
    Related work This section focuses on recent failure management solutions for the
    fog and IoT applications. Rivulet [31] is a fault-tolerant distributed platform
    for running smart home applications. It focuses on delivery of events and tolerates
    failures such as link losses, network partitions, and sensor failures. It relies
    on a model where software elements are executed on heterogeneous smart consumer
    devices within the home. Delivery of data is ensured by a delivery service with
    two types of guarantees: a best-effort guarantee for delivery of sensor events
    where a few values can be missed and a stronger delivery guarantee that ensures
    delivery despite failures for cases that cannot afford to miss delivery of events
    because it would be undesirable and potentially catastrophic. The latter comes
    with a more costly bandwidth and battery life. Rivulet is focused on delivery
    of events and targets stateless smart home applications. It does not provide any
    mechanisms for restoring the state of the application upon recovery. Thus, cyber-physical
    consistency is not taken into account. The authors in [32] discuss the different
    building blocks to provide resilient services for IoT applications in the Fog
    for smart city applications. They propose that IoT devices should be connected
    to redundant fog nodes so as to survive fog node failures. They suggest that better
    fault tolerance can be achieved if the communication coverage of fog nodes overlap
    across multiple IoT distribution areas and fog nodes should monitor each other
    based on proximity for faster failure recovery. The authors also identify the
    need for maintaining state data of stateful fog services in smart city applications.
    The discussed solution to tackle failures in this context is based on replication
    of stateful fog services such that the replicas of a fog service are updated with
    each service invocation and each change in state data so that a replica can replace
    a failed service. Replication of services in a Fog-IoT environment, however, is
    not always feasible because a service can be tied to the IoT device and thus cannot
    be replicated without replicating the device too. Replication of stateful IoT
    devices is also not realistic or sometimes even infeasible. For instance, updating
    the state of the replica of actuators violates consistency with respect to the
    PW since actions would be performed multiple times in the PW. Geographical constraints
    may prevent the use of replication: some IoT devices such as smart window blinds
    can only operate in a unique space and thus cannot support physical replicas.
    Replication, when possible, may also be too costly. Gia et al. [33] proposes an
    architecture for supporting network fault tolerance for the healthcare environment.
    It is based on the wireless protocol 6LoWPAN for an energy efficient communication
    infrastructure. The architecture consists of a customised star-based 6LoWPAN sensor
    nodes, which retrieve patients bio-signals, connected to a gateway composed of
    multiple sink nodes with backup routing and access to the internet. In order to
    provide fault tolerance, the inactivity of a sensor node over a predefined period
    of time triggers a discovery protocol which initiates actions to determine if
    a failure has occurred. The protocol begins by requesting the status of the sensor
    node. If the latter fails to reply, a warning message is broadcasted through another
    sink node to eliminate the possibility of a faulty sink node. The set of sensor
    nodes reacts to the warning message such that the failure can be identified. The
    use of backup routing between sink nodes allow one to maintain connectivity in
    case of failing connections and prevent traffic bottleneck due to high receiving
    data rate. The proposed architecture also implements a notification mechanism
    for caregivers/doctors. This approach makes use of star-based architecture as
    well as customised hardware. This type of approach is use case specific and cannot
    be extended to more generic IoT domain applications. Moreover, the approach relies
    heavily on notification and intervention of care-givers/doctors to confirm and
    correct a failure. In our approach we aspire at having a complete automation of
    detection of failures and recovery. Guillet et al. [34] proposes a fault tolerance
    mechanism in smart homes dedicated to people with disabilities. In this work,
    the authors focus on fault tolerance as a safety property and provide methodologies
    for the design and control of such smart homes. To do so, a smart home is modelled
    as a hierarchy of hardware and software elements, sensors, and actuators that
    are distributed in the rooms in order to help a person with impairment to perform
    activities of daily living. The components of the smart home and their properties
    are specified by the means of a synchronous framework. Formal synthesis techniques
    are then used to create a controller designed to keep the smart home in a correct
    state taking into account dynamicity, controllability, and temporal constraints.
    Security constraints are defined to guarantee a safe behaviour and improve security
    of the smart home environment under different execution conditions. This approach
    focuses on security properties and more particularly on how to provide protection
    and adequate assistance with respect to the person’s disabilities when a failure
    occurs. These security properties are verified for different execution modes of
    the application. Our approach is different because we aim at recovering the application
    and limiting service unavailability. Our recovery procedure implements mechanisms
    that avoid unsafe situations in the PW by (i) restoring a consistent state of
    the application by taking into account the changes in the PW during the recovery
    procedure, (ii) ensuring a consistent behaviour of the application after the recovery
    procedure is implemented, thus avoiding harmful impacts on the PW. Sterbenz [35]
    discusses the challenges, modelling, and research opportunities for achieving
    resilience of IoT in the context of smart cities. The authors discuss an architecture
    based on the concept of islands and corridors of resilience. The idea is to group
    clusters of connectivity corresponding to individual smart cities containing IoT
    devices and infrastructures for mobile telephone, internet as well as cloud and
    data-centers. This grouping is done so that the clusters (or islands) can continue
    to operate when the links to the core infrastructure are disconnected. In order
    to tolerate this kind of failure, network services such as web caches, DNS servers,
    edge infrastructure as well as 4G and 5G services should be replicated within
    each island. These islands should be connected to the core network and thus to
    one another through corridors capable of surviving large-scale disasters and attacks
    by implementing multipath routing and transport as well as path optimisations.
    A similar approach is discussed in [36]. The authors propose a resilient IoT architecture
    for smart cities composed of multiple layers. A first layer of the architecture
    is composed of IoT islands which the authors define as a group of physical devices
    such as sensors and actuators deployed in the city. An IoT island sends data to
    IoT services where they are processed. For the purpose of data transmission, an
    IoT gateway provides access to multiple IoT islands and acts as a bridge to the
    upper layer of the architecture called IoT middleware. The IoT gateway is responsible
    for guaranteeing data delivery. The routing protocol for lossy networks (RPL)
    is proposed to this end because it supports dynamic networks and allow the use
    of multipath techniques which enhance resilience of data transmission. The IoT
    middleware layer handles the following functions: heterogeneity by acting as an
    interpreter between the communication protocols used in the IoT islands, routing
    of data, and discovery of devices and services in the IoT infrastructure layer.
    A resilience manager in the same layer has the role of supervision and defines
    the recovery actions that have to be applied in case of failures. These studies
    focus on very high level constructs. Albeit interesting, the proposed approaches
    are very difficult to test or implement. At this stage in the development of the
    IoT, failure management should rather focus on more practical aspects. Also, a
    unifying fault-tolerant architecture for IoT application could be an infeasible
    approach because the concepts and technologies in IoT continues to evolve rapidly.
    It imposes too many constraints in the design and development of the application.
    In addition, such an approach is not supported by legacy applications. On the
    contrary, there should be a clear decoupling between the architecture of the application
    and that of the proposed fault tolerance solution. Therefore, a failure management
    solution should adapt to the architecture and requirements of the application
    rather than vice versa. Other fault tolerance studies have been focussing on the
    reliability of data reported by devices. For instance, in [37] the authors designed
    a framework for fog devices in healthcare to ensure reliable data transmission
    between storage nodes and processing nodes through diffusion algorithms and routing
    on multiple network links. The reliable transmission mechanism recollect lost
    or inaccurate data automatically. Chakraborty et al. [38] focuses on incorrect
    data reported. The authors propose mechanisms for identifying whether a sensor
    is transmitting faulty data for example because of hardware malfunction by cutting
    its power off and analysing its voltage response. Tolerating only data faults
    and reliable transmission are not enough to provide reliable services in the Fog-IoT
    context and does not address application resiliency and CP-consistency. Xu et
    al. [39] studies fault prediction which provides the means to ensure safe operations
    of IoT applications as well as to anticipate maintenance. Su et al. [40] proposes
    replicated services for fault recovery in IoT. This approach requires multiple
    devices that have identical services. On the other hand, Zhou et al. [41] introduces
    virtual service composition in which data from multiple sensors of different modalities
    are used as fault tolerant backups for each other. Zieliski et al. [42] proposes
    fault tolerance techniques for IoT in the military domain. Fault Diagnosis is
    done at the sensor level by sending the same input to pairs of processing nodes
    and comparing their response, and at system level by distributed agents based
    on the simple network management protocol (SNMP). Cryptographic mechanisms are
    used for authentication and data transmission protection. The recovery phase involves
    the removal of the faulty node from the architecture. Other works have focused
    on reliability of the delivery of events from IoT devices. Particularly, these
    works propose mechanisms based on the communication infrastructure to provide
    alternative and simultaneous routing paths [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48],
    [49], [50]. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is also a very active research area.
    This application field usually consists in the deployment of low power sensors
    with limited transmission range for data collection and task monitoring. Various
    mechanisms have been proposed based on replication (e.g., hardware, paths), data
    aggregation, and the adaptation of the network topology in order to tolerate failures
    [51]. Even if fault-tolerant WSN has received much attention, this application
    domain exhibits a lower heterogeneity than the Fog-IoT ecosystem and has other
    characteristics (e.g., energy awareness) that should be addressed for failure
    management. Hence, the fault tolerance solution proposed in WSN does not address
    the issues inherent to Fog-IoT ecosystem. A preliminary version of the current
    paper was published in [52] and is extended here with a detailed presentation
    of the models, of the fours steps of the failure management approach, of the architecture,
    and of the safe recovery approach that maintains cyber-physical consistency. To
    summarize, our failure management approach resolves the following key challenges
    of the Fog-IoT ecosystem: • Cyber-Physical Consistency: Since the Fog-IoT ecosystem
    is cyber-physical, our failure management approach recovers the application in
    a consistent state with respect to the PW. This means that the approach takes
    into account the changes in the state of the PW upon implementing a recovery procedure.
    In this way, a recovery procedure which is safe for the PW is implemented and
    costly situations in the PW are avoided. • Disruptions: Our approach limits the
    disruptions caused by the approach itself during monitoring of the application
    and during the actions implemented for recovery. The monitoring step limits the
    interference with the execution of the application. Moreover, the recovery procedure
    implemented avoids impacting the failure-free part of the application. • Heterogeneity:
    The Fog-IoT ecosystem is highly heterogeneous. Thus our approach relies on the
    integration of multiple techniques that are suited to the properties of the infrastructure
    and applicative entities participating in the application. • Cost: The Fog-IoT
    ecosystem is limited in terms of processing, storage, and communication capabilities.
    Therefore, our failure management approach avoids techniques based on replication
    and makes use of infrastructure entities with higher capabilities for the deployment
    failure managers. 6. Conclusion This paper has presented F3ARIoT, an end-to-end
    autonomic failure management approach for IoT applications in the Fog that is
    capable of detecting failures and recovering the application in a consistent state
    with respect to the PW. The approach avoids costly and unsafe situations in the
    PW, and maintains a consistent behaviour of the application after recovery. The
    failure management approach is based on four functional steps. State saving aims
    at saving the data from which the state of the application can be resumed. The
    approach monitors both infrastructure and applicative entities for failure detection.
    When a failure is detected, failure notifications are propagated to the impacted
    parts of the application so that they can move into a degraded mode. In order
    to recover, an architectural reconfiguration is performed and the data stored
    during the state saving phase are used to restore a CP-consistent state of the
    application. Maintaining CP-consistency is important as it avoids dangerous and
    costly situations upon recovery. It is achieved by defining recovery policies
    and exploiting the behavioural models of entities during state restoration. This
    ensures that intermediary states are avoided and that the state of the physical
    world after recovery is consistent with the pre-failure state. The approach was
    implemented as a framework called F3ARIoT and was deployed on a smart home application
    based on an industrial project at Orange Labs. The results of the evaluation showed
    that the framework recovers from failures in a CP-consistent way and the recovery
    time is bounded by one second. Future work includes the description of how to
    make the global failure managers in F3ARIoT reliable. This can be based on a recursive
    design where the failure managers monitor each other and implement the recovery
    procedures. The approach can also be made pro-active by implementing predictive
    maintenance so that the occurrence of a failure and its impact may be avoided.
    Some parameters (such as validity time of events and weights of events) have to
    be manually filled in by the DevOps. These parameters could be automatically computed.
    For instance, the validity times of events could be inferred from the type of
    the event and from the frequency at which the event is sent. Finally, in order
    to keep good performances for applications that are highly geographically distributed,
    such as smart cities, the GDM should be geographically distributed. This aims
    at minimising the network latencies between the entities of the application and
    the GDM. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have
    no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
    appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. References [1] F. Bonomi,

    \ pest management methods are often reactive and have serious disadvantages such\
    \ as emerging genetic resistance and \nmight lead to poisoning of non-target species.\
    \ In the 1970s Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was developed as a result of the\
    \ \nbook Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, that criticised the reliance on poisons\
    \ and the associated risks. One of the key aspects of \nIPM is the refined knowledge\
    \ of ecology and behaviour of pest species. A tool which could further support\
    \ the knowledge on the \nspatiotemporal behaviour of pest animals, is the landscape\
    \ of fear (LOF). LOF reflects levels of anxiety a prey species perceives \nat\
    \ diverse sites within its territory and characterizes the areal variation in\
    \ scavenging cost as result of predation risk. In practice, \nLOF envisages habitat\
    \ use as a result of perceived fear, which enables to predict where traps or bait\
    \ are most expected to come \nacross and used by pest animals. We focused particularly\
    \ on the opportunities for better rodent control strategies: if pest \ncontrollers\
    \ focus on those areas where rodents perceive the smallest amount of predation\
    \ risk, rodent management could become \nmore effective. However, the same mechanism\
    \ could also be used in the future for other pest species. \nPredictive Systems\
    \ Model Simulating The Development Of Beehives And Honeybee Population (Apis \n\
    Mellifera) In Professional Apicultures \nJochen Georg Wiecha, Sascha Wörz, Heinz\
    \ Bernhardt \nTechnical University of Munich, Germany \nWorldwide, beekeepers\
    \ are fighting against the parasitism through Varroa mites infesting their colonies\
    \ and start mite \nreproduction in sealed brood combs. In order to ensure pollination\
    \ maintaining healthy honeybee colonies is crucial. Long-term \npredictions for\
    \ rearing development of a single honeybee colony can be simulated by several\
    \ software-based models with the \npurpose to investigate the effects of pesticides\
    \ on the bee colony or the general biological development of honeybees in their\
    \ \nbeehive and the surrounding environmental. \nPrevious published models do\
    \ not consider the beekeeping practice sufficiently. Ethological factors on beekeeping\
    \ measures are \nneglected. Unfortunately, an interaction between the animals\
    \ and the beekeeper cannot be studied. However, robbery of nectar \namong bee\
    \ colonies and reinvasion of the Varroa mites must be attributed to disturbed\
    \ predator-prey interaction and require the \nurgent intervention of the beekeeper.\
    \ These models also do not consider that epigenetic switches adapt to the environmental\
    \ \nconditions of honeybees. After swarming, several honeybee glands can develop\
    \ again. All this is still missing in current prediction \nmodels. \nIn this work\
    \ a new model for population development of honeybee colonies is presented. While\
    \ using published probabilities from \nscholarly literature, the model covers\
    \ beekeeping measures and involves for the first time the effects “robbery”, “invasion\
    \ of the \nVarroa mites”, “age of queens” and “effects of professional breeding”.\
    \ The apicultural system is fully determined and is the \nfundamental for the\
    \ calculations in annual frequency. \nWith the proposed model beekeepers are able\
    \ to plan their decisions with regard to a long-term apiculture system and to\
    \ observe \nthe effects of intensified breeding or beekeeping measures on the\
    \ honeybee colony. Thus, the introduced model can also be \nused for decision-making\
    \ in beekeeping. \nA Methodological Framework To Incorporate Animal Capacities\
    \ In A Structured Design Approach \nEllen Van Weeghel1,2, Bram Bos2, Peter Groot\
    \ Koerkamp1,2 \n1Wageningen University, Netherlands, The; 2Wageningen Livestock\
    \ Research, the Netherlands \nRecent design projects applying Reflexive Interactive\
    \ Design (RIO) - an interactive and structured design approach to contribute \n\
    to system innovation –, have shown that the needs of animals can be successfully\
    \ taken into account within an engineering \ndesign approach. Until now, these\
    \ RIO-projects aimed at fulfilment of animal needs with the animal as a stakeholder,\
    \ but only \noccasionally considered the animal as a contributor. \nThe designed\
    \ environment of animals can motivate them to engage in activities that are meaningful\
    \ for the animal itself and at \nthe same time let the animal contribute to system\
    \ goals, functions and sustainability aspects. Engineering design based on control\
    \ \nover nature will not satisfy, as increased levels of control over animals\
    \ will easily get in conflict with their needs. We elaborated \nan alternative\
    \ that thinks in terms of ‘providing the possibilities’ to let animals take care\
    \ of themselves, and –by doing this- \ncontribute to system goals at the same\
    \ time. \nWe present the groundwork, and an example for pigs, of a systematic\
    \ design approach that provides a methodological framework \nto incorporate animal\
    \ capacities in design: the Brief of Capacities (BoC). The BoC is a design tool\
    \ that provides an overview of \nanimal capacities of a specific animal species,\
    \ ordered into categories and provides the additional information necessary to\
    \ \n \n \n \n24 \nunderstand and deploy these capacities in design. The BoC enables\
    \ engineers to enlarge the (technical) solution space and to \nconsider the biological\
    \ domain in a structured manner as well as it is a tool to trigger the mind. \n\
    The results show that an overview of capacities can represent the biological system\
    \ in an engineering context and make biological \ninformation accessible to designers.\
    \ However, successful application of the approach and the technical BoC depends\
    \ on an \nattitude shift towards ‘providing agency’ instead of ‘taking care of’\
    \ or ‘controlling’ animals. \nIndustrialization and Agricultural Mechanization\
    \ in Africa \nLawrence Gumbe \nTechnical University of Kenya, Kenya \nThis paper\
    \ reviews and recommends on the way forward on the policies on industrialization\
    \ and agricultural mechanisation in \nAfrica. The mutual reinforcing relationship\
    \ between industry and agriculture can be harnessed so that the simultaneous \n\
    development of both sectors can form the foundation for industrialization in Africa.\
    \ \nThe mechanisation of agriculture requires the application of biochemical and\
    \ mechanical inputs from industry. These inputs \ninclude water pumps, tractors,\
    \ harvestors, crop driers, silos, computers, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides.\
    \ The output from \nagriculture can also be used in industry including: Cotton\
    \ lint for production of clothes; cotton seeds for production of cooking oil;\
    \ \nmaize seed for production of flour, cooking oil and starch; sorghum for production\
    \ of beer; meat products for production of \nsausage; milk for production of cheese\
    \ and butter; and many other products in industry. \nIt is important that a carefully\
    \ thought out policy framework be instituted so that the mutually reinforcing\
    \ relationship between \nagriculture and industry is harnessed so as to simultaneously\
    \ develop both sectors and the African economy in general. \nAssessment of the\
    \ Vegetation Parameters of Almond and Vine Plants for Designing a Compact Tractor\
    \ \nPietro Catania, Antonio Comparetti, Pierluigi Febo, Giuseppe Morello, Santo\
    \ Orlando, Mariangela Vallone \nUniversity of Palermo, Italy \nThe first step\
    \ of this study was a survey on the use of safety equipment of tractors, aimed\
    \ at identifying their critical issues causing \naccidents to the drivers of machines\
    \ during field operations. The results show that tractor overturning is the main\
    \ factor of the \naccidents and often death of the driver. Overturning is caused\
    \ by several factors and the seriousness of its consequences is \noften due to\
    \ the lack or non-use of Rolling Over Protective Structure (ROPS) or Falling Object\
    \ Protective Structures (FOPS), \ntogether with safety belts. A protective structure,\
    \ together with a regularly fastened safety belt, holds and protects the driver\
    \ from \nthe risk of crushing in case of overturning. \nFruit tree and vine farms\
    \ are the most exposed ones to the above risk. In fact, compact tractors equipped\
    \ with a roll-bar having \ntwo pillars, that can be lowered for facilitating the\
    \ passage of the machine under the tree foliage, are generally used in the above\
    \ \nfarms. Unfortunately, after being lowered, the roll-bar is not often positioned\
    \ again normally to the field plane and, therefore, its \npurpose of protecting\
    \ the driver is nullified. \nThe aim of this research is to assess the vegetation\
    \ parameters of almond and vine plants, aimed at designing a compact tractor \n\
    suitable for these orchards. The research is part of the Italian project TRACLAS,\
    \ involving the Universities of Palermo, Milan, \nBari, “Tuscia” of Viterbo and\
    \ Agricultural Research and Economics - Research Unit for Agricultural Engineering\
    \ (CREA-ING) of \nTreviglio (Bergamo). Based on the results of the surveys carried\
    \ out in a sample of almond and vine farms, it was possible to \ndefine the vegetation\
    \ parameters that will allow to design a very low and narrow tractor equipped\
    \ with a fixed ROPS and suitable \nfor these orchards. \nNew Farming Concepts\
    \ in Arable Farming  \nSustainable Sensor-based Tillage \nOle Green1,2, Frederik\
    \ Foldager1,3, Alevtina Evgrafova1, Kirkegaard-Nielsen Søren1,2, Dalgaard Tommy1,\
    \ Munkholm Lars \nJuhl1 \n1AGROINTELLI, Denmark; 2Aarhus University, Department\
    \ of Agroecology; 3Aarhus University, Department of Engineering \nSustainable\
    \ intensification provides an attractive solution to the global challenges of\
    \ the increasing world population and demand \nfor food. The primary goal of sustainable\
    \ intensification is a resource efficient agricultural sector combined with reduced\
    \ \nenvironmental impact. Intensification of agricultural production (fertilizers,\
    \ pesticides and heavy machinery) may increase soil \ndegradation and thereby\
    \ gradually decreasing the area suitable for agricultural production. \nThe implementation\
    \ of sustainable intensification in practice farming may be obtained by applying\
    \ an automation approach where \nsensors and control systems are utilized for\
    \ adjusting site-specific tillage intensity, in order to minimize the risk of\
    \ soil erosion (by \ntillage, water and wind) and compaction. \nThe concept of\
    \ site-specific tillage utilizes the ideas known for many years in precision farming.\
    \ Now, site-specific tillage intensity \ncontrol is enabled by on-board sensors,\
    \ as well as information gained before tillage, e.g. utilizing traffic registration\
    \ from an auto-\nsteering system for optimized primary tillage intensity for ploughing.\
    \ \nThe work presented demonstrates how the research and development of modern\
    \ farming equipment within soil tillage operations \ncan be achieved with benefits\
    \ in terms of yield and profit as well as reducing the environmental impact. New\
    \ farming systems \nand practices developed specifically for tackling sustainability\
    \ problems, including soil degradation, are not only theoretical and \npolitical\
    \ goals but are getting operational and profitable for farmers and the society.\
    \ \nSmaragd – development of an innovative farming system in the Netherlands \n\
    Jan Kamp, Herman Schoorlemmer \nWageningen University & Research, The Netherlands\
    \ \nSMARAGD’s ambition is to design a new agricultural concept for the cultivation\
    \ of highly-validating arable and outdoor vegetable \ncrops in which heavy large-scale\
    \ mechanization is replaced by light, autonomous, innovative technologies. The\
    \ increasing scale \n \n \n \n25 \nof Dutch arable farming goes hand in hand with\
    \ a high intensity of land use. The bigger and heavier mechanization is having\
    \ \nstrong negative side effects: about 50% of Dutch soils is suffering from declining\
    \ soil quality and biodiversity, soil compaction and \nreduced yields. The growing\
    \ interest in mixed cropping systems helps to stimulate partners in the project\
    \ to work together. \nTechnological developments offer opportunities for developing\
    \ high tech and small-scale solutions that save the soil and labor \ninputs. These\
    \ solutions will include the use of autonomous (small-scale and light vehicles\
    \ combined with sensing techniques in \na controlled traffic farming system (CTF).\
    \ \nThis research project consists of a modeling phase, to optimize the dimensions\
    \ of the CTF system (bed with and length), based \non technological options and\
    \ economic preconditions. For the optimization of weed control vision technology\
    \ combined with deep \nlearning technology helps the farmer to recognize weed\
    \ type and intensity and will be translated into a real time or task map \nbased\
    \ type of weed control. A special focal point of the project is the modeling of\
    \ harvest – field transport. In the project we are \ndeveloping a low tech (based\
    \ on current technology) and a high tech option that minimizes the soil pressure.\
    \ To be able to plow \nin a CTF system without mixed soil from the driving lanes\
    \ in to the seedbed, a special eco plow is under construction that solves \nthese\

    \ technological solutions will be discussed, as well as the future \nchallenges\
    \ we face. \nExplaining the Reflexive Interactive Design (RIO) Method using Intercropping\
    \ as an Example \nMarjolein Derks1, Peter Groot Koerkamp1, Bram Bos2 \n1WUR, Netherlands,\

    \ De Elst 1, 6708WD, Wageningen \nThe aim of this work is to present a novel method\
    \ of system innovations design, using intercropping as an example. With growing\
    \ \nworld populations, we need to find new ways to produce food in a sustainable\
    \ way. This asks for system innovations: changes in \nthe structure of the system\
    \ as we know it. Currently, breakthroughs are often prohibited by conflicting\
    \ interests: economics versus \nanimal welfare, intensification versus biodiversity,\
    \ etc. However, the nature of these conflicts may be caused by the way the \n\
    system is historically shaped, and they can possibly be overcome by allowing another\
    \ view on the system. \nRIO is a method that aims to redesign systems, based on\
    \ key functions in the system. It combines knowledge from system \nanalysis, structured\
    \ design, stakeholder management and transition management, and uses interactive\
    \ and collaborative learning \nto (re)design novel food production systems, starting\
    \ from a heterogeneous set of values and goals. It consists of three modules:\
    \ \n1) thinking, where the values and goals for the system are set together with\
    \ the relevant stakeholders; 2) designing, where the \nkey functions that the\
    \ system should perform are analyzed and used to construct a new design that meets\
    \ the goals from step \none; and 3) acting, where the new design is anchored in\
    \ a practical setting, together with the stakeholders involved. \nRIO has previously\
    \ been applied to livestock systems, and has led to novel designs like Windstreek\
    \ (broiler production) and \nRoundel (poultry production). However, it can also\
    \ be applied to arable farming systems. Intercropping, where several crops are\
    \ \nmixed to increase biodiversity and improve soil quality (without the use of\
    \ artificial fertilizers), will be used here as an example to \nshow that RIO\
    \ can really lead to novel systems that can readily be implemented in current\
    \ food production systems. \nChallenges for Future Livestock Systems  \nA Model\

    \ of the United Nations, Animal Production and Health Division, Italy \nIn this\
    \ work we developed a model to assess the environmental efficiency of pig production\
    \ systems. Based on pork demand, \nproduction performance and dietary composition,\
    \ the model predicts the global feed and land demand, nitrogen excretion and \n\
    nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for pig production systems. We considered 26 regions\
    \ around the world (based on IMAGE global \nmodelling framework). For each region,\
    \ productive characteristics and dietary compositions were defined from 1970 to\
    \ 2050 \nunder different scenarios. Scenarios were built following the storylines\
    \ of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways. Our model \noutcomes suggest that pig\
    \ production systems will play a significant role in the global agro-food system\
    \ in 2050 including protein \nsupply, land demand and N fertilization. The sustainability\
    \ of future pig production systems will strongly depend on the livestock \nproduction\
    \ performances and feed rations. The model suggests that limits for system efficiency\
    \ will be reached in some regions. \nThe replacement of part of the soybeans by\
    \ swill and industrial by-products in the feed ration of pigs is a promising solution\
    \ to \nincrease NUE as well as to reduce the land demand associated with pork\
    \ production. \nMonitoring Framework for the Assessment of the Integral Sustainability\

    \ Netherlands, The; 2Farm Technology Group, \nWageningen University & Research,\
    \ Netherlands, The \nAgricultural engineering has an important role in making\
    \ food production more sustainable. Increasingly, this means improving \non a\
    \ range of diverse parameters, ranging from ghg-emissions, land use, to animal\
    \ welfare and public health, while mitigating or \novercoming trade-offs. Quantification\
    \ of the current and expected performance on these diverse parameters is critical.\
    \ Yet, an \noverarching framework is lacking as well as shared criteria for what\
    \ could be seen as ‘sustainable’ levels. \nIn 2013 a governance network of stakeholders\
    \ in and around the Dutch livestock sector (the ‘UDV’) formulated and endorsed\
    \ 15 \nambitions for integrally sustainable animal production, making the UN SDG’s\
    \ concrete for the Dutch context. We used these 15 \nambitions as a starting point\
    \ to develop a monitoring framework, that can be used to assess different livestock\
    \ production systems \non their performance on these ambitions. After identifying\
    \ a small set of representative indicators per ambition, we defined a \nscale\
    \ per indicator based on the desired performance as expressed in the qualitative\
    \ ambition, and a minimum based on either \n \n \n \n26 \na theoretical or an\
    \ historical worst case. Indicators were normalized and averaged per ambition.\
    \ This setup not only enables a \nrelative assessment across different production\
    \ systems, but also enables to see the gap between desired state and current \n\
    state. \nThe framework will be presented, as well as its application on the largest\
    \ animal production sectors in the Netherlands, and on a \nfew chain initiatives\
    \ oriented at more sustainable production. The framework and results enable the\
    \ debate on the inherent \nnormative choices and different stakes regarding sustainability,\
    \ the identification of trade-offs and relations between \nsustainability-parameters\
    \ as well as future challenges. \nInteractive System Analysis Of Livestock Production\
    \ In The Galápagos Islands: Co-designing Through \nKnowledge-Practice Interfaces\
    \ \nDaniel Puente Rodríguez1, Bram Bos1, Peter Groot Koerkamp1,2 \n1Wageningen\
    \ Livestock Research, Netherlands, The; 2Farm Technology Group, Wageningen University\
    \ & Research, The \nNetherlands \nThe Galápagos Islands are well-known because\
    \ of their ecosystems and wildlife, however less attention has been given to the\
    \ \nlivestock production-systems that (partially) sustain local food chains. Industrialized\
    \ livestock production-systems co-exist with \nsmall-scale traditional ways of\
    \ animal husbandry. In this context, various stakeholders perceive the current\
    \ situation (e.g. invasive \nspecies, introduction of pathogens, nutrient losses)\
    \ in different and, sometimes, even contradictory ways, and have different long-\n\
    term goals. \nThere are many challenges ahead for designing livestock production\
    \ systems along socioecological sustainability lines. Here, we \nintroduce an\
    \ initiative to redesign the livestock (i.e., pigs and poultry) production systems\
    \ on the Galápagos Islands (i.e., on Santa \nCruz Island). Moreover, the analysis\
    \ is based on the concept of knowledge-practice interfaces. The design process\
    \ is organized \nthrough the reflexive interactive (re)design approach. \nThis\
    \ paper focuses on the first phase of this redesign process that we have recently\
    \ concluded, i.e., the interactive system \nanalysis. We address the experienced\
    \ problems, contradictions and shared long-term goals of stakeholders concerning\
    \ local \nlivestock production in Santa Cruz, Galápagos. Moreover, we present\
    \ specific redesigning strategies that enable change towards \nsocio-ecological\
    \ sustainability. Among these strategies we find, for instance, the restoration\
    \ of rural land. Within this strategy \nlivestock plays a key role to control\
    \ invasive species and to revalorize abandoned rural areas. Other strategies concern\
    \ manure \nmanagement, animal feed production, or the creation of a ‘semi-creole’\
    \ production-system with higher biosecurity standards and \nhigh efficient food\
    \ conversion, and similar cultural and culinary aspects of current creole production.\
    \ \nOur paper-approach is relevant to agrarian engineers because it introduces\
    \ a participatory redesigning practice formed by \ninclusive, interactive and\
    \ reflective knowledge arrangements in which different types of knowledge (both\
    \ formal and informal) and \ntypes of actors (including and beyond scientists\
    \ and policy makers) assume an active role and responsibility regarding biosystem\
    \ \nengineering in environmental management. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \n \n \n\

    \ \nInspiring Students With An Introduction To Smart Dairy Farming \nKees Lokhorst\
    \ \nVan Hall Larenstein University of Applied Science, Wageningen Livestock Research\
    \ \nDevelopment of the concept of precision livestock farming and precision agriculture\
    \ was mainly driven by research and \ndevelopment of research institutes and commercial\
    \ companies. All kind of new sensing systems and decision support systems \nwere\
    \ developed and introduced in the market. Nevertheless one of the critical points\
    \ in adoption is the integration in practical \nfarming systems. The question\
    \ arises then whether farmers are capable of understanding and integrating these\
    \ concepts in their \nfarming systems, and whether advisors are capable of understanding\
    \ the pros and cons of smart farming. Education might play \na role in this. Since\
    \ 4 years the author is involved in an organisation where the dairy farmers and\
    \ advisors of the future are \neducated. A minor on smart dairy farmer has been\
    \ developed. However, it appeared after two groups of students that there was\
    \ \nvery little study material available for students. Therefore a book ‘An Introduction\
    \ to Smart Dairy Farming’ has been written to \ninspire students and give an overview\
    \ of different aspects that have to be taken care of when they will become involved\
    \ in the \nfield of smart dairy farming. The combination of using text and visualizations\
    \ will be explained. The overview is not only interesting \nfor student, but also\
    \ for others stakeholders involved in smart farming (or precision livestock farming\
    \ and precision agriculture). \nAdoption of Precision Farming by Flemish Farmers\
    \ \nTom Van Bogaert1, Jelle Lecomte2, Ruben Janssens1, Ellen Maertens1, Jürgen\
    \ Vangeyte2, Stephanie Van Weyenberg2 \n1Department of Agriculture and Fisheries,\
    \ Brussels, Belgium; 2Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research,Merelbeke,\
    \ \nBelgium \nThe focus group of the agricultural European Innovation Partnership\
    \ (EIP-AGRI, 2015) indicated that the adoption of precision \nagricultural technologies\
    \ (PAT) in Europe is lacking behind. More recently, ABN AMRO concluded that “everybody\
    \ is doing smart \nfarming except the farmers”. Although experts seem to agree\
    \ on the limited uptake, clear recent figures are lacking, at least in \nFlanders.\
    \ \nTherefore, the objective of this study was to map the use of PAT in Flemish\
    \ agricultural businesses. In the framework of the \nFlemish year of agricultural\
    \ data, questions on the use of PAT’s were sent out to participants of the Farm\
    \ Accountancy Data \nNetwork, i.e. a representative for all Flemish agricultural\
    \ and horticultural companies. 527/655 (80%) useful replies were collected. \n\
    57% of the responding farms apply PAT’s themselves or through contractor, or will\
    \ most likely do so within a period of five years. \nIn arable farming, dairy,\
    \ pig and poultry sectors, this percentage is even higher than 66%. This mainly\
    \ concerns GPS in crop \nfarming and yield registration in livestock farming.\
    \ A management information system is often lacking. Half of non-users thinks \n\
    their farm is too small to invest in PAT. Drivers to adopt PAT’s are clear costs/benefits,\
    \ a substantial price reduction and positive \nexperiences from fellow farmers.\
    \ More accurate daily management and improved insights into technical results\
    \ are mentioned \nas the most important benefits. \nConcluding, today the use\
    \ of PAT’s is often limited to rather simple technologies like GPS. Yet, a fast\
    \ majority of farmers shows \ngreat interest. The next step, using the generated\
    \ data for data-driven management decisions is yet to be taken. \nConnectivity\
    \ of Agricultural Equipment and Applications - Strategical Approaches and Technical\
    \ \nStandards \nMatthias Rothmund \nOSB AG, Germany \nConnectivity plays an emerging\
    \ role in farming systems. It includes m2m, m2b and b2b communication in which\
    \ business \napplications like farm management tools and also on-machinery applications\
    \ are increasingly cloud-based. \nConnectivity in a habitat of cross-brand machinery\
    \ fleets and a heterogeneous tool landscape is challenging. After having solved\
    \ \nthis problem for wire-based machinery communication by defining the ISOBUS,\
    \ we are now facing the challenge to let data flow \nbetween machines in the fields\
    \ and all kinds of applications. The goal is to allow farmers to freely decide\
    \ for equipment and \napplications based on their functionality and quality and\
    \ not based on their brand while being able to easily connect everything. \nOne\
    \ product approach for connectivity is to create an intra-brand habitat like some\
    \ of the big Ag machinery manufacturers do. \nSome other players are invited to\
    \ connect their applications, but there is no discrimination-free access guaranteed.\
    \ Farmers can \nonly use this connectivity platform with equipment of this brand.\
    \ \nAnother approach is to create a platform for applications like some of the\
    \ farm software companies do. Thus, different machinery \nbrands can be connected\
    \ using third-party communication devices or data-exchange standards. But on such\
    \ a platform, only a \nlimited number of applications can be used respectively\
    \ there is no discrimination-free access for all software companies to \nconnect.\
    \ \nThe method to exchange data between different habitats is to create standards\
    \ like it is done for instance by AEF with the \n“Extended-FMIS-Data-Exchange”\
    \ standard (EFDI). But this still works with many point to point connections and\
    \ requires a lot of \ntest efforts. \nA third approach is to create a brand independent\
    \ connectivity entity like for instance the DKE “Agrirouter”. This allows a non-\n\
    discriminating access for all machines and applications but at the same time requires\
    \ only one single technical interface which \nhas to be tested. \n \n \n \n29\
    \ \nThe Analysis Of Tweets In French Agriculture Using OLAP Systems \nSandro Bimonte1,\
    \ Omar Boussaid2, Jean-pierre Chanet1 \n1irstea, France; 2ERIC, University Lyon2\
    \ \nLast years some new technologies, such as blogs, wikis, RSS, social networks,\
    \ etc., appear for sharing dynamic and personalized \ninformation content by means\
    \ of the Web, enabling the knowledge production. This information can be used\
    \ for several purposes, \nsuch as to understand consumers and their preference,\
    \ health, etc. In the case of Twitter, users can post short-status messages \n\
    with up to 140 characters and may include photo attachments, which are called\
    \ “tweets”. According to Twitter, about 271 million \nmonthly active users are\
    \ generating an average of 500 million tweets per day. Twitter is more and more\
    \ used in each application \ndomain, and recently also in agriculture. However,\
    \ to the best of our knowledge, there is not a study that investigates the usage\
    \ \nof twitter in the context of agriculture. Therefore, in this paper we propose\
    \ an OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) system to \nanalyze tweets to answer\
    \ to the following question: “Who and why people in French use twitter for sharing\
    \ knowledge about \nsustainable agriculture?”. \nAnswering such a question is\
    \ like collecting tweets, putting them in a form that can be manipulated by the\
    \ machine, and finally \nexploring them to build such information. But collecting\
    \ and preprocessing data from tweets present a real scientific lock. These \n\
    are of textual type, the techniques to be used for their preparation must be adapted\
    \ to their complex nature. Analyzing the content \nof social data from tweets\
    \ requires approaches that combine different techniques from data mining, information\
    \ retrieval and \nmore. We used the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) method to\
    \ extract topics related to agriculture. We have completed this study \nby OLAP\
    \ analysis illustrating the various actors who use Twitter to exchange their information\
    \ on agriculture. For this, we use \n1,825,958 tweets . Analysis shows interesting\
    \ results concerning the agricultural actors that really use twitter and their\
    \ reasons. \nInternet of Farming \nInternet of Things Experiments in IoF2020 Dairy\
    \ Trial \nKees Lokhorst1, Ivan Andonovic2, Patrick Honcoop3 \n1Wageningen Livestock\
    \ Research; 2University of Strathclyde; 3365Farmnet \nThe H2020 - IoF2020 project\
    \ for a large scale pilot for Internet of Things started in 2017. The ambitions\
    \ of the dairy trial, the way \nthat they will learn from each other and their\
    \ contribution to the fine tuning of technical IoT challenges, the measurement\
    \ and \nmonitoring of the business oriented KPI’s and the use of feedback by the\
    \ involvement of end-users and co-creators will be \nexplained in this paper.\
    \ The dairy trial aims to implement, experience and demonstrate the use of real-time\
    \ sensor data from \n‘grass to glass’ to create value in the dairy chain. The\
    \ trial will demonstrate, test and deploy IoT solutions for four user cases \n\
    (Grazing Cow Monitor, Happy Cow, Silent Herdsman, Remote Milk Quality) that address\
    \ different aspects of dairy farming and \nmilk processing. The platform 365Farmnet\
    \ will be used in all use cases to ensure seamless exchange of IoT data and services.\
    \ \nThe basic idea is that feeding individual cows and taking care of her individual\
    \ needs can save up to 15% compared to feeding \ncows as a group. The neck collar\
    \ sensors, together with the GPS location information, will deliver new insights\
    \ and proxies for \nfeed intake of grass and roughage. The same sensors will be\
    \ used to improve oestrus detection, which will contribute to a longer \nlife\
    \ span of the cows. The feed information and cow behaviours will be used at the\
    \ same time for early warning on animal health \nand welfare. Early warning will\
    \ focus on feed related warnings like ketosis, but also on the issue of lameness\
    \ and mastitis \ndetection. Milk quality can be measured in different places in\
    \ the production chain. This quality data will be used for a new concept \nof\
    \ remote calibration and validation of sensors. \nInternet of Food and Farms:\
    \ Dairy Use Case 2.3 \nCraig Michie, Christos Tachtatziz, Ivan Andonovic, Andrew\
    \ Hamilton, Chris Davison \nUniversity of Strathclyde, United Kingdom \nThe use\
    \ of Internet of Things based technology to optimise the operational performance\
    \ of farming practice is fast developing. In \nthe present use case we are demonstrating\
    \ the performance of SilentHerdsman accelerometer collar that measures neck motion\
    \ \non an animal and translates this into behavioural features that can assist\
    \ in daily farm management functions. The initial objectives \nwere to optimise\
    \ herd fertility by alerting farm operatives to the onset of oestrus in cattle.\
    \ This enables timely insemination so that \nherd productivity can be maximised.\
    \ In addition to the above, the collar provides an indication of feeding and rumination\
    \ time \nbudgets which give an insight into animal welfare. The performance of\
    \ the collar as a heat detection system is established and, \nonce the system\
    \ parameters are adjusted to suit the on farm conditions, farm operatives report\
    \ a strong reliance on the system \noutputs. Presently we are exploring the interaction\
    \ between the feeding and rumination signatures and other on farm \nmeasurement\
    \ available through, for example, milking robots and other sensors accessed remotely\
    \ in order to identify the early \nonset of illness in a robust manner. Integration\
    \ of multiple sensor streams offers the potential to calibrate systems against\
    \ each \nother thus reducing instances of false positives. \nDetermining Valuable\

    \ cases, organized \ninto five different trials, including Pig Farm Management.\
    \ One of the aims of this use case is to create early warning systems for \npossible\
    \ health and production problems in individual fattening pigs. A pilot study to\
    \ test the technical performance of several \ndifferent sensor systems was recently\
    \ concluded. Data from 119 fattening pigs (60 boars and 59 gilts) were collected.\
    \ The barn \nwas divided into 8 pens, with 14-15 pigs of the same sex (either\
    \ gilts or boars) per pen. The pigs were checked for health problems \ndaily by\
    \ caretakers and twice a week by a trained observer. Each pen was fitted with\
    \ a flow meter and a HF RFID-antenna near \nthe drinking nipple. A conventional\
    \ round feeder, mounted with a HF RFID-antenna was used in 4 of the pens. In the\
    \ other 4 \n \n \n \n30 \npens, a Nedap feeding station with weighing scale was\
    \ used. All pigs had 2 high-frequency (HF) RFID tags, one in each ear. An \nextra\
    \ low-frequency RFID tag was added to the right ear for the pigs in the feeding\
    \ station pens. With these systems, data on \nfeeding and drinking patterns, water\
    \ consumption and, in half of the pens, feed consumption and body weight was collected\
    \ on \nan individual pig basis. Several individual cases that died or with other\
    \ types of health problems, such as lameness and illness, \nwill be analysed to\
    \ determine whether the health status of the pig was reflected in the data and\
    \ if so, which variables are most \npromising to detect specific health problems.\
    \ These results will be presented at the conference. \nMeat Transparency and Traceability\
    \ in the IoF2020 Project with EPCIS \nAyalew Kassahun1, Georg Schwering2, Nicolas\
    \ Becker2, Sabine Kläser3, Tim Bartram3, Ioannis Athanasiadis1 \n1Wageningen University,\
    \ The Netherlands; 2EECC, Germany; 3GS1 Germany, Germany \nWe present the information\
    \ model we developed for improving transparency and traceability in pig and pork\
    \ supply chains. Our \ninformation model is developed on top of the standard EPCIS\
    \ traceability data model and aims to enable the capturing and \nsharing of information\
    \ related to meat quality, animal welfare, and provenance of meat products. The\
    \ focus of this work is on the \nupstream side of the supply chains, i.e. at farms\
    \ and slaughterhouses. The information model is, however, easily extendable to\
    \ \nthe downstream side of the supply chains so that the sharing of such information\
    \ is possible across entire supply chains. By \nemploying the widely adopted EPCIS\
    \ standard we are able to use EPCIS-compliant software solutions that provide\
    \ diverse \ninformation extraction and processing facilities. In addition, EPCIS-compliance\
    \ guaranties that the software solutions provide \nstandard interfaces for integration\
    \ with existing farm and supply chain systems, including farm management, logistics\
    \ and retailer \nsystems, and eventually with consumer applications. Our engagement\
    \ with stakeholders demonstrates that, while customers at \neach stage of the\
    \ meat supply chain increasingly demand information regarding origin, animal welfare\
    \ and details about meat \nprocessing conditions, the main driving force for transparency\
    \ seems to be the suppliers’ objective in creating more value for their \nproducts\
    \ through brand labels that are supported by trustworthy quality assurance schemes.\
    \ In this respect, the solution we \ndevelop enables the producers of primary\
    \ products, including farmers, to share information downstream the supply chain\
    \ and \nbuild trust with their end-customers. Such an approach to transparency\
    \ contributes towards improving consumer confidence in \nfood products, and eventually,\
    \ the European food market. In this respect, we aim to support the efforts of\
    \ EU in realizing full \ntraceability from farm to fork in diverse agrifood sectors\
    \ by collaborating with other pilot studies within the IoF2020 project. \nThe\

    \ data ranges from soil, weather, water, seed, \nfertilizers, and pests etc. which\
    \ generate volumes of data every day. Agriculture is a vital industry in China,\
    \ employing over 300 \nmillion farmers. Despite rapid development of China’s agriculture,\
    \ it still faces several challenges from expanding population, low \nproductivity,\
    \ decreased arable land, and increasing labor cost etc. The only way to revolutionize\
    \ China’s agriculture pattern and \ncurrent challenges it faces should be from\
    \ technology innovation, especially digital technologies.Big data and the Internet\
    \ of \nThings (IoT) platforms will be the key enabler to revolutionize China’s\
    \ agriculture. Firstly, various sensors, smart phones, drones \nand other IoT\
    \ devices allow an ability to collect, manage and store an enormous amounts of\

    \ the crop growth, \nconnecting systems so as to allow an integrated, multidimensional\
    \ view of farming activities, data sharing and enabling deeper \nunderstanding\
    \ on how the whole ecosystem works. This intensive use of ICT (Information and\
    \ communications technology) \ninvolves a large number of sensors, control loops,\
    \ models and optimization techniques, forecast, vegetable production, energy \n\
    costs, etc. In this ecosystem situation, 'fog computing' based control systems\
    \ arise as a solution to improve system efficiency by \nreducing the amount of\
    \ data transported to the cloud for processing, analysis, and storage. We focus\
    \ on a model-based \ngreenhouse control system using hierarchical architecture.\
    \ Common fog computing applications include smart grid, smart city,… \nIn our\
    \ control algorithm structure, the first layer (upper layer, the timescale of\
    \ weeks/months) takes into account the long-term \nobjectives and data obtained\
    \ and long-term predictions of the growth using a growth model (production estimation)\
    \ and energy \nconsumption models. The IoT (Internet of Things) supervisor receives\
    \ the data necessary for decision-making from the local units \nand other agents\
    \ (mainly public agencies) like weather forecast, market price fluctuations, energy\
    \ prices, etc. which help the next \nlayer, the intermediate, to optimize crop\
    \ growth, modifying the control decisions (crop conditions) of each greenhouse\
    \ to improve \ndifferent objectives: water/energy/fertiliser/efficiencies. With\
    \ this architecture, supervision and control of each greenhouse \npolygon are\
    \ carried out by the local supervisor and the data storage is established using\
    \ 'fog computing' technics. This The IoT-\nbased hierarchical crop-growth system,\
    \ which combines publically available and farmer data, is used as a multiobjective\
    \ \noptimization solution to satisfy the objectives inherent in control system\
    \ design and the data sharing/interoperability available for \nthe different users:\
    \ farmers, technical engineers, production planners and public administrations.\

    \ (IoTs) based cloud system with image processing technique for agricultural application.\
    \ \nThe proposed platform employs the Zigbee and WiFi wireless transmission protocol\
    \ for receiving multiple data which form the \ndifferent micro-electromechanical\
    \ systems (MENs) sensor module. Each sensing module receives the environmental\
    \ and image \ndata, including the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light\
    \ quantum, air pressure, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, etc. \nand send it\
    \ to the embedded platform. Besides, the camera devices capture the plant image\
    \ and store it into the platform. The \nimage processing techniques is utilized\
    \ to conduct morphological measurement, including area of leaf, number of leaf,\
    \ and color \nlevel, etc. The fuzzy inference technique has applied to find the\
    \ relationship between the growth status of plant, water quality, \nand environmental\
    \ data. The decision results provide the suggestion and information for user to\
    \ enhance the quality of plant. The \nproposed platform has been verified and\

    \ \nIoT Architecture For Digitalization Of Silage Bale Life Cycle Management \n\
    Khoa Dang, Antti Juntunen \nHäme University of Applied Sciences, Finland \nThe\
    \ research is conducted as part of Digibale project, which studies and conducts\
    \ trial to evaluate the effect and benefit of \ndigitalization for silage bale\
    \ production and post-harvest management. By introducing sensors, RFID technology\
    \ and digitalized \nservices into silage bale farming and logistics, farmers would\
    \ gain significant benefits and information, namely bale quality and \nhistory,\
    \ thereby enhancing their customer’s trust and increase the value of their products.\
    \ \nThe focus of this paper is the research on information system architecture\
    \ for management of silage bale life cycle, based on \ncloud infrastructure to\
    \ provide data management and access services. The project aims include identification\
    \ of silage bales \nusing passive RFID technology, with the hardware implementation\
    \ planned to be built separately or integrated to bale wrapper. \nThe data collected\
    \ contains identity of bales and additional information such as weather, GPS data\
    \ and bale measurements, \nwhich will be transferred to the cloud-based information\
    \ system. \nIn this research, the backend system is developed on cloud premises\
    \ and include essential components for data exchanging and \nprovision, such as\
    \ database; device management and information provision using web services. The\
    \ decision of developing the \nsolution system on cloud infrastructure was based\
    \ on three reasons: the abundance of cloud service providers, high availability\
    \ \nand fast trial. The research aims to establish the trivial software structure\
    \ for agricultural digitalization applications, e.g. data \nschema, data ownership,\
    \ user management and data access. User input from participating farms will be\
    \ the focus of the \ndevelopment cycle, to maximize the usefulness of the system\
    \ for farmers and their customers. Finally, the operation cost for the \ncloud-based\
    \ system could be derived and compared between different cloud service providers.\
    \ The resulted information system \narchitecture serves as a reference model,\
    \ technically and economically, allowing interested parties to develop new business\

    \ data-bases and web-service. Over 10 validated decision-support apps are \navailable\
    \ on Akkerweb to apply variable rate technologies on different crop management\
    \ activities. Most apps have been \ndeveloped for potato crop management, but\
    \ apps can also be used for management of other arable and vegetable crops, and\

    \ \nInternet-based Harvest Fleet Logistic Optimisation \nAndrés Villa-Henriksen1,2,\

    1Agro Intelligence ApS, Denmark; 2Aarhus University, Denmark \nHarvesting operations\
    \ of cereal crops in a modern farming context often involves multiple vehicles,\
    \ which can lead to inefficiencies \nand increase operational costs if they are\
    \ not used appropriate. Large distances from depot to the field, pronounced field\
    \ \ntopographies or visual barriers, e.g. hedges, can limit the operator’s decisions\
    \ on when and where an offload is taking place, and \nconsequently make the operation\
    \ less efficient. Moreover, the operation manager, who may be at the farm, does\
    \ not have a clear \noverview of where the machines are at the moment, or how\
    \ far the operation is. \nTherefore, the harvesting operation of cereal crops\
    \ is an obvious case for utilizing the potential of an internet-based harvest\
    \ fleet \nlogistic optimisation system - an application that assists the operators\
    \ and manager in the harvest for optimising the farm’s \noperations. The harvest\
    \ fleet logistic optimisation system created gives the user a live overview of\
    \ the operation and vehicles \ninvolved, it assists the operator on where and\
    \ when to offload, and optimises the path in the field to reduce the operational\
    \ time. \nThe concept system is described with focus on its architecture, its\
    \ data flow and communication technologies used. The \narchitecture is divided\
    \ in three layers: sensor layer, communication layer, and application layer. The\
    \ sensor layer consisting on a \nload cell, that measures the grain mass flow,\
    \ and a GNSS receiver. The communication layer comprising the gateway. And the\
    \ \napplication layer covering the database, the data analysis and the interfaces.\
    \ The system is based on Bluetooth communication \nbetween sensors and gateway\
    \ and 3G/4G communication between the gateway and the cloud. Android-based mobile\
    \ devices \n(tablets) act at the same time as gateways and interface. \nThe system\
    \ is manufacturer independent and allows any machine to be connected, so it supports\
    \ the interoperability that many \nfarmers are seeking today. \n \n \n \n32 \n\

    \ Research, \nWageningen University & Research, The Netherlands \nModern fruit\
    \ production is not possible without reliable and up-to-date information. Fruit\
    \ companies are getting bigger, the market \nrequires increasingly detailed information\
    \ about cultivation processes and there is a lot of data exchange required for\
    \ regulatory \nand certification purposes. These developments pose ever higher\
    \ demands on fruit growers' information management. \nThis paper investigates\
    \ how the concepts and technologies of Industry 4.0 can be applied to fruit production\
    \ to meet these \ndemands. The so-called fourth industrial revolution is changing\
    \ production processes radically towards flexible and seamlessly \nintegrated\
    \ systems based on recent technological developments in the field of the internet,\
    \ sensors and robotics, among others. \nMore specifically, the paper aims to propose\
    \ a high-level information systems architecture for data management in fruit production\
    \ \nand to analyse to what extent existing data management solutions can enable\
    \ this architecture. \nTo do so, first the requirements were defined based on\
    \ 12 interviews with growers, cooperatives, advisors and sector \nassociations,\
    \ and a validation workshop. Next, existing systems were investigated based on\
    \ desk research, 10 interviews with \nvendors and a validation workshop. A long-list\
    \ of 75 data management solutions was identified and 21 solutions were analysed\
    \ \naccording to a standardised questionnaire. \nThe resulting information architecture\
    \ for Fruit 4.0 comprises three layers: i) sensing, actuation, data exchange via\
    \ (wireless) \nnetworks and data processing in a Sensing & Control Platform; ii)\
    \ farm management and supply chain information systems; and \niii) support for\
    \ decision-making. \nThe investigation shows that especially an operational Sensing\
    \ & Control platform is currently lacking in the Dutch fruit production \ndomain.\
    \ The paper addresses three approaches to overcome this situation: \n1. Extend\
    \ existing farm management systems with a Sensing & Control layer; \n2. Adapt\
    \ platforms from adjacent sectors, especially arable farming, to fruit-specific\
    \ requirements; \n3. Implement generic IoT platforms in the fruit domain. \nSystems\
    \ of IoT systems for smart food and farming \nCor Verdouw1, Jeroen van Grondelle2,3,\

    \ \nUtrecht, The Netherlands \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to be\
    \ a real game changer in food and farming. However, an important challenge for\
    \ \nlarge-scale uptake of IoT is to deal with the huge heterogeneity of this domain.\
    \ This paper proposes a systems of systems \napproach that combines flexible customization\
    \ with efficient standardization in the design, development, implementation and\
    \ \ndeployment of IoT systems for food and farming. To do so, the research started\
    \ with the architectures of 19 European uses cases \nof the IoF2020 project from\
    \ multiple views (including domain, business process, data, and deployment diagrams).\
    \ These use \ncases reflect the diversity of the food and farming domain, including\
    \ different sub sectors (i.e. arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables and \nmeat production),\
    \ conventional and organic farming, and different supply chain roles. They follow\
    \ a demand-driven philosophy in \nwhich IoT solutions for specific business needs\
    \ are developed by end users and IoT companies, supported by R&D organisations.\
    \ \nNext, the commonalities and synergies of these use cases are analysed and\
    \ validated. Main common technologies include \nconnectivity (e.g. Lora/Sigfox),\
    \ localization (e.g. GPS, beacons), and data management (e.g. FIWARE, 365Farmnet)\
    \ solutions. \nMain logical commonalities include animal and crop features, outdoor\
    \ and indoor conditions, and soil characteristics. Most cases \nfocus on information-centric\
    \ control (47%), followed by task-oriented decision support (37%) and automated\
    \ control (16%). \nFurthermore, location (granularity) and time (continuous, discrete)\
    \ appeared to be essential dimensions for reuse. Finally, an \narchitectural approach\
    \ was developed in which autonomous IoT systems function as interoperable nodes\
    \ in a software ecosystem \nand in which users can configure customized solutions\
    \ from standardized components. Main elements are: a common reference \narchitecture\
    \ (adapted from IoT-A), catalogue of reusable system components, IoT lab that\
    \ provides a testbed environment, and \na Collaboration Space in which services\
    \ and data can be shared among IoT systems. \nPrecision Farming \nEnhanced Vineyard\

    \ 10095, Italy \nPrecision viticulture has been assumed as an essential approach\
    \ to optimise crop-managing practices and to improve the quality \nof food products.\
    \ To deploy proper site-specific management, addressing the intrinsic variability\
    \ within a vineyard or a parcel, \nreliable methods for features extraction and\
    \ mapping of crops must be developed. The introduction in agriculture of Unmanned\
    \ \nAerial Vehicle (UAV), equipped with sensors able to acquire fields planar\
    \ images at several wavelengths, makes available huge \namount of data with high-resolution,\
    \ in terms of both spatial and temporal dimension. Recently, in addition to well-known\
    \ 2D \nmosaicked images, innovative features leaded by modern photogrammetry allowed\
    \ accurate three-dimensional models of crops \n(ex. 3D point cloud datasets) to\
    \ be generated. \nThe proposed new approach is aimed at defining enhanced crop\
    \ descriptors by exploiting information provided by both 2D and \n3D crop models.\
    \ Crucial phases of the procedure are the proper management of data provided by\
    \ several sources, in order to \nachieve high consistency of the obtained huge\
    \ dataset. In addition, the detection of vine rows, discriminating them from all\
    \ the \nother elements of rural areas, plays a crucial role. The developed algorithm,\
    \ being not based on the straightness of vine rows, \ncan profitably manage models\
    \ of vineyards with curvilinear rows, also on steep terrains. Specific computing\
    \ optimisation have \nbeen defined in order to process big data. \n \n \n \n33\
    \ \nFour 3D point-cloud models and aerial images, acquired during UAV flights\
    \ over a set of parcels of a vineyard in Serralunga \nd'Alba, Italy, have been\
    \ profitably processed by the developed algorithm. The integration of 2D-3D information\
    \ allowed to obtain \ngood performance also in the presence of dense inter-row\
    \ grassing which, usually, slightly differs from vine canopies in terms of \n\
    reflectance. \nA Territorial Services Platform for the Sustainable Precision Agriculture\

    \ Ipema \nWageningen UR Livestock Research, Netherlands, The \nDairy cows may\
    \ use grassland more efficiently when allowed grazing in predefined areas with\
    \ predictable sward height and grass \nquality. Separating High- and Low yielding\
    \ (HY and LY) cows may have advantages for grassland use optimisation, by allowing\
    \ \nHY-animals to graze on a new grass strip first. In the control group 8 cHY\
    \ and 8 cLY cows were grazing on a fixed area with daily \na fresh grass strip.\
    \ In the experimental group 8 eHY- cows (matched with cHY) were also free to graze\
    \ in the same fixed area, \nbut 8 eLY cows (matched with cLY) were potentially\
    \ stopped at a virtual fence (GrazeGuide) and reduced the grazing area. \nGrazeGuide\
    \ consisted of underground wires signalling a boundary that was received in the\
    \ collar, producing a warning signal \nwhen approaching the boundary and a correction\
    \ signal when crossing it. \nWageningen Livestock Research tested the GrazeGuide\
    \ applicability on its Dairy Campus. Cows were tested in three periods of \n3\
    \ days: P1 (learning), P2 (basic) and P3 (crossover, ie experimental and control\
    \ group switched). Cows quickly learned how to \nadequately react to the signals,\
    \ and remained within the borders of the area allocated to them. High yielding-cows\
    \ (23.5 l/day) \nand Low Yielding-cows (19 l/day) continued to give their pre-experimental\
    \ milk yield in P1, P2 en P3 (all P=0.000) and no effects \nof the virtual fence\
    \ on milk yield were found. Low yielding cows with a virtual fence had a slightly\
    \ lower Locomotor activity in P1 \nand P2 (Yield* Fence interaction P = 0.028).\
    \ However, in P3 this effect is not found. \n \n \n \n34 \nThe research concluded\
    \ that GrazeGuide offers farmers the possibility to use efficient grazing routines\

    Application of Precision Viticulture for Thematic Maps Production \nPietro Catania,\

    \ Food and Forest Sciences \nThe innovative technologies of precision agriculture\
    \ offer today new solutions for the wine sector in line with the current demands\
    \ \nof the sector. Income maximization in viticulture can be achieved by reducing\
    \ management costs or by increasing the value of \nthe product, or its quality.\
    \ Viticulture in hilly areas is characterized by different composition and soil\
    \ structure, humidity, nutrients \nand microclimate within the same plot. As a\
    \ consequence, the vine responds by revealing different states of physiological\
    \ \nexpression resulting in different production per plant. The aim of this study\
    \ was the quantification of grape production per plant \nwithin a vineyard plot\
    \ with the same variety and year of planting in order to allow the realization\
    \ of thematic maps useful for vine \ngrowers in order to eliminate the critical\
    \ issues of the plot and allow them to manage the vineyard applying differentiated\
    \ cultivation \ntechniques with cost reduction and environmental protection. The\
    \ experimental tests were carried out in Tenute Rapitalà farm, \nCamporeale (Italy).\
    \ The vineyard, is trained with hedgerow system. The Catarratto lucido vineyard,\
    \ 7.70 hectares wide, exposed \nto South-East, was hedgerow trained with 4000\
    \ plants/ha and Guyot pruning. The self propelled harvester Braud 9060L was \n\
    used to mechanically harvest the grapes. The machine was equipped with a platform\
    \ able to monitor and continuously record the \nquantity of grapes harvested by\
    \ the machine. The platform was programmed to record grape weight data entering\
    \ the hoppers \nevery 10 seconds. GPS “STONEX S5\" with differential correction\
    \ and sub-centimeter precision, was used for geo-referencing. \nThe study allowed\
    \ to obtain a thematic map of the entire plot with different classes of yield.\
    \ In this way, it will be possible to \nidentify the critical aspects of the vineyard\
    \ thus increasing quantity and quality of grapes, through the application of focused\
    \ \ncultivation techniques, also reducing management costs. \nAnalysis of Vine\

    \ since the 90s of last century. However, little effort has been made in the \n\
    systematic definition of Key Performance Identifiers (KOIs) for the characterization\
    \ of the quality of mechanized tasks. Moreover, \nstandardized automated procedures\
    \ are required for the comparison of mechanized tasks irrespective machine manufacturers,\
    \ \nfield conditions, operators or many other local conditions. This study aims\
    \ at providing a KPI for the characterization of vibration \nconditions (by means\
    \ of accelerometers) as well as the quantification of grain and must losses, in\
    \ this last case by means of \nmaking visible those losses that are invisible\
    \ to the naked eye. To this end georeferenced data from 19 plots (42.3 ha) have\
    \ been \ngathered in order to characterize mechanized work performance, together\
    \ with corresponding grain and must losses. On the \nother hand, vine vibrations\
    \ have been analysed by placing 4 accelerometers (6 channels) in dedicated positions\
    \ of the vine, and \ncomputing the time and frequency response, as well as the\
    \ power spectra normalized in terms of vine productivity (kg). The \nresults indicate\
    \ that outliers found in grape losses (must and grain) can be explained in terms\
    \ of the power spectra information, \npointing to deficient regulation of the\

    National Chiayi University, Taiwan \nWater limitation not only affects industrial\
    \ production but also puts pressure on irrigation systems to produce more with\
    \ lower \nsupplies of water in Taiwan. To improve the efficiency of irrigation\
    \ in agricultural production, this study developed a sensing-\nbased platform\
    \ to simultaneously monitor the environmental factors of a greenhouse and the\
    \ growth status of Brassica \nchinensis Linn. The sensing platform comprised an\
    \ environmental monitoring platform and a wireless imaging platform, which \n\
    were deployed in the greenhouse. The environmental monitoring platform comprised\
    \ six wireless sensor nodes and a gateway \nfor measuring temperature, relative\
    \ humidity, and illumination. The wireless imaging platform comprised a set of\
    \ embedded \nboards with cameras to capture images of B. chinensis Linn, and all\
    \ the sensing data and captured images were stored and \nestimated using an image\
    \ processing algorithm. Our experimental results indicate that the daily average\
    \ growth rate and color \nvisibility of the leaf of B. chinensis Linn are a slight\
    \ difference between full watered and reduced watered plants. The sensing \ndata\
    \ will be examined to determine the relationship between the environmental factors\
    \ of the greenhouse and the growth of B. \nchinensis Linn under various irrigation\
    \ conditions with the same type of fertilizer management. Finally, the statistical\
    \ analysis and \nlong-term monitoring data will be used to build water management\

    \ Kaivosoja \nNatural Resources Institute Finland, Finland \nExperience and expertise,\
    \ or tacit knowledge, traditionally have a very significant role in farm management.\
    \ This is especially \ntrue on smaller farms, where the scope of the farm’s operations\
    \ isn’t necessarily overwhelming without external planning tools. \nHowever, the\
    \ ongoing digitalization of farming is bringing increasing amounts of data into\
    \ farm decision making. Simultaneously, \nthe rapid decrease in the prices and\
    \ significant improvements in the usability of new technology and new analysis\
    \ tools are \nmaking them viable alternatives for an ever-increasing number of\
    \ farmers. Thus, in the future, traditional farm management will \nbe increasingly\
    \ supplemented – or even replaced – by management methods based on data gathered\
    \ by various systems. In \nthis work we examine how using drone-based mapping\
    \ of agricultural fields can affect decision making in silage production for \n\
    cattle. Our work covers four important field operations: overseeding, application\
    \ of both organic and industrial fertilizers, weed \ncontrol, and timing of harvests.\
    \ We examine how drone data can be used in planning silage farming operations,\
    \ and formalize \nplanning processes that take advantage of field maps created\
    \ from the data. We will compare the drone-data utilizing process to \n \n \n\
    \ \n35 \ntraditional decision making to see how the drone-based data will supplement\
    \ – or replace – the traditional decision making. Based \non this, we will discuss\
    \ how this can affect the tacit knowledge of farmers in the future, and possible\
    \ implications for these changes \nin the expertise of farmers. The work will\
    \ both demonstrate the effect of new technology on farm management processes,\
    \ as well \nas contribute to research on knowledge management in agriculture.\

    \ \nAs an essential source of food, feed, and fuel, cassava has the potential\
    \ to become a promising crop that can adapt in changing \nclimatic due to its\
    \ low water requirement and drought tolerance. Despite the potential, cassava\
    \ production has the constraints by \nseveral factors, including farm management,\
    \ yield prediction, and supply chain. Inappropriate decision could limit yield\
    \ production \nand increase associated production cost with less profit margin\
    \ to farmers in Indonesia. This research presents a decision support \nsystem\
    \ integrated with geospatial technologies such as remote sensing (RS), geographic\
    \ information systems (GIS), and global \npositioning systems (GPS) for cassava\
    \ management and cassava monitoring information. In the methodology, multi-source\
    \ \ndatabase was built using the fuzzy membership of expert knowledge integrated\
    \ with the application of spectral reflectance of \nsatellite image and mapping\
    \ system. The decision scheme presented the farming practices including assessing\
    \ suitable land, \nmanaging pests, and predicting the economic benefits. Performance\
    \ evaluation of CasNet was conducted by the agricultural \nexperts and farmers\
    \ for yield prediction and inventory planning in the supply chain management of\
    \ cassava in the Banten \nprovince, Indonesia. A suitability map for cassava production\
    \ was created. It was mapping for the production and also the \ndistribution of\
    \ the cassava. Furthermore, the prediction yield model was done from the application\
    \ of remote sensing vegetation \nindex. In further research, the fuzzy-based expert\
    \ systems will be extended to develop food nutrition security model in Indonesia\

    \ to create and develop a precision animal husbandry tool that supports the sustainability\

    \ and organization of data, that allows the evaluation of a set of \nenvironmental\
    \ and physiological variables and to act in real time on environmental conditions.\
    \ The first test to validate the \nequipment and methodology for collecting and\
    \ monitoring information, related to animal welfare indicators, occurred between\
    \ \nOctober 2017 and January 2018. \nThe environmental data were collected by\
    \ sensors of temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and gas concentration,\
    \ which \nare integrated in a environmental control system (Webisense) and a platform\
    \ (Nidus). Webisense controlled the ventilation \nsystem, the cooling system and\
    \ the heating system. \nPhysiological data (rectal temperature, body surface temperature,\
    \ α-amylase and cortisol concentrations) were collected \nmanually and analyzed.\
    \ In order to monitor the behavior of the animals, video cameras and microphones\
    \ were installed. The \ncomponent of analysis of video and audio is in development,\
    \ through the video and audio captures already made. This analysis \naims to detect\
    \ abnormal behaviors such as crowding/spacing of animals and vocalizations above\
    \ certain frequencies. \nAn individual feeding machine equipped with a scale has\
    \ been installed. That allows, through an RFID system, individual \nmonitoring\
    \ and control of the quantity of food supplied and ingested; number and duration\
    \ of visits; and the weight of the animals. \nThis information allows the analysis\
    \ of productive data of animals. \nThe development of AWARTECH platform results\
    \ from the integration of physiological data manually supplied and real-time data\

    \ Lab srl \nAgri-food supply-chain have been extensively studied and several researchers\
    \ are considering the application of advanced \ntechnologies in supply-chain-management.\
    \ Indeed, technological developments in the area of networking devices, sensors\
    \ and \ncommunication technology can play a signiﬁcant role in sustainability\
    \ of animal product. \nA new-technology called blockchain has drawn much attention\
    \ from researchers in many different domains. Blockchain is a \ndistributed database\
    \ that maintains a continuously-growing list of data-records secured from tampering\
    \ and revision. It consists \nof blocks, holding batches of individual transactions.\
    \ Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. Blockchain \n\
    could guarantee the security of the whole network by using mathematical algorithm\
    \ mechanism. \nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the possibility to establish\
    \ a conceptual framework to support and guarantee supply-\nchain traceability.\
    \ The system takes advantage of blockchain technology, which has the potential\
    \ to enhance food safety and \nquality and, at the same time, to significantly\
    \ reduce losses during the logistics-process. Such approach can cover the whole\
    \ \nprocess of data gathering and information management of every link in the\
    \ agricultural product supply chain, supporting \nmonitoring, tracking and tracing\
    \ \"from farm to fork\". \nSpecifically, the study takes into consideration supply-chains\
    \ with different levels of complexity and analyses strengths, \nweaknesses, limits\
    \ and opportunities in the implementation of this new technique. It is shown how\
    \ blockchain can be particularly \nadvantageous not only in the case of direct\
    \ supply chains (one-supplier to one-customer) but also in the case of multi-entry-exit\
    \ \nchain (multiple-suppliers for multiple-customers), allowing time saving ranging\
    \ between 30% and 70%, and costs reductions \ncomprised between 60% and 90% in\
    \ the analyzed case studies. \nFeedback Grading Information For Insight In Variability\
    \ In Yield And Fruit Quality Of Elstar Apples At Sub \nOrchard Level \nPieter\
    \ Van Dalfsen, Peter Frans De Jong, Dirk De Hoog \nWageningen University & Research,\
    \ Netherlands, The \nFruit growers gather their fruit production information,\
    \ such as yield and fruit quality, mainly at the level of the whole orchard. \n\
    When, after harvest, fruits are graded by a machine at fruit sale organisations\
    \ much data is gathered, but this information is \nunused by the grower because\
    \ the exact picking position in the orchard is not known. Using this data by the\
    \ grower would give \nmore detailed insight in variability in yield and fruit\
    \ quality and could be used to apply better management strategies to optimise\
    \ \nfruit production. The picking platform Pluk-o-Trak was equipped with a GPS\
    \ system in order to georeference the position of the \nfull bins of picked apples\
    \ in the orchard. Therefore the route per bin was tracked at three picking moments\
    \ in an ‘Elstar’ apple \norchard. The full bins were labelled and stored in cold\
    \ storage. Next, the labelled bins were taken out of storage and graded on \n\
    an Aweta grading machine which determines 13 different parameters per apple trough\
    \ sensing and vision techniques. This data \nwas available per bin and then linked\
    \ to the GPS coordinates of the picking area for each picking moment. The cumulative\
    \ yield \nand fruit quality and also per picking moment were presented in a geo\
    \ referenced map. This method makes differences visible in \nyield and fruit quality\
    \ at sub orchard level. Combining the three picking moments, the yields varied\
    \ from 8 up to 23 kg/m of tree \nrow. Areas with high yield (weight and number\
    \ of apples) generally had a lower individual fruit weight. Some areas have less\
    \ than \n1% fruit rot, whereas other areas have more than 3%. To get feedback\
    \ from grading information to sub orchard levels a chain \napproach is needed\
    \ with fruit growers, sales organisations and technological suppliers. \nSite-Specific\
    \ Management of Pastures Based on Soil Apparent Electrical Conductivity Survey\

    \ Spain \nFertilization is the main cost of maintenance of permanent pastures.\
    \ Its incorrect use results in important direct economic loss \nand in environmental\
    \ polluction. Usually, soils utilised for pasture and livestock production in\
    \ Southern region of Portugal have \nhigh spatial variability. In consequence,\
    \ it is necessary to determine the spatial patterns of the main soil properties\
    \ as the first \nstage to implement site-specific management. However, this has\
    \ to be performed using an inexpensive technique because the \nprofitability in\
    \ these types of farm are very low, so owners need a cheap, effective, and reliable\
    \ method to know which zones \nhave similar potential management. The use of soil\
    \ apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), as it integrates many soil properties\
    \ \naffecting crop productivity (for instance, soil texture, organic matter and\
    \ cation exchange capacity), constitutes one of the most \nappropriate soil variables\
    \ to characterize the management zones of a field. In the present study ECa measurements\
    \ obtained \nwith a Veris 2000 XA contact-type sensor and soil samples taken at\
    \ 0-0.30m depth in three permanent pastures were used. The \naim was to assess\
    \ the spatial pattern of some soil properties, based on many ECa measurements\
    \ as ancillary information and a \nguided sampling taking into account the spatial\
    \ distribution of ECa. Relationships between ECa and some important soil \nproperties\
    \ were analyzed and, later, some maps were produced to visualize the spatial variability\
    \ of the soil properties. Finally, \nhomogeneous zones were delimited for attaining\
    \ a site-specific management of the fields. Results showed that ECa is associated\
    \ \nwith some important soil properties and, consequently, can be considered as\
    \ support information with the aim of obtaining low-\ncost data to be used to\
    \ implement site-specific management (intelligent soil sampling or differential\
    \ and optimal fertilization), in \nsoils with permanent pastures and to contribute\
    \ to the increased sustainability of the pasture grazing systems. \nApplication\

    \ C, 26 C and 32 C). The growth of the population was identified through sampling\
    \ counts conducted every four \ndays. Sampling counts of the population served\
    \ to estimate the average time of development for egg life stage from 6.4 days,\
    \ to \n5.7 days, and to 5.6 days for 20 °C, 26 °C and 32 °C, respectively; whereas\
    \ for larva life stage was found from 8.3 days, to 6.2 \ndays, and to 5.2 days\
    \ for 20 °C, 26 °C and 32 °C, respectively. Also, estimation of the average survival\
    \ rates from eggs to larva \nwere 37.1%, 56.9% and 4.5% for 20 C, 26 C and 32\
    \ C, respectively; whereas from larva to pupa were 6.7%, 32.9% and 0% for \n20\
    \ C, 26 C and 32 C, respectively. Finally, the time of development was subjected\
    \ to variability, which was deduced from the \nexperimental data at each treatment,\
    \ and was used to predict the expected population density using the modified McKendrick-\n\
    von Foerster equation in order to recommend the periodic sampling counts accordingly\
    \ to the change of life-stage, when X. affinis \nis subjected to a constant temperature.\
    \ \nA Systems and Control Approach for Integrated Pest Management \nSimon van\
    \ Mourik, Koen van Dinther, Johan van Riel \nWageningen University, The Netherlands\
    \ \nPoultry red mite (PRM) is a common pest in the poultry sector. The mites hide\
    \ in the laying houses and they feed themselves \nwith blood from the birds. Infestation\
    \ of PRM in a laying hen house can lead to irritation, restlessness, anaemia and\
    \ even mortality. \nAs these symptoms are associated with a lower production,\
    \ poultry red mite may cause considerable financial damage. \nWe investigated\
    \ the added value of precise timing and dosage for PRM pest management with a\
    \ modelling and control study. \nWe designed a model based optimal control strategy\
    \ for the timing and dosage of treatments. The optimality criterion used here,\
    \ \nwas defined as a minimized treatment input under the constraint that the mite\
    \ population does not exceed a certain threshold. \nFor this, we integrated a\
    \ population dynamics model with a mite monitoring and scoring model. \nThe optimal\
    \ control treatment strategy showed a potential saving of 52% of pesticides, compared\
    \ to a conventional treatment \nstrategy. The main difference between the optimal\
    \ and conventional treatments, is that the optimal strategy prescribes a \ncontinuous-time\
    \ treatment input, whereby the mite population is held at a constant level. The\
    \ conventional strategy consists of 8 \nseparate treatments during a production\
    \ round of 70 weeks. \nWe found two main issues with the optimal control strategy.\
    \ First, in case of chemical treatments, a continuous-time dosage might \nlead\
    \ to resistance development. Second, model based control without sensor feedback\
    \ might be sensitive to errors in the model \nthat describes the dosage response.\
    \ In an approach to deal with these problems, we approximated the optimal control\
    \ strategy \nwith a sensor based threshold controller that applies single separate\
    \ dosages using the scores of a mite counter. \nPerformance Evaluation of Passive\

    Digitalization in farming sector has raised interest nowadays. By increasing knowledge\
    \ and enabling unique identification of \nharvested crop, farmers gain relevant\
    \ business profit. At present, most of silage bales are stored in stacks on the\
    \ edge of field or \nnear cowshed without any special tag identification. In some\
    \ rare cases spray paint are used for identification, but real-time and \nunique\
    \ tracking is impossible. The need for weatherproof and automated identification,\
    \ combined with microclimate and \ngeographic information offer valuable information\
    \ to farmers. Research work presented in this paper presents the first steps to\
    \ \nachieve unique bale identification and related data management. \nThis research\
    \ is focused on the utilization of passive radio frequency identification (RFID)\
    \ for silage bales in stationary conditions. \nPassive RFID is wireless, non-line\
    \ of sight identification technology, with free-air identification distances over\
    \ 10m. When installed \nto application, distances decrease based on material’s\
    \ electromagnetic properties. As conservation of silage is based on lactic \n\
    acid fermentation, with pH around 4 and dry matter variation between 20 and 45%,\
    \ the challenge to achieve sufficient distance \nraises. RFID operation principle\
    \ is based on reader command and transponders’ passive backscattering, where transponders\
    \ \nharvest all their operational energy from reader’s communication signal. As\
    \ maximum communication signal strength is limited \nby telecommunication standard\
    \ regulations (e.g. ETSI), transponder type plays a crucial role to guarantee\
    \ adequate signal \nstrengths to achieve sufficient communication distances. \n\
    In this research, the applicability of RFID technology is measured in a silage\
    \ bale of 160cm in diameter, covering 360 degrees \naround the bale. Measurements\
    \ are conducted as identification distance [meters], and transponder population\
    \ [number of tags]. \nBased on the results, the most suitable tag for the application\
    \ is chosen, and the applicability is proven. The project next steps \nwill be\
    \ on-site testing, integrating RFID reader to baler and evaluating the performance\

    \ Portugal; 2 ISQ, Portugal \nIn a world of increased lack of resources, it is\
    \ imperative to promote the transition to a more circular economy, seen as an\
    \ \nalternative business model to promote competitiveness, reducing simultaneously\
    \ the consumption and dependency of raw \nmaterials and energy. \nThe main goal\
    \ of “Alentejo Circular” project was to raise awareness and mobilize Alentejo’\
    \ s agrifood sectors to adopt the circular \neconomy model, aiming to create value\
    \ for enterprises, and consequently for the region, by transferring knowledge\
    \ on the best \npractices and technologies for efficient resource use and waste\
    \ valorisation. The work was focused on the wine, olive oil and pig \nfarming\
    \ industries, due to their current and growing importance for the regional economy.\
    \ \nThrough national and international technical site visits and bibliographic\
    \ research, a current diagnosis of circularity in the \naddressed regional industries\
    \ was as carried out, as well the assessment of circular economy best practices,\
    \ at national and \ninternational level. The resources and wastes were characterized\
    \ and quantified improving the knowledge of recovery cycles with \na list of best\
    \ practices being gathered as priority for actions to be taken by the regional\
    \ stakeholders, in order to support the \ntransition towards a circular economic\
    \ model. \nAs a result of this study, it was possible to conclude that the best\
    \ available practices in these sectors, such as, smart farming and \nthe use of\
    \ renewable energy are already in use across the region, however these practices\
    \ are only implemented by a limited \nnumber of the regional companies. \nBy means\
    \ of several public sessions across the territory and a web 2.0 based platform,\
    \ the interaction between stakeholders, \nincluding companies, public authorities\
    \ and the scientific community increased, resulting in shared experience and knowledge\
    \ on \nalternative use of resources, thus settling the conditions for the development\
    \ of future synergies. \nA Technical–Economic Analysis Of Precision Spraying In\
    \ Vineyard And Apple Orchard \nEmanuele Tona, Aldo Calcante, Roberto Oberti \n\
    University of Milan, Italy \nA technical–economic analysis was conducted considering\
    \ three different technological levels of spraying equipment for specialty \n\
    crops case studies, using the results of precision spraying technologies reported\
    \ in scientific literature. The application scenarios \nwere referred to general\
    \ protection protocols against fungal diseases adopted in vineyards and apple\
    \ orchards in Central-\nSouthern Europe. The analysis evaluated the total costs\
    \ of protection treatments (equipment and pesticide costs), comparing the \nuse\
    \ of conventional air-blast sprayers (technological level L0), of on–off switching\
    \ sprayers (L1), and of canopy-optimised \ndistribution sprayers (L2). Average\
    \ pesticide savings from 10 to 35% were associated to equipment L1 and L2, as\
    \ compared to \nconventional techonology L0. Within the assumptions made, on grapevines,\
    \ the conventional sprayer L0 resulted in the most \nprofitable option for vineyard\
    \ areas smaller than 10 ha; from 10 ha to approximately 100 ha, L1 was the best\
    \ option, while above \n100 ha, the more advanced equipment L2 resulted in the\
    \ best choice. On apple orchards, L0 was the best option for areas smaller \n\
    than 17 ha. Above this value, L1 was more profitable, while L2 never proved advantageous.\
    \ Finally, in a speculation on possible \nperspectives of precision spraying on\
    \ specialty crops, the introduction of an autonomous robotic platform able to\
    \ selectively target \nthe pesticide on diseased areas was hypothesised. The analysis\
    \ indicated that the purchase price that would make the robotic \nplatform profitable,\
    \ thanks to pesticide and labour savings, was unrealistically lower than current\

    \ have surveyed and purposively selected as 20 groups of hire service providers\
    \ of small farm \nmachinery in the region. Group managers and machine operators\
    \ were personally interviewed using questionnaires to collect \nprimary data during\
    \ September – October 2017. The results showed that the small farm machinery hire\
    \ services were small \nbusinesses managed by farmer groups and operated within\
    \ village area. They managed 2 - 4 kind of farm machines and offered \nhiring\
    \ services for their group members according to machine owned with a lower charge\
    \ rate. The businesses became sources \nof increasing and diversifying family\

    \ This research used a three round Delphi technique to identify the factors reached\

    \ cultivation in Italy represents an important production sector within the horticultural\

    \ in greenhouses can provide for the various operations and are conditioned, as\
    \ well as by the characteristics \nof the species in cultivation, vegetables or\
    \ flowers, the type of greenhouse used and the type of cultivation adopted. \n\
    The present study has the main objective of observing the distribution of current\
    \ mechanization levels in protected production \ncompanies and to verify any influences\
    \ from income or from the surface and structure. Therefore the data of the Italian\
    \ agricultural \naccounting information network (R.I.C.A. - Rete di Informazione\

    \ of 95% of the utilized agricultural area (UAA), 97% of the \nvalue of the Standard\
    \ Production, 92% of the Work Units. \nThe available data have therefore been\
    \ studied for the spatial distribution of the farms, their mechanization in terms\
    \ of kW used \nin the production process and for the interaction with the net\
    \ income obtained, the company surface and the manpower used. \nFurthermore, a\

    \ of overhead trellis systems, to almost or fully discrete canopies characteristic\
    \ of some fruit tree \norchards. It also estimates portions of the canopy under\

    \ Administration, Republic of Korea \nIncreasing labour scarcity puts pressure\
    \ on labour intensive tasks in agriculture, such as crop management and harvesting.\
    \ \nAgricultural robots have the potential to execute agricultural tasks unattended.\
    \ These robots often rely on Global Navigation \nSatellite Systems (GNSS) for\
    \ autonomous navigation. In environments where GNSS localization is unreliable,\
    \ for example in \norchards, alternative sensors and algorithms need to be used\
    \ for navigation. Scientific literature indicates a lack of consensus on \nwhich\
    \ alternative navigation algorithm should be used in an orchard. This research\
    \ presents a comparison between four in-row \norchard navigation algorithms under\
    \ constant conditions; the Hough transform, least squares line fitting, the Kalman\
    \ filter and the \nparticle filter. All algorithms relied on 2D LiDAR data and\
    \ included the extraction of line features in the laser scan image. Two \nexperiments\
    \ were executed in a Dutch apple orchard, using a robot platform equipped with\
    \ a 2D LiDAR, inertial measurement \nunit and wheel encoders. The first experiment\
    \ assessed the navigational accuracy by traveling two paths of 500 m at two \n\
    velocities, while registering the robot’s position and orientation using an RTK-GNSS\
    \ receiver. Average lateral deviations from the \ncentreline between two tree\
    \ rows ranged from 0.05 m to 0.12 m, while extreme lateral deviations ranged from\
    \ 0.12 m to 0.23 m. \nThe particle filter showed the lowest average and extreme\
    \ deviation from the centreline. The second experiment assessed \nnavigational\
    \ robustness by artificially removing trees from the sensor measurement and registering\
    \ the navigational response of \nthe robot. The Hough transform and particle filter\
    \ steered the robot on collision course in case of missing trees, while the Kalman\
    \ \nfilter and the least squares line fitting only showed a marginal increase\
    \ in lateral deviation. The last showed the lowest lateral \ndeviation, indicating\
    \ the highest degree of robustness. \nReliability of Autonomous Guided Systems\

    \ \nCSIC, Spain \nHomogeneous use of pesticides in the majority of the cropping\
    \ areas is the most common method for pest control. Intra-plant \nvariation is\
    \ not considered which leads to the use of a non-adjusted dose. These facts demonstrate\
    \ that the dose of sprayed \nproducts should be adapted to the growing state at\
    \ each location. Information about crop status is of high value for agricultural\
    \ \nmanagement. The use of plant models allows site specific management and yield\
    \ estimations. The models can be analyzed to \nobtain information such as height\
    \ of tree-row-volume, which is used to determine the amount of agrochemicals,\
    \ nutrients or grow \nregulator to apply at each location. The use of new technologies\
    \ is of high impact in agriculture, and viticulture is the agricultural \nsector\
    \ with more technological advances. The creation of spatial variability maps for\
    \ site-specific management is still a challenge. \nThe use of 3D structural maps\
    \ can adapt the application of inputs within the fields. This work assess the\
    \ reliability of 3D models \nusing large maps of vineyards for site-specific management\
    \ and explore the economic profitability of its usage. A mobile platform, \nbased\
    \ on a commercial electric vehicle, was developed and equipped with different\

    \ and IMU information allowed operating in autonomous mode for vineyard monitoring.\
    \ A \nlow-cost RGB-D sensor, Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor was installed on-board\

    \ objects was fully automatic based on ICP algorithms for 3D reconstructions of\

    \ Camino de Vera, s/n, 46022 Valencia, Spain \nA low cost field robot has been\
    \ built capable of transporting a series of sensors through horticultural fields,\
    \ with the aim of early \ndetecting problems in the crop by means of proximal\
    \ sensing techniques. The robot is operated by remote control and is driven \n\
    by two electric motors coupled to the wheels and powered by batteries. The sensors\
    \ include different thermal, colour and \nmultispectral cameras in the visible\
    \ and the near-infrared range that are synchronised with the advance of the robot\
    \ by means of \nan encoder coupled to the axis of the motors. The position of\
    \ each image is geolocated using a GPS. An industrial computer \nreceives the\
    \ encoder pulses and triggers the cameras, also receiving and storing the images\
    \ and GPS information for further \nprocessing. The inspection area is located\
    \ beneath the robot with the cameras focusing downwards (to the crop). To avoid\
    \ the \nnegative influence of direct sunlight, the area had been covered with\
    \ a canvas and illuminated artificially with four-spot halogen \nlights. A telescopic\
    \ extension system between 100 and 200 cm allows the robot to adapt to crops with\
    \ different row widths. The \nfirst trials were carried out in a carrot test field\
    \ located in Villena (Spain) to detect plants infected with Candidatus Liberibacter\
    \ \nsolanacearum. The crop was inspected every month from sow to harvest. Labels\
    \ were placed on 100 plants to guarantee their \nindividual identification in\
    \ the images. During the harvest, these plants were collected separately, identified\
    \ and analysed in the \nlaboratory using molecular techniques in order to determine\
    \ whereas they were infected or not. Several maps of the field have \nbeen created\
    \ using spectral indexes at very high resolutions between 0.5 mm/pixel and 2.5\
    \ mm/pixel depending on the camera. \nGeneration of Weed Cover Maps Using a SLR\
    \ Camera \nKarla Cantuña, Dionisio Andujar, Jose Maria Bengochea-Guevara, Angela\
    \ Ribeiro \nCSIC, Spain \nPrecision agriculture uses knowledge of spatial and\
    \ temporal variations in crops for selective treatments. The case of weed \nmanagement\
    \ is of high importance because herbicides are the most used pesticides in the\
    \ world. Weed mapping at early \nphenological stages is necessary to optimize\
    \ herbicide application. The acquisition of series of high-quality overlapping\
    \ pictures \nfrom autonomous platforms allows the reconstruction of accurate 3D\
    \ models. The method needs of computer vision and digital \nphotogrammetry such\
    \ structure from motion (SfM) and dense image matching (DIM). It also needs of\
    \ colour index-based \nsegmentation algorithms to separate plant from soil to\
    \ extract the vegetal cover from the digital images. This paper describes two\
    \ \naspects: 1) the generation of weed maps from images provided by an SLR camera\
    \ (Single Lens Reflex, Canon EOS 7D) under \nreal field conditions of uncontrolled\
    \ lighting. All the images were georeferenced using the geographic location information\
    \ provided \nby the RTK-GNS receiver. The data processing leads to an orthogonal\
    \ projection (GeoTIFF image or orthophoto) of the sampled \narea. Lately, the\
    \ best segmentation strategy was chosen by testing and adapting several methods.\
    \ 2) Ten color-based \nsegmentation strategies were applied to 313 random images.\
    \ The efficacy of each segmentation strategy was tested by Jaccard's \nsimilarity\
    \ coefficient. It estimates the percentage of similarity between automatically\
    \ segmented image and its corresponding \nground truth image. Following, Newman-Keuls\
    \ test compared the averages of similarity percentages of the ten segmentation\
    \ \nstrategies to determine which strategy fits better. The results showed differential\
    \ similarities: COM1 (53,01%), EXGR (52,08%), \nCIVE (50,52%) and automatic threshold\
    \ (42,82%) were the most effective. Thus, the possibilities and disadvantages\
    \ of different \nsystems regarding their practical use in weed detection were\
    \ assessed based on results obtained from field experiments. The \nstudied strategies\
    \ offers opportunities for automation of agricultural processes by integrating\
    \ RGB cameras with fast algorithms. \nThe Electronic Smell of the Orchard Fruit\

    \ Science and Remote Sensing, Wageningen University & Research \nAssessing fruit\
    \ maturity when at the end of the season is a hard task for fruit growers. This\
    \ is because this task is either made by \nvisual inspection – which is tedious\
    \ and time consuming - or using destructive procedures for measuring biophysical\
    \ properties \non the fruits, such as the sugar content. \nAn alternative to measure\
    \ the ripeness of fruits is measuring the volatile organic compounds emitted by\
    \ the fruits. An important \ncompound produced by the fruits in this stage is\
    \ ethylene (C2H4). \nThe recent advances in electrochemical semiconductors have\
    \ enabled the rapid growth of electronic noses technologies and \napplications.\
    \ Nevertheless, the research reported where its characteristics and limitations\
    \ are explored only addresses \nexperiments in controlled and indoor settings.\
    \ Therefore, many questions remain regarding the electronic noses applicability\
    \ in \noutdoor environments. \nThis work presents preliminary evidences that there\
    \ are good chances that ethylene can be detected outdoors via an electronic \n\
    nose placed within an orchard field. The results presented are measurements acquired\
    \ in a Conference pear (Pyrus communis) \norchard in September 2017. The measurements\
    \ where acquired on several points within the field, and the maximum ethylene\
    \ \ndetection shows an increase of 10% over 400 seconds. \nThese results were\
    \ contrasted with a theoretical study where gas dispersion patterns can be appreciated\
    \ when subject to the \nwind speeds recorded in the field. The simulation results\
    \ indicated a good correlation between the practical and the theoretical \nsimulation\
    \ results. \nTo the best of our knowledge this work is the first to report results\

    Changes in ingestive-related behaviors (e.g., feeding and ruminating) are key\
    \ indicators for assessing health and well-being in \ncattle. The aim of this\
    \ study was to develop a decision-tree (DT) algorithm to classify neck-mounted\
    \ accelerometer data for the \nmeasurement of feeding and ruminating behaviors\
    \ in dairy cattle. The performances of the DT were compared with those of a \n\
    support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Ten multiparous dairy cows were used in\
    \ this study. The cows were housed in an area \nof 36x13 m2 with individual cubicles\
    \ and concrete slatted floor. The cows were fed roughage ad libitum. Drinking\
    \ water was \navailable ad libitum. Collar-mounted accelerometers were used to\
    \ distinguish between three behavioral categories: feeding, \nruminating and other\
    \ activity (non-ingestive). The accelerometer (sampling at 10 Hz) was attached\
    \ on the cow’s collar. Direct \nobservations (i.e., reference) were made from\
    \ 09:00 AM to 03:00 PM (6 hours per cow). To classify the data of the three \n\
    behaviors, a new DT algorithm was developed. The decision-tree algorithm was selected\
    \ for its low computational costs, which \nmakes it implementable on the on-cow\
    \ nodes. The performances were calculated using leave-one-out cross-validation.\
    \ Results \nshowed that the DT algorithm nearly matched the performances of computationally\
    \ intensive algorithms such as SVM (i.e., overall \naccuracy of 89 % for the DT\
    \ and 92 % for SVM). The precision, sensitivity, and specificity measures were\
    \ between 77 % and 94 \n% for the DT, and between 82 % and 96 % for the SVM. These\
    \ preliminary findings illustrate the potential of the collar-mounted \naccelerometer\
    \ to classify feeding and ruminating behaviors with a simple DT method. This would\
    \ optimize the power consumption \nof the sensors by transmitting just the behavior\
    \ of the cow instead of all the raw data to the backend system. Measurements are\
    \ \nbeing continued in order to validate the reported results. \nAutomatic Body\

    \ The Netherlands \nVision-based automatic body condition scoring for dairy cows\
    \ offers a laborsaving solution to frequently assess the fat reserves \nof individual\
    \ cows on farms. The body parts assessed in the existing vision-based studies\
    \ include spinous processes, hook bones, \npin bones, and the cavity between the\
    \ tail head and pin bones. The manual body condition scoring used as references\
    \ in these \nstudies, however, often include four additional body parts: short\
    \ rib, loin pit, thurl, and sacral ligament. We assume the conditions \nof all\
    \ the additional body parts can be assessed automatically and the accuracy of\
    \ the vision-based scoring improves when \nincluding all body parts. Our objective\
    \ was to automatically extract the body-condition-related image variables of the\
    \ eight body \nparts using multiple three-dimensional (3D) cameras to predict\
    \ the body condition score (BCS). Forty-four lactating cows were \nrecorded ten\
    \ times in two consecutive days using three 3D cameras from the top-, right-side-,\
    \ and rear-view. Each image was \nautomatically processed to identify the projections\
    \ of the anatomical landmarks on the body surface. The protrusion around the \n\
    landmarks and concaveness between them were quantified as eight image variables\
    \ for the eight corresponding body parts. \nMoreover, body condition was independently\
    \ assessed by two trained assessors using a detailed protocol. Because the inter-\n\
    assessor correlation coefficient was high (Spearman's ρ = 0.91), the BCS of the\
    \ two assessors were averaged and used as the \nreference. To predict the BCS,\
    \ a one-Nearest Neighbor classification model was applied using all the image\
    \ variables as inputs. \nUsing a 10-fold cross-validation, the model outputs were\
    \ compared with the referential BCS, which yielded a mean absolute error \nof\
    \ 0.15 BCS. So far, the smallest error obtained in referential studies was 0.26\
    \ BCS. Hence, we conclude that assessing all eight \nbody parts in the vision-based\
    \ body condition scoring increases the BCS prediction accuracy significantly.\

    \ China, People's Republic of \nAnimal walking gait can reflect its health status.\
    \ In order to identify the normal walking and lame walking of pigs, a lameness\
    \ \nrecognition method based on skeleton analysis and gait energy image was proposed\
    \ in this paper. Firstly, the binary silhouette \nimages of pigs were extracted,\
    \ and the gait cycle of pigs was detected by the method of skeleton analysis.\
    \ Then the gait energy \nimages of pigs were synthesized in one gait cycle, and\
    \ the gait features of pigs were characterized using the gait energy image \n\
    (GEI). Two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) method was used to\
    \ reduce the feature dimension of gait energy \nimage of pigs. Finally, the nearest\
    \ neighbor classifier was designed to recognize the normal walking and lame walking\
    \ of pigs. In \norder to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the\
    \ pig's gait image database was established. The proposed method \nwere tested\
    \ using the samples in the database. Experimental results showed that the recognition\
    \ rate of normal pigs is 91.0% \nand that of lame pigs is 95.5%. The total recognition\
    \ rate is about 93%. The main causes of the error in normal pigs are that some\
    \ \nof them sometimes would walk or stop alternatively, and their heads would\
    \ shake considerably. This study provides a new method \nfor identifying pigs\
    \ with abnormal gait and lameness using computer vision technology. \nRobotic\
    \ Systems in Open Fields  \nAutomatic Detection Of Broccoli Heads In Open Field\
    \ Using An Artificial Neural Network \nPieter M. Blok, Toon Tielen, Joris M. M.\
    \ IJsselmuiden, Gert Kootstra \nWageningen University & Research, The Netherlands\
    \ \nVisual observations to assess the quality of open field crops are labour-intensive\
    \ and subjective. One instance of a crop which \nrequires frequent visual observations\
    \ for phenotyping, disease scouting and selective harvesting, is broccoli. In\
    \ this research, an \nimage acquisition module was built to acquire images from\
    \ field grown broccoli. Computer vision software was developed to \ndetect the\
    \ broccoli heads in the RGB images as a basis for automatic and objective quality\
    \ assessment. Object detection in these \ntop-view images can be challenging as\
    \ broccoli heads can be partially occluded by surrounding leaves. The goal of\
    \ this research \nwas to investigate if machine learning has the ability to deal\
    \ with these environmental disturbances. As such, the object detection \nperformance\
    \ using machine learning was compared to traditional threshold based computer\
    \ vision. A pixel-based artificial neural \nnetwork, more specifically a multi-layer\
    \ perceptron (MLP) with 40 hidden layers, was developed to classify image pixels\
    \ in either \nbroccoli or background. Five image features were used to train the\
    \ MLP. Three features were colour-based and two texture-\nbased. The MLP classifier\
    \ was trained on 197 images which were randomly selected from a dataset containing\
    \ 30.000 field \nimages. The object detection method merged the connected MLP\
    \ classified broccoli pixels into regions and selected the broccoli \nhead objects\
    \ with a threshold on the region size. The computer vision was validated on 295\
    \ independent images, containing 219 \nbroccoli heads. 204 broccoli heads were\
    \ detected, compared to 169 heads when a threshold based computer vision script\
    \ was \napplied on the same test set. The corresponding false positive count was\
    \ 2 versus 15. The MLP-based software showed a 94.8% \ndetection accuracy, which\
    \ was an 14.4% increase compared to the threshold based computer vision. The results\
    \ show the \npotential of machine learning to detect crops in open field for automatic\
    \ and objective quality assessment. \nVirus Infection Detection in Hyperspectral\
    \ Images of Potato Plants using Deep Neural Networks \nHendrik De Villiers, Pieter\
    \ Marinus Blok, Gerrit Polder \nWageningen University & Research, The Netherlands\
    \ \nVirus diseases are one of the major problems in the cultivation of seed potatoes.\
    \ Once found in the field, diseased potatoes lead \nto rejections of the tubers,\
    \ resulting in a large financial loss. Much damage occurs when the disease is\
    \ not detected in an early \nstage, which is often the case. Hyperspectral images\
    \ provide detailed localized spectral information which could be useful in \n\
    detecting regions of a plant which exhibit symptoms of viral infection. Deep neural\
    \ networks have been shown to be effective in \nthe process of simultaneously\
    \ learning both informative features and the process of localizing these features\
    \ within a given image. \nWe demonstrate these methods on a set of hyperspectral\
    \ line scan images of potato plants imaged under field conditions. Ground \ntruth\
    \ is based on GPS positions of diseased plants, marked by crop experts and provided\
    \ on the level of individual lines. A fully \nconvolutional neural network (FCN)\
    \ architecture is employed to predict the health status of the plant at each given\
    \ captured line. \nTests on potato varieties other than that in the training data\
    \ suggest the network partially generalizes to these other varieties. \nResults\
    \ on the Vermont variety exhibit a high true positive rate exceeding 90%. An analysis\
    \ of false positives shows that the \nmajority of false detections originate from\
    \ plants bordering known sick plants, possibly caused by the inaccuracy of the\
    \ mapping \nbetween the images and GPS positions of the diseased plants. Testing\
    \ on another variety (PCR11) produced similar results as \nthe Vermont case in\
    \ an earlier week, but showed poorer results in a later week with a 78% true positive\
    \ rate and the majority of \nfalse positives lying in healthy regions. The results\
    \ of a sensitivity analysis suggest that the network is primarily making use of\
    \ \nspectral information, rather than spatial contrasts. \nAgrosense, a Real-Time\
    \ Height Compensation Mechanism for Crop Monitoring Applications \nMichael Terzer1,\
    \ Raimondo Gallo2, Michael Riedl1, Fabrizio Mazzetto2 \n1Fraunhofer Italia - Innovation\
    \ Engineering Center; 2Free University of Bozen-Bolzano \nTransferring sensing\
    \ and monitoring technologies from applied research to practical applications\
    \ is an important aspect of \ninnovative precision agriculture. Until now several\
    \ attempts can be found in context of automatic crop monitoring and proximal \n\
    sensing. Various problems arise when adapting these solutions to real environments\
    \ conditions, for instance to uneven and steep \nterrains in apple orchards and\
    \ vineyards present in alpine regions such as South Tyrol (IT). Measurement data\
    \ is influenced by \nshocks, vibrations and geometrical misalignments transmitted\
    \ from the carrier vehicle or terrain, and can be improved with either \nSoftware\
    \ or Hardware methods. ByeLab is a mobile laboratory, designed to carry out automatic\
    \ crop monitoring tasks by applying \ntechniques of ground sensing. It consists\
    \ of an electric driven bins carrier and a support system for several installed\
    \ sensors: 6 \nOptRx, 2 LiDAR, 1 RTK-GNSS. This paper presents an extension of\
    \ this system with AgROSense, a sensor platform in \n \n \n \n46 \ncombination\
    \ with a real-time height compensation mechanism for sensors. The feedback for\
    \ the control algorithms is composed \nby an AHRS measuring angles and a laser-sensor\
    \ used to gather the height reference from the moving sleigh of the mechanism\
    \ \nto the ground. In order to overcome disturbances, the support system of the\
    \ vehicle dampens high frequency vibrations whereas \nthe mechanism evens out\
    \ low frequency movements with high amplitudes. A controlled environment was used\
    \ to validate the \nsystem whereas the uneven terrain was simulated using well-defined\
    \ obstacles. The validation was carried out comparing LiDAR \nscans obtained by\
    \ the system, with and without AgROSense, and the scans collected by a terrestrial\
    \ laser scanner as a reference. \nFirst experimental results have shown the capability\
    \ of the system to carry out more precise measurements than compared with \nthose\
    \ made without real-time compensation. Further investigations and real environment\
    \ experiments are planned in future work. \nData Acquisition Platform for Collecting\

    \ \n1Aarhus University, Department of Engineering; 2Aarhus University, Department\
    \ of Agroecology, Denmark \nIn modern agriculture there is an increasing focus\
    \ on a reduction in herbicide usage. As a result, machine learning algorithms\
    \ is \napplied in several weed detection and classification applications. To make\
    \ robust detection and classification, training data for \nsuch algorithms must\
    \ include a wide variety of weed species and present diversity in the appearance\
    \ of these. Ideally, training \ndata should be collected in real-world fields\
    \ to reflect reality most accurately. However, acquiring high quantities of in-situ\
    \ images \nof all weed species plus annotation of these is time consuming and\
    \ prone to human errors. \nThis paper presents a data acquisition platform providing\
    \ a reliable and efficient way of collecting high-quality images of weeds, \n\
    cultivated in a controlled environment. The platform is established at a semifield\
    \ area at Aarhus University, Research Center \nFlakkebjerg. The platform itself\
    \ consists of an imaging acquisition system mounted on a camera dolly that moves\
    \ on a railing \nsystem above a set of pot experiment tables. The acquisition\
    \ system is configured to automatically collect images when the dolly \nis moved\
    \ above the cultivated plants. Each of the collected images covers approximately\
    \ 0.28 m^2 and have a ground resolution \nof ~6.6 pixels/mm. The controlled environment\
    \ makes additional annotation unnecessary, thereby reducing the risk of errors.\
    \ \nDiversity in plant appearance have been achieved by applying different growth\
    \ conditions. The platform has been used to acquire \nimages each day of 39 different\
    \ weed species, divided over two growth seasons: one spring and one autumn. The\
    \ weeds are \ncultivated under three different growth conditions, from emergence\
    \ to the 6 to 8-leaf stage. The spring season includes 18 weed \nspecies observed\
    \ over a period of 36 days and the autumn season includes 21 weed species observed\
    \ over a period of 60 days. \nDesign Of Simplified Optical Devices For The Agrofood\

    \ Agroenergy, \nItaly \nThe Italian agri-food system is mostly characterized by\
    \ small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Due to their size and the \nsmall\
    \ possibility of significant investments in analytical instrumentation, they are\
    \ characterized by the lack of crucial information \nfor the management and control\
    \ of their processes. The main parameters related to important information to\
    \ better lead the \ndecision-making stages of the production process (e.g. decide\
    \ the harvest time, monitoring fermentations, monitoring shelf life \nand post-harvest\
    \ life, etc.) need to be measured in a simple, quick and objective way. \nFrom\
    \ this point of view, the optical techniques based on visible near-infrared spectroscopy\
    \ (vis/NIR) are an established, simple \nand rapid application for the analysis\
    \ of many productions quality related parameters. \nA number of vis/NIR and NIR\
    \ optical systems are available on the market. These devices potentially represent\
    \ a valid support to \nthe various supply chains. Nevertheless, the available\
    \ optical systems are complex and expensive devices and their real use in \nSME\
    \ is still very limited. \nThe aim of the research was to design, build and test\
    \ concepts and prototypes of low-costs and user-friendly devices useful for \n\
    different applications from pre-harvest to post-harvest. Tests for the selection\
    \ of specific wavelengths for the analysis of grapevine \nleaf water status, for\
    \ grape and blueberry ripening evaluation, and for senescence monitoring of fresh-cut\
    \ baby leaf salad during \nshelf life were conducted. In particular, for the grape\
    \ ripeness analysis a Light Emitting Diode (LED) based prototype equipped \nwith\
    \ a customized optical fiber for the measurement of the spectral reflectance at\
    \ four specific wavelengths (630, 690, 750 and \n850 nm) was proposed and tested.\
    \ \nThe use of these devices could be helpful for a more rational and objective\
    \ monitoring of the products quality, leading to an \noptimization of the supply\

    \ vehicles with different functions to accomplish tasks. Besides, each machine\
    \ is \ndifferent in its operation modes, which makes the operation time-consuming\

    \ module to identify the \nlocation of crop and weed, soil moisture below the\
    \ machine and perform the weeding, watering, and fertilizing. The platform also\
    \ \nincludes moisture sensor modules, multiplexing, decision making module, and\
    \ fuzzy logic inference engine to receive the soil \nmoisture so as to access\
    \ degree of soil moisture and to define the operation procedures. The image identification\
    \ scheme based \non color space conversion and adaptive threshold selection are\
    \ utilized to classify the weed, crop, and estimate the soil moisture. \nThe automatic\
    \ raking weed and watering device are utilized to accomplish weeding, watering,\

    \ Politécnica de Madrid, Spain; 3UMR ITAP Irstea - SupAgro \nThe peach tree is\
    \ one of the fruit species with the highest production in Spain. The nutritional\
    \ diagnosis of the peach tree, usually \nbased on the mineral analysis of leaves,\
    \ is often late for the application of corrections before harvesting. On the other\
    \ hand, the \nleaf diagnosis of ferric chlorosis is often imprecise, due to the\
    \ narrow range of variation in leaf iron concentrations. SPAD \nmeasurements are\
    \ commonly used for chlorophyll content sensing in leaves, showing relation with\
    \ chlorosis development. \nHowever SPAD is measured locally. Hyperspectral images\
    \ could be able to sense the evolution of ferric chlorosis on the leaf \nsurface.\
    \ Thirty-two trees, belonging to seven rootstocks, and three leaves per tree were\
    \ considered for hyperspectral \nmeasurements. SPAD measurements were acquired\
    \ from their leaves and flowers. Mineral composition (Al, B, Ca, Cu) was also\
    \ \ndetermined. The SPAD appears correlated with several minerals in leaf: Ca,\
    \ S, Fe, Cu and Sr, restricted to Ca and Sr when \ncomparing the SPAD with the\
    \ mineral composition in flower. There appears to be a very large dispersion among\
    \ SPAD values \nfor the same rootstock which points the existence of isolated\
    \ individuals with leave chlorosis. \nAccording to experts identification SPAD>=32\
    \ was set to sound trees, SPAD<24 was label as severely affected by chlorosis,\
    \ and \nintermediate level in-between. Comparing the average spectra of sound\
    \ leaves with affected ones, three features were observed; \na) an increase of\
    \ reflectance from 500 to 600 nm, with a peak around 550, b) a red-edge displacement\
    \ to the left, and c) an \noverall weak decrease of reflectance at NIR range probably\
    \ due to the increase of the chlorosis. Several authors notices that red-\nedge\
    \ moves towards left with the decreasing of chlorophyll content. Besides, an increase\
    \ in the visible range could be caused by \na decrease in chlorophyll due to nutritional\
    \ stress. \nRobotic Systems in Pastures  \nNovel Systems for Pasture Characterization\

    \ - CSIC, Arganda (Madrid), Spain \nReliable assessments of grassland growth and\
    \ development enable accurate and timely management decision taking (e.g. \napplication\
    \ of slurry or grass cutting). In Norway, these assessments are commonly done\
    \ by farmers, based on their experience, \nwhich is subjective and possibly erroneous.\
    \ Current machine vision and geospatial technologies enable objective, time flexible\
    \ \nand cost-effective plant monitoring, although, little implementation has been\
    \ achieved for grasslands. Therefore, we evaluated \nthe capability of two procedures\
    \ to study and model pasture architecture in 3D, aiming at computation of grass\
    \ height and \nbiomass. Using the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor, on-ground depth\
    \ images were acquired on selected 1x1 m plots and reconstructed \n3D point clouds\
    \ via Kinect Fusion algorithms. Paralelly, a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV) captured alongside a set of \naerial Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images with\
    \ 90% field overlap and the Structure from motion (SfM) technique composed the\
    \ mosaic \nimage, including also a 3D model of the study plots. Image data and\
    \ 3D models were processed with object-based image analysis \nfor estimation of\
    \ grass heights and other parameters, to be compared with ground-truth observations\
    \ (e.g, plate-meter \nmeasurements, manual cuttings and determination of dry weight\
    \ biomass). A total of 20 sampling plots were measured in two \nexperimental fields\
    \ (10 plots per field) at the NIBIO Særheim Research Station, containing grass\
    \ mixtures of importance for local \nfarmers and of varying sward densities and\
    \ plant heights. A higher accuracy of the Kinect-based procedure was reflected\
    \ on the \nresults to model grass architecture and compute plant height. However,\
    \ the UAV-based procedure required significantly less time \nfor data acquisition\
    \ and elaboration of 3D models. We point out some advantages and limitations of\
    \ each procedure. The use of \nUAVs facilitated operability and coverage of large\
    \ surfaces, compared with on-ground systems. However, the on-ground sensing \n\
    captured fine details of plants, producing more accurate measurements. \nEstimating\

    \ \nA farm experiment was conducted to determine if there is any correlation between\
    \ leaf N content and the surface temperature of \nthe herbage of the perennial\
    \ ryegrass <em>Lolium perenne</em>. Using the thermal camera, periodic measurements\
    \ of herbage \nsurface temperature was made in conjunction with herbage cuts and\
    \ analysis of dry matter for %N content. At the same time, \nother environmental\
    \ factors such as humidity, soil temperature, and air temperature was measured.\
    \  \nSix treatments of soil N (0, 50, 100, 200, 350, and 500 kg N/ha equivalent)\
    \ was created using urea mixed into a soil medium for \nthis glasshouse pot experiment.\
    \ Periodic measurements of herbage surface temperature was made using a mobile\
    \ platform from \nwhich infra-red measurements of herbage temperature can be made\
    \ from a consistent height above the pots.  \nFor data analysis, the thermal images\
    \ was analysed using Flir software to find the average temperature of the leaves.\
    \ As data \nconstitutes the core of the study, the database should be flexible,\
    \ accessible and simple, for both data entry and data analysis. \nSubsequently,\
    \ an MLR model was developed to predict nitrogen content based on herbages temperature\
    \ and other measured \nfactors. The result of this study will help to estimate\
    \ nitrogen content of perennial ryegrass <em>Lolium perenne</em>under \ndifferent\

    \ 7.800 automatic milking systems (AMS) installed in Germany, \nwith a clearly\
    \ evident upward-trend [1, 2]. Based on the steep rise of AMS a similar development\
    \ in AFS (automated Feeding \nSystems) seems likely. The technical advances are\
    \ mainly attributed to time and labor savings for the farmer and the plan to \n\
    meet nutritional and behavioral aspects of the cows. Recently Strautmann presented\
    \ their study “Verti-Q”, a fully automated \nfeeding system, on the Agritechnica\
    \ 2017. Previously Schuitemaker, Lely, Hirl, LucasG and Siloking announced fully\
    \ or partly \nautomated feeding systems, so that self-driving, automatic feeding\
    \ systems can be seen as a future solution in dairy industry. \nChallenging for\
    \ most manufacturers is, that no standards for self-propelled AFS are existing,\
    \ which are said to be the state of the \nart. \nEspecially the various environments\
    \ on farms cause critical situations for machine operations, such as tough weather\
    \ conditions. \nTo reach the set safety level, durable sensing and a comprehensive\
    \ safety concept are necessary. In preliminary tests a novel \nradar scanner and\
    \ a laser 2D-scanner were tested. They proved to be possible solutions for navigational\
    \ and safety tasks in AFS. \nThe sensors gathered data of the environment of a\
    \ farm. The acquired data were used to create digitals maps of the stable and\
    \ \nshowed the applicability of these methods. Quality data for mapping algorithms\
    \ have been improved staedily with a self-designed \nhigh-complex physical system,\
    \ where already Monte Carlo-filtered data has been processed with an Extended\
    \ Kalman-Filter. \nWith further progression concerning the prototyped radar-scanner\
    \ and its data-processing, radar as well as laser will provide the \nsensory for\
    \ a self-driving AFS. The next step will be a risk assessment based on the ISO\

    \ was based on the vertical cross bars design, and the precision and \ncompletion\
    \ rate were improved by a stepping motor. The UWB positing system can provide\
    \ the position data, therefore, the \nautomatic cruising robot would execute the\

    \ with natural or cultivated grassland in the undercover and grazing \nanimals.\
    \ A decline of these ecosystems has been reported since the end of the nineteenth\
    \ century in southern Portugal. In order \nto ensure a sustainable management,\
    \ there is an urgent need to produce knowledge on the resilience thresholds of\

    \ variability in Montado is particularly complex and an important \nchallenge\
    \ due to the existence of different strata (soil, pasture, trees and animals).\
    \ The conventional methods for determining \nkey components of pasture productivity\
    \ and quality are time consuming and expensive, hence the interest in evaluating\
    \ faster \nand cost effective tools. Monitoring pasture productivity and quality\
    \ over time is critical for defining the nutritional value of pastures \nand designing\

    \ and Vineyards:  \nVisual Feedback for Flight Control of an Autonomous UAV Operating\
    \ Within Vineyard Rows \nRaphael Linker \nTechnion, Israel \nIn recent years there\
    \ is a growing interest in the use of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles, “drones”)\
    \ in agriculture. The common \nfeature to all existing platforms is that they\
    \ fly over the crop. Although for field crops there is obviously no alternative,\
    \ the \nmotivation of the proposed work is that in orchards and vineyards much\
    \ more information could be obtained by flying the UAV \nwithin the tree rows.\
    \ Accordingly, the present work focuses on the development of the sensing methodology\
    \ and algorithms \nnecessary in order to enable autonomous flight of a small UAV\
    \ within rows of trees or vines. Such autonomous flight requires \naccurate estimation\
    \ of the UAV position and heading relative to the tree/vine rows. Although ultrasound\
    \ sensors which are \ncommonly installed on small UAVs for obstacle detection\
    \ work well for detecting large and strongly reflective objects, they do not \n\
    provide reliable estimation of distance to sparse and irregular objects such as\
    \ leaves canopy. In the present work we investigate \nthe use of a simple vision\
    \ system for this task. The system consists of a forward-looking and a backward-looking\
    \ cameras. In \neach image each tree/vine row appears roughly as a trapeze whose\
    \ properties depend on the camera position and/or orientation. \nAlthough one\
    \ camera does not provide enough information for estimating both camera position\
    \ and orientation, this can be \n \n \n \n49 \nachieved by combining the information\
    \ of the two cameras. The image analysis procedure we have developed is robust\
    \ in respect \nto strong illumination variations and background changes, and the\
    \ accuracy of the position and heading estimations appears to \nbe satisfactory\
    \ for autonomous flight control in vineyards. \nFruit Detection Using Mobile Terrestrial\

    \ systems is essential for future sustainable agronomic management of \nhigh-value\
    \ crops. Up to date, most proposed systems on fruit detection and characterization\
    \ are based on RGB cameras and \nthus affected by intrinsic constraints, such\
    \ as variable lighting conditions and camera calibration. This work presents a\
    \ new \ntechnique that uses a mobile terrestrial laser scanner to detect and localize\
    \ fruits regardless of the prevailing lighting conditions \nand without the need\
    \ of a previous calibration. An experimental test focused on two Fuji apple trees\
    \ (containing 139 and 145 \napples each) was carried out. A 3D point cloud of\
    \ this scene was generated using a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR sensor synchronized \n\
    with a RTK-GNSS receiver. A reflectivity analysis of tree elements was performed,\
    \ obtaining mean reflectivity values of 28.9%, \n29.1%, and 44.3% for leaves,\
    \ trunks, and fruits, respectively. These results suggest that the reflectivity\
    \ parameter can be useful \nto localize fruits in the tree. From this knowledge,\
    \ a three-step fruit detection algorithm has been developed: 1) reflectivity \n\
    thresholding to remove most of the leaves and trunks from the original point cloud;\
    \ 2) statistical outlier removal to reduce noise; \n3) connected components clustering\
    \ using a density-based algorithm. By applying this algorithm to our dataset,\
    \ a localization \nsuccess of 85%, a detachment success of 78.8%, and a false\
    \ detection rate of 15.2% were obtained. These detection rates are \nsimilar to\
    \ those obtained by current RGB-based system, but with the additional advantage\
    \ of providing direct 3D fruit location \ninformation (global coordinates) which\
    \ is not affected by sunlight variations. It can be concluded that LiDAR technology\
    \ and, \nparticularly, its reflectivity information, might have potential use\
    \ in fruit detection. Future work should include the application of \nthis fruit\
    \ detection technique on a wider range of crop types. add text in remarks! \n\

    \ can contribute to enhance profitability of farms and solve the problem of labour\
    \ \navailability. The growing demand of the juice market generates the need for\
    \ more efficient harvesting system. The canopy shaker \nsystems are a current\
    \ technology used to detach the fruit from the tree by means of the interaction\
    \ of machine rods with the tree \ncanopy. Since the most of citrus production\
    \ is hand harvested, a mutual adaptation between machine and tree is requires\
    \ for an \nefficient result. The objective of this work is to establish recommendations\
    \ to reach high values of fruit detachment efficacy able \nto eliminate a sequent\
    \ hand harvesting process. Field tests were carry out with a lateral tractor-drawn\
    \ canopy shaker in four \ncommercial plots of sweet orange in south of Spain.\
    \ The canopy vibration during the harvesting process was measured with a \nset\
    \ of triaxial accelerometer sensors with a datalogger placed on bearing branches\
    \ in 90 trees. The vibration process, fruit \nproduction and branch properties\
    \ were analysed. Vibration parameters showed a large variability in different\
    \ points into the tree \ncanopy. The harvesting efficiency values were reduced\
    \ from an average value of 85% in zones of canopy in contact with rods to \na\
    \ mean value of 27% in zones without direct contact. The improvement of fruit\
    \ detachment efficiency is possible if both hedge \nand machinery were mutually\
    \ adjusted. The hedge should be training to facilitate the rods access and placing\
    \ the fruit production \non the outside of the canopy. The machine, working at\
    \ mean frequency value of 4.1 Hz, must to produce a high level of resultant \n\
    acceleration (100-200 ms-2) in the branches during a period of time higher than\

    \ Multi-Arm Tree Fruit Harvesters \nRajkishan Arikapudi, Stavros Vougioukas \n\
    University of California, Davis, United States of America \nRobotic tree fruit\
    \ harvesting is still at a pre-commercial stage, despite active research for at\
    \ least 30 years. One reason is that \nfruit picking efficiency and fruit pick\
    \ cycle times (PCT) are still inadequate for cost-effective operation. \nThis\
    \ paper studies PCT as a function of the number of robot arms used for picking.\
    \ A simulator modeled the kinematics and \ndynamics of a harvester comprising\
    \ identical, independent, non-interfering arms. Each arm moved inside a ‘cell’\
    \ in an array \nconfiguration and picked fruits only from the canopy volume allocated\
    \ to it, in a sequence that minimized arm travel time. Each \ntree was harvested\
    \ independently, while the harvester was static in front of it. Digitized models\
    \ of fruit-bearing, high-density \ntrellised pear trees were used. Individual\
    \ fruit distributions were non-uniform and varied significantly among trees. Such\
    \ yield \nvariation can introduce significant inefficiencies in multi-arm robot\
    \ harvesting. Two scenarios were considered: A) all arm cells \nhad the same size;\
    \ B) cells were unequal and optimally sized to contain approximately the same\
    \ number of fruits. Scenario (B) \nserves as an ‘upper bound’ on performance,\
    \ since all arms harvest the same load and finish almost together. \nResults showed\
    \ that in both scenarios PCT followed a power law; it did not drop linearly as\
    \ the number of arms increased. Overall, \nthe PCTs of scenario A were three times\
    \ worse than the corresponding PCTs of scenario B; this is the result of non-uniform\
    \ fruit \ndistribution. A ten-fold decrease in PCT (from 4.6 s to 0.46 s) was\
    \ only possible with optimally sized cells and at least 14 arms. \nAchieving such\
    \ low PCT with uniform cells required more than 40 arms. These results indicate\
    \ that achieving low PCTs for cost-\neffective fruit tree harvesting requires\
    \ many arms that must be carefully load-balanced in the presence of changing,\
    \ partially \nknown fruit distributions. \n \n \n \n \n \n50 \nEstimation of Vine\
    \ Shoot Morphology and Volume Based on Computer Vision and Image Processing \n\
    Barna Keresztes1, Jean-Pierre Da Costa2, Christian Germain2 \n1Université de Bordeaux,\
    \ France; 2Bordeaux Sciences Agro \nWhile various automated techniques exist for\
    \ the assessment of vine vigour and vegetative growth (including remote/close\
    \ \nsensing NDVI measurements and LAI estimation), manual ones (pruning weight,\
    \ shoot count) remain the reference methods. \nHowever manual vigour estimation\
    \ is a very time-consuming task that is usually limited to experimental studies\
    \ and that cannot \nbe carried out routinely for vigour mapping in a production\
    \ context. This work presents an automatic method to estimate the vine \nshoot\
    \ volume and pruning weight, based on an embedded computer vision system mounted\
    \ on a tractor and image analysis \nalgorithms. The algorithm can also determine\
    \ vine shoots morphology i.e. diameter and length. The method can easily be \n\
    implemented in daylight and it is fully automated. \nThe image acquisition system\
    \ is composed of one camera, two synchronized flashes and a reflective panel designed\
    \ to produce \nover-saturated images where shoots appear as dark objects over\
    \ a quasi-uniformly white background, without shadowing \nproblems. The shoots\
    \ are segmented using grey level thresholding and morphology-based filtering.\
    \ Metallic wires are removed \nusing orientation information. The shoot axes and\
    \ lengths are detected using skeletonization and the distance transform is used\
    \ \nto determine the local shoot diameter and section area in every point of the\
    \ shoot axes. The shoot volume is determined by \nintegrating the local shoot\
    \ section along the skeleton. \nThe method was tested on images acquired on a\
    \ parcel of vines in the Pessac-Leognan area, France. A total of 300 vine plants\
    \ \nwere taken in photo. The estimated shoot volumes per plant were correlated\
    \ with manual pruning weights and NDVI \nmeasurements made by remote sensing during\
    \ the previous growing season. \nThe first results show a promising correlation\
    \ between the estimated shoot volume and the vine vigour. Future work concern\

    \ have attracted attention as a breakthrough to solve the food production crisis.\
    \ In the plant factory, there is an \nadvantage that the light-dark cycle can\
    \ be flexibly controlled, so that the circadian rhythm in plants can be regulated\
    \ by light \nconditions and plant growth could be maximized by matching the circadian\
    \ rhythm with light-dark cycle. However, the circadian \nrhythm is difficult to\
    \ measure without destruction of plants, e.g. analyze of gene expression. In this\
    \ research, we focused on \nhyperspectral camera (HS camera) to measure the circadian\
    \ rhythm nondestructively. HS camera is an instrument that analyze \nthe reflected\
    \ light from an object as high-precision wavelength information. In a previous\
    \ study, we have found that the internal \ntime of the circadian clock (circadian\
    \ phase) can be estimated by combining HS camera and machine learning, but the\
    \ effective \nwavelengths for the estimation has not been clarified. \nHere, we\
    \ identified wavelengths as indicators of circadian phase by analyzing all combinations\
    \ of two different wavelengths. \nGreen perilla (Perilla frutescens) was grown\
    \ and measured every 2 hours for 2 days. Maximal information coefficient (MIC)\
    \ was \nused for all combinations of 525 nm to 900 nm (25 nm interval) to evaluate\
    \ the association between two wavelengths. \nFurthermore, we constructed timeseries\
    \ data of MIC (timeseries-MIC) and figured out that the correlation between timeseries-\n\
    MIC in 1st and 2nd days are maximized when two wavelengths were chosen from photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation region (400 \nnm to 700 nm) and near infrared region (700 nm\
    \ to 900 nm). This study suggests that the circadian phase can be measured by\
    \ \ntwo different wavelengths of light reflectance on leaves. \n \n \n \n51 \n\
    Flower and Bud Detection of Gerbera L. Using Faster Region-Based Convolutional\
    \ Networks. \nJos Ruizendaal, Ruud Barth, Jos Balendonck \nWageningen University\
    \ & Research, The Netherlands  \nIn flower production, the total number of flowers\
    \ and buds are counted to obtain the plant load, which is an important indicator\
    \ for \nthe expected future harvest and plant health. For production of gerbera\
    \ flowers currently this is manually done once a week by \nthe grower, taking\
    \ into account any bud or flower on a plant having a size above 20 mm. Due to\
    \ the high labour intensity, only 4 \nplants/ha are currently monitored and results\

    \ was mounted on a mobile platform with a high intensity xenon flash light (MVS-5002,\
    \ PerkinElmer). The \nmobile platform drives on the pipe rail system in the greenhouse,\
    \ taking an image of the crop every 70 cm. Images were taken \nfor 6 rows in 6\
    \ sections, acquiring 700 images of the crop. In the images all flowers and buds\
    \ were annotated with bounding \nboxes to train a Faster Region-Based Convolutional\
    \ Network (Faster-RCNN). The network was applied to extract the number of \nbuds\
    \ and flowers per image. Due to occlusions, a bud and flower visibility in the\
    \ images of 87.4% was achieved compared with \nmanual counting. Preliminary classification\
    \ results of the faster R-CNN network show a precision of 0.92 and recall of 0.75.\

    \ Imaging \nGerrit Polder, Anja Dieleman, Esther Meinen, Kees Weerheim \nWageningen\
    \ University & Research, The Netherlands  \nOne of the challenges in modern greenhouse\
    \ horticulture is to optimally convert light into a harvestable product, such\
    \ as tomato \nfruits. Leaves are essential in this process, via (1) assimilate\
    \ production via photosynthesis and (2) the temporary storage of \nassimilates\
    \ before they are transported to the fruits. In order to apply the appropriate\
    \ crop and climate management actions, \ngreenhouse growers could benefit from\
    \ knowledge about the assimilate status of the leaves. Currently, there is no\
    \ monitoring \ntool available that can provide growers with these data. Therefore,\
    \ we studied the application of hyperspectral imaging to monitor \ncrop status\
    \ non-destructively. \nIn a greenhouse experiment, 5 tomato varieties were grown\
    \ using 9 different treatments resulting in a large variation in chemical \ncomposition.\
    \ Leaves were harvested, and hyperspectral scans were made in the VIS/NIR (400-1000nm)\
    \ and NIR (900-1700nm) \nrange. Subsequently, ground truth measurements were performed,\
    \ such as chlorophyll, sugar, acid, starch, dry matter content \nand nutrients\
    \ (K, Na, Ca, Mg, N, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, B, Mo and Cu). Partial Least Square (PLS)\
    \ regression shows high correlations \n(R2> 0.95) for VIS/NIR and NIR hyperspectral\
    \ images and dry matter content and for VIS/NIR images and chlorophyll. Starch\
    \ \nand sugar contents can be predicted by NIR images (0.74 < R2 < 0.90). For\
    \ nutrients, Ca and N had the best correlation in NIR \n(R2 of 0.78 and 0.82 respectively).\
    \ These promising results show that it is possible to develop a tool that growers\
    \ can use to \nmonitor crop status instantaneously and decide on the proper cultivation\
    \ actions and climate management in the greenhouse. \nComparison Of Different\

    \ indicator for feedback on the management of production \nprocess in vegetables\
    \ especially aimed for the ready-to-eat salads market. The non-destructive assessment\
    \ of growth-rate is \nbased on top-view color imaging which enable to estimate\
    \ the plant biomass by measuring the projected area of the canopy at \ndifferent\
    \ points in time. The obtained accuracy becomes more limited as progresses the\
    \ stage of growth, due to leaves \noverlapping and to occlusions of plant’s top-view.\
    \ The recent introduction of cost-effective time-of-flight cameras with three\
    \ \ndimensional (3D) capability may enable a valuable step ahead towards an accurate\
    \ and fast technique for monitoring leaf \nvegetables growing at greenhouse and\
    \ field scale. The experiment consisted in an in vivo 3D imaging technique on\
    \ undisturbed \nRomain lettuce potted plants at different growing stages. Top-view\
    \ color and depth images (RGB-D) were obtained with a Kinect \nV2 (Microsoft,\
    \ USA) in a greenhouse setup. Immediately after the acquisitions, each lettuce\
    \ plant was destructively harvested to \ndetermine the total area of detached\
    \ leaves and the corresponding fresh weight of the biomass. The RGB-D derived\
    \ point-cloud \nof each plant was processed to extract the canopy volume and to\
    \ estimate leaf area and biomass with two different approaches. \nIn one case,\
    \ single leaves were segmented with a region growing algorithm based on surface\
    \ smoothness and colour similarities \nin the point-cloud. For all the single\
    \ leaves the area was then calculated considering local surface orientation and\
    \ finally added \nto obtain the plant leaf area. The second approach, based on\
    \ concave hull volume, enabled to obtain the smallest polyhedron \ncontaining\
    \ the canopy, and to compute its surface area and volume. The results obtained\
    \ with the two methods correlated fairly \nwell with fresh biomass, even at more\
    \ advanced growing stages with R2=0.77 and R2=0.84, respectively. \nA 3D Low-Cost\

    \ Measurement Using Stereo Vision \nPeter Riegler-Nurscher1, Heinrich Prankl1,\
    \ Gerhard Moitzi2, Helmut Wagentristl2 \n1Josephinum Research, Austria; 2University\
    \ of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna \nSoil Roughness is an important\
    \ agronomic soil parameter. It influences plant emergence as well as plant growth\
    \ and plays an \nimportant role in soil erosion. The main goal at point of seeding\
    \ is to get a good settled seedbed which is not to rough crumbled \nfor good plant\
    \ emergence and not to fine crumbled to avoid soil erosion and silting. These\
    \ agronomic properties at seeding can \nbe determined by soil roughness. \nThus,\
    \ a robust method for soil roughness measurement is needed for mapping the soil\
    \ roughness on fields and to control \nmachines according to the site specific\
    \ roughness. Tillage machines might be controlled online during field work to\
    \ get more \nhomogeneous and more efficient working results. Furthermore, roughness\
    \ maps, generated with overlapping GNSS data, might \nbe used for later precision\
    \ farming applications, for instance site specific fertilizing. \nOur proposed\
    \ method is based on cost-effective stereo cameras and mobile processors. The\
    \ method can be implemented in real \ntime on a moving machine. Challenging environmental\
    \ influences, like dust, lighting and vibrations, have been taken into account.\
    \ \nThe resulting roughness indices consider directional roughness, like stripe\
    \ patterns. These constant soil patterns are generated \nby the directed movement\
    \ of the tillage machine. \nTo evaluate the method, the roughness measurements\
    \ and aggregate size of the soil were compared in different field tests. The \n\
    robustness of the method was investigated in various tests under different soil\
    \ conditions. Also machine parameters which \ninfluence the resulting roughness,\
    \ like driving speed or PTO speed, were evaluated. Finally, the influence of soil\
    \ roughness on \nthe plant emergence was evaluated. \n \n \n \n \n \n53 \nTowards\

    \ Leuven (Belgium) \nAlternaria solani, which causes early blight, is a pathogen\
    \ notorious for its economic damage in potato cultivation. Crop protection \n\
    products need to be applied regularly, may have an environmental impact and imply\
    \ a considerable cost to the farmer. Localized \ntreatment has been reported to\
    \ reduce the application of crop protection products and hence lessen the environmental\
    \ and \neconomic burden. In this paper, hyperspectral imaging is proposed to automatically\
    \ detect A. solani in field conditions to allow \nthe generation of task maps\
    \ for site specific spray applications. A proximal sensing platform (hypercart)\
    \ was constructed for fully \nautomated acquisition of hyperspectral images in\
    \ the field under controlled light conditions. A protocol was created to normalize\
    \ \nthe acquired hyperspectral images. During the growing season of 2017, 32 potato\
    \ plants in four field plots were inoculated with \nA. solani and monitored before\
    \ and during visual disease expression over a period of seven days after inoculation\
    \ using \nhyperspectral imaging. A variety of statistical analysis methods such\
    \ as partial least squares – discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) \nand soft independent\
    \ modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) were applied on the dataset to demonstrate\
    \ the potential of \nhyperspectral proximal sensing for detection of A. solani\
    \ in the field. \nThe variability in light intensity at leaf level resulting from\
    \ the heterogeneity in leaf position made correct classification of pixels \n\
    solely based on their spectra difficult. Less illuminated healthy leaves were\
    \ regularly misclassified as infected or categorized as \n‘unknown’. Several pre-processing\
    \ methods were investigated to deal with this variability in intensity, with varying\
    \ success. An \nalternative method is to compare potentially infected spots and\
    \ calculate the Euclidian distance of the centroid of infected pixels \nmapped\
    \ in hyperspace to the centroid of the surrounding pixels. This distance could\
    \ be a potential feature to distinguish A. solani \nlesions from artefacts and\
    \ less illuminated leaves. \nSustainable Management and Yield Monitoring of an\

    \ Universidad de Granada, Spain \nThe green spaces, gardens and urban grasslands\
    \ play a very important role in big cities since they help the regeneration of\
    \ air \npolluted by the peoples’ daily activity. Although the automatic irrigation\
    \ systems of these natural spaces are beginning to be \nimproved, there is usually\
    \ a fixed irrigation routine that does not take into account meteorological aspects\
    \ such as the fact that it \nis raining or that the earth contains enough moisture\
    \ to ensure the correct development of the grass. Taking into account these \n\
    facts, this paper presents the design, development and test of an intelligent\
    \ system for irrigation control of urban lawns. The \nsystem is based on the use\
    \ of a multisensor node composed by humidity and temperature for soil and air,\
    \ as well as a rain \nsensor. The multisensor node is controlled by an intelligent\
    \ algorithm that takes into account the real time values provided by the \nsensors\
    \ and the stored data of previous measurements. The intelligent algorithm is responsible\
    \ for analyzing the data and \ndeciding on the amount of water to be used in a\
    \ given area. The multisensor node is integrated into a wireless sensor network\
    \ \nthat will allow us to control areas and specify different irrigation routines\
    \ for areas with different requirements. Using actual annual \nmeteorological\
    \ values of Madrid (Spain) where different water requirements are observed throughout\
    \ the year, the system's \noperation is simulated. The results show that for a\
    \ landscaped area of about 140 ha, we could save approximately the 6% of the \n\
    irrigation water we would use in a fixed irrigation routine which would be equivalent\
    \ to about 22 million liters of water. \nStructured Design of a Novel End-effector\

    \ \nThe European TrimBot2020 project researches the robotics and vision technologies\
    \ to prototype the first outdoor garden trimming \nrobot. The robot navigates\
    \ over different terrains, approaches boxwood plants and trims them to a desired\
    \ shape. The robot \nplatform is based on a modified Bosch robot lawnmower, which\
    \ navigates autonomously using 3D-based vision scene analysis. \nDuring trimming\
    \ a robotic arm is controlled by visual servo in order to trim the bush. A novel\
    \ end-effector had to be designed to \nguarantee flexibility of the manipulator,\
    \ precision of trimming and smoothness of the trimmed bush surface. This paper\
    \ describes \nthe structured design of this bush trimmer. \nWhen faced with a\
    \ design problem with many interconnecting system elements, structured design\
    \ is a tool to be used to iteratively \nand step by step guide the designers in\
    \ making the right design choices at the right moment during the different design\
    \ phases. \nFirst, preliminary research is done to analyse the problem and to\
    \ assess the goals of the bush trimmer. Second, the functions \nare determined\
    \ and working principles are found and put into a coherent structure. Finally,\
    \ this leads to a composition of several \npreliminary designs of which the most\
    \ promising one is determined. This design is built as a working prototype. Next\
    \ to this, 3D-\nCAD tools and rapid prototyping is used to test ideas along the\
    \ design process. \nThe final design, based on contra-rotating blades, was discussed\
    \ in terms of how and to what extent it met the requirements, \nobjectives and\
    \ functions found during the structured design process. Moreover, the results\
    \ of lab and field tests have shown the \nfirst functional results and improvements\
    \ have been identified. \nA novel trimming method, by contra-rotating blades,\
    \ has been found using structured design which meets the demands and \nlimitations\
    \ of other system components of the robot. \nVision-based Robotic Bush Trimming\
    \ Evaluation \nDejan Kaljaca1, Angelo Mencarelli2, Eldert van Henten1, Jochen\

    \ Research, The Netherlands  \nTrimbot2020 is an EU project that aims at automatizing\
    \ garden maintenance. The maintenance of a garden is a labor-intensive \ntask,\
    \ that is difficult to automate because of the variation in a natural environment.\
    \ To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there \nis currently no robot able to\
    \ trim bushes of arbitrary shapes. \nIn order for a robot to handle generic garden\
    \ trimming tasks, an evaluation mechanism to decide whether a given bush has been\
    \ \nproperly trimmed is needed. As the trimmed bush has a complex 3D architecture,\
    \ evaluating it is not straightforward. Furthermore, \ntrimming evaluation is\
    \ inherently a subjective process, as the opinion of users on a trimmed bush is\
    \ dependent on personal \npreference and present-day gardening fashion. Evaluation\
    \ can be used as a way to improve the trimming system, or as a way to \nprovide\
    \ closed-loop feedback to modify the trimming plan. Especially the latter leads\
    \ to the requirement that evaluation should \nbe automated, to prevent that for\
    \ each trimming execution a human judge is needed. \nThis study proposes a novel\
    \ automated system for the evaluation of trimmed boxwood bushes. Our system exploits\
    \ a camera \nand a rotation table to collect a sample of snapshots of the bush\
    \ before and after robotic trimming. This allows to downscale the \n3D bush analysis\
    \ into a 2D problem. A framework of metrics and assessment methods was devised\
    \ to evaluate the quality of the \ntrimmed bush with respect to a target shape\
    \ defined over the untrimmed bush. The proposed framework was used to evaluate\
    \ \nthe shape result for some real robotic trimming tests. Results show that that\
    \ our approach allows to capture a mathematical \ndescription of the trimming\
    \ quality of a bush that can be correlated with the opinion of a human observer.\

    \ a low cost, light weight modular platform targeted for low cost crops like maize\
    \ or sugerbeat. The low cost, \ncompared to other robotic-platforms, enables the\
    \ farmers to use robotic technology in crops where the return of interest until\

    \ implements they already have at their farm. The width \nof the Robotti is customized\
    \ for each farmer so it matches the working width of the existing row widths.\
    \ \nThe safety system designed for the Robotti, allows an agricultural robot to\
    \ operate autonomously in the field with limited or no \nsupervision by a human\
    \ operator. The goal of operation without human supervision has currently not\
    \ been achieved because, as \nwith self-driving cars, in the case of an accident\
    \ the responsibility must be placed somewhere. The Robotti toolcarrier is classified\
    \ \nas a machine according to EU legislation and standards. \n \n \n \n55 \nThe\

    \ inherent part of the system. The path planning \nalgorithm takes soil-compaction\
    \ into account when planning the route in the field, along with other parameters\
    \ as execution time \nand fuel consumption. The high-level control of the movement\
    \ of the robot is being developed based on design space exploration \nto find\

    \ most demanded food items in the daily human being’s diets, and one of the most\
    \ important crops in the \nworld with high economic impact. \nThe most grown banana\
    \ species in the world is denoted as Cavendish. This banana replaced the Gros\
    \ Michel (GM) variety that \nwas wiped out in the last century due to Fusarium\
    \ wilt. The causal agent of Fusarium wilt is the soil-born fungus Fusarium \n\
    oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). Whereas GM was conquered by Foc Race 1, Cavendish\
    \ banana is now threatened by Foc \nTropical Race 4 (TR4). A decease that originates\
    \ from Southeast Asia but is spreading towards Latin America, where most \nWestern\
    \ consumers obtain their banana from. \nGeneticists have been researching for\
    \ many years in trying to obtain a resistant banana variety but so far not a commercial\
    \ \naccepted variety is identified. Due to the rapid spread of Foc TR4, a new\
    \ crash in the banana industry, fully dependent on \nCavendish banana, is dawning\
    \ at the horizon. \nThis work discusses the idea that electrochemical sensors\
    \ (aka, electronic noses) might be able to detect chemical compounds \nemitted\
    \ by infected banana’s plants. This hypothesis is based on the fact that infected\
    \ bananas emit for instance more odours, \nand that stressed plants tend to release\
    \ more ethylene. \nTo address this hypothesis a novel remote sensing system is\
    \ proposed for non-invasive real-time monitoring of banana plants \nand infected\
    \ patterns recognition. This system combines low-cost consumer electronics boards\
    \ with an electrochemical sensor. \nTwo prototypes are placed in two different\
    \ greenhouse rooms with infected and non-infected banana´s plants for 24h. Preliminary\
    \ \nresults, validate the conceptual sensor framework. \nPotential of a LiDAR-based\

    \ have been widely explored for the geometrical characterization and measurement\

    \ density of points at a very high sampling frequency \nwith a resolution of some\
    \ millimeters of error. They reconstruct 2D planes and 3D information can be acquired\
    \ by displacing the \nsensor perpendicularly. The use of plant models allows site-specific\
    \ management at different crop stages. The study evaluates \nof the accuracy and\
    \ performance of a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor for vegetation characterization\
    \ using distance \nmeasurements aiming to detect and reconstruct of 3D maps of\
    \ vineyards. The maps were created during winter when only \nbranches were present\
    \ and leaves fell down. The models can be used to obtain information such as height\
    \ and branch volume \nin order to make an automated prune or relate this parameter\
    \ with future yield at each location. LiDAR sensors were installed on-\nboard\
    \ of a mobile platform equipped with RTK-GNSS receiver and IMU sensor for crop\
    \ scanning. The 3D map was correlated \nwith actual, manually determined, rest\
    \ of pruning weight. The result indicate that LiDAR sensors are a promising tool\
    \ for vineyard \nbranch detection with great advantages over other types of non-contact\
    \ ranging sensors, such as a high sampling resolution and \nhigh sampling rates.\
    \ Thus, this tool is of high interest for several scenarios even when only branches\

    \ has increased, leading to an enhancement \nof features resolution. At present,\
    \ several satellites images services exist, which provide very different products\
    \ for different \ndemands. Specifically, constellations of nanosatellites are\

    \ comparing \nspatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric resolution taking into\
    \ account the farmer's requirements to benchmark the major \nsatellites images\
    \ providers. Concurrently, the study analyses the computational power needs per\
    \ unit of area, for each single \ndownloadable product. Finally, the costs of\
    \ single images related to the minimum purchased areas are considered. \nThe integration\
    \ of satellite services with digital agriculture technologies could be profitable\
    \ for both small and large farms. Small \nfarmers require low-cost services, but\
    \ with enough resolution to manage modest plots of land. On the other hands, big\
    \ farmers, \ndespite the possibility they have to make significant investments,\
    \ can use low-resolution images, due to the relevant dimensions \nof the fields;\

    \ which provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of Earth. Recorded Sentinel-1\
    \ data \nhave shown a potential for remotely observing and monitoring local conditions\
    \ on broad acre fields. Remote sensing using \nSentinel-1 have the potential to\
    \ provide daily updates on the current conditions in the individual fields and\
    \ at the same time give \nan overview of the agricultural areas in the region.\
    \ Research depends on the ability of independent validation of the presented \n\
    results. In the case of the Sentinel-1 satellites, every researcher has access\
    \ to the same base dataset, and therefore independent \nvalidation is possible.\
    \ Well documented research performed with Sentinel-1 allow other research the\
    \ ability to redo the \nexperiments and either validate or falsify presented findings.\
    \ Based on current state-of-art research we have chosen to provide \na service\
    \ for researchers in the agricultural domain. The service allows researchers the\
    \ ability to monitor local conditions by using \nthe Sentinel-1 information combined\
    \ with a priori knowledge from broad acre fields. Correlating processed Sentinel-1\
    \ to the actual \nconditions is still a task the individual researchers must perform\
    \ to benefit from the service. In this paper, we presented our \nmethodology in\
    \ translating sentinel-1 data to a level that is more accessible to researchers\
    \ in the agricultural field. The goal here \nwas to make the data more easily\
    \ available, so the primary focus can be on correlating and comparing to measurements\
    \ collected \nin the broadacre fields. We illustrate the value of the service\
    \ with three examples of the possible application areas. The presented \napplication\
    \ examples are all based on Denmark, where we have processed all sentinel-1 scan\

    \ Spain \nThe VineScout project aims to industrialize, demonstrate, and take to\
    \ market an innovative expert field monitoring system \n(decision support system)\
    \ embedded in a small-size and cost-efficient robot for the vineyard. Autonomous\
    \ robots need agile \nperception systems for stoping the robot in critical situations\
    \ and helping in navigation. This study focuses on obstacle and path \ndetection\
    \ in front of the robot. In a first aproximation to this problem, ultrasonic sensors\
    \ were used for navigation and safeguarding. \nThe suitability of the sonar network\
    \ depended of sound cone dimensions and interference crosstalk errors. Due to\
    \ echo \ninterference, ultrasonic sensors had to be separated 90 cm, producing\
    \ a gap in the central area ahead of the robot. As an \nalternative, a 2D LIDAR\
    \ sensor was used to provide 11 measurements simultaneously. Both perceptive solutions\
    \ have been \ncompared to determine which one is the most appropriate as a safety\
    \ system. Both types of sensors were mounted in the same \nsupport, measuring\
    \ the range to several targets in static and dynamic tests. For the trials, the\
    \ sensing frame was attached to a \nrobot prototype, which moved over the field\
    \ in real work conditions. Three types of target were considered in the trials,\
    \ being the \ntarget A a cylindrical element, the target B a rectangular box and\
    \ the target C a person. The results show that the 2D LIDAR \ncomplements well\
    \ the deadzone caused by separating the sonar rangefinders because it provides\
    \ an increased safety zone for \nthe robot with redundancy from combining two\
    \ different technologies. In all trials the LIDAR scan provided more reliable\
    \ distance \nmeasurement than ultrasonic sensors regardless of surface texture\
    \ and position. Further research is in progress to find out if the \nside sonars\
    \ add reliability to the perceptive capabilities or on the contrary may be ommitted\
    \ to reduce complexity. \nNon-destructive Firmness Assessment of Avocado Fruit\
    \ Using a Pneumatic Low Impact Device \nCoral Ortiz, Carlos Blanes, Martin Mellado\
    \ \nUniversitat Politècnica de València, Spain \nAvocado is one of the most rapidly\
    \ ripening fruits. The decrease of fruit firmness is a physiological process that\
    \ occurs during \nfruit ripening. Different methods have been developed and used\
    \ for firmness measurement. The objective of this research study \n \n \n \n57\
    \ \nwas to test a developed laboratory prototype designed for the non-destructive\
    \ assessment of avocado firmness. A set of 150 \n‘Hass’ variety avocados, size\
    \ 16, were selected and divided in 5 sets of 25 avocados. Fruits were stored in\
    \ the laboratory under \nroom. In order to assess firmness decrease, every day\
    \ measuring session a set of 25 avocados was measured, destructively \nand non-destructively.\
    \ The non-destructive firmness measuring prototype was an impact device with a\
    \ pneumatic low mass \ncylinder. The final rod of the impact devise has a vacuum\
    \ jamming system capable to be adapted to the irregular fruit shape. The \naccelerometer\
    \ located at the base of the rod registered the deceleration curve, three non-destructive\
    \ parameters were obtained. \nNon-destructive parameters registered from the prototype\
    \ were highly correlated to the destructive firmness. A multiple regression \n\
    model explained destructive firmness according to the non-destructive parameters\
    \ from the prototype (R2=77.4 %).The designed \nprototype is capable to assess\
    \ avocado firmness without damaging the fruit. Further research should be done\
    \ in order to improve \nthe adjustment of the prototype to assess avocado firmness.\

    Knowledge of spatial variation of vegetative vigour is essential for site-specific\
    \ management and variable rate application. \nSpecifically, precision viticulture\
    \ requires continuous monitoring of the vigour due to the mutable condition during\
    \ the year and to \nfrequent treatments (10 to 15) during the growing season.\
    \ Over the last few years, several solutions for vegetation variability \nsurveying\
    \ have been proposed, mainly based on optical remote and proximal sensing. In\
    \ precision viticulture, images from remote \nsensing are influenced by inter-row\
    \ spacing, which can somehow mask or distort field variability. Analysis of high-resolution\
    \ \nsatellites or UAV imagery are not trivial, due to the computing power needs,\
    \ however inter-row spacing can be in these cases \nrecognized, segmented and\
    \ eventually removed. On the other hand, medium resolution satellites imagery\
    \ does not allow \nidentification of single rows, while they can easily provide\
    \ general averaged information. The spatial resolution of the images \nplays a\
    \ preeminent role in vineyard variability sensing and understanding. \nIn the\
    \ present work, vineyard variability is evaluated through vegetation indices,\
    \ which were estimated taking advantage of \nmultispectral images at different\
    \ resolutions, from Planet Scope, RapidEye and Sentinel 2 satellites respectively\
    \ providing 3, 5 \nand 10 meters pixel sizes. The experimentation took place in\
    \ a 5 hectares vineyard located in Northern part of Italy. Data were \ncompared\
    \ with UAV images, opportunely re-sampled in order to fit the spatial resolution\
    \ of different considered satellites. The \ncomparison was carried out considering\
    \ references statistical parameters calculated on the basis of spectral images.\
    \ Fast Fourier \ntransform, and root mean square was been considered to exploit\
    \ differences and relation between sources images. \nData Management System for\

    \ Department of Rural Engineering, University of Cordoba, Spain \nOlive harvesting\
    \ is usually carried out by trunk shakers, mainly for intensive olive orchards.\
    \ The lack of tracking systems adapted \nfor olive harvesting purposes lead this\
    \ crop to have a gap of information that makes difficult to develop new harvesting\
    \ \ntechnologies based on knowledge. Machinery tracking provides a highly useful\
    \ data flow that enhances decision making \nprocesses for olive growers and technicians\
    \ but gathered data should be automatically processed. Tests were performed on\
    \ an \nintensive olive orchard 7 by 5 m spacing. Machine remote monitoring platform\
    \ (MRMP) was mounted on a straddle harvester \nprototype based on trunk shaking.\
    \ MRMP consist on pressure switch that detected when the harvester was shaking.\
    \ This sensor \nsent information to a modem that includes GPS to determine harvester\
    \ position sending information by a GSM/GPRS unit to a \nhost control platform.\
    \ Automatic time study methodology was also developed to analyze gathered data\
    \ attending to time element \nsize, harvester position or time element sequence.\
    \ Based on these criteria, time elements were classified enabling harvester \n\
    performance analysis. Basically, harvester work cycle consists on trunk shaking\
    \ (13.4 ± 8.8 s), displacement between trees (30.8 \n± 13.5 s), turnings (351\
    \ ± 187 s) and fruit unload (229.7 ± 116.5 s) (mean ± standard deviation). Moreover,\
    \ time element size was \nmapped separating shaking time from other time elements\
    \ in order to provide spatial information at a glance. Straddle harvester \nprototype\
    \ showed a theoretical and effective field capacity of 0.46 and 0.23 ha h-1 respectively.\
    \ However, it is expected that this \nharvesting system improve its performance\
    \ after pre-commercial tests therefore, potential field capacity could reach 0.37\
    \ ha h-1 \nin optimal field conditions. Finally, olive integral harvesting could\
    \ reduce labour requirements increasing olive sector \ncompetitiveness along with\
    \ tracking systems, which make possible to enhance decision making processes for\
    \ agricultural \npurposes. \nRobotic Systems for Monitoring in Open Fields  \n\

    \ for agricultural crops and an indirect indicator of potential production. Especially\
    \ when measured \nover the growing season it characterizes plant health in phenotyping\
    \ or precision agriculture applications. Plant height can be \ndefined as the\
    \ distance from ground level to the tallest leaf. However, measuring crop height\
    \ in phenotyping experiments is time-\nconsuming and costly, so there is a need\
    \ for new sensing technologies capturing plant height and other architectural\
    \ traits in an \nautomated manner. \nIn recent years, Light Detection And Ranging\
    \ (LiDAR) systems have shown the potential to revolutionise crop structural \n\
    characterisation by providing very high-resolution 3D data. LiDAR systems operated\
    \ from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have \nnow become available with sufficient\
    \ point densities (up to 1000-2000 points per m2) to characterize the complex\
    \ structure of \nagricultural crops. This study presents the first results of\
    \ the RIEGL RICOPTER with the VUX®-1UAV airborne laser scanning \nsystem for agricultural\
    \ applications. During the 2017 growing season we scanned a number of fields with\
    \ different crops: wheat, \n \n \n \n58 \nquinoa, grassland, and a fruit tree\
    \ nursery. Some fields were scanned several times to capture the structural development\
    \ of the \ncrop. Around the time of LiDAR acquisition, manual crop height measurements\
    \ were made for validation. From the point clouds \nof the UAV based LiDAR measurements,\
    \ we derived Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and\
    \ finally \nCanopy Height Models (CHMs). In general, comparison of field measured\
    \ canopy height and CHMS showed good agreement. \nIn addition, the spatial datasets\
    \ from UAV based LiDAR allowed characterization of height distributions within\
    \ experimental plots \nand captured the spatial variation of crop height over\
    \ the complete field. As a next step we are investigating opportunities to use\
    \ \nthe UAV-borne LiDAR point cloud for explicit 3D modelling of individual plants\
    \ to characterize plant architectural traits. \nDevelopment Of Autonomous Robotic\

    \ are made from a two small leaf \nstage up to the final stage just before harvesting\
    \ task. \nTwo robotic devices were used to make colorimetric and geometrical measurements\

    \ IES, Université Montpellier \nIn recent years, the use of phytosanitary inputs\
    \ is a touchstone issue in the agricultural sector. The fact is, when pesticides\
    \ are \napplied to crops, some spray drops fail to reach their target, which go\
    \ on to contaminate the outer regions of the treated area. \nThis off-target issue\
    \ can cause environmental, health and economic problems. \nBy estimating off-target\
    \ volumes, spraying quality could be optimized and thus help farmers improve their\
    \ planting performances. \nThis work purposes to develop an optical sensor based\
    \ on a RIB waveguide design in order to characterize the quantity and \ndistribution\
    \ of a liquid spray deposit. We have assumed that the light guidance properties\
    \ of these sensors would undergo a \nmodification when spraying droplets are deposited\
    \ on their surface. This phenomenon results from partial evanescent wave \nabsorption\
    \ by the water present in the pesticides which leads to a decrease in the transmitted\
    \ intensity at the waveguide output. \nUsing different droplet volumes (0 to 10\
    \ µl), we studied the influence of a range of deposits at the guide center. The\
    \ result was a \ngradual decrease in the output intensity signal due to the water\
    \ absorbtion of the evanescent field, and this proportionally to the \ndroplet\
    \ volume; the bigger the droplet, the greater the loss in output intensity. \n\
    In addition, we performed a second test by successively adding 2.5 µl droplets\
    \ on the waveguide to analyze their cumulative \ninfluence. The results obtained\
    \ showed that the decrease in output intensity is also proportionally related\
    \ to the number of \ndroplets. \nTo conclude, these first results demonstrate\
    \ the potential of RIB waveguide sensors to accurately quantify droplet deposits.\
    \ Our \nfuture work should focus on improving the waveguide architecture in order\
    \ to estimate deposited volumes and also the number \nof deposited droplets. \n\

    \ employs simple and \naffordable sensors (RGB camera) and processes raw images\

    \ In order to test the \nrobustness of this approach aerial surveys were conducted\
    \ over different growing stages and field treatments. \nThe results suggest that\

    \ Labour is costly, physically demanding and \nincreasingly scarce. Robotic automation\
    \ of apple picking has been explored already for over 30 years, but is not sufficiently\

    \ some tasks than robots, a human-robot collaboration \ncould be a better intermediate\

    \ suitable for \nmechanization. An aspect that has been often disregarded, and\
    \ which may greatly contribute to ease mechanisation. \nThe objective of this\
    \ research is to develop and test a proof-of-principle of a teleoperated apple-picking\

    \ against set requirements of picking performance (apple picking \ntime), and\
    \ of user experience like seamlessness and enjoyability, or low physical demand.\
    \ The overall system approach proved \nrather interesting for testing users and\

    \ The robot is remotely driven and provided with different \nproximal sensing\

    \ the data acquisition, which is synchronised with the advance of the robot by\
    \ means of a pulse encoder \ncoupled to the axis of the motor. Then, crop maps\
    \ can be created off-line after the analysis of the collected data to show \n\
    graphically potential Xf infection in the trees. Owing to the height of the olive\
    \ trees inspected, the cameras were placed on a \nplatform that can be raised\
    \ up to 200 cm. Two batteries power the electric motors attached to the wheels,\
    \ thereby allowing a \ncomplete inspection of a field of approximately 4 ha. A\
    \ series of tests have been carried out in an olive orchard showing slight \n\
    symptoms of Xf infection in the region of Apulia, southern Italy. During the first\
    \ tests, the robot inspected each row in both \ndirections with the cameras pointing\
    \ to one side, so as to inspect both sides of the trees. The tests were mainly\
    \ focused on the \ndevelopment of the mechanics, navigation systems, sensors and\

    \ and grading system was developed, which mainly \nconsists of a fruit singulating\
    \ and rotating mechanism, imaging chamber, and rotary sorter. The sorting system\
    \ is able to sort and \ngrade apples for color and size (with the defect sorting\
    \ function being incorporated soon) at a speed up to 9 fruit/s, and its \nsingulating\
    \ and rotating mechanism enables the digital camera to acquire 8-15 images for\
    \ each fruit for complete surface feature \nanalysis. Automatic filling of harvested\
    \ apples into individual bins without causing bruise to the apples is critical\
    \ to the overall \nsystem design. An innovative, simple bin filling system was\
    \ developed, which employs a pair of foam rollers coupled with rotating \nsoft\
    \ panels for easy, gentle handling of sorted fruit in the bin. Laboratory and\
    \ field tests showed that the new bin filler can meet \nthe industry’s requirement\

    \ of the machine were \ncarried out in the two harvest seasons of 2016 and 2017,\
    \ and results showed that the machine has met our initial design goals \nin performance.\
    \ Adoption of the technology will help apple growers achieve significant labor\

    \ factors characterizing soils’ quality and health and \nconsequently affecting\
    \ agricultural productivity. Additionally, soil is the second largest C pool with\
    \ an estimated storage capacity \nof 1500 Pg C. Since soil is not a static reservoir,\
    \ SOC estimation is of great use to ensure adequate agricultural production \n\
    combined with sustainable soil management practices for climate change adaptation\
    \ and mitigation. However, even if laboratory \nanalytical methods for SOC content\

    \ cannot be \nof use for large scale SOC measurements. To that end, more efficient,\
    \ rapid, non-destructive and cost-effective estimations need \nto be developed\

    \ revised methodologies, (ii) \nupdated remote and proximal sensing methods and\
    \ (iii) simplified field information that could be used for SOC estimation, since\
    \ \nthere is still lack of a common measuring protocol with mutual acceptable\

    During the development of a device for fully automated attachment of supporting\
    \ wires in hop gardens, a dependency between \nthe area capacity, efficiency and\
    \ roughness of the soil surface was analysed using a simplified 3D model of the\
    \ device. Since \nmost of the hop gardens are not designed for mechanised attaching\
    \ of supporting wires, often prevail suboptimal conditions, \ncausing difficulties\
    \ during the application and consequently increasing the number of outages. The\
    \ malfunctioning can be caused \nby the inertia of machine components as well\
    \ as due the inadequate sensor technology. To solve this problem implementation\
    \ of \nadditional sensors and improvement of the mechatronic systems on the device\
    \ can be striven for. Furthermore, the analysis of \nthe working conditions, especially\
    \ the preparation of the path including the soil roughness, which influences the\
    \ achieved area \ncapacity and the quality of the attached wires are required\
    \ in order to achieve further improvements. In both cases, the \ndocumentation\
    \ of the occurring errors and the failure reasons during the testing is necessary.\
    \ \nThe paper highlights the design of an experiment in which a 2D LIDAR has been\
    \ used for measuring the configuration of the \nterrain (fixed lanes) immediately\
    \ before the application of the device for wire attaching. The questions considering\
    \ the optimal \nposition of the LIDAR, the measured data correction based on the\
    \ information considering the roll, pitch and yaw angle of the \nLIDAR, as well\
    \ as the measured accelerations will be analysed. Furthermore, the optimal way\
    \ of data fusion will be analysed. It \nis expected that the data with adequate\
    \ resolution combined with the information about the outage should provide more\
    \ detailed \ninsights considering the influence of the conditions which caused\
    \ the outages and thus support the decision making to choose \nthe optimal strategy\

    1Agro Intelligence Aps, Denmark; 2Aarhus University, Department of Engineering;\
    \ 3Aarhus University, Department of \nAgroecology; 4Newcastle University, Department\
    \ of Computing \nWithin the last decade, an increased focus in the agricultural\
    \ industry is drawn towards autonomously driving field robots. When \nremoving\
    \ the driver from a field operation, the human sense of machine dynamics and operation\
    \ accuracy must be replaced with \na robust steering control system of the robot.\
    \ The steering of an autonomously driving robot consists of a multiple of sensors\
    \ and \nactuators. \nTo accommodate a wide range of field operations, a flexible\
    \ design is preferable. Flexible in terms of changing width and mass \ndue to\
    \ the varying nature of the specific implements and tools within the working width\
    \ of the robot. From an engineering point of \n \n \n \n61 \nview, a flexible\
    \ design yields changing machine and controller dynamics which has a significant\
    \ impact on the performance in \nterms of following the desired path. \nThis issue\
    \ is addressed by modelling and co-simulating a Continuous Time (CT-model) of\
    \ the machine dynamics of the robot \nwith a Discrete Event (DE-model) of the\
    \ steering controller. \nInitial simulations show that changing the parameters\
    \ of the machine or controller directly influences the overall performance of\
    \ \nthe robot. This indicates that an optimized controller tuning can be found\
    \ corresponding to the particular machine design. These \noptimized controller\
    \ settings have been identified using Design Space Exploration (DSE) which provides\
    \ a structured way of \nperforming a large number of co-simulations. In this case,\
    \ DSE is applied to investigate the performance of the robot by evaluating \n\
    a number of simulated trajectories. \nThe results of this study show how a model-based\
    \ approach to investigate such issues can be applied efficiently using DSE. This\
    \ \napproach is shown to provide valuable results and knowledge about the robot\
    \ in the early stages of the product development \ncycle. \nIntegrated Study of\

    \ pepper harvesting in greenhouse. The robot has five major components: a six-degree-of-\n\
    freedom robot manipulator, a harvesting end effector, a machine vision system,\
    \ a mobile-platform which was modified from \nelectric powered lift-platform-truck,\
    \ and a control system which employs LabVIEW software package to control and monitor\
    \ the \nharvesting processes. The machine vision system uses two color cameras\
    \ to capture the image of targeted sweet pepper, and \ndetermines the position\
    \ and orientation of its stalk through imagine processing techniques. The end-effector\
    \ is a two-finger gripper \ninstalled with a set of cutting blade on one side\
    \ of the fingers, and with sponge pads on inner side of both fingers. It was designed\
    \ \nto grip and cut the stalk of the targeted sweet pepper, and secure the cut-off\
    \ pepper between padded fingers with no damage. A \nprimary test using 58 plastic\
    \ sweet pepper models with 1500 x1500 mm simulated vertical harvesting zone and\
    \ 500x500 mm \nimagine shot was conducted to check the essential functions of\
    \ the developed robot. The success harvest rate was 93.7%. \nAnother practical\
    \ performance test which harvested 42 peppers with real sweet pepper plants in\
    \ simulated greenhouse cultivating \nsetup resulted in 81% success rate. Out of\
    \ 8 failed cases, 5 was unable to accurately identify the position of the pepper\
    \ stalk; 1 \nwas cutting fail, and the other 2 dropped off when was transferred\
    \ to collecting basket. The time for harvesting one pepper is \nabout 21.8 seconds.\
    \ The developed robot proved to be feasible and practical for automatic sweet\

    \ Consequently, occasionally windmills or \nPV-plants in Germany need to be switch\

    \ energy for \nseasonal fluctuations. On the other hand, looking at the current\
    \ findings about diesel emissions, the conversion of a surplus of \nelectricity\
    \ into fuel, which is less toxic, would be very convenient. Methanol has already\
    \ been proven to be less polluting and its´ \nenergy density at ambient conditions\
    \ equals to 4.4 kWh/l and in contrast to hydrogen, which energy density at 700\
    \ bar equals to \n1.4 kWh/l, makes methanol an interesting alternative. \nAs a\

    \ An \ninvestigating on 14 farms was done to evaluate performance of PV pumping\

    \ systems to photovoltaic was tested and a power management method was \nproposed\
    \ to set parallel pumps instead of using a single pump for the same installed\
    \ equivalent power. The method improved \nperformances of the PV pumping system\
    \ as synchronization between hydraulic and actual irradiance behaviors were searched.\
    \ \nEvaluation showed that use of three small pumps in parallel improved hydraulic\

    \ meadows and grasslands. \nAt the same time, biogas plants with crop-based substrates\
    \ are looking for alternative substrates to adapt to EU RED and to \nincrease\
    \ profitability. Unutilized silage that would not otherwise be used for feed can\
    \ be an excellent biogas substrate, but the \nmaterial is often coarse and pretreatment\
    \ is necessary. This project was performed as a case study to substitute 20% of\
    \ the crop-\nbased substrate used today (maize, whole-crop silage and grain) with\
    \ unutilized silage bales for the Jordberga biogas plant in \nthe south of Sweden.\
    \ \nThree different mobile machines for disintegration of silage bales were used\
    \ in practical trials to evaluate which was most effective \nat reducing particle\
    \ length and damaging the structure of the grass for improved digestion. Two of\
    \ the machines used a \nhammermill technique for disintegration and the third\
    \ used knife rotors. Test results were evaluated regarding particle length, \n\
    particle structure, energy consumption and capacity. Costs were calculated for\
    \ the handling system of the bales from the farm or \nstorage site to the processing\
    \ unit for disintegration and then to the digester. \nAll three machines managed,\
    \ to different extent, to reduce particle length and damage the structure of the\
    \ grass. For a good \nestimation of the capacity and fuel consumption further\
    \ tests are needed. The purchase of bales and transport to the plant are \nthe\
    \ largest costs in the system. It is therefore crucial for the interest of the\
    \ biogas plants to use bales if they can have them \ndelivered for free at the\
    \ gate. If and how much the biogas plant is prepared to pay for the bales is also\
    \ highly dependent on how \nthe silage quality affects the methane yield potential.\

    \ energy production is worked out. For \nthat the feeding amount and composition\
    \ of available substrates is adapted to the energy demand. Within batch experiments\
    \ the \nkinetic and degradation of different substrates are examined to identify\
    \ the optimum feeding strategy. \nThe experiments will show that the substrates\
    \ have got a different biogas production rate and reaction time. Also it will\
    \ be \npresented that it is possible to cover the residual load rises with an\
    \ intelligent feeding of a biogas plant. For these simulations a \nload profile\
    \ of the region Emden was used. With adapting the substrate composition and amount\
    \ this profile could be nearly \ncompletely covered. According to the substrate\
    \ a contemporary increase of the gas amount could be reached. All in all the results\

    \ on mass balance calculations over 120 days in 2017. During this period, amounts\
    \ of raw \nmaterial into the plant were recorded. At the same time, samples were\

    \ The amount and composition of biogas were also registered. During this period,\

    \ The average methane yield was 453 \nNm3 CH4/tonnes VS at a degradation rate\
    \ of approx. 57% of VS. The methane discharge in the plant was measured at 2.9%\

    \ of the energy produced as methane, and heat recovery \nusing heat pumps was\
    \ equivalent to 37% of the power consumed. The production of methane for fuel\

    \ of Tractors  \nTractor Driveline Efficiency Evaluation Taking into Account Power\
    \ Lost in Slippage. \nMaurizio Cutini, Massimo Brambilla, Carlo Bisaglia \nCREA-IT,\
    \ Italy \nThe primary purpose of agricultural tractors is to perform drawbar work\
    \ that is mathematically defined by the pull force (kN) and \nforward speed (km\
    \ h-1) of the tractor-tool assembly. An ideal tractor converts all the fuel energy\
    \ into useful work at the drawbar: \nthis implies the maximization of both engine\
    \ fuel and drivetrain mechanical efficiencies allowing the optimization of tractive\
    \ \nadvantage by selecting an optimum travel speed for any given operation. \n\
    The adoption of OECD Code 2 for drawbar power and fuel consumption assessment\
    \ if, on the one hand, allows obtaining \ncomparable data (measurements are carried\
    \ out at maximum engine power), on the other one opens the issue that tractors\
    \ \nmaximum drawbar power changes with gear or speed. \nTo deepen such knowledge,\
    \ the data of 100 tractors of different power and weight, obtained following the\
    \ OECD Code 2, were \nanalysed with the aim of evaluating the specific driveline\
    \ efficiency (the driveline power net to losses due to slippage). The whole \n\
    dataset underwent Linear Regression Analysis (LRA) aimed at pointing out the relations\
    \ between the power at the drawbar and \nthe losses due to slippage in accordance\
    \ with the following equation: \n \n \n \n66 \nPdb=α•PPTO-β•Pvd•-Ps \nwhere: \n\
    - Pdb is the power at the drawbar (measured); \n- α is the driveline efficiency\
    \ coefficient (assessed); \n- PPTO is the maximum power at the Power Take Off\
    \ (PTO; measured); \n- β·Pvd•defines the power used for the displacement of the\
    \ vehicle (calculated as weight and speed): in it β is the motion \nresistance\
    \ ratio expected to result ≈0.04 as reported in the ASABE standard; \n- Ps is\
    \ the power lost for slip. \nAccording to results, driveline efficiency coefficient\
    \ (α) turned out to be 0.93. This value was tested against an independent \ndataset\
    \ pointing out that the model achieved optimal levels of efficiency and accuracy\
    \ with R2 = 0.98. \nPreliminary Study On Traction Efficiency of an Agricultural\
    \ Tractor Equipped With an Extendable Ballast \nHolder \nMassimiliano Varani,\
    \ Michele Mattetti, Giovanni Molari \nUniversità di Bologna, Italy \nIn the last\
    \ decades, agricultural tractor optimization was the main topic of countless studies.\
    \ In fact, a more efficient tractor leads \nto higher durability and reduced energy\
    \ losses, thus saving on fuel consumption. In particular, many studies were conducted\
    \ on \nthe optimal weight distribution among tractor front and rear axles because\
    \ this aspect deeply influences traction efficiency. \nTherefore, in recent years\
    \ some agricultural machinery manufacturers tried to develop innovative ballast\
    \ systems to obtain the \nmaximum traction efficiency in every field operation\
    \ and soil condition. One example of these innovative ballast systems is a \n\
    special ballast holder that could be installed both on front or rear three point\
    \ hitch, able to move the ballast up to 1 m over its \noriginal position in the\
    \ longitudinal direction. This movement is granted by a mechanical linkage actuated\
    \ by the tractor hydraulic \nsystem. The aim of this paper is the tractive performance\
    \ comparison of a tractor equipped with this special ballast holder between \n\
    its two extreme configurations, device fully closed and device fully extended.\
    \ Field tests were performed on a loam soil with a \n4WD tractor with a maximum\
    \ engine power of 194 kW and a ballasted weight of 9590 kg. With each ballast\
    \ holder configuration, \ndrawbar tests were carried out by towing another tractor\
    \ with similar weight as a loading unit. Tractor operating parameters were \n\
    acquired through a CAN-Bus data logger, while drawbar pull and speed were acquired\
    \ respectively with a load cell and a GPS \nreceiver. The analysis of the results\
    \ shows that a higher traction efficiency was reached with the device in the fully\
    \ extended \nconfiguration, especially in high slip condition. The obtained results\
    \ confirm that the tractor weight distribution on the axles \ninfluence its traction\
    \ efficiency. \nAgricultural Tire Energy Efficiency Test Method and Dedicated\

    \ \nSustainable way of agriculture is one of the fundamental pieces of our viable\

    \ The ENTAM as the European Network of Testing stations of \nAgricultural Machines\
    \ and equipment has settled up a new ENTAM Technical Working Group in order to\
    \ draft a common \nmethodology to test the agricultural tire energy efficiency,\
    \ in close cooperation with Michelin. The aim was to find an easy still a \nrepresentative\
    \ measurement method with reproducible records on real agricultural fields, in\
    \ standardized soil conditions. A novel \ndedicated equipment has been built which\
    \ uniquely provides the possibility to measure dimensionless tire performance\
    \ indices \nin a standardized way. The prototype covers a wide range of tire dimensions\
    \ and is capable of applying large vertical loads and \ndrive torques. In the\
    \ practice it will play a key role to determine optimal tire settings and can\
    \ decisively contribute to the sustainable \nway of agricultural practice. \n\
    Fuel Consumption Analysis Of Real-World Measurements \nMichele Mattetti1, Riccardo\
    \ Molinari1, Eugenio Sereni2, Giovanni Molari1 \n1University of Bologna, Italy;\
    \ 2CNH Industrial SpA \nThe trend in agriculture is toward more sustainable and\
    \ efficient crop productions. The efficiency of a crop production can be \nevaluated\
    \ as a ratio of between energy costs and crop yield. The highest energy cost is\
    \ that of mechanization fuel consumption. \nThis information is usually estimated\
    \ with empirical formulas. The most commonly adopted formula was established by\
    \ the ASAE \nand it was derived from the Nebraska Tractor Test reports. The procedure\
    \ that developed those reports are based on constant \nload tests, but tractors,\
    \ under real field activities, operate with variable loads and therefore, concerns\
    \ can be made in using this \nformula. Nowadays, due to the widespread integration\
    \ of CAN-BUS, much information is easily available from any modern tractors \n\
    and they can be used for an exact estimation of tractor fuel consumption. The\
    \ aim of this paper was the collection and the analysis \nof fuel consumption\
    \ data acquired under real operating conditions. A large fleet of tractors of\
    \ the same family were used in \ndifferent farms for cultivation. Tractors operated\
    \ with different cultivators (i.e. different working width and depth, tool type,\
    \ etc) \nand worked on different soils and land profiles. On each tractor, a CAN-Bus\
    \ data logger was installed and the following operating \nparameters were acquired:\
    \ engine torque and speed; vehicle speed; and fuel consumption. For each tractor,\
    \ data were acquired \nfor an hour. From the acquired signals, power requirements\
    \ and frequency plots were calculated for each acquisition and all the \ndata\
    \ were statistically analysed. The data analysis revealed that in-field average\
    \ engine power is limited to the 75% of the \nmaximum engine power due to the\
    \ fact the implement draft is highly variable. Moreover, the in-field fuel consumption\
    \ varies from \ntractor to tractor due to the fact each tractor was used with\
    \ different power demand by the driver. \n \n \n \n \n \n67 \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\

    \ Emissions of Various Triggered Milk Logistic Chains \nMichael Schmid, Sascha\
    \ Wörz, Heinz Bernhardt, Omar Hijazi \nChair of Agricultural Systems Engineering,\
    \ Germany \nThis paper copes with the full costs and the carbon emission rates\
    \ of a milk supply chain between milk producers and dairy \nprocessor, where two\
    \ different milk logistic chains and three different milk collection cycles are\
    \ considered. The optimization \ntriggered milk chain and its process variant\
    \ requires a monetary valuation of the milk collection cycles and different milk\
    \ logistic \nchains. This contribution aims at determining the full costs and\
    \ the carbon emission rates of a milk supply chain during a period \nof six days\
    \ for a one-, two-, and three-day triggered milk chain. Exemplarily, the various\
    \ triggered marginal costs are estimated \nfor two milk logistic chains and two\
    \ milk draw areas. The cost calculation of various triggered milk logistic chains\
    \ uses full cost \naccounting. The carbon emission rates are determined by the\
    \ consumption-based method. The unique full cost accounting and \ncarbon emission\
    \ rates of the triggered milk chains and the various process variants differ.\
    \ The analysis of the individual scenarios \nconstitutes an indicator for the\
    \ payment to the milk producer of a various triggered and processed milk chain\

    \ of Raw Milk From 12000 Individual Dutch Dairy Farms \nJeroen Hospers1, Sanne\

    \ The Netherlands; 2Wageningen University & Research, Livestock Research, \nWageningen,\
    \ the Netherlands; 3Wageningen University & Research, Farm Systems Ecology, Wageningen\
    \ , The Netherlands \nRaw milk production is estimated to contribute to 4 percent\
    \ of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, global \nand\
    \ national targets are set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions\
    \ from dairy farming. \nThe aim of this study was to explore greenhouse gas mitigation\
    \ potential of the Dutch dairy sector by evaluating the magnitude \nand cause\
    \ of variation in carbon footprints of raw milk from 12000 Dutch dairy farms.\
    \ Carbon footprints were analyzed for \nindividual Dutch dairy farms using life\
    \ cycle assessment. Farm specific Life Cycle Inventory data were retrieved from\
    \ a national \ndatabase. \nResults show that the average carbon footprint per\
    \ kg FPCM was 1247 gram CO2-equivalents/kg FPCM, with 90 percent of \ncarbon footprints\
    \ ranging from 1014 to 1640 grams CO2-eq/kg FPCM. The distribution of all carbon\
    \ footprints showed to be \npositively skewed. Stratification of data showed that\
    \ this is caused by higher carbon footprints of milk from dairy farms with peat\
    \ \nsoils. On average enteric methane emissions, manure storage emissions, roughage\
    \ production at farm and production of \npurchased resources accounted for 493,\
    \ 186, 161, 406 grams of CO2-eq/kg FPCM respectively. The relative contribution\
    \ \nindividual processes to total carbon footprint of milk, however, varied between\
    \ farms. The carbon footprint of raw milk was \ncorrelated positively and most\
    \ strongly with the share of on-farm peat soils, the grazing period of dairy cows\
    \ and soil nitrogen \nsurpluses. Negative correlations were found with feed efficiency,\
    \ milk production per cow and the amount of maize fed. \nThis study showed that\
    \ large variation between carbon footprints of raw milk from individual Dutch\
    \ dairy farms exists. Carbon \nfootprint varies with soil type and individual\
    \ farm characteristics. Results indicate that mitigation potential exist for all\
    \ dairy farms \nand a farm system approach is needed to develop most effective\
    \ mitigation programs for dairy farms. \nEconomic Comparison and Carbon Emissions\
    \ of Payload Optimized Milk Logistic Chains \nMichael Schmid, Sascha Wörz, Heinz\
    \ Bernhardt \nChair of Agricultural Systems Engineering, Germany \nThis contribution\
    \ copes with the optimization of the payload and carbon emission rates in milk\
    \ logistic chains between milk \nproducers and dairy processor by full cost accounting,\
    \ where two different milk logistic chains and two different milk draw areas \n\
    are examined. The use of a milk transport truck and its profitability requires\
    \ a monetary and carbon emissions valuation between \ndifferent triggered milk\
    \ chains and its payloads. This contribution aims at determining the full costs\
    \ and carbon emission rates for \nfive different payload scenarios. Exemplarily,\
    \ the various payload marginal costs are calculated for two milk logistic chains\
    \ and \ntwo milk draw areas. The cost calculation of payload triggered logistic\
    \ chains uses full cost accounting. The carbon emission \nrates are determined\
    \ by the consumption-based method. Thereby, the full cost accounting and the carbon\
    \ emission rates differ \nand increase with the decrease of the payload and increasing\
    \ distances between milk producer and milk processing company. \nStudying payload\
    \ triggered milk logistic chains and carbon emissions is beneficial for strategical\
    \ consulting and decision-making \nwhen thinking of milk removers from the viewpoint\
    \ of a dairy processor. \nTechnology for Efficient Application of Liquid Manure:\
    \ A Comprehensive Modelling Approach on \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions \nBianca Zerhusen,\
    \ Fabian Lichti, Stefan Neser \nBavarian State Research Centre for Agriculture,\
    \ Germany \nThe goal of this study is to describe all effects of liquid manure\
    \ application technologies on greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions at \nfarm level.\
    \ A literature review showed, that despite the existence of a big number of research\
    \ done in this field, there is still a lack \nof understanding overall ghg emission\
    \ dynamics. As there is a big uncertainty in predicting nitrous oxide emissions\
    \ and so far \nnone of the field studies included the full set of relevant pathways\
    \ of nitrogen loss and all influencing factors (e.g. location factors), \nthe\
    \ current work aims to analyse and describe coherences and the range of possible\
    \ manifestations rather than derive absolute \nnumbers for ghg emission reductions\
    \ through liquid manure application technology. A modelling approach was developed\
    \ to \nshow self-enforcing and counteractive influences using values of diverse\
    \ studies. The results highlight different forces that need \nto be considered\
    \ to achieve a ghg emission reduction. Furthermore results show which framework\
    \ conditions promote or hinder \nthe implementation of liquid manure application\
    \ technology at farm level. The liquid manure application technology provides\
    \ a \nbig potential to reduce ghg emissions. The efficiency of liquid fertilizers\
    \ due to application close to the soil and roots can be \nexpressed by the mineral\
    \ fertilizer equivalent. Such high efficiencies can be accounted for in ghg modelling\
    \ by savings of manure \nthat are available for fertilization elsewhere and replace\
    \ mineral fertilizers there. Our findings emphasise, that to ensure a ghg \n \n\
    \ \n \n68 \nemission reduction through the use of liquid manure application technology,\
    \ it should go hand in hand with a reduction of manure \ninput, being the biggest\
    \ control variable in ghg modelling. From the found results the conclusion can\
    \ be drawn, that ghg modelling \nneeds to address manifold effects to develop\
    \ functional ghg mitigation strategies and not to mislead by monocausal findings.\

    \ of biomass harvesting and transporting from the uprooting of a peach tree orchard\
    \ placed in the surroundings of Ravenna \n(Emilia-Romagna, Italy).Trees were planted\
    \ in a low-density orchard, spaced at 3.5 m along rows and 6.0 m between rows,\
    \ at \n476 plants ha-1 (the total area was 1.96 ha).The biomass collection chain\

    \ a +35.7% increase in working time. The collection system was also found to affect\
    \ the quality of \nthe supplied biofuel following the cleaning of root biomass\
    \ from soil residues. \nThis study shows the importance of a specific set up of\
    \ the logistic chain related to the recovery of orchards stumps that should \n\

    \ \nThe parameters on mechanized operations were logged using a remotely data\

    \ by energy analysis. The CO2 fixed was a transformation of yields. Two parameters\
    \ were defined: \nCO2 Efficiency (CE): CO2 emitted/CO2 fixed. Carbon Productivity\
    \ (CP): Kg of yield/each kg of CO2 emitted. \nThe results showed how the applications\
    \ of BMPs improved yields, which increased on average of 32% with respect CF.\
    \ As more \nBMPs were implemented, the CO2 emissions were reduced. The higher\
    \ diminution respect to CF was 32% (treatment 5), and \nthe average of all BMPs\

    \ to be needed for scallion production. Chemical fertilizer was attributed the\
    \ \nlargest amount of energy consumption. The economic analysis showed the total\
    \ cost of scallion production was 4461.49 $ ha-1 \nand the highest cost of scallion\
    \ production system belonged to the human labor. Moreover, the benefit to cost\
    \ ratio was calculated \nto be 4.03. The energy indices of energy use efficiency,\

    \ Spain \nThe Segura River basin, in south-eastern Spain, is one of the areas\
    \ with the highest water scarcity, not only in Spain but also in \nEurope. As\
    \ a result, in such a region, farmers can have up to six different water supply\
    \ sources for irrigation (surface water, \ngroundwater, reclaimed water, desalinated\
    \ brackish groundwater, desalinated seawater and inter-basin Tagus-Segura water\
    \ \ntransfer). Moreover, water reallocation by water trading between concession\
    \ holders is also possible (i.e. water markets), which \nin practice represents\
    \ an additional water supply source. Water markets are one of the most promising\
    \ instruments for reallocating \nwater resources in mature water economies since\
    \ they are capable of increasing the economic efficiency of water use and \nreducing\
    \ the economic impact of scarcity. This paper analyses the environmental impacts\
    \ of production of a representative lemon \norchard irrigated with each one of\
    \ the water supply sources above mentioned. Lemon has been selected as it is the\
    \ perennial \ncrop with a greater area in the basin. A life cycle assessment was\
    \ used to quantify the lemon orchard global warming potential, \nacidification\
    \ of land and water, eutrophication potential, land use and cumulative energy\
    \ demand. The system boundary was \nconsidered from raw material extraction to\
    \ farm-gate based on lemon production.The results showed large variation in the\
    \ \nindicators. As expected, irrigation with desalinated seawater showed the highest\
    \ value of global warming potential and cumulative \nenergy demand, which is justified\
    \ by the high-energy requirements to produce desalinated seawater and also for\
    \ higher \nimplementation of calcium and magnesium fertilization. In addition,\
    \ the analysed environmental indicators of water markets \nresources with the\
    \ basin were similar to those of the inter-basin Tagus-Segura water transfer.\

    \ temperature increase \nand greenhouse gas emission of Co2 uses different sources\
    \ in the period of 2000-2017 and then regression equations were used \nin the\

    \ di Torino, Italy \nIn last years, the adoption of monitoring systems also in\
    \ animal houses has increased the amount of data that are available for \nthe\
    \ farmers. A correct analysis of those data could mean more information about\
    \ the farm that could help to improve the \nmanagement of the production, to maximize\
    \ the profit and to guarantee the animal welfare. The continuous monitoring of\
    \ indoor \nclimate conditions is interesting because the productivity can be strongly\
    \ affected by environmental parameters that are not \nadequate to the reared species.\
    \ \nIn this work, the results obtained from an environmental and energy monitoring\
    \ campaign carried out in two fattening pig houses \nare presented. The measurements\
    \ were performed during two production cycles and take about one year. For the\
    \ environmental \nmonitoring, the two buildings were equipped with temperature\
    \ and relative humidity data loggers (10 minutes logging time) that \nwere placed\
    \ in various spots inside the house. Outdoor data (air temperature, relative humidity\
    \ and solar radiation) were obtained \nthrough a weather station located next\
    \ to the test site. Concerning the energy monitoring, 3-Phase kW Power Transducers\
    \ (10 \nseconds logging time) were placed in the electric panel of each house\
    \ in order to log the electrical energy consumptions of both \nthe houses due\
    \ to ventilation, lighting and automatic feeding. Data regarding the reared animals\
    \ (e.g. final live weight, feed \nconversion ratio and mortality) were provided\
    \ by the farmer. \nThe obtained data were used for mapping the temperatures inside\
    \ the houses, for evaluating the electrical energy consumption \nrelated to indoor/outdoor\
    \ air temperatures and for comparing the indoor air temperature values with values\
    \ provided in literature. \nFurthermore, the obtained data were used for individuating\
    \ potential heat stress conditions of the pigs that could cause production \n\

    \ Politecnico di Torino, Italy; 2DISAFA, Università di Torino, Italy \nThe promotion\
    \ of a sustainable agriculture is between the Sustainable Development Goals set\
    \ by United Nations that should be \nachieved before 2030. To reach this target,\
    \ particular attention has to be paid to the rational use of energy in livestock\
    \ sector. \nIntensive animal farms are characterized by high energy consumption,\
    \ especially for the control of the climate that can consume \nup to 140 kWhth∙m-2∙K-1\
    \ in broiler houses, representing 96% of the total thermal energy consumption.\
    \ Even though energy \nneeded for climate control entails a considerable energy\
    \ consumption and running cost of livestock houses, currently neither \nlegislation\
    \ nor calculation methods about this energy consumption exist. \nEPAnHaus project\
    \ aimed at establish an energy certification scheme for livestock houses that\
    \ considers the energy uses due to \nclimate control (heating, cooling and ventilation).\
    \ The objective was reached through three steps. First, an inventory of the energy\
    \ \nuses for climate control of livestock houses in Europe was done to obtain\
    \ benchmark values. Second, a calculation method in \ncompliance with international\
    \ standards on the energy performance of buildings was customized to develop a\
    \ simulation model \nfor the estimation of the energy consumption, in particular\
    \ of broiler and pig houses. The developed models were validated using \ndatasets\
    \ obtained through measurement campaigns. Finally, a certification scheme based\
    \ on the previous steps was developed. \nThe energy certification of livestock\
    \ houses increases the knowledge of the energy amount needed for climate control\
    \ and has \nboth local and global positive effects. Local positive effects concern\
    \ farmers and engineers, which can use the provided \ninformation, for instance,\
    \ for better planning the production and for better evaluating retrofit actions.\
    \ Global positive effects lie in \nproposals of legislations and funding that\
    \ politicians could develop based on the provided information, with the final\
    \ aim to reach \na global reduction of energy consumption in this sector. \nHow\

    \ México \nGlobally, throughout the total food value chain 33% of the produced\
    \ food becomes waste. That is roughly 1.3 billion tonnes per \nyear, and 3.3 Gt\
    \ in CO2 equivalent. The Netherlands is one of the countries introducing major\
    \ innovations, such as with the first \nnational food related network for the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT). \nIn this paper we discuss the influence of one relatively\
    \ new paradigm that has proved to foster CO2 reduction through “Smart \nFarming”\
    \ (SM). The driving research question is: how does the Dutch Agri-food sector\
    \ offer sustainable solutions to improve the \nproblem of food waste (FW) and\
    \ reduce CO2-eq. emissions through SF and related technological innovations? \n\
    A mixed research method approach was used to gather the information to answer\
    \ this question, i.e. literature review and semi-\nstructured questionnaires to\
    \ interview key respondents. As part of the preliminary findings (from literature)\
    \ an inventory is provided \nhere of the effects (not exhaustive yet) of the technology\
    \ associated to SF practices : (i) prevention of FW generation at different \n\
    stages of the value chain; (ii) improvement of production efficiency by automated\
    \ operations; (iii) valorisation of some perishable \nfood stuffs (e.g. CO2 absorbent\
    \ materials). Further, the need to include other relevant aspects in our analysis,\
    \ aspects that may \nhave a crucial influence in the technology implementation\
    \ and in the collaboration deployed among different actors of the Agri-\nfood\
    \ value chain, is acknowledged and explained. As the CO2-eq emissions reductions\
    \ were derived from literature, suggestions \nare made as regards future research\
    \ for their actual calculation in the context of SF practices. \nThe Effect of\

    \ The Netherlands, 2Wageningen Livestock Research, The \nNetherlands  \nHigh levels\
    \ of CO2 in culturing conditions have negative effects on fish growth, physiology\
    \ and behaviour which are serious \nproblems when trying to achieve an intensification\
    \ of aquaculture . The concentration of CO2 in the aquaculture recirculating \n\
    system is usually controlled by trickling filter which also works as a degassing\
    \ tower. Therefore, it is combining the nitrification \nprocess with the degassing\
    \ of CO2 due to the structure of the media , ventilation and the height of the\
    \ tower. \nThe goal of current research is to investigate the effect of gas to\
    \ liquid ratio(G/L), on carbon dioxide removal and heat loss across \na trickling\
    \ filter, in order to reduce the heat loss by optimization of the ventilation\
    \ rate for CO2 control. the trickling filter in the \nAquatic Research Facility\
    \ (ARF) was used for the experiment under different G/L ratio’s. the ventilation\
    \ fan (range 6 - 60 m3/h) \nmounted on the top of the trickling filter moving\
    \ air upward through the filter. The CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity,\
    \ \nflowrate,...of the influent and effluent water/air was measured using several\
    \ sensors. \nIn this study the effectivity of 8 different GLRs (1, 2, 5, 7 ,10,\
    \ 11, 15) on carbon dioxide removal and heat loss in a trickling filter \nwas\
    \ tested under steady state conditions. Test Results show when G/L is between\
    \ 1~5, CO2 removal efficiency increasing rapidly \nwith growing of G/L ratio’s\
    \ and it was effectively the same between G/L= 6~10. The heat loss will increase\
    \ sharply for G/L=1~3 \nand then it rises slightly. Considering an energy saving\
    \ aspect and removal efficiency, the ratio of removal percentage to energy \n\
    loss, in G/L ratio of 4~5 is considered to be the best for CO2 removal. \nBiomass\
    \ Heating System with Kerosene Boiler for Green House Heating \nYoshimichi Yamashita,\
    \ Kazuhiro Takekura, Genta Kanai, Kenichi Yakushidou \nNational Agriculture and\

    \ fossil fuel with woody biomass. Generally, the biomass boiler system has a heat\
    \ \nstorage tank filled with water in order to store hot water converted from\
    \ combustion heat. With a heat storage tank, even a small \nburner can heat the\
    \ greenhouse. However, according to the heating load, the biomass boiler is comparatively\
    \ easy to control the \nquantity of woody biomass, but difficult to turn on and\
    \ off; therefore, we developed a biomass heating system using a rotary kiln-\n\
    type burner combined with kerosene boiler. \n \n \n \n71 \nThe Heat storage tank\
    \ of our system contained 7 m3 water, we kept the water from 30℃ to 40℃ using\
    \ Kerosene boiler. \nFurthermore, we made the water temperature rising to 70℃\
    \ - 90℃ by the biomass boiler with the rotary kiln-type burner. For \nheating\
    \ the greenhouse, we used the radiator which was made by automobile component,\
    \ and it provided warm air converted \nfrom the hot water. The heat output of\
    \ the radiator was about 20 kW with 60 - 80 ℃ water temperature. This system controlled\
    \ \nswitching on and off the fan of the radiator. \nField tests were performed\
    \ by heating a strawberry-cultivation greenhouse in Japan from December 2017 to\
    \ March 2018. The \ngreenhouse was double layer greenhouse. Outside temperature\
    \ was from about -10℃ to 10℃ ,and the ,minimum temperature \nwas -17℃. \nThe Greenhouse\
    \ was able to be heated to keep 10℃ or 18℃ at night, depending on the growing\
    \ stages of strawberries. The \ntemperature control accuracy in the greenhouse\
    \ was ± 2 ℃ . When the water temperature was 70℃ in daytime, The total heat \n\
    produced from calorie radiated was about 1,530 MJ from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.\
    \ \nGroundwater Utilization in a Farm Heat Network \nGenta Kanai, Yoshimichi Yamashita\
    \ \nNARO, Japan \nThere are various demands for heating and cooling in a farm.\
    \ The dryer of grain, raising seedling and heating of greenhouse and \nfarm office\
    \ or working space in winter need heat source. And refrigerators for products\
    \ and cooling of greenhouse in summer \nneed heat sink. Our purpose is to reduce\
    \ the energy consumption in a farm by building the Farm Heat Network (FHN) that\
    \ is \nconsisted of networks of hot and cold water and heaters and coolers. Hot\
    \ water will be supplied to the network from biomass \nboiler, solar heater and\
    \ other heat sources. Cold water will be supplied to the other network from heat\
    \ pump or other cold sources. \nAs a part of that system groundwater can be utilized\
    \ for both heat and cold sources. Because the temperature of groundwater \nkeeps\
    \ almost the same temperature throughout the year it can be utilized for cooling\
    \ in summer and heating in winter. \nWe built a system to heat and cool green\
    \ house for flower production utilizing groundwater. The capacity for cooling\
    \ and heating \nof the system was examined as a part of FHN. \n A result of heating\
    \ trials of our system is as follows, the average temperature of input air to\
    \ the heat exchanger was 0.4 °C, the \noutput air 8.7 °C, the input groundwater\
    \ temperature to the heat exchanger 10.1 °C, the output 4.6 °C and the average\
    \ heating \ncapacity 5.1 kW with the groundwater flow rate13.5 L/min. And a result\
    \ of cooling trial is as follows, the average temperature of \ninput air to the\
    \ heat exchanger was 20.4 °C, the output air 17.2 °C, the input groundwater temperature\
    \ to the heat exchanger \n14.9 °C, the output 19.6 °C and the average cooling\
    \ capacity 4.2 kW with the groundwater flow rate13.1 L/min. \nSimulation Model\

    \ Hassan Keshek \nMenoufia University, Egypt \nThe poultry industry is an important\
    \ industry in Egypt and consumes a large amount of energy. This study was done\
    \ to estimate \nthe renewable energy generated from the broiler waste and reused\
    \ it in the broiler farm. A mathematical model consisting of \nalgebraic equations\
    \ was developed for broiler house heating by exhaust gas from generator engine\
    \ integrated with a heater \nexchanger. The equations were activated by MATLAB\
    \ program in four stages. The first one, calculate the required broiler house\
    \ \nheating energy according to the recommended inside air, outside air temperature\
    \ and heat transfer through the broiler house \nstructure. The second stage, estimate\
    \ the broiler litter waste produced from broiler house and calculated its bio-gas\
    \ production \nin m3/day. The third stage, calculate the electricity generated\
    \ and heat energy of exhaust gas from the generator. Finally, calculate \nthe\
    \ energy saved by balancing energy produced from wastes to the energy required\
    \ for the broiler house. The results of the \ndeveloped model show that, about\
    \ 19.85 kWh/day of electricity can be generated from the bio-gas produced from\
    \ the broiler \nwaste and 32.28 kWh/day of waste heat energy recovered from generator\
    \ exhaust gas. This adaptation would be a valuable \naddition of renewable energy\
    \ in country existing energy system. The saved energy from broiler litter wastes\
    \ was ranged about \n45 to 53% of the total required energy. The values of thermal\
    \ loss during the broiler cycle production from Transmission and \nventilation\
    \ were about 48.78 and 44.19% of total required energy. The minimum correlation\
    \ coefficients between predicted and \nmeasurements values were 0.940, 0.9478\
    \ and 0.936 for inside temperature, bio-gas generation, electricity generation.\
    \ Using the \nelectricity and heat energy from exhaust gas which, generated from\
    \ waste as an input for broiler house operations is a new \napproach for reducing\
    \ operating costs and considering as a new application of renewable energy \n\

    \ \nTechnical University of Munich, Germany \nThe debate on sustainability is\
    \ playing a more and more important role in European agriculture. The greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions \ninduced by production processes are a decisive factor in this\
    \ process. On the one hand, they are a decisive factor in the \ncommitment of\
    \ individual states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, there\
    \ is an increasing demand for \ninformation about emissions by food retailers\
    \ as these are a marketing instrument. \nIn general, farmers have to document\
    \ a wide range of activities, so more and more farmers are switching to farm management\
    \ \nsystems. It will be investigated whether it is possible to calculate agricultural\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions with the help of automated \ndata from Farm Management\
    \ Systems. \nThe calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in the soil and plants\
    \ sector requires 40 different input data: 21 of these can be \nread directly,\
    \ four of them have to be calculated indirectly and 15 are not available automatically.\
    \ The calculation of greenhouse \ngas emissions from agricultural machinery requires\
    \ 15 different input data: nine are directly readable, one input factor has to\
    \ be \n \n \n \n72 \ncalculated indirectly and five are currently not digitized.\
    \ For the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock (beef \ncattle\
    \ and dairy cattle) 43 different input data are required: 26 are already directly\
    \ readable via digital sources, two have to be \ncalculated indirectly via several\
    \ input data and 15 are not yet available automatically. \nThis thesis explains\
    \ that it is possible to calculate greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture using\
    \ digital sources. For some of the \nrequired values, however, literature values\
    \ must be used. In order to further advance research in this area, it is recommended\
    \ to \nexamine the perspective of farmers regarding automated greenhouse gas calculation\

    \ University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran \nSeveral researchers have used Multi Linear\
    \ Regressions (MLR) or Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks\
    \ to \nmodel the energy audit of agricultural production. A literature review\
    \ showed that no previous analytical work has been reported \non the comparison\

    \ the main goal of this \nresearch is to compare the MLR with MLP artificial neural\
    \ networks modeling and select the best one to predict the energy output \nof\
    \ peach production in Iran. For this purpose, the same data were used to train\
    \ the MLR and MLP models and thus, 60, 70, 80 \nand 90% of data were selected\
    \ to train the models. Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm was employed to\
    \ train ANNs models. \nThe results showed that 3.41 MJ of energy was consumed\
    \ to produce one kilogram of peach in Iran. The application of the \nmodels highlighted\
    \ that the differences between the actual and predicted values for the two models\
    \ were not statistically \nsignificant. The performance indices such as coefficient\
    \ of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute \nPercentage\
    \ Error (MAPE), and Efficiency (EF) for the best ANN architecture were determined\
    \ to be 0.96, 2297.75 kg, 11.79% \nand 0.96%, respectively. While, these indices\
    \ for the best MLR model were 0.91, 3418.27 kg, 14.80% and 0.91%, respectively.\
    \ \nOverall, it was concluded that the MLP models could better predict the energy\

    \ of Biosystems Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran \n\
    There are some studies regarding the prediction of agricultural energy flows using\
    \ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These \nmodels are quite sensitive to correlations\
    \ amongst inputs. And, there are often strong correlations amongst energy inputs\
    \ for \nagricultural systems. One potential method to remediate this problem is\
    \ to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, \nthe purpose of this\
    \ research was to predict energy flows for an example agricultural system (Iranian\
    \ tea production) via a novel \nmethodology based on ANNs, using principal components\
    \ as model inputs, not raw data. PCA results showed that the first and \nsecond\
    \ components could account for more than 99% of variation in the data, thus the\
    \ dimensions of the data set could be \ndecreased from six to two for the prediction\
    \ of energy flows for Iranian tea production. Using these principal components\
    \ as \ninputs, an ANN model with 2-15-1 structure was determined to be optimal\
    \ for energy flow modeling of this system. Results from \nthis optimal model demonstrated\
    \ that the difference between actual and predicted amounts of energy was not significant\
    \ at the \n1.0% level. Ultimately, these results indicate that a PC+ANN model\
    \ could be used to reliably predict this agricultural system. To \nconclude, the\
    \ results of this study highlighted that the use of PC as ANN inputs improved\
    \ ANN model prediction through reducing \nits complexity and eliminating data\
    \ colinearity. Many agricultural systems could benefit from using this methodology\
    \ for modeling. \nDevelopment of In-House Lattice-Boltzmann Simulator of Anaerobic\

    \ Brazil \nSugarcane vinasse is a by-product from the ethanol industry whose large-scale\
    \ exploitation has long pointed to ferti-irrigation in \nsugarcane crops after\
    \ it undergoes anaerobic treatment. Anaerobic packed bed reactor (APBR) comes\
    \ forward as an attractive \ntreatment system so as to preserve vinasse quality\
    \ as bio-fertiliser while allowing energy to be recovered as biogas, thus \nmitigating\
    \ greenhouse gas emission as well as groundwater contamination. Bearing in mind\
    \ the computational modelling of APBR \ntowards cost-effective and sustainable\
    \ operation, an in-house numerical simulator has been developed via lattice Boltzmann\
    \ \nmethod (LBM). Claimed as a promising method, LBM has the ability of numerically\
    \ simulating transport phenomena, fluid flow \nand moving boundaries without solving\
    \ Navier-Stokes equations. Inspired by the Anaerobic Digestion Model Number 1\
    \ from \nInternational Water Association, such in-house LBM simulator has initially\
    \ relied on a time-dependent one-dimensional model in \nprimitive variables. In\
    \ view of supporting (while simplifying) prospective scale-up, this work aims\
    \ at casting this preliminary model \nand LBM simulator in dimensionless form.\
    \ Original model parameters (e.g. interstitial fluid velocity, species diffusivity,\
    \ kinetic \ncoefficients, and reactor length) were successfully lumped into fewer\
    \ dimensionless parameters (e.g. mass-transfer Péclet and \nDamköhler numbers).\
    \ Computationally implemented in D1Q2 lattice, the LBM simulator remained fully\
    \ operational in \ndimensionless form. A sensitivity analysis indicated that gradients\
    \ of dimensionless species concentrations were smoothed not \nonly with respect\

    \ Antwerp, Belgium \nGroundwater flow models are commonly used to understand and\
    \ forecast groundwater flow under anthropogenic and climatic \neffects, but the\
    \ reliability of the predictions is strongly influenced by different sources of\
    \ uncertainty. The conventional treatment \nof uncertainty in groundwater modelling\
    \ focuses on parameter uncertainty. Recent studies suggest that uncertainties\
    \ on model \npredictions may be largely dominated by uncertainties arising from\
    \ alternative conceptual model definitions. In this study, we \npresent a flexible\
    \ Integrated Bayesian Multi-model Uncertainty Estimation Framework (IBMUEF) to\
    \ explicitly quantify the \nuncertainty originating from errors or simplifications\
    \ in the model conceptualization, the input data, the parameter values and \n\
    measurement errors of a fully distributed physically-based groundwater flow model.\
    \ In the proposed integrated fully Bayesian \nmulti-model framework, the DiffeRential\
    \ Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm with updated likelihood function\
    \ is \ncombined with Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). This framework is applied\
    \ on an overexploited aquifer in Bangladesh. Four \nalternative conceptual models\
    \ representing different geological models have been developed. The uncertainty\
    \ of the spatially \ndistributed input of the model (recharge and pumping discharge)\
    \ has been represented by multipliers. A generalized formal \nlikelihood function\
    \ is also included for hydrogeological modelling based on a new heteroscedastic\
    \ error model to extend the \napplicability of our IBMUEF framework in situations\
    \ where residual errors are heteroscedastic. The results of the study confirm\
    \ \nthat consideration of both conceptual model uncertainty and uncertainty of\
    \ the input data are important to have confident \nparameters sets and better\
    \ model prediction. The results also confirm that the IBMUEF framework is a useful\
    \ tool and provides \nbetter model predictions than individual models. We conclude\
    \ that an explicit consideration of conceptual model structural \nuncertainty\
    \ along with model input, parameter and measurement uncertainty using the IBMUEF\
    \ framework improves the accuracy \nand reliability of the model prediction and\
    \ related uncertainty bounds. \nClimate Change Effects on Groundwater Recharge\

    \ exploited to irrigate \nhigh water demanding Boro rice crop therein. This leads\
    \ to a declining trend of groundwater level (GWL) in the region. Therefore, \n\
    a research study was conducted in three selected sites of Barind region namely,\
    \ Bagmara, Mohadevpur and Nachole upazila to \nestimate recharge potentials and\
    \ safe yields of the underneath aquifers; and, to project the likely impacts of\
    \ climate change on \nrecharge to those aquifers. Two recharge estimating approaches\
    \ (i) GWL fluctuation and (ii) soil moisture accounting method \nembedded in the\
    \ Hydrologic Modelling System (HEC-HMS) model were employed in this study. \n\
    It was found that rainfall is strongly correlated with groundwater recharge estimated\
    \ by both GWL fluctuation (correlation \ncoefficient = 0.61) and HEC-HMS (correlation\
    \ coefficient = 0.83) models. The studied aquifers are mainly get recharged during\
    \ \nJune – October and about 23 –70% of annual rainfall can be converted into\
    \ groundwater recharge. Safe yield analysis shows \nthat both unconfined Mohadevpur\
    \ and Bagmara aquifers are no longer suitable for further exploitation whereas\
    \ the confined \naquifer underneath Nachole upazila has still the potentiality\
    \ to provide useable groundwater. The build HEC-HMS model was run \nwith future\
    \ climate forcings generated by the two Global Climate Models (GCM), GFDL-CM3\
    \ and MIROC-EMS, participated in \nthe latest IPPC’s CMIP5 project. Compared to\
    \ the baseline period (1981 – 2000), an increased mean monthly rainfall (up to\
    \ 60 \nmm/month) was projected during June –August in the future 2021 – 2040 period.\
    \ Moreover, the studied areas are projected to \nexperience consistent increased\
    \ temperature for all calendar months (maximum increase 2.9 °C). Projected increasing\
    \ rainfall \nand decreasing evapotranspiration altogether increase groundwater\
    \ recharge (maximum 90 mm/month) of the aquifers for the \nfuture 2021 – 2040\
    \ period. Such blessing impacts of climate change will help conserve the country’s\
    \ groundwater resources. \nFlow Simulation in a Phreatic Aquifer using Infinite\

    Surface water and groundwater interaction is a challenging issue and special case\
    \ studies are usually examined. Such a case is \nthe seepage from a stream or\
    \ canal into the adjacent phreatic aquifer. In this groundwater flow problem,\
    \ the area of main interest \nis the soil zone in the vicinity of the stream while\
    \ the aquifer is supposed to extend, particularly for the mathematical analysis,\
    \ to \ninfinity. In this paper, the problem is approximated as one-dimensional\
    \ saturated groundwater flow described by the Boussinesq \nequation and as two-dimensional\
    \ saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow described by the Richards equation. To\
    \ solve \nnumerically these equations, the finite elements analysis is applied\
    \ by embedding special elements, called infinite elements, \nwhich extend to infinity\
    \ in one direction based on the appropriate shape functions used to describe the\
    \ infinite part of the element. \nHence, the number of elements required to discretise\
    \ the key subsurface flow region is substantially reduced compared to the \nelements\
    \ required to discretise the flow region of the whole aquifer. Thus, computationally\
    \ efficient and sufficiently accurate \nsolutions are obtained both in terms of\
    \ simulated water table and groundwater recharge or discharge. The computational\
    \ schemes \nusing infinite elements are calibrated by the corresponding schemes\
    \ that discretises the entire flow region with common elements. \nThe developed\
    \ schemes are also applied to an agricultural area in Central Greece where the\
    \ variation of water level in a drainage \ncanal is closely associated with the\
    \ variation of the water table in the phreatic aquifer. \n \n \n \n75 \nTerritorial\

    \ \nThe information produced by the data analysis and the surveys carried out\

    Irrigation Performance of Soil-Moisture Based Automatic Irrigation System for\
    \ Growing Soybeans in Korea \nSoon Hong Kwon1, Jongsoon Kim1, Ki-Yeol Jung2, Sanghun\
    \ Lee2 \n1Pusan National University, Republic of South Korea; 2National Institute\
    \ of Crop Science, RDA, Republic of South Korea \nWater management is important\
    \ for growing soybeans in Korea, because they are easily affected by water stress.\
    \ Although \nmanual irrigation systems are very simple, they are labour intensive\
    \ methods. Automatic irrigation system operates with no or \nminimum manual intervention.\
    \ In this study, soil moisture content, water use, and irrigation efficiency were\
    \ calculated to evaluate \nthe performance of the irrigation system. \nThree different\
    \ irrigation methods (sprinkle irrigation (SI), surface drip irrigation (SDI),\
    \ and fountain irrigation (FI)) were used in \nthis study. Soybean (Daewon) cultivar\
    \ was sown in June 20, 2016. \nSoil water contents were measured at 10, 20, 30\
    \ and 40cm depths and irrigation efficiencies were obtained by dividing the water\
    \ \nabsorbed in the effective root zone by the total applied irrigation water.\
    \ The automatic irrigation system maintained the soil water \ncontent at 10cm\
    \ depth at constant value (30%) using a controller and solenoid valves. \nThe\
    \ average soil water contents were 45.17% at SI, 46.03% at SDI, and 42.47% at\
    \ FI for whole growth period. These values \nwere higher than the control (42.09%,\
    \ no artificial irrigation practice), but there were no significant differences\
    \ between the \nirrigation methods. However, the total amount of irrigation water\
    \ at SDI (47.3 ton/10a) was the lowest among the methods (60.4 \nton/10a at SI,\
    \ 92.6 ton/10a at FI). In addition, the irrigation efficiency at SDI (91.86%)\
    \ was the highest among them, followed by \nSI (89.34%) and FI (78.92%). \nEven\
    \ though SDI requires higher initial investment, it turned out that SDI saves\
    \ water and may improve yields by applying water \nmore directly to the root zone.\
    \ Thus, SDI would be a promising irrigation method for upland crops. \nIn conclusion,\
    \ this automatic irrigation system can reduce the production costs of upland crops,\
    \ thereby improving grain self-\nsufficiency in Korea. \nAlternative Underdrain\

    \ Construction, University of Girona; 2Department of Chemical and \nAgricultural\
    \ Engineering and Technology, University of Girona \nReduction of pressure drop\
    \ across sand media filters – which are broadly used for preventing emitter clogging\
    \ – should help \nreducing energy consumption in microrrigation systems. Previous\
    \ research has shown that most of the pressure drop is located \nat sand filter\
    \ underdrain. In this work, the effect of the nozzle geometry on the pressure\
    \ drop of a sand filter was experimentally \nstudied. Four nozzles were analysed:\
    \ one commercially produced with a conical shape and three alternative cylindrical\
    \ \nunderdrains that were built for the experiment and that differed in the location\
    \ and the number of slots. Experiments in both \nfiltration mode and backwashing\
    \ conditions for a wide range of superficial velocities were carried out at the\
    \ laboratory. The results \nreported that a reduction of the filter energy consumption\
    \ greater than 20% could be achieved by simply modifying the position \nof the\
    \ slots above the surface of the underdrain element. The effects of the nozzle\
    \ were further investigated by means of an \nanalytical model that predicted the\
    \ pressure drop of the water flow through the filter. The model confirmed that\
    \ the distribution of \nthe slots in the underdrain was a critical factor for\
    \ determining the length of the region with a nonuniform flow within the sand.\
    \ \nWhen using the commercial nozzle at flow rates >0.85 l/s, this region produced\
    \ the major contribution to energy losses in the \nfilter due to increases in\
    \ the tortuosity of the water path within the porous medium. From these results,\
    \ it is suggested that an \naffordable way to increase the energy efficiency of\
    \ already existing installations would be to replace the current underdrain \n\
    elements with new improved designs that have 40% more slots in its cylindrical\
    \ surface. \n \n \n \n \n \n76 \n \nCoupling Water Saving Technologies and Wireless\

    \ of California, Berkeley \nMaximizing limited available water supply for crop\
    \ production during drought occurrences in tropical and arid countries can be\
    \ \naddressed using modern information and communication technologies. A collaborative\
    \ project is developing and pilot-testing a \nwireless sensor network (WSN)-based\
    \ water information system for improving water use efficiency under upland and\
    \ lowland \ncrop production systems in the Philippines. The upland pilot test\
    \ site uses drip irrigation together with a network of soil moisture \nsensors\
    \ and weather sensors that provide real-time monitoring of soil and weather conditions\
    \ fed directly to a cloud-based water \ninformation system as basis for automated\
    \ irrigation scheduling. The lowland pilot test site uses alternate wetting and\
    \ drying \ntechnology (AWD) along with a network of water level and weather sensors\
    \ for real-time monitoring of water management \nparameters, similarly fed directly\
    \ to a cloud-based water information system as basis for automated irrigation\
    \ scheduling. \nBiophysical characterization of the upland and lowland pilot test\
    \ sites and design of WSN hardware have been performed. Field \nexperimental plots\
    \ under “with” and “without” wireless sensor network have also been established.\
    \ Deployment of wireless \nsensors and accessories, low-level programming and\
    \ testing will consequently be performed at the test sites. Significantly higher\
    \ \nirrigation water use efficiency, water productivity and crop yield are expected\
    \ to be observed under plots with wireless sensor \nnetwork and water saving technologies\
    \ compared to plots with manual irrigation without wireless sensors. Results of\
    \ pilot testing \ncould serve as basis for upscaling and commercialization and\

    \ Sensing and G.I.S. \nHarish Chandra Sharma \nG. B. Pant University of Agriculture\
    \ & Technology, Pantnagar, India \nWith the increasing population and industrialization,\
    \ water demand for various purposes is increasing, resulting in over \nexploitation\
    \ of ground water. The water table in many parts of the India is declining. Keeping\
    \ it in view, the present study was \ncarried out to identify the groundwater\
    \ potential zones for the artificial groundwater recharge planning with the help\
    \ of Remote \nSensing data of IRS-1D-LISS-III. Area selected for the above study\
    \ was the Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh state of India, covering \nan area\
    \ of about 441980 ha. Satellite data were used to prepare geomorphological map\
    \ of the district. Thematic map was \nintegrated with the help of Geographic Information\
    \ System to demarcate the poor to excellent groundwater potential zones. Water\
    \ \ntable depth variation contour map (for the period of 20 years) was prepared\
    \ to delineate the maximum water table decline zones. \nThe study has presented\
    \ a synoptic view of the geo-morphology of Bijnor district. On the basis of this\
    \ study, suitable sites for the \nconstruction of different structures for the\
    \ artificial groundwater recharge have been suggested. Results showed that water\
    \ table \ndeclined by 3 to 9 m in Old Flood Plain (OFD)–2, during the study period.\
    \ The geomorphic elements, identified in the study area, \nsuggest that OFP-1\
    \ land form is highly suitable site for percolation tanks. In OFP-3 land form,\
    \ percolation tanks having larger \nwidth and lesser depth are suitable. Maximum\
    \ water table declined in OFP-2 and OFP-3 land forms. Hence these areas need \n\
    immediate recharge plan. Dug well recharge method can be powerful tool for the\
    \ land form OFP-3 where the silt and clay contents \nin the upper surface are\
    \ high, whereas OFP-1 and Young Flood Plain (YFP) -2 land forms are highly suitable\
    \ sites for percolation \ntanks. \nEffect of Irrigation Systems and Water Quantities\
    \ on Corn Production under Partial Rootzone Drying \nConditions \nAbdellateif\
    \ Abdelwahab Samak, Mohamed Nabih Omar, Mahmoud Hassan Keshek \nMenoufia University,\
    \ Egypt \nWorldwide, Agriculture is consider the main user of water. In Egypt,\
    \ Agriculture uses more than 80 % of the available water. In \nirrigated agriculture,\
    \ the right way to save water is to increase water use efficiency (WUE) through\
    \ better irrigation management \nlike Partial Rootzone Drying (PRD). Partial Rootzone\
    \ Drying is an irrigation regime, which increase water use efficiency without\
    \ \nyield reductions in many different crops. Corn crop is one of the most important\
    \ crops for human and animal consumption and \nplanted for grain yield or for\
    \ forage (FAO, 2018). Corn yield productions under surface and sub-surface drip\
    \ irrigation systems \nand their responses to different irrigation water quantities\
    \ was evaluated in 2016 and 2017 summer growing seasons. A field \nexperiment\
    \ was conducted using corn crop (Zea Mays) grown in northern Egypt at Shebin El\
    \ Kom, Menoufia Governorate. A \nrandomized split-plot design was used with irrigation\
    \ system as main plots and different irrigation water quantities randomly \ndistributed\
    \ within either conventional or partial rootzone drying irrigation regimes. The\
    \ irrigation water quantity was a fraction of \ncrop evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ as 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 of ETc. The experimental treatments were replicated\
    \ three times. The \nexperimental results showed that, the soil water content\
    \ significantly affected by irrigation regime and irrigation water quantities.\
    \ \nAlso, Corn grain yield was significantly affected by irrigation system and\
    \ both irrigation regime and irrigation water quantity. Corn \n100-grain weight\
    \ and plant height were affected by irrigation system, irrigation water quantity\
    \ and irrigation regime, respectively. \nSignificant differences for the interaction\
    \ between season and irrigation systems were only found for Corn yield production\
    \ and \n100-grain weight. Finally, the results from this small experiment should\
    \ extrapolate to a large field to find out the optimal irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ under non-uniform of irrigation applications. \nDown the drain: A model based\
    \ irrigation strategy \nFrancisco Domingo Mondaca Duarte, Simon van Mourik, Jos\
    \ Balendonck, Eldert van Henten \nWageningen University & Research, The Netherlands\
    \  \nEfficient irrigation strategies in soil agriculture are hard to predict.\
    \ Ideally, the irrigation strategy a grower follows should prevent \ncrop water\
    \ stress while maintaining drainage to a minimum. Nevertheless, is not easy to\
    \ measure drainage in soil. Lysimeters \n \n \n \n77 \nare capable of measuring\
    \ drainage, yet they are expensive and require maintenance. Model based scenario\
    \ studies can run \ndifferent case scenarios without needing to set-up numerous\
    \ lysimeters in the field. \nThe purpose of this works is to find out how much\
    \ drainage can be reduced without increasing crop water stress by using model\
    \ \nbased scenario studies. \nThe model consists of two integrated modules: The\
    \ first module describes the water transport through the soil by Richard’s \n\
    Equation. The second module describes the plant water uptake by Penman-Monteith\
    \ evapotranspiration. \nThe model was validated with experiment data from lysimeter\
    \ drainage measurements. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was \nused to find\
    \ the robustness of the model in different soil parameters. The soil types ranged\
    \ from light clay to sandy soils. Six \ndifferent soil parameters were chosen.\
    \ An algorithm was used to change the parameters stepwise and observe the change\
    \ in \ndrainage. \nThe model showed good prediction accuracy. The predicted total\
    \ drainage was 250 litres per square meter, against a measured \nvalue of 260.\
    \ The grower strategy did not result in crop stress according to our model, it\
    \ required 1590 litres, and resulted in 250 \nlitres drained. Strategy 2 did also\
    \ not result in crop stress, with 217 litres drained. The third strategy resulted\
    \ in only 164 litres \ndrained, however here crop stress was predicted to occur.\
    \ \nThe balance between crop stress and drainage is a delicate one. Drainage model\
    \ scenario studies have potential to help in this \nbalance. However, careful\
    \ attentions in measured parameters needs to be considered for the model to perform\
    \ accurate \npredictions. \nDevelopment of an ICT-based Groundwater Control Systems\
    \ for Increasing Yields of Field Crops Grown in \nPaddy Fields \nSoon Hong Kwon1,\
    \ Jongsoon Kim1, Ki-Yeol Jung2, Sanghun Lee2 \n1Pusan National University, Republic\
    \ of South Korea; 2National Institute of Crop Science, RDA, Republic of South\
    \ Korea \nIn Korea, rice consumption has declined gradually recently and its self-sufficiency\
    \ ratio maintains more than 90 percent. Other \nfield crops heavily rely on imports\
    \ from other countries, because of their low productivity domestically. Thus,\
    \ crop production in \npaddy fields is critical for improving crop self-sufficiency\
    \ ratio in Korea. \nIn this study, a wireless sensor-based irrigation management\
    \ was developed for automatic irrigation control and field monitoring. \nAt subsurface\
    \ drain irrigation system, the underdrain pipes were placed at 3m and 6m apart,\
    \ and the groundwater levels were \n30cm and 60cm. In addition, the soil water\
    \ contents and soil electrical conductivities were measured to evaluate soil’s\
    \ physical \nand chemical properties. \nThe soil water contents at the surface\
    \ layer (0-10cm, 10-20cm) during the growing season were 0.253 and 0.316 \nm3/m3\
    \ respectively at 60cm groundwater level, which were 27% and 21% lower than the\
    \ higher groundwater level. These soil \nwater contents were affected by rainfall.\
    \ In addition, the soil water contents at 30cm groundwater level were larger than\
    \ 0.24 \nm3/m3, whereas these values at 60cm groundwater level were decreased\
    \ to 0.16 m3/m3. The drain spacing did not influence the \nsoil water contents;\
    \ however, the drainage outflow at 3m drain spacing was greater than the one at\
    \ 6m drain spacing, indicating \nthat the narrow drain installation is more effective\
    \ to drain the soil water. Electrical conductivity in soil was significantly greater\
    \ \nwith 30cm groundwater level because of the reduction of drained outflow volumes\
    \ passing through soil profile. In conclusion, the \nhigh groundwater level (30cm)\
    \ and narrow drain spacing (3m) is required for better water retention in soil\
    \ and higher crop yield. \nThis smart irrigation system provides farmers with\
    \ the efficient use of water resources for crop production in paddy fields. \n\

    \ BOD and COD were correlated at 2 \nand 3 points, respectively. T-N showed a\
    \ positive correlation at 9 points, and 7 of them had a strong positive correlation,\
    \ indicating \nthat sewage treatment effluent had a large effect on downstream\
    \ streams. In this study, we found that the correlation between \nriver flow rate\
    \ and water quality factors (COD, SS, TP) was high for river water measurement\

    \ to \neffect of addition of 10% date palm biochar, 0.4% K-HCP polymer, 10% silt-clay-loam\
    \ soil and 10% cattle manure respectively. \nOn other hand, the date palm biochar,\
    \ silt-clay-loam, and cattle manure decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity\
    \ of sandy soil \nby about 74%, 59% and 47% respectively, while the K-HCP polymer\
    \ incensed by about 31%. The date palm biochar has the \nhighest potential to\
    \ improve hydraulic properties of sandy soil; therefore has the potential to save\
    \ irrigation water and reduce \ndeep percolation water losses. \nEffect of Sand\
    \ Size and Inlet Pressure on Sand Media Filter Performance Using Reclaimed Effluents\
    \ \nMiquel Duran-Ros, Jaume Puig-Bargués, Gerard Arbat, Joan Pujol, Francisco\
    \ Ramírez de Cartagena \nDepartment of Chemical and Agricultural Engineering and\
    \ Technology, University of Girona, Italy  \nSand media filters are specially\
    \ recommended for preventing emitter clogging when irrigation water with high\
    \ pollutant load is \nused in micro irrigation. The objective of this work was\
    \ to assess those operational conditions related to media size and filter inlet\
    \ \npressure that could yield to a better emitter protection when wastewaters\
    \ are used. So, an experiment was carried out in a micro \nirrigation system that\
    \ had a sand media filter for filtering a reclaimed effluent. Two sand size ranges\
    \ (0.4-1.0 mm and 0.8-2.2 mm) \nand three operating pressures (200, 300 and 400\
    \ kPa) were tested. Filtered flow rate and volume, pressure loss across the filter,\
    \ \ninlet pH, temperature, turbidity and electrical conductivity and outlet turbidity\
    \ data were collected every minute in a supervisory \ncontrol and data acquisition\
    \ system. Volume used for filter backwashing was also recorded after each filtration\
    \ cycle. As the \nreclaimed effluent was supplied by a wastewater treatment plant,\
    \ there were some variations in its quality across the experiment. \nGreater sand\
    \ size significantly (P<0.05) increased filtered flow rate but reduced turbidity\
    \ removal. On the other hand, operating \npressure was statistically significant\
    \ on filter flow rate, backwashing volume and turbidity removal. The effect of\
    \ pressure was not \nthe same on each parameter but, overall, a pressure of 300\
    \ kPa yielded higher filter flow rates and turbidity removal and required \nless\
    \ backwashing volume. Although that for the 0.4-1.0 mm sand size range, inlet\
    \ filter pressures of 300 and 400 kPa did not \nshow statistical differences on\
    \ turbidity removal, increasing filter pressure up to 400 kPa is not recommended\
    \ because working \nat this inlet pressure caused higher pressure loss and, presumably,\
    \ higher energy consumption. \nDevelopment of a New Subsoil Management Concept\
    \ for Combined Deep Loosening and Incorporation of \nOrganic Material \nInga Jakobs,\
    \ Oliver Schmittmann, Peter Schulze Lammers \nUniversity of Bonn, Institute of\
    \ Agricultural Engineering, Germany \nSoil deterioration due to soil compaction\
    \ and limited fertilizer application become increasingly significant. Concerning\
    \ common \ntillage practices, deep tillage (subsoiling), is known to be beneficial\
    \ for soil physical conditions and thus plant development. \nSubsoiled soils have\
    \ lower bulk densities and increased infiltration capacities. A new subsoil management\
    \ concept was \ndeveloped to figure out its effects on plant development. \nThe\
    \ concept operates strip wise and excludes the topsoil. The topsoil is removed\
    \ in a strip of 30 x 30 cm (width x depth). Organic \nfertilizer is placed on\
    \ the strip in a quantitative volume portion of 20 % and incorporated up to 60\
    \ cm. Afterwards the topsoil is \nlaid back into the strip and reconsolidated.\
    \ \nThe feasibility and value for plant development was examined by a two year\
    \ field experiment and verified in comparison to a \ncontrol treatment. The experiment\
    \ covers effects on growth of spring barley on fallow land (FL) and at regularly\
    \ tilled land (RT). \nA significant increase in straw and grain yield (P>0.1)\
    \ was detected for subsoiling and subsoiling with incorporation of biological\
    \ \nwaste compost (Bio). The effect of subsoiling on yield is higher at the FL\
    \ than at RT (28 % vs. 5.7 %), compared to control. While \nfor Bio the opposite\
    \ effect occurs (40 % vs. 73 %). The incorporation of compost from green cuttings\
    \ promoted contrary results. \nFor FL a significant increase in yield (11 %) occurs,\
    \ while at RT a significant decrease in yield (- 32 %) is present. Plants of all\
    \ \ntreatments were significantly higher at FL, while at RT only subsoiling and\
    \ subsoiling with Bio increased plant height. \nThus subsoiling and subsoiling\
    \ with Bio increase overall plant development. The new subsoil management concept\
    \ offers the \nopportunity for a sustainable increase in plant production that\
    \ can secure stable yields during dry periods \n \n \n \n79 \nEvaluation of Compaction\
    \ in No-Till Vertisol Field Using Methods of Cone Index and Pedotransfer Function\
    \ \n- Case of a Moroccan Semi-Arid Context \nYassine Al masmoudi1, Abdellah El\
    \ Aissaoui1, Khalid Ibno Namr2 \n1National Institute of Agricultural Research,\
    \ Morocco; 2Faculty of Science, El Jadida, Morocco \nThis study aims to evaluate\
    \ compaction of a fifteen years old no-till vertisol field crop (40.91 % clay\
    \ 44.16 % loam 14.93 % sand) \nand find spatially potential correlation between\
    \ compacted clusters and relative physicochemical properties. Measurements are\
    \ \ndone on soil strength (using vertical penetrometer), bulk density, organic\
    \ matter, total limestone, and Atterberg limits to evaluate \nsoil compaction\
    \ and develop pedotransfer function. Experimental results showed ranges of the\
    \ bulk density of [1.30 to 1.80 g/cm3] \nin the boundaries and [1.01 to 1.40 g/cm3]\
    \ in the center of the field crop. The matter organic content averages are 2.23%\
    \ and \n2.91% for the profiles of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, respectively. Analysis\
    \ of the total limestone content showed a spatial decreasing \ngradient situated\
    \ between the ranges of [3.5-14 %] and [0.5-3%] for the soil profile of [0-10\
    \ cm]. The total limestone gradient \ndecreased in the soil profile of [10-20\
    \ cm] within the range [4.5-21 %] and [1- 4 %]. Soil strength behavior showed\
    \ relatively a \ndecreasing gradient between the ranges of [11.5-19 MPa] and [0.1-11\
    \ MPa]. Atterberg limits showed that is of importance to \nrespect delay intervention\
    \ for avoiding compaction induction relative to soil plasticity state . The results\
    \ showed an important \ncompaction level in the extremities field due to importance\
    \ of machines/tools traffic impact and intensity of tractor turning and \noperation\
    \ number with no respect of soil plasticity during intervention in the crop production\
    \ cycle. The compaction was also \nrelated to limestone gradient in the field.\
    \ The limestone content affected soil strength and its susceptibility to compaction.\
    \ Based \non evaluated parameters, estimation of vertisol sensitivity to compaction\
    \ was approached using a pedotransfer function \n(R2=0.9039). \nNovel in Situ\

    \ \nRecognizing the importance of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) for effectively reorienting\
    \ and transforming agricultural systems \ntowards the perspective of climate smart\
    \ agriculture, it is essential to perform in-situ measurements in a novel, efficient,\
    \ and cost \neffective way. The objective of the present study is to introduce\
    \ a Mobile Proximal Soil Sensing System (MPS3) allowing in situ \nvis-NIR measurements\
    \ independent of illumination and soil roughness restrictions. The MPS3 towed\
    \ by a tractor provides some \nadvantages over conventional backpacker and soil\
    \ penetrator systems such as the fast and high power data acquisition in a \n\
    near- real time domain. The current study focused on integrating in situ measurements\
    \ with machine learning methods and geo-\nstatistics towards delivering quantitative\
    \ and spatially distribution of SOC to support the implementation of informed\
    \ decision \nmaking in the agricultural sector. Specifically, a set of linear\
    \ and non-linear machine learning algorithms including the partial least \nsquares\
    \ regression (PLSR), Cubist, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are utilized with\
    \ leave one-out cross-validation in order \nto establish spectroscopic calibration\
    \ models of SOC. A detailed in-situ dataset (100 soil samples coupled with in\
    \ situ spectral \nand chemical laboratory measurements) was acquired in an experimental\
    \ layout in Greece to test the performance of the \nMPS3 under open field conditions.\
    \ The results reached coefficients of determination values (R2) of 0.68 and a\
    \ residual prediction \ndeviation (RPD) of 1.36.In this context, this study proves\
    \ that the MPS3 is a rapid and cost effective tool for precision agriculture \n\
    applications and effectively monitoring of SOC stocks for accounting purposes.\
    \ Further research should consider the \nimprovement of signal processing and\
    \ reconstruction techniques to address the effects of soil moisture aiming at\
    \ the synergetic \nuse of field acquired spectra with existing soil spectral libraries\

    \ Shear Vane for Measuring of the Peatland Top Roots Layer \nStrength \nAdam Piotr\
    \ Dubowski, Krzysztof Zembrowski \nPIMR-Industrial Institute of Agricultural Engineering,\
    \ Poland \nMany wetlands in Poland require special care to restore them as breeding\
    \ areas for endangered bird species. Using tracked \nsnow groomers, tracked trailers\
    \ and farm tractors is not eco-friendly practice and can conflict with conservation\
    \ goals, mainly, \nthrough disturbance of the ground surface. To improve protection\
    \ of these sites Industrial Institute of Agricultural Engineering \n(PIMR) developed\
    \ tracked vehicles and technologies that will be more useful in formal paludiculture.\
    \ To assess the quality of \nvehicles work and theirs impact on terrain the spiked\
    \ device, developed by METLA from Finland, was built in PIMR for measuring \n\
    the shear modulus of the ground. Tool is manually rotated using a commercial torque\
    \ wrench equipped with gyroscopic sensor. \nSpiked tool is good but output of\
    \ 13 spikes shear vane measurement only describes strength prevailing in very\
    \ small areas. \nManually operation sets also limits to the torque availed in\
    \ the researcher hands but increasing diameter of the plate should yield \na truer\
    \ estimation of the top layer strength in the scale of track contact path. After\
    \ field tests new version of the plate was build. \nIn this version of the spiked\
    \ plate its radius increased from 0.1 m up to 0.194 m, spikes length is almost\
    \ twice shorter comparing \nwith first one (0.16 m). Number of spikes was preliminary\
    \ increased to 25 and in next step up to 45 spikes. The length of spikes \n(0.7m)\
    \ corresponds to the height of the crossbars of the snow grooming vehicle. Volume\
    \ of specimen rotated by spiked blades \ncorresponds to ¼ of the volume of the\
    \ top roots layer which is between the crossbars of each track of the PIMR’s vehicle.\
    \ Spiked \ntool is equipped with removable wheels for easier transport handling\
    \ in the field. New version of tool facilitates relatively fast \nmanual measurement\

    \ are considered to achieve a high soil tilt for plant growth and reduce cost\
    \ of operation. \nThe purpose of this research was to establish the relationship\
    \ between the working machine parameters of a compact disc harrow \nand tillage\
    \ operational parameters under various soil moisture content. The working machine\
    \ parameters were disc space and \n \n \n \n80 \nground machine speed. The tillage\
    \ operational parameters were soil inversion, cutting depth and soil clod breakage.\
    \ The results \nshowed that disc space and ground machine speed all significantly\
    \ affected soil inversion in the various soil moisture content \nmedia. The resulting\
    \ data was statistically analyzed in one way ANOVA. The highest soil inversion\
    \ was achieved when the ground \nmachine speed was 0.2m/s with the disc space\
    \ at 20cm. Also, at disc space of 20cm and the ground machine speed of 0.2m/s\
    \ \nin the 26.5% soil moisture content, the highest soil breakage was achieved\
    \ in this particular medium. According to the study, \nchanging the disc space\
    \ or the forward ground speed of the working machine did not have much significant\
    \ effect on the tillage \ncutting depth. It was concluded that varying working\
    \ machine parameters such as disc space and ground machine speed could \nsignificantly\
    \ affect the soil inversion, and soil clod breakage. \nSoil and Landscape Engineering\

    \ Chapingo, Mexico \nFertilisers applied to soils commonly undergo a quick removal\
    \ by leaching that greatly diminish nutritional benefits to the plant. \nTo solve\
    \ such problem, this investigation proposes augmenting effectiveness by means\
    \ of a controlled release of the fertiliser. \nThe present investigation suggests\
    \ a process of synthesising particles that contain fertiliser and having an average\
    \ size between \n1 µm and 2 µm. For this study, a fertiliser (KH2PO4) was immobilised\
    \ with chitosan, and later was evaluated with the aim to \nidentify in first place\
    \ efficiency of synthesis of micro-particles, and in second place delivery rates\
    \ along time. The evaluation \ncompared results between KH2PO4 and KH2PO4 immobilised\
    \ with chitosan in order to know the capacity of retention and \ntransport within\
    \ the soil. To conduct experiments, soil was represented by a column length of\
    \ 0.1 m with porous medium, which \nwas constituted of silica gel with average\
    \ size particle of 51 µm. Milli-QTM water was used for a series of experiments\
    \ that \nassessed the micro-particles through induced leaching. It was found that\
    \ 17% of the KH2PO4 was delivered during the first \ninduced leaching, and corresponded\
    \ to the KH2PO4 that was not immobilised with chitosan. Additionally, every 48h\
    \ there was \nan induced leaching that was conducted 4 times, and delivered 69%\
    \ of the KH2PO4. Then, the experimental rig was also \nmodelled by means of the\
    \ general rate model. The model included axial transport, convection, and accumulation\
    \ in the mobile \nand stationary phase to get unidimensional predictions along\
    \ the column. In this way, it was possible to predict the concentrations \nafter\
    \ water moved down through the column, as an indicator of delivery rates. Thus,\

    \ in a column under specific operating conditions. \nSoil Conductivity: Detecting\
    \ Slurry Injection Depth With Minimal Effort \nJochen Georg Wiecha, Sascha Wörz,\
    \ Heinz Bernhardt \nTechnical University of Munich, Germany \nSemi-liquid manure\
    \ is a valuable fertilizer. Worldwide, pig or cattle slurry ensures efficient\
    \ supply of plant nutrients in many crops. \nCurrent laws and future regulations\
    \ demand to apply semi-liquid manure on soil surface or to inject the slurry immediately\
    \ into \nthe soil during application. The results are emission reductions and\
    \ reduction of nutrient loss. Correct slurry application depth is \na significant\
    \ factor in each crop. If the roots reaches the injected slurry at the optimal\
    \ plant growth, we observe a maximum \nconsumption of nutrients and a suitable\
    \ uptake. \nIn field trials and research facilities, the potentially successful\
    \ slurry deposition depth after injection is checked by digging with \nspade.\
    \ Depending on the structure of the soil and the presence of larger particles\
    \ and stones slurry injection depth may vary. By \na large number of samples,\
    \ the variance depending on soil conditions, moisture and nutrient supply can\
    \ be determined. This \nrequires lots of work and much time. \nFor quick and reliable\
    \ checking of the correct deposition depth of the semi-liquid manure, we present\
    \ a measuring system based \non conductivity. The system delimits the processed\
    \ soil areas from the slurry, measures the vertical extent of the fertilizer applied\
    \ \nand can make a declaration of the zone of mixed loosened soil and semi-liquid\
    \ manure in deposition depth. \nThis results in a large reduction of spending\
    \ time on field trials for the scientific staff. Fast data collection makes the\
    \ measurement \nresults comparably, since the environmental influences during\
    \ data acquisition can change less strongly than over a long trial \nperiod. \n\
    NH3 Emissions from Treated Buffalo Manure Application in Mediterranean Climate\

    \ II, Italy \nAmmonia volatilization is widely recognized as one of the major\

    \ activities. As a consequence, accurate ammonia assessment is needed in order\
    \ to control ammonia emissions \nand to update national emission inventories.\
    \ Besides some uncertainties still related to the measurement methods, another\
    \ \nimportant issue is the necessity of investigating a different kind of fertilizers.\
    \ In the last few years, considerable attention has \nbeen paid to many manure\
    \ treatments prior to field application. \nThis study aims to assess ammonia emissions\
    \ from the field application of separated buffalo manure digestate in the \nMediterranean\
    \ climate, in order to improve the emission inventory for this animal species,\
    \ reared mostly in South Italy. Two \nmeasuring methods were used: wind tunnel\
    \ (WT) and Integrated Horizontal flux (IHF). Moreover, ammonia emission measured\
    \ \nwere compared to those obtained running the statistical regression model ALFAM.\
    \ This model based on Michaelis-Menten type \nequation is often used to predict\
    \ cumulative ammonia loss and since it is based on a significant dataset is useful\
    \ to discuss the \neffectiveness of the emission measured. The total ammonia losses\
    \ measured in 7 days were 26.39 and 49.24 kg N ha-1, for WT \nand IHF, respectively.\
    \ Although the predicted total emissions were 40.99 and 36.56 kg N ha-1, for IHF\
    \ and WT, respectively, it is \npossible to observe the good accordance of the\

    \ of Civil and Environmental \nEngineering and Architecture, University of Cagliari,\
    \ Cagliari, 09123, Italy \nIn Europe, some policies have focused on landscape\
    \ and environment quality. Landscape fragmentation (LF) can be considered \nas\
    \ one of the main causes that negatively affect landscape quality, because it\
    \ triggers habitat loss processes, decline of fauna \nand flora species, and loss\
    \ of connectivity. Transport and mobility infrastructures (TMIs) and urban settlement\
    \ have been \nacknowledged as key factors in increasing LF processes. Scientific\
    \ literature describes several metrics able to quantify LF, but \nmethods useful\
    \ to quantify LF caused by TMIs are poorly described. \nIn this study, we measure\
    \ LF in four landscape units (LUs) - two LUs in Wales (the UK) and two in Sardinia\
    \ (Italy) - to identify \nareas where defragmentation measures could contribute\
    \ in reconnecting isolated patches, allowing wildlife movement. We use \nthe Barrier\
    \ Fragmentation Index (BFI) to quantify the LF due to TMIs and the Urban Fragmentation\
    \ Index (UFI) for the one due \nto urbanized areas. The BFI is able to measure\
    \ LF taking into account how specific target species perceive TMIs. We choose\
    \ the \nhedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) as target species, a quite common species\
    \ in both the countries. Finally, we apply two \nadditional metrics, namely the\
    \ effective mesh size (EMS) and the connectivity of natural areas (CNA) in order\
    \ to verify correlation \nbetween the four metrics. \nPreliminary results show\
    \ (i) high values of BFI and UFI in Wales (North East Wales: BFI 299733.70; South\
    \ East Wales: UFI 7.06) \nand low values of both indices in Sardinia, and (ii)\
    \ likely correlation between BFI, UFI and EMS. On the whole, the coastal areas\
    \ \nappear as the most fragmented, and measures may be planned to reconnect patches\
    \ and allow the target species’ movement. \nFurthermore, soil loss in rural and\
    \ agrarian areas could be avoided by using urban eco-friendly planning measures.\

    \ of both sections. \nIntegrative air samples are collected by multipoint sampling\
    \ using a grid of critical glass capillaries and directed to the analytics \n\
    situated in a trailer in the central section. Gas samples from the experimental\
    \ sections, in-between area and background site are \nextracted sequentially,\
    \ using a selector switch and analysed for NH3, CH4 and CO2 by CRDS (Picarro Inc.)\
    \ and for the tracer \ngases by GC-ECD (Agilent Technologies). \nSystematic validation\
    \ experiments with different dosing variants demonstrate the suitability for both\

    \ The accuracy of the tracer ratio method was demonstrated by CH4 dosing \nexperiments\
    \ and the uncertainty of the tracer ratio method shown to be in the 3-10 % range,\
    \ superior to existing alternative \napproaches. Cross-contamination between the\

    \ In field measurements, ghg emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) from the ground level\
    \ of a typical \ndairy open lot in Beijing was surveyed by closed chambers in\

    \ respectively. Compared with \nunpaved soil floor, higher CO2 and NH3 emitted\
    \ from the brick-paved floor. Via N2O and NH3volatilization, 1.6%-8.6% of total\
    \ \nnitrogen in the manure lost in the latter 12 hours of experimental duration.\
    \ \nNaturally Ventilated Stables: Emission Measurements Combining Open-Path Lasers\
    \ And Anemometers \nPhilippe Van Overbeke1, Shaojie Zhuang1, Sabrina Curial2,\
    \ Eva Brusselman1, Peter Demeyer1 \n1ILVO,Technology and Food Science Unit, Belgium;\
    \ 2ILVO, Animal Sciences Unit, Belgium \nCurrently available ammonia emission\
    \ measuring techniques for naturally ventilated stables rely on assumptions such\
    \ as \nhomogeneous gas distribution or slow temporal fluctuation. Such assumptions\
    \ are often difficult to verify under practical conditions \n \n \n \n84 \nand\
    \ raise questions concerning measurement uncertainties. Therefore, there is a\
    \ need for a technique that delivers both spatially \ndetailed and dynamic information\
    \ on flows and gas concentrations under practice conditions. However, as there\
    \ is no golden \nstandard, it is essential that this technique is validated in\
    \ the best way possible. \nFor this purpose a naturally ventilated dairy cattle\
    \ stable was equipped with 16 ultrasonic anemometers (2D and 3D) spread \nacross\
    \ the openings of the building envelope. Each of them was linked to a representative\
    \ ventilation opening surface area to \ncalculate total in- and outflowrate. Four\
    \ open-path lasers (OP-TDL) were installed at the major ventilation openings to\
    \ capture \nthe NH3 concentrations. To gain more insight into the heterogeneity\
    \ of the NH3 distribution, four automated retractable reflectors \nwere placed\
    \ in the path of the laser in the ridge, effectively dividing this path into sub-segments.\
    \ The windscreens at both side \nvents were manually controlled according to the\
    \ expert judgement of the farmer. \nTo justify the reliability of the proposed\
    \ method, the equivalence between total measured inflow and outflow was assessed.\
    \ Large \ndifferences between both flows were found. Possible causes and solutions\
    \ will be discussed. The open-path laser set-up in \ncombination with the ultrasonic\
    \ sensors showed the ridge opening to be a relatively steady environment even\
    \ under changing \nmeteorological conditions. Therefore a less complex set-up\
    \ is possible in the ridge. However, measurements at the side vents \nseem much\
    \ more susceptible to changes in wind speed and direction and possibly need a\
    \ more detailed approach. Issues \nconcerning the practical implementation of\
    \ this set-up are discussed. \nApplication Of Best Available Technique (BAT) For\

    \ \nInfluence Of Wind Direction And Sampling Strategy On The Estimation Of Ammonia\
    \ Emissions In Naturally \nVentilated Barns \nDavid Janke, Diliara Willink, Sabrina\
    \ Hempel, Christian Ammon, Barbara Amon, Thomas Amon \nLeibniz Institute for Agricultural\
    \ Engineering and Bioeconomy, Potsdam, Germany \nAmmonia and greenhouse gases\
    \ have a negative impact on our environmental live. The most important agricultural\
    \ sources of \npollutants are cattle housing systems, where dairy cattle housing\
    \ systems are mainly naturally ventilated. Estimating emissions \nfor naturally\
    \ ventilated barns (NVB) is challenging due to a great number of influencing factors.\
    \ Especially the direct coupling of \nthe inside flow regime with the ambient,\
    \ turbulent weather conditions makes it hard to measure the air exchange rate\
    \ and the \nemissions. Often, the measurement setup is designed to cover only\
    \ the main wind direction. In case of deviating wind directions, \nthe measured\
    \ values are neglected, which extends the duration of the measurement campaign\
    \ in order to have a sufficiently \nlarge dataset. \nTo overcome this limitation,\
    \ we equipped an NVB in northern Germany with an extensive setup, making it measureable\
    \ for every \nwind direction. More than 900 m sampling lines in- and outside the\
    \ barn with critical orifices every 5 -10 m were installed. Gases \nlike ammonia\
    \ (NH3), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured in parallel with\
    \ two Fourier-Transformations-\nInfrared-Spectrometer (FTIR) devices. Hourly emission\
    \ factors for NH3 over a period of more than 200 days were derived by \nusing\
    \ the CO2 balance method and two different sampling methods for inside-outside\
    \ concentrations. \nThe results show a gain in usable data up to 190% when also\
    \ taking into account wind conditions that deviate from the main wind \ndirection.\
    \ The derived emission factors strongly depend on the choice of the sampling line\
    \ according to the wind direction. A first \nanalysis shows differences of the\
    \ NH3 emission factors for different wind directions between -2.23 g/h and +0.23\
    \ g/h per livestock \nunit. Further investigation needs to be done to identify\
    \ the correlation of wind direction, ambient temperature and emission factors.\
    \ \nLegal Requirements on Ammonia and Greenhouse Gas Emission from Animal Production\
    \ Buildings in \nEuropean Countries \nBjarne Bjerg \nUniversity of Copenhagen,\
    \ Denmark \nAmmonia and greenhouse gas emission from animal production buildings\
    \ can be reduced by converting to low-emission housing \nsystems, by use of effective\
    \ abatement technologies, and by changes in the feed composition. These options\
    \ are usually \nassociated with additional costs, which makes farmers less motivated\
    \ to make use of them, and therefore additional incentives \nmight be necessary\
    \ to force a reduction of the emissions. Legislation is a well-known approach\
    \ to obtain an aim-directed \ndevelopment. Some countries have already substantial\
    \ experiences with legal requirements on ammonia emission from animal \nproduction\
    \ buildings. One experience is that legislation can be an important driver for\
    \ development and testing of new abatement \ntechnologies. Experiences also show\
    \ that it is demanding to develop and administrate the requirements, and that\
    \ there exist large \n \n \n \n85 \ndissimilarities between specific requirements\
    \ set by different countries. In addition, it is assessed that mayor advantages\
    \ may be \narchived by utilizing experiences from other countries to improve existing\
    \ legislation, or to develop appropriate legal requirements \nin countries, which\
    \ not already have such. Therefore, this work aims to review legal requirements\
    \ on ammonia and greenhouse \ngas emissions from animal production buildings in\
    \ European countries. \nThe review was conducted though contributions from experts\
    \ in each of the 27 countries participating in the COST Action \n“Ammonia and\

    \ \nNeubrandenbur, University of Applied Science, Germany \nThe teat of a dairy\
    \ cow is exposed to a large load during milking because it is the interface between\
    \ the udder and the liner in the \nmilking process. This results in a fatigue\
    \ of the teat tissue, especially the teat skin, and can lead to teat damages.\
    \ The aim of this \nstudy was to test the usability of the suction method for\
    \ teat skin elasticity measurements to get a better understanding of the teat\
    \ \nliner interface. The usability of the different measuring parameters was analysed\
    \ as well. During the present investigation, the \nCutometer® dual MPA 580 was\
    \ used to investigate the teat skin elasticity of the right rear teats from 101\
    \ cows. Measurements \nwere carried out in a side-by-side milking parlour before\
    \ and after milking using the measuring time-strain mode (suction period \nabout\
    \ 1 second followed by a 1-second suction-off relaxation period; 450 mbar of suction)\
    \ of the Cutometer® dual MPA 580. The \npenetration depth of the skin and the\
    \ gross elasticity were analysed. Descriptive statistics of both traits were calculated.\
    \ The \npenetration depth of the skin before and after milking ranged between\
    \ 0.50 mm and 2.86 mm and 0.50 mm and 2.82 mm, \nrespectively. The gross elasticity\
    \ before and after milking was around 26%, respectively and ranges between 0.4%\
    \ and 90.6% \nbefore milking and between 20% and 84% after milking. Based on the\
    \ results of our study we concluded that the Cutometer® \ndual MPA 580 is generally\
    \ usable to measure teat skin elasticity. The penetration depth of the skin seems\
    \ to be an important \nparameter. In conclusion, a combination of several parameters\
    \ could be most suitable to evaluate teat skin elasticity. Further \nstudies are\
    \ needed to validate the method. The influence of anatomical, physiological, and\
    \ technical factors on teat skin elasticity \nshould be investigated as well.\

    Assessing body condition (BC) of dairy cows is a way to collect information about\
    \ their fat reserves, which is essential for effective \nfeeding management. 3D\
    \ vision-technology might offer the opportunity to automatically and frequently\
    \ assess BC. Daily \nmonitoring provides a short feedback-loop of changes in fat\
    \ reserves. Hence, feedings strategies can be optimized which is \nbeneficial\
    \ from an economic (lower costs), environmental (lower emissions) and animal welfare\
    \ (lower disease incidences) \nperspective. This study aimed to determine whether\
    \ visual scores or subcutaneous fat thickness measurement is better to design\
    \ \na system using 3D vision-technology to predict BC scores. \nCows (n=46) ranging\
    \ in BC score on a 5-point-scale from 1 (lean) to 5 (fat) were preselected on\
    \ four farms. For eight body parts, \nBC scores (1-5) given by two observers independently\
    \ via visual observation and subcutaneous fat thicknesses (mm) measured \nby ultrasound\
    \ were related with corresponding 3D variables. The three methodologies were conducted\
    \ twice on two consecutive \ndays. \nOnly two body parts, i.e. sacral ligament\
    \ and line between spinous process and tips of short ribs could be assessed by\
    \ all three \nmethodologies (ultrasound was limiting). The inter- and intra-observer\
    \ agreement (kappa) for visual observation ranged from 0.52 \nto 0.71 and 0.50\
    \ to 0.69 for the two body parts respectively. Correlation coefficients between\
    \ days for the two body parts were \n0.72 and 0.88 for subcutaneous fat thickness\
    \ and 0.91 and 0.96 for 3D vision variables. Furthermore, 3D vision variables\
    \ of the \ntwo body parts correlated better with visual observations (range 0.79-0.88)\
    \ than with subcutaneous fat thickness (range 0.55-\n0.69). \nDespite the high\
    \ precision of the ultrasound device, this method appeared labour intensive and\
    \ only delivered useful information \nfor two body parts. Instead visual observations\
    \ were made on all eight body parts and showed better potential for predictive\
    \ BC \nmodels using 3D vision variables. \nComparison of Grazing Behaviour of\

    \ extracted features \non grazing identification and compare the consistency of\
    \ the selected features across various SSH; 3) validate the robustness by \nusing\
    \ classifiers trained from the dataset with specific SSH to distinguish the grazing\
    \ activity on the datasets from different SSH. \nExperimental results revealed\
    \ that 1) our approach achieved high classification accuracy on all the epochs\
    \ regardless of SSH; 2) \nMean of accelerometer Z-axis, Entropy of accelerometer\
    \ Y-axis, Entropy of accelerometer Z-axis, Mean of gyroscope X-axis and \nMean\
    \ of gyroscope Y-axis were the top 5 features that contributed most in classifying\
    \ the grazing versus non-grazing activities \nand there were consistent trends\
    \ in features across the three SSH; 3) there was enough robustness when the trained\
    \ LDA \nclassifier on a specific SSH was used to classify behavior on different\
    \ SSH. Overall, our research confirmed that IMU sensors \n \n \n \n86 \ncan be\
    \ a very effective tool for identifying the grazing behaviour of sheep and there\
    \ is enough robustness to use a trained LDA \nclassifier on a specific pasture\

    \ Berlin, Germany \nThe measurement of the respiration rate (RR) in cattle is\
    \ an important tool to monitor the health status. Thus, the RR is an \nindispensable\
    \ tool for the stress detection, especially heat stress. Heat stress leads to\
    \ a deviation of the normal RR and results \nin a decrease of milk production\
    \ and fertility. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the RR can help to detect\
    \ heat stress early and \nthus to initiate timely counteractive measurements to\
    \ minimize physical stress. The most common method to measure the RR in \ncattle\
    \ is to count the flank movement visually. However, this method is time-consuming\
    \ and labor-intensive. In addition, the \ncontinuous measurement of the RR is\
    \ difficult to implement and can be physically strenuous. Therefore, a device,\
    \ based on a \npressure sensor, which is able to record RR automatically and continuously\
    \ has been developed to make long-term studies \npossible. The aim of this study\
    \ was to validate the data measured by the device with the help of a reference\
    \ method. The reference \nmethod was the counting of the flank movements of a\
    \ total of six cows (Holstein-Friesian). The rear flank movements of each \ncow\
    \ were recorded by a camera and counted independently of the device by an observer.\
    \ Eight recordings of one minute each \nwere made per cow. The data analysis was\
    \ divided into three areas of activity: standing, lying and dozing. A total of\
    \ 48 RR-\nmeasurements of the device were compared with the counted frequencies\
    \ of the video recording. The results were highly \ncorrelated during standing\
    \ (r = 0.99, R2= 0.99 n=20), lying (r= 0.98, R2= 0.96, n=15) and dozing (r=0 .92,\
    \ R2= 0.85, n=13). The \nevaluation shows that the device is suitable for automated\
    \ RR counting. A marketable further development of the device is \nplanned. \n\

    \ \nUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison, United States of America \nThe present\
    \ study summarizes our recent efforts to design permanent chambers capable of\
    \ simulating production conditions \ninside dairy houses so that reliable data\
    \ pertaining to gas emissions could be collected. We considered replicate chambers,\
    \ \nconstructed at a selected research facility, in conjunction with an instrumentation\
    \ system capable of measuring the mass flux of \ngasses through such chambers.\
    \ To determine the best locations in which to place sensors and thereby identify\
    \ best practices \nintended to reduce the amount of gasses emitted by dairy cows\
    \ (and also to test mitigation strategies), we developed a \ncomputational fluid\
    \ dynamics model capable of assessing the mixing patterns that gas species would\
    \ form within the chambers. \nThis work was followed by the creation of a comprehensive\
    \ computational model of a commercial dairy holding area, a model \ncapable of\
    \ predicting the biological generation of heat and gas species. The model also\
    \ considered gas and thermal energy \nproduction and was evaluated with experimental\
    \ data pertaining to air speed and velocity as well as ammonia and methane \n\
    concentrations. To evaluate the effects of design changes and optimization, the\
    \ velocity, temperature, and gas concentrations \nwithin the animal occupied zone\
    \ (AOZ) were computationally investigated, and the outcomes derived from modelling\
    \ cases were \ncompared to the experimental data. The final iterations of the\
    \ model could be used to improve dairy housing design and provide \naccurate assessments\
    \ of ghgs and the volumes of ammonia and methane emitted from a dairy house and,\
    \ potentially, the related \nmitigation strategies. \nAnalysis of Factors Affecting\

    \ de València, Spain \nReducing crude protein is a recommended technique to reduce\
    \ nitrogen excretion and ammonia emissions. Greenhouse gas \nemissions from slurry\
    \ are also affected by nutrient composition. However, it is still needed to evaluate\
    \ the interactions among \nnutrients using commercial-like feed compositions.\
    \ The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of different diets on\
    \ \nnitrogen (N) and energy balances. A total of 13 diets were evaluated in digestibility\
    \ trials using 78 animals. Diets were formulated \nto fulfil commercial standards,\
    \ although differing in ingredient composition. Nutrient intake, excretion and\
    \ potential NH3 and CH4 \n(Biochemical methane potential) emissions from slurry\
    \ were measured. Animal weight was also monitored. Correlations between \nemissions\
    \ and nutrient balance components were done. An analysis of variance was conducted\
    \ to assess differences in nutrient \nbalance of low, medium and high emitting\
    \ animals. For the N balance, a two-fold range in faeces to urine N excretion\
    \ ratio was \nfound throughout the experiments, even considering the low crude\
    \ protein variations (from 15 to 16%). This was related to the \nammonia emissions\
    \ from slurry (r = -0.59, p<0.001). In fact, the amount of crude protein ingested\
    \ to increase 1 kg of metabolic \nweight was positively correlated with the associated\
    \ emissions (r=0.58, p<0.001). The difference between animals associated \nwith\
    \ high or low NH3 emissions per weight gain was therefore related to urine losses\
    \ due to excess N intake. The energy balance \nshows that methane potential from\
    \ slurry was mainly related to the excretion of indigested feed components, mainly\
    \ the fibrous \nfraction (particularly the soluble fibre). When expressed per\
    \ body weight increase, it was clear that animals emitting high amounts \nof methane\
    \ were those with higher dry matter and energy ingestion. The results of this\
    \ study demonstrate relevant nutrition effects \non N and energy balances even\
    \ at diets formulated according to commercial standards. \n \n \n \n \n \n87 \n\

    \ the relationships between feed composition, litter characteristics and ammonia\
    \ \nemission from broiler houses. The study consisted of model development on\
    \ one side and experimental studies on the other side. \nThe study included a\
    \ total of four complete broiler production rounds in two climate chambers. In\
    \ these climate chambers \ntemperature, relative humidity and ventilation rate\
    \ could be accurately controlled. In order to create differences in dry matter\
    \ and \nammonium content of excreted faeces or the excreta, diets with different\
    \ potassium and protein content were fed. Each climate \nchamber had 8 pens (area:\
    \ 1.5 m2) with litter (white wood shavings: 2 kg/m2) for 25 broilers. The length\
    \ of the production period \nwas 35 days in the first three rounds and 42 days\
    \ in the last round. Ammonia emission was determined at days 20/21, 27/28, \n\
    34/35, and 41/42 (only round 4) of the growing period, with the so-called dynamic\
    \ box method. The following litter characteristics \nwere determined on these\
    \ days: pH, temperature, dry matter, total (Ntot) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N)\
    \ content. From the \nresults the following main conclusions were drawn: 1) the\
    \ following variables had main effects on ammonia emission from the \nlitter:\
    \ pH, friability of the litter and the dynamic box flow rate (P <0.001). The effects\
    \ of temperature (P = 0.032) and Ntot content \n( P = 0.078) of the litter were\
    \ less strong. The effect of NH4-N content was not significant (P = 0.383); 2)\
    \ The ammonia emission \ncould not be very well predicted with the current model.\
    \ Better insight is required into the rate of uric acid conversion and the rate\
    \ \nat which the ammonia volatiles from the litter depending on pH and friability\

    \ emissions emanate from the slurry pit in fully slatted pig houses. Especially\
    \ in ground channel ventilated \n(GCV) designs, direct flow of incoming air into\
    \ the slurry pit can further promote ammonia transport into the pig house. Therefore,\
    \ \na CFD based ammonia emission model of a GCV pig house was developed to better\
    \ understand the key factors that affect \nammonia release and transport from\
    \ emitting sources depending on the airflow pattern and the ventilation rate.\
    \ Since CFD \nprovides detailed spatial velocity, temperature and pollutant distribution\
    \ at minimal costs. Ammonia emission was modelled as a \nuser defined function\
    \ (UDF) at the first cell zone at the slurry pit and pen floor. The slatted floor\
    \ was modelled as porous media \nand pigs at the animal occupied zone as semi-cylinders.\
    \ The model was validated for airflow pattern (from smoke tests), \ntemperature\
    \ and ammonia concentration distribution using experimental data at the ground\
    \ channel inlet, the slurry pit and the \nexhaust duct. The CFD model predicted\

    \ The CFD model generally under predicted slurry pit \nheadspace temperature in\

    \ for livestock, and quantify emission of ammonia and greenhouse gases, it is\
    \ essential to \nunderstand indoor air characteristics with respect to ventilation\
    \ openings in naturally ventilated livestock buildings. The objectives \nof this\
    \ study were to investigate the influence of the sidewall opening size and location\
    \ on indoor airflow patterns and airflow \ncharacteristics within the animal occupied\
    \ zone (AOZ), above the floor and the effects on gas emission and dispersion properties.\
    \ \nThis study was carried out in a large boundary layer wind tunnel and with\
    \ a scaled dairy barn model. Eight cases with different \nopening ratios and opening\
    \ locations were designed and tested under cross-ventilation conditions. Air velocities\
    \ inside the scaled \nmodel were measured with a 2D Laser Doppler Anemometer.\
    \ The results showed that when the openings were positioned at the \ntop and the\
    \ opening ratio was no greater than 62.7%, a ‘ceiling-attaching’ airflow pattern\
    \ was observed. The incoming air went \nacross the AOZ without circulating with\
    \ the surrounding air when the sidewall heights were below the AOZ height. This\
    \ airflow \npattern was better for removing gaseous emissions from the AOZ but\
    \ might increase total ammonia release rate and thus give \nnegative effects on\
    \ gas removal efficiency when applying a partial pit air exhaust. Besides, it\
    \ was found that the concentration of \nthe air contaminant behind the building\
    \ was affected by the opening size and unaffected by the opening location, and\
    \ the plume \nwidth was not influenced by the sidewall openings. \nChallenges\

    \ & Research, The Netherlands \nTo abate ammonia emissions from livestock production\
    \ processes has been a prevailing topic for researchers and policy makers. \n\
    To quantify the effects of the best available technologies for ammonia emission\
    \ abatement, feeding and management, it is \nimperative to predict the ammonia\
    \ emissions appropriately since online monitoring is almost impossible for commercial\
    \ farms. A \ndynamic model was developed by Dr. Aarnink for ammonia emissions\
    \ predictions in Netherland. During the modeling processes, \nthe mass transfer\
    \ coefficient of ammonia should be given, which was borrowed from a literature\
    \ in 1920s. This paper is to use \nthe Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to re-determine\
    \ the mass transfer coefficient model. First, we would like to identify if \n\
    there is a big difference between the one used in the dynamic prediction model\
    \ and the one developed from CFD simulations. If \nthe difference is obvious,\
    \ then how it could affect the results of ammonia emission predictions. Some simulations\
    \ have been \nconducted and challenges have been found in CFD modelling, which\
    \ includes the determination of the boundary conditions, \n \n \n \n88 \nunsteady\

    \ Among the important factors in achieving improved efficiency is the provision\

    \ In Greece we have very few data concerning \nthe internal environment and the\

    \ assess the environmental footprint \nof livestock facilities through a sustainable\
    \ reduction of released air pollutants and ghgs along with a decrease in energy\
    \ \nconsumption. This will be achieved through an integrated approach aimed at\

    \ Research, The Netherlands \nReducing the impact of diseases in growing pigs\
    \ can be achieved if susceptible pigs are timely identified before infections\
    \ are \npresent. Effective interventions can then be implemented, thus reducing\
    \ the damage of infections. It is not yet clear which \npredictors are most informative\
    \ with respect to the damage of infection in pigs. \nTo identify pigs that are\
    \ more susceptible to develop severe disease symptoms, different host-related\
    \ indicators were tested to \npredict disease severity after an experimental co-infection.\
    \ A data set was used of 14 pigs that were infected with PRRSv and \none week\
    \ later with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Average, variance and level changes\
    \ after specific events (weaning, \nPRRSv-infection) were calculated for different\
    \ repetitive physiologic measurements (rectal temperature, growth, blood cell/serum\
    \ \nexaminations) acquired prior to and between both infections. The pigs were\
    \ also subjected individually to a backtest, to assess \ntheir coping strategy.\
    \ A standardized patho-histological assessment of the lungs was performed to quantify\
    \ the impact of the co-\ninfection. Regression analysis was performed with the\
    \ severity of disease as dependent variable and each physiologic indicator \n\
    (i.e average, variance of rectal temperature) considered as explanatory variable.\
    \ \nLower average levels of white blood cell count (p<0.05), lymphocytes (p<0.001),\
    \ NK cells (p<0.01), naive T cells(p<0.05) and \nmemory cells (p<0.001) prior\
    \ to both infection, showed significant higher patho-histological score after\
    \ A. pleuropneumoniae \ninfection. A higher PRRS virus clearance in the blood\
    \ was predictive for a lower patho-histological score after A. \npleuropneumoniae\
    \ infection (p<0.05). Furthermore, a low-resistor coping strategy was associated\
    \ with a higher clinical impact of \ndisease (p<0.05). Temperature and growth\
    \ features prior to infections were not predictive. \nThese results are a first\
    \ step to identify predictors for the impact of disease in growing pigs. With\
    \ reliable predictors of disease \nsusceptibility, timely interventions can result\
    \ in higher health and welfare, as well as optimal productivity. \nBroiler Health\

    \ housed in large groups making it difficult for the farmer to monitor all animals\
    \ in a precise way. This \nwork is a preliminary study with the aim to identify\
    \ sneezing sounds in an automatic manner. Sneezing sounds occur when \nchickens\
    \ have respiratory issues due to for example certain diseases or sub optimal climate\
    \ in the farm. A group of 51 Ross 308 \nbroiler chickens were housed in two different\
    \ plastic cages (1 m x 3 m: 36 animals and 1 m x 1 m: 15 animals) in the same\
    \ room \n(5 m x 4 m). At 27 days old the chicks were vaccinated by a conventional\
    \ Newcastle vaccine with the knowledge that respiratory \ndisturbances occur common\
    \ using this vaccine. Monophonic sound was monitored continuously in the room\
    \ during the full \nexperiment. To develop the algorithm 85 minutes of data were\
    \ labelled exhaustively. Of this 85 minutes 65 were used for training \nthe algorithm\
    \ (78 sneezes) and 20 minutes were used for validating the algorithm (75 sneezes).\
    \ A basic algorithm first identified \npossible sneezing events by selecting the\
    \ moments where the energy of the sound signal between 9 000 – 12 000 Hz exceeded\
    \ \nan adaptive threshold. Second the algorithm calculated different time and\
    \ frequency domain features for every event that was \nidentified. Lastly, classification\
    \ was performed by manually adjusting the threshold on the different features.\
    \ The event detection \nstep yielded 1994 events and after classification 9.3%\
    \ of the sneezes were detected. No false positives were detected, 90.6% of \n\
    the sneezes were falsely classified as not a sneeze. The algorithm yields a high\
    \ precision (100%), however, the recall (9.3%) is \nlow due to the many sneezing\
    \ events falsely classified. Looking at the results it is possible to detect sneezing\
    \ of broiler chickens \nin an automated way. \nEvaluating Pig Ear Skin Temperature:\

    \ of two batches of animal in intercontinental \ntransport and housing was registered\
    \ and characterized by the use of phase space diagram methodology. \nEleven pigs\
    \ were monitored during transport from a farm located in Reston (Canada), until\
    \ their arrival at a farm in Montiel (Spain) \nduring the month of May 2016. After\
    \ the itinerary by airplane and trucks separated with rest housing, pigs arrived\
    \ to the farm after \n94 hours. Fourteen finishers were monitored in one pen on\
    \ a breeding farm in Villatobas (Spain) during one week in June 2017. \nTo measure\
    \ ear skin pig temperature, one logger with sensor of temperature (iButton DS1923)\
    \ was glued to the RFID tag of each \npig and placed on the inside half of the\
    \ left ear. The areas and centroids of the phase space diagrams of ear skin temperatures\
    \ \nwere used to quantify the variability of the time temperature series. It was\
    \ considered analysis of full times series and time series \nby periods (transport\
    \ modality, transport transfers and day and night). The time series pattern for\
    \ each individual was analyzed \nindependently in order to identify differences\
    \ between animals of the same batch. \nThe thermal variability between animals\
    \ of the same batch was higher during transport than those identified in housed\
    \ animals. \nThe maximum area for an animal during transport was more than twice\
    \ the maximum area for housed animals; however, the \nvalues of minimum areas\

    \ pigs tend to lie on the side with their limbs extended while, in lower \ntemperatures\
    \ they will adopt a sternal or belly lying posture. Image processing, as a cheap,\
    \ non-contact and non-stressful \ntechnique, along with data classifiers has been\
    \ widely used in recent years to monitor individual and group pig behaviours.\
    \ So, \nthe aim of this study was to determine whether two-dimensional image can\
    \ be used for side and belly lying posture detection in \ngroup pigs under commercial\
    \ farm conditions. An image processing algorithm with SVM classifier were applied\
    \ in this work. Pigs \nwere monitored by top view RGB cameras and animals were\

    \ Hannu Haapala3 \n1Natural Resources Institute Finland, Finland; 2Finnish Environment\
    \ Institute SYKE, Finland; 3Agrinnotech, Finland \nAmmonia emissions from dairy\
    \ barns depend on several variable factors, most importantly on indoor temperature,\
    \ ventilation, \nmanure composition (type, nitrogen content and pH), manure handling\
    \ method used, and the quality and quantity of litter. National \nFinnish emission\
    \ model for nitrogen compounds, however, has been developed on the basis of international\
    \ guidelines. In order \nto check and improve the reliability of these calculations,\
    \ a sufficient number of domestic emission measurements is needed. \nIn this study,\
    \ ammonia emissions were measured in six different dairy barns in four seasons.\
    \ Continuous measuring data loggers \nwere used and the measurements were done\
    \ during one-week measuring periods. The measured results were compared to \n\
    those of the national emission model. \nThe ammonia emissions measured varied\
    \ considerably both between seasons and barns, being mainly less than 5 g / cow\
    \ / day \nin loose housing. In stationary barns, ammonia emissions were on average\
    \ less than 3.5 g / cow / day. \nThe share of volatile ammonium nitrogen calculated\
    \ from the ammonium content of manure varied between 1% and 17%. The \nmean value\
    \ for free stall barns was 5.5%. This is significantly lower than the 17.6% calculated\
    \ with the emission model. The \nmean value for stationary barns, 9.3%, was, in\
    \ turn, higher than the <6% calculated by the model. \nThe measured ammonia concentrations\
    \ were lower than those previously measured in comparable circumstances. In Finland,\
    \ \nrelatively few ammonia emission measurements have previously been made on\
    \ animal housing and none during all seasons. \nThe results obtained also give\
    \ new information on the seasonal variations in emissions. \nStill, the results\
    \ represent only few measurements and locations and their use is limited. In addition,\
    \ a new kind of measurement \nmethod has been used and it should be further assessed\

    \ Slatted Floor \nHendrik Jan Van Dooren, Nico Ogink, Johan Van Riel, Julio Mosquera\
    \ \nWageningen Livestock Research, The Netherlands  \nIn Dutch emission regulation\
    \ grazing of dairy cows is rewarded with an ammonia emission reduction of 5%.\
    \ This reduction is \nbased on Monteny et al. 2001. They estimated the ammonia\
    \ emission reduction from housing at 2.4% per hour grazing. However, \nrecent\
    \ measurements to proof validity of current ammonia emission effect of grazing\
    \ from modern dairy housing are lacking. \nThe reduction of ammonia emission from\
    \ housing during grazing is based on the assumption that after the cows leaves\
    \ the barn, \nthe floor emission will decrease to a stable level within a few\
    \ hours, representing the contribution of the slurry pit to the total \nammonia\
    \ emission. Upon return of the cows the emission will increase again to the emission\
    \ level prior to the grazing period. \nBoth decrease and increase can be described\
    \ with an exponential function. \nGoal of the research was to investigate the\
    \ decrease and increase patterns of ammonia emission from dairy housing due to\
    \ \ngrazing and to establish to pit contribution to the total ammonia emission.\
    \ \nResearch was done in four identical measurement units of Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden,\
    \ The Netherlands. These units housed \n15 lactating dairy cows each and were\
    \ mechanically ventilated. Grazing was simulated by removing the cows from a unit\
    \ for one \nweek. All other circumstances were kept equal. In two rounds each\
    \ unit received two times the treatment grazing. In each unit \nammonia concentrations\
    \ of incoming and outgoing air and were measured using a Teledyne T200 NOx analyser.\
    \ \nAnalyses of daily emission results showed that ammonia emission started to\
    \ reach a stable level from the third day after cows \nremoval. Reduction of ammonia\
    \ emission was around 1% per hour grazing resulting in an emission reduction per\
    \ year of 2.6%. \nFurther analyses of emission results on hourly basis will improve\
    \ estimates of ammonia emission reduction. \nElevated Feeding Stalls To Reduce\
    \ Soiled Area In Dairy Housing: First Results From Comparable Ammonia \nEmission\
    \ Measurements \nSabine Schrade1, Kerstin Zeyer2, Joachim Mohn2, Frederik Hildebrandt1,\
    \ Michael Zaehner1 \n1Agroscope, Switzerland; 2Empa, Switzerland \nIn the case\
    \ of a raised standing surface with partitions - so-called feeding stalls - the\
    \ cows are guided at the feeding place in such \na way that very little excrement\
    \ accumulates on the platform. Further, feeding animals are not disturbed by the\
    \ scraper when \ndung removal occurs at more frequent intervals. Therefore, the\
    \ heavily soiled area is reduced, which should lead to lower \nammonia emissions.\
    \ Aim of this study was to quantify ammonia emissions of a dairy housing system\
    \ with feeding stalls in \ncomparison to a reference. \nThe investigations were\
    \ carried out in the experimental dairy housing for emission measurements in Tänikon\
    \ (Switzerland). The \nhousing consists of two experimental compartments – each\
    \ for 20 dairy cows. The two spatial separated housing compart¬ments \nenable\
    \ comparable measurement conditions (e.g. climatic conditions) on a practical\
    \ scale. In one compartment, the feeding area \nwas constructed with elevated\
    \ feeding stalls with partitions at every second place, whilst the reference compartment\
    \ was \nequipped without feeding stalls. To determine emissions under natural\
    \ ventilation, a tracer-ratio method with two tracer gases \nwas used (Mohn et\
    \ al. 2018). To describe each measurement situation and further aspects of the\
    \ investigated system, relevant \n \n \n \n91 \naccompanying parameters were recorded\
    \ (e.g. climate, milk urea and urine urea content, feed data, soiling of aisles\
    \ and feeding \nstalls, feeding behavior). Measurements over three seasons covered\
    \ climatic variations in the course of the year. \nFirst ammonia emission calculations\
    \ for the sub-variant with twelve dung removal events per day and outdoor exercise\
    \ area show \nclear seasonal effects: emissions in summer were higher than in\
    \ the transition period and in winter. The ammonia emission \nreduction effect\
    \ of feeding stalls was highest in the transition period with 19% and in winter\
    \ with 16% but distinctly lower in summer \nwith 8% (means over four days). \n\
    A Novel Method with Improved Accuracy to Determine The Reduction Potential for\
    \ AmmoniaoOf Innovative \nDairy Cow House Floor Systems \nGert-Jan Monteny \n\
    Monteny Milieu Advies, The Netherlands  \nA private initiative, Meet-ID (www.meetid.nl),\
    \ was developed to assess the reduction potential for ammonia emissions of \n\
    innovative abatement solutions for dairy cow barns. This method consists of a\
    \ case/control set-up under laboratory conditions, \nwhere all emission influencing\
    \ factors, except the innovation, are controlled and kept constant on practical\
    \ average values. \nTwo separate compartments of 3.0 * 3.7 m each were constructed,\
    \ representing an approximately 10 m2 section of a dairy cow \nhouse. Each compartment\
    \ consists of a slurry pit (0.8 m depth). A pre-fouled traditional slatted floor\
    \ is placed on top of the first \ncompartment (‘control’), whereas an pre-fouled\
    \ innovative floor system (‘case’) is put on top of the second. Prior to the emission\
    \ \nmeasurements, both floors are treated with fresh dairy cow faeces (10 kg)\
    \ and fresh dairy urine (10 L), to mimic cow’s urination \nand defeacation behaviour.\
    \ Slurry, feaces, and urine are sampled before each measurement, and analyzed.\
    \ Mechanically \nventilated (0.15 m/s) Lindvall-boxes are lowered directly after,\
    \ and ammonia concentrations are continuously measured using a \nphoto-acoustic\
    \ monitor (QCL) over a period of 24 hours. Each treatment is repeated 4 times.\
    \ \nOutcomes are the cumulative ammonia emission during 14 hours, being the average\
    \ urine pool residence time on the floor in a \nmodern dairy cow barn. The cumulative\
    \ emission of the ‘case’ relative to the ‘control’ represents the emission reduction\

    \ Scientifique \nIn 2015, agriculture accounted for more than 90% (455 kt) of\
    \ all NH3 emissions in Canada. Livestock production was the largest \ncontributor;\
    \ emitting around 66% (300 kt) of the agricultural emissions. NH3 is mainly produced\
    \ by the degradation of the urea in \nurine. The contact between air and excreta\
    \ plays a key role in ammonia emissions from livestock buildings. Consequently,\
    \ the \nemission rate is closely related to the soiled floor surface. The objective\
    \ of this study was to reduce ammonia emissions from \nswine buildings using a\
    \ modified slat design profile. The new profile has a notch along the side of\
    \ the slat so that the manure will \ndrip directly in the pit without sliding\
    \ down the side in order to minimize the soiled area. Two control and two treatment\
    \ slat \nsections were placed in two pig rooms (16 pigs each) for 8 weeks. The\
    \ four soiled sections were then removed from the pig rooms \nand put in four\
    \ individual desorption chambers made of galvanized steel where NH3 emissions\
    \ were measured individually. \nAdditionally, emissions from an empty chamber\
    \ were measured to determine background levels. Airflow, NH3 concentration and\
    \ \ntemperature from each chamber were monitored on a regular basis. Emissions\
    \ were first monitored for seven days. The slats \nsamples were then exposed to\
    \ a washing process with pressurized water and reintroduced in the emission chambers\
    \ to measure \nthe NH3 emissions for an additional seven days with the aim to\
    \ evaluate the persistence of the emission reduction effect after a \ncleaning\
    \ process. The tests are currently in progress. Results will be introduced and\

    \ In Practice: Odour And Ammonia Removal Still A \nChallenge \nRoland Melse, Guus\
    \ Nijeboer, Nico Ogink \nWageningen Livestock Research, The Netherlands  \nIn\
    \ countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, air scrubber\
    \ technology is used at large scale to reduce \nemissions of ammonia, odour, and\
    \ particulate matter. The main types are single-stage acid scrubbers, biotrickling\
    \ filters, and \nmulti-stage scrubbers (or combi-scrubbers) that combine a water\
    \ spray section with either an acid or, in most cases, a biotrickling \nstep.\
    \ A survey was carried out in the Netherlands with the objective to evaluate odour\
    \ and ammonia removal performance level \nof scrubbers in practice. In total 48\
    \ farm locations were visited, without prior notice. Odour removal (30 min. sampling,\
    \ \nolfactometric) and ammonia removal (gas detection tubes) and pH and electrical\
    \ conductivity (EC) levels of the washing water \nwere determined. The results\
    \ show that odour an ammonia removal for acid scrubbers (n=16) and biotrickling\
    \ filters (n=3) were \nclose to assigned removal values in regulations. For combi-scrubbers\
    \ (n=29), however, an average reduction was found of 40% \nfor odour and 59% for\
    \ ammonia, whereas assigned regulatory levels amounted 70-85% for odour removal\
    \ and 85% for ammonia \nremoval. The low odour removal of combi-scrubbers might\
    \ partly be caused by systematic differences between the odour \nlaboratories\
    \ in this survey and laboratories that were involved in tests on which the assigned\
    \ removal capacities were based. \nEarlier research demonstrated strong differences\
    \ in removal capacity between laboratories evaluating the same air scrubbers,\
    \ \ndespite all of them using EN13725. Another factor could be better operation\
    \ conditions of air scrubbers during test programs \n(which regulatory levels\
    \ are based on) than during normal farm practice. For ammonia, low removal efficiencies\
    \ are expected to \nbe caused by operational parameters, although pH and EC levels\
    \ were mostly within normal range. It is concluded that the \nperformance level\
    \ of combi-scrubbers in practice are not meeting expectations, and that test procedures\
    \ with regards to odour \nremoval need improvement. \n \n \n \n92 \nPerformance\

    \ Denmark \nA two-step chemical air cleaner with an acid step and an alkaline\
    \ step was developed by Agrifarm as a part of their farm concept \nwith naturally\
    \ ventilation and partial pit ventilation. The air cleaner is designed to treat\
    \ pit ventilation air with high concentrations \nof ammonia and odorants from\
    \ facilities with pigs. The air cleaner is cylindrical, 2.8 m wide and 11 m high,\
    \ and with a capacity of \nca. 20,000 m3·h-1. \nThe first step is a packed bed\
    \ acid scrubber unit with recirculated diluted sulfuric acid kept at a pH of 2.2\
    \ that removes ammonia, \nother alkaline and water soluble gases. The second step\
    \ is a packed bed alkaline scrubber unit with recirculated diluted sodium \nhydroxide\
    \ with a pH of 9.8 that removes hydrogen sulfide and other acidic gases. \nThe\
    \ air cleaner was tested at a pig house for growing-finishing with partial pit\
    \ ventilation at 16 m3·h1·pig-place-1. The air cleaner \nwas tested over one year\
    \ according to the VERA protocol for test of air cleaners. Ammonia and carbon\
    \ dioxide were measured \nby infrared photo-acoustic spectrosco-py, odour by dynamic\
    \ olfactometry, and odorants by proton-transfer-reaction mass \nspectrometry.\
    \ The following odorants were measured: hydrogen sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, methanethiol,\
    \ carboxylic acids, phenols \nand indoles. \nThe ammonia and odour removal rates\
    \ were measured in an 8-weeks summer period and an 8-weeks winter period. The\
    \ average \nammonia removal was 90 percent, and 98 percent without down-time.\
    \ The average odour removal measured by olfactometry \nwas 72 percent. Mass spectrometry\
    \ showed that methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide were not removed, whereas the\
    \ removal rates \nfor carboxylic acids, phenols and indoles were 95 percent. Calculated\
    \ as the sum of odour activity values, the removal was around \n80 percent. \n\
    In conclusion, an effective chemical air cleaner has been developed that can treat\
    \ pit ventilation air from pig houses. \nEmission of Nitrous Acid (HNO2) and Other\
    \ Nitrogen (N) Compounds from Biotrickling Filters Treating \nExhaust Air of Pig\
    \ Houses \nRoland Melse, Johan Ploegaert \nWageningen Livestock Research, The\
    \ Netherlands  \nAir scrubbers are used for removal of ammonia (NH3) and other\
    \ compounds from exhaust air of mechanically ventilated animal \nhouses. In single-stage\
    \ biotrickling filters, and multi-stage scrubbers (combining a water spray section\
    \ with biotrickling), ammonia \nis converted to nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-),\
    \ and discharged with the waste water. In some cases an additional denitrification\
    \ \nstep is used. Such systems normally operate at near-neutral pH (6.5-7.5).\
    \ A field survey was carried out to investigate effects of \npH on emissions of\
    \ a range of nitrogen compounds. Samples of inlet and outlet air of biotrickling\
    \ filters were taken at 15 farm \nlocations and analysed for NH3 (gas detection\
    \ tubes), nitrous oxide (N2O) (gas chromotography) and nitrogen oxides or NOy\
    \ \n(chemiluminescence NOx analyser). Results show that systems running at normal\
    \ pH (n=3) had an average NH3 removal of 65% \nand low production of N2O and NOy.\
    \ Systems with added denitrification (n=4) had relatively high N2O emissions,\
    \ equalling 14% \nof all NH3-N removed. Systems operating at low pH (< 6.5) (n=6)\
    \ showed very high NOy emissions, equalling 61% of all NH3-N \nremoved. This appears\
    \ to be caused by evaporation of nitrous acid (HNO2), which is a volatile compound.\
    \ This reduced the \napparent N-removal of the scrubber system from 100% (as based\
    \ on NH3 only), to a net N-removal of 36%, if all N compounds \nare taken into\
    \ account. Systems with high pH (> 7.5) (n=2) showed low NH3 removal (22%) and\
    \ relatively high N2O production \n(71% of all NH3-N removed), but the net N-removal\
    \ was only slightly lower (19%). As scrubber performance (N-removal) is \ncommonly\
    \ estimated based on NH3 measurements only, the emission of other nitrogen compounds\
    \ might often remain unnoticed. \nIt is concluded that it is important to prevent\
    \ low pH conditions in biotrickling filters, as the net N-removal can be drastically\
    \ \naffected. \nAmmonia Emission From a Fattening Pig House With Partly Slatted\
    \ Floor During Warm Thermal Conditions \nKnut-Håkan Jeppsson, Anne-Charlotte Olsson\
    \ \nSwedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden \nOne of the most important\
    \ factors controlling ammonia emission from livestock buildings is area of floor\
    \ surface covered with \nurine and faeces. Due to reduced slurry pit area and\
    \ increased clean pen floor area, partly slatted floor pens for fattening pigs\
    \ \nhave shown lower levels of NH3 release compared to fully slatted floor pens.\
    \ However, studies with partially slatted floors have \nalso shown very high ammonia\
    \ release due to fouling in the pen. At warm thermal conditions, pigs spend more\
    \ time in the cooler \nplaces of the pen, which are usually the dunging areas.\
    \ They also use the lying area for excretion, which results in increased \nfouling\
    \ of the pen and impaired animal hygiene. The objective of the project is to test\
    \ technical solutions for improving pen hygiene \nin growing-finishing houses\
    \ by cooling the pigs during warm thermal conditions reducing the pen fouling.\
    \ Two technical solutions \nare investigated; showering the pigs with low-pressure\
    \ water sprinklers above the slatted floor, and convective cooling of the pigs\
    \ \nwith higher air velocity on the lying area. The research is carried out on\
    \ a commercial pig farm with 480 sows and 3 600 growing-\nfinishing places. The\
    \ pig house where the studies are performed consists of 10 identical compartments\
    \ with 16 pens per \ncompartment (160 pigs per compartment). During 10 batches\
    \ for two years, whith two compartments filled simultaneously, \nammonia emission,\
    \ pen hygiene and pig behaviour will be measured and analysed. NH3 and CO2 concentration\
    \ are measured \nusing a photo-acoustic multi-gas analyser 1412 and a multiplexer\
    \ 1309 (Lumasense Technologies S/A, Denmark). Ventilation \nrate is determined\
    \ with indirect CO2 tracer gas method calculated according to CIGR. Preliminary\
    \ data will be presented from \nthe measurements started in January 2017. The\
    \ project is part of the ERA-NET SusAn project PigSys. \nEnvironmental Footprint\
    \ Of Fattening Pigs: Do Including Agro-industrial By-products In Feed Mitigate\

    \ \n \n \n \n93 \nThe potential of nutritional strategies to mitigate environmental\
    \ impacts from pig production has been demonstrated. Previous \ndigestibility\
    \ tests using olive cake and citrus pulp have shown potential emission reductions\
    \ from slurry degradation. In this work, \nwe explored the gaseous emissions associated\
    \ with fattening pigs production following a LCA approach. Two agro-industry by-\n\
    products (citrus pulp and olive cake) were used for feed formulation by replacing\
    \ traditional ingredients such as barley and \nsunflower meal. Diets were formulated\
    \ following nutritional and commercial constraints achieving inclusion levels\
    \ up to 12% for \nolive cake and 24% for citrus pulp. The study on olive cake\
    \ was concluded, whereas the citrus pulp assay is ongoing and its \nresults will\
    \ be presented at the conference. A complete nutrient balance was performed and\
    \ potential emissions of NH3 and ghg \nfrom resulting slurries were determined\
    \ during two months. Carbon footprint from feed ingredients were obtained from\
    \ Ecoinvent \n3.01 Database. Introducing olive cake in diets did not affect productive\
    \ parameters either potential NH3 emissions. Potential CH4 \nemissions were slightly\
    \ reduced (by 13% expressed as potential emissions per animal) when introducing\
    \ olive cake in diets. \nContrastingly, carbon footprint of feeds increased when\
    \ by-products were included as ingredients as expressed per kg of dry \nmatter\
    \ (12% for citrus pulp and 5% for olive cake diets respectively). This effect\
    \ was stronger for citrus pulp, since the drying \nprocess enhances this by-product\
    \ carbon footprint to similar levels than cereals. Moreover, since it presents\
    \ lower energetic \ndensity than barley, the need to include palm oil in the diet\
    \ raised its carbon footprint as expressed per kg of dry matter. In the \ncase\
    \ of olive cake feed, despite this by-product was assigned with no carbon footprint,\
    \ the feed to introduce a higher proportion \nof protein-rich ingredients (soybean\
    \ meal), increased the feed carbon footprint. \nPotential for Predicting Ammonia\
    \ Emissions from Naturally Ventilated Dairy Houses based on Indirect \nParameters\
    \ \nPernille Lund Kasper, Peter Kai, Anders Feilberg \nAarhus University, Denmark\
    \ \nMeasuring ammonia emissions from naturally ventilated dairy houses is costly\
    \ and time consuming. Hence, there is an interest \nin investigating alternatives\
    \ to full-scale absolute emission measurements. \nIn this study, ammonia emissions\
    \ were predicted using partial least squares (PLS) models based on emission data,\
    \ barn \nparameters, meteorological data and analysis of manure and feed samples.\
    \ In addition to predicting emissions, the models can \nalso be used for identifying\
    \ factors of importance for the emissions. The models were generated based on\
    \ ammonia emissions \nfrom eight naturally ventilated cubicle dairy barns in Denmark\
    \ for which emission data was determined during six measuring \ncampaigns distributed\
    \ over a one-year period. Four barns with slatted floor and four barns with solid\
    \ drained floor were included. \nThe concentration of NH3 and CO2 was determined\
    \ in three perforated sample lines spanning 20 meters of the center of the \n\
    barn and two background-measuring points were placed on each side of the barn.\
    \ NH3 was measured using cavity ring-down \nspectroscopy (CRDS) and CO2 was measured\
    \ using photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) and nondispersive infrared spectroscopy\
    \ \n(NDIR). \nThe prediction model based on measured parameters was able to explain\
    \ ~80% of the variation in ammonia emission for barns \nwith solid drained floors\
    \ (R2=0.75). For barns with slatted floors this was only ~60% (R2=0.36), indicating\
    \ that the measured \nparameters are not adequate to describe this type of barn.\
    \ The most significant parameters for predicting emissions were pH, \nfloor surface\
    \ area and temperature. The variation in the reference measurement data affects\
    \ the precision of the model and is \ntherefore included in the discussion. Generally,\
    \ less than 10-15% variation was observed. \nAn alternative approach is to use\
    \ the ratio of N-to-K in manure combined with an animal excretion model to predict\
    \ ammonia \nemissions. Quality criteria and key uncertainties in relation to this\
    \ approach are presented and discussed. \nAmmonia Emission Assessment After Buffalo\

    \ (NA), Italy; 2General engineering school \nCESI, Saint-Nazaire Center, boulevard\
    \ de l’université, 44600 Saint-Nazaire, France \nQuite recently, considerable\
    \ attention has been paid to the effect of anaerobic digestion on ammonia emissions\
    \ from digestate \nspreading in the field, due to the growing interest in NH3\
    \ emission monitoring. Unfortunately, there are still some different studies \n\
    finding about the effect of anaerobic digestion on ammonia emissions. Thus, more\
    \ research into this topic is still necessary before \nobtaining a definitive\
    \ answer to the increment or not in emission. For this purpose, this paper proposes\
    \ comparison study between \nammonia emissions from buffalo raw (Farmyard) manure\
    \ and digestate on bare soil under Mediterranean climate, using the wind \ntunnel\
    \ equipped with acid traps, to assess the ammonia emission fluxes. The sampling\
    \ campaign, in three replicates, lasted each \ntime, for 6 days to ensure that\
    \ most of the ammonia has been emitted before the end of each campaign. The results\
    \ obtained \nindicate that a diurnal correlation between emission and external\
    \ temperature occurs, especially during the first days. Specifically \nfor both\
    \ fertilizers, ammonia volatilization increased with air temperature raising.\
    \ Overall, the total digestate cumulative NH3 \nemission is 54% higher than raw\
    \ manure emission. This is certainly due to the Total NH4+-N rate, which was 55,8kg\
    \ ha-1 for the \nraw manure and 107 kg ha-1 for the digestate, around 1,9 times\
    \ higher for the digestate TAN content. Finding suggests the need \nfor adjusting\
    \ digestate application rate based on TAN content, in order to reduce the impact\
    \ on the environment. \nA Simple Model to Predict Ammonia Emission from Livestock\
    \ Pens \nAnders Peter Stubkjær Adamsen \nSEGES, Denmark \nEmissions of ammonia\
    \ from surfaces of solid floor, slatted floor or slurry pits are controlled by\
    \ two different production and \ntransport patterns. Ammonia originates from urea\
    \ in urine and its degassing depends on urea and ammonia concentrations, pH, \n\
    temperatures and surface areas. Degassing is often estimated by an emission factor\
    \ assuming that a specific proportion of the \nurea and ammonia content is degassed,\
    \ or it is estimated by assuming a specific emission per area unit. Both methods\
    \ have \nlimitations. \nAssuming that a certain fraction of the ammoniacal nitrogen\
    \ is degassed from the urine puddles on the floor using an emission \nfactor,\
    \ whereas the emission from the slurry pits is primarily controlled by the surface\
    \ area, a simple model can be constructed \nwith good explanatory power. Emission\
    \ data from conventional finishing pig production in Denmark with different solid\
    \ and slatted \nfloor ratios as well as slurry pit areas were used to calibrate\
    \ the model, and then the model was used to predict emissions from \n \n \n \n\
    94 \norganic pig production with larger indoor and outdoor areas. Environmental\
    \ technologies reducing the emission from the slurry \nsurface in the slurry pits\
    \ were incorporated in the model by using specific emission reduction factors.\
    \ \nThe model predicts that the ammonia emission from the solid floor is an important\
    \ source, and actions that will ensure a high \nproportion of urine is excreted\
    \ on the slatted floor is of great importance for the emission reduction potential.\
    \ The potential of \ntechnologies that limit the emission from the slurry pits,\
    \ e.g. slurry acidification or slurry cooling, is likewise very dependent on \n\
    the proportion of urine added directly on the slatted floors above the slurry\
    \ pits. The prediction quality of the model will be improved \nin future by using\
    \ emission data from urine puddles, slatted floors and slurry pits measured by\
    \ flux chambers.  \nFarm Technology \nTest of UHF Ear Tags for Piglets and Growing-Finishing\
    \ Pigs on an Optimized Test Bench. \nAdrian Foerschner, Felix Adrion, Eva Gallmann\
    \ \nUniversity of Hohenheim, Germany \nUltra-high frequency (UHF-) RFID systems\
    \ (865-868 MHz) could provide advanced applications of electronic animal identification\
    \ \nsuch as automated activity measurement and real-time localization of animals.\
    \ However, in UHF systems strong influence of \nreflections and absorption leads\
    \ to signal attenuation, which poses major challenges. Especially ear tissue causes\
    \ strong \nabsorption of the electromagnetic waves, changes in the resonance frequency\
    \ of UHF transponders and, thus, impairs reading \nperformance. In a current research\
    \ project, UHF ear tags, readers and antennas for pig farming are being developed\
    \ further. The \nobjective of this study is to test a series of small UHF ear\
    \ tags, which were designed especially for use in piglets and growing-\nfinishing\
    \ pigs, on a test bench and later on for behavior monitoring of pigs. \nAn automated\
    \ test bench was developed to test UHF ear tags, readers and antennas in a standardized\
    \ manner within a short \ntime and in a measuring field of 3.5 x 3.5 m. The measured\
    \ parameters are the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), the \nread range\
    \ and the detection area of different types of transponders. In order to minimize\
    \ the influence of reflections and to lower \nthe measurement bias, the test bench\
    \ was partially equipped with electromagnetic (EM) absorbers. Six different types\
    \ of new \nUHF transponder ear tags for piglets and growing-finishing pigs were\
    \ tested on the test bench with and without real pig ears. \nThese ear tags were\
    \ optimized in terms of directional characteristic, resonance frequency and bandwidth\
    \ to lower the influence \nof ear tissue. A randomized complete block design was\
    \ used as test design and the data is currently being analyzed using mixed \n\
    models for RSSI and read range. First results show a read range up to 1.75 m with\
    \ a reader output power of 1 W. The final results \nwill be presented at the conference.\
    \ \nMeasuring the Walking Distance of Growing-Finishing Pigs with UHF-RFID \n\
    Felix Adrion, Anita Kapun, Monika Tomalla, Matthias Reger, Eva Gallmann \nUniversity\
    \ of Hohenheim, Germany \nActivity data can provide valuable information on behaviour,\
    \ health and reproduction status of animals. Systems for activity \nmeasurement\
    \ and especially for real-time localisation of animals are often complex and expensive.\
    \ The objective of this paper is \nto present a simple approach for measurement\
    \ of the walking distance of growing-finishing pigs with an ultra-high frequency\
    \ radio \nfrequency identification system (UHF-RFID) by applying cell-of-origin\
    \ localisation. Ten UHF patch antennas were placed \nhorizontally above a pen\
    \ for 25 growing-finishing pigs, each covering a sector of 1.6 x 1.6 m. The walking\
    \ distance of four pigs \ntagged with UHF-RFID ear tags was observed by video\
    \ on three days with different combinations of antenna output power and \nheight.\
    \ The video data was compared to calculated walking distances based on the RFID\
    \ registrations and sector visits created \nfrom the RFID registrations. Each\
    \ change of a pig between antenna sectors added the Euclidian distance between\
    \ the two sector \ncentres to the calculated walking distance. The smallest difference\
    \ and highest correlation between observed and calculated \ndistances was achieved\
    \ with the highest output power (30.8 dBm), an antenna height of 2 m and sector\
    \ visits with a minimum \nduration of 1 s and a bout criterion of 100 s. The calculated\
    \ distances were 78 ± 22 % (mean ± SD) of the observed distances \nwith an R²\
    \ of the linear regression of 0.77. These results show the potential of this technology\
    \ for activity monitoring in pigs. \nFurther research should be conducted with\
    \ increased distances of the UHF antennas to prevent overlap of the sectors and\
    \ to \ndecrease system costs. \nThe Use Of Electronic Identification in Fattening\

    \ \n1Wageningen Livestock Research, The Netherlands; 2Westfort, The Netherlands;\
    \ 3De Hoeve, The Netherlands \nAssessment data on fattening pigs become available\
    \ in the slaughterhouse. These data include weight, backfat and loin depth, \n\
    and abnormalities found. They are used for the pricing of the carcasses and meat\
    \ processing. The assessment data are also \npresented to the farmer, but in standard\
    \ practical situations, can difficultly be interpreted by the farmer, as they\
    \ are usually not \ncombinable with the individual pig data collected on farm.\
    \ Resulting in the situation that for example the age of the pigs is not \nknown.\
    \ \nData can be recorded from birth to slaughter by using radio frequency identification\
    \ (RFID). The RFID tags are applied at birth \nand remain in the ears until read\
    \ out at slaughter. The age at slaughtering can be calculated from the data recorded\
    \ in combination \nwith the RFID number. RFID can be used on the farms to record\
    \ treatments of animals, and so the meat of animals that, \nthroughout their life,\
    \ have not received any treatment can be certified as antibiotics-free meat. Combining\
    \ slaughterhouse data \nwith birthdate can give insight into the effect of age\
    \ on animal characteristics. RFID is being introduced by a Dutch slaughterhouse\
    \ \non associated farms. The RFID's are now being scanned at slaughter allowing\
    \ the possibility of combining slaughter data with \nfarm management data. \n\
    The relation between slaughterhouse data with farm management data has been explored,\
    \ relating the growth rate of individual \nanimals with recorded abnormalities\
    \ and treatments. First results will be presented. These combined data have also\
    \ been used \nfor benchmarking when comparing farm-specific data with the average\
    \ of all farms. This can give clues on the potential of \nimproving the management\
    \ on individual fattening pigs farms. \n \n \n \n95 \nExperimental Study on Feeding\

    \ After that, 29 \nsets of test tests were designed by using the response surface\
    \ design method of Box-Behnken Design (BBD), and in accordance \nwith the order\
    \ of experimental numbers to start the test., the effects of wind speed, feeding\
    \ interval, feeding amount and feeder \nloading on feeding accuracy were studied,\
    \ then used the Design Expert software for data analysis, obtained a quadratic\
    \ \nregression model for the feeding accuracy. \nThe variance analysis was performed\
    \ on the regression model, the results show that the model is extremely significant(p<0.0001),\
    \ \nmismatch is not significant(p=0.635>0.05), indicating that the model is appropriate.\
    \ and the results also show the wind speed has \na extremely significant effect\
    \ on the accuracy of feeding (p <0.001) in the four factors, and other factors\
    \ have no significant effect \non them. Then the single factor analysis and interaction\
    \ analysis were carried out, and we can get the influence degree of each \nfactor\
    \ on the accuracy of feeding: wind speed> feed amount> feeding interval> cylinder\
    \ volume. The results of this study can be \nused as a reference for optimization\
    \ and application of the feeding machine. \nThe Effect of Liner Type on the Teat\

    \ Germany; 3Hochschule \nNeubrandenbur, University of Applied Science, Germany\
    \ \nDuring milking the teat of a dairy cow is exposed to a high load. The teat\
    \ cup liner is the interface between the teat and the milking \nsystem, so it\
    \ should be very well adapted. The most commonly used method to detect the impact\
    \ of liner type is to visually \nevaluate teat condition based on teat color,\
    \ swelling, ring formation at the teat base, and teat-end hyperkeratosis. In addition,\
    \ \nsensor-based determination of the influence of liner type on the teat load\
    \ caused by liner collapse can be performed with several \nmeasuring devices,\
    \ such as ultrasonography, infrared thermography, and pressure-sensitive sensors.\
    \ As the methods commonly \nused to detect the effect of liner type on the bovine\
    \ teat are very subjective and because the tested sensor-based methods are \n\
    very complex to use or have shown limited usability, the aim of this study was\
    \ to determine the effect of liner type on the directly \nmeasured teat load caused\
    \ by a collapsing liner with a pressure-indicating film. The Extreme Low pressure-indicating\
    \ film was \nused to detect the effect of six different liners on teat load at\
    \ artificial teats. For each liner, six positions in the teat cup were \nspecified,\
    \ and six repetitions were performed for each position with a new film piece each\
    \ time. Analysis of variance was \nperformed to detect differences between the\
    \ six liners, the positions within a liner, and the measuring areas. The pressure\
    \ applied \nto the teat by a liner depends on the technical characteristics of\
    \ the liner, especially the barrel shape. A square and a concave \nliner applied\
    \ the highest teat load at the teat base, while a round silicone liner and a round\
    \ rubber liner applied the highest load \nat the teat end. For all tested liners,\
    \ a higher teat load was found at the teat end. \nEvaluation of a Robotic Manure\
    \ Scraper in Dairy Production by Means of Ethological and Technical \nParameters\
    \ \nTheresa Leinweber1, Sabine Schrade2, Eva Gallmann1, Michael Zähner2 \n1University\
    \ of Hohenheim, Germany; 2Agroscope, Switzerland \nThe application of robotic\
    \ manure scrapers in housing for dairy cows is increasing. Beside the time saving\
    \ for cleaning the floor \nthe robot should also provide a cleaner environment,\
    \ thereby improving claw health and reducing ammonia emissions. However, \nthere\
    \ is a lack of recommendations how to operate such machines. Up to now, farms\
    \ cannot fully exploit the potential. The aim \nof this study was to evaluate\
    \ the cleaning quality of the LELY Discovery 90 SW (Maassluis NL) and to investigate\
    \ effects on the \nanimals. \nThe investigations were carried out in the experimental\
    \ dairy housing for emission measurements in Tänikon (Switzerland). The \nexperimental\
    \ compartment for 20 cows was equipped with slatted and solid floors which were\
    \ covered with rubber mats. Four \nvariants with different frequency of cleaning\
    \ (no, rare, frequent, optimized) lasted four days each, with a preceding acclimatization\
    \ \nperiod. The cleanliness of the floors was scored once a day. The behaviour\
    \ of the cows was observed in two blocks each day. \nThis included the avoiding\
    \ behaviour related to the robot, the feeding behaviour and the events of slipping.\
    \ \nCleaning the floor more often leads to lower soil levels, lower percentages\
    \ of straw on the floor, lower amounts of smear layer \nand less slipping events\
    \ of the cows. The use of the robot’s water sprayer improved the cleaning results.\
    \ The amount of smear \nlayer was higher in the situation without water. The robotic\
    \ cleaning process in the feeding aisle interrupted the cow’s feeding \nperiods,\
    \ but they continued eating right away. In addition, the cows became accustomed\
    \ to the robot very quickly. The \ninvestigations showed that an optimized cleaning\
    \ interval combined with the use of water is recommendable. \nDevelopment of a\
    \ Test Stand for the Testing of Alternative Manure Removal Methods in Slurry Channels\
    \ \nBastian Kolb, Eva Gallmann \nUniversity of Hohenheim, Germany \nAnimal welfare\
    \ is becoming more important in animal husbandry which leads to an increased use\
    \ of organic enrichment material \nto e.g. counteract tail-biting. However liquid\
    \ manure systems are not designed for the increased dry matter and fiber contents.\
    \ \nThe results are dense, thick and sticky floating layers concentrated under\
    \ mangers and feeders which results in labor intensive \nstirring, rinsing and\
    \ shoveling to remove the remains of solid matter. \n \n \n \n96 \nThe research\
    \ aim is to develop new technical solutions for liquid manure channels to remedy\
    \ these problems. As first step a test \nstand is being constructed at the University\
    \ of Hohenheim. Made of transparent acrylic glass and PVC, the test stand allows\
    \ the \nsimulation of the complete manure removal process and gives an insight\
    \ into possible bottlenecks, blockage points and residue \ndeposits. A stainless\
    \ steel frame allows the secure attachment of various newly developed and retrofitted\
    \ stirring, pulling, \nchopping, scraping and rinsing modules. Together with variants\
    \ of basin designs, lock compartments, flushing nozzle positions \nand flow rates,\
    \ a large number of combinations can be tested. \nIn order to ensure the comparability\
    \ of the test runs despite the heterogeneity of pig manure a substitute fluid\
    \ will be developed \nto simulate the rheological properties of a fibrous pseudo\
    \ plastic suspension. Organic fiber material, roughage pellets, sand and \nwater\
    \ mixed with natural and synthetic thickening agents serve as the basis for the\
    \ test medium. \nPreliminary tests will be conducted to explore the limitations\
    \ of the system and the substitute fluid in terms of the DM contents, \nfiber\
    \ lengths and viscosity. Purging intervals and different mixing ratios will be\
    \ validated to obtain a baseline for the start of the \nmain test series of mechanical\
    \ manure removal solutions. First results are expected by the end of May. \nEvaluation\
    \ of Novel Farrowing Systems with Possibility for the Sow to Move – Effects on\
    \ Working Time \nRequirement \nFranz Handler1, Emil Blumauer1, Birgit Heidinger2\
    \ \n1HBLFA Francisco Josephinum, Austria; 2HBLFA Raumberg-Gumpenstein, Austria\
    \ \nAccording to the amendment of Austrian animal husbandry regulation all farrowing\
    \ pens on Austrian farms must provide at least \n5.5 m². Moreover, it is allowed\
    \ to crate the sows to protect their piglets only until the end of the critical\
    \ phase of life of the piglets \n(max. 6 days after birth). The farrowing crates\
    \ must be adjustable in width and length in accordance to the individual size\
    \ of the \nsows. During a trial of three years, three new developed Austrian farrowing\
    \ pens and two from the European market were tested \non animal welfare, economic\
    \ efficiency and occupational safety. This paper reports about the effects on\
    \ working time requirement \ncompared to the conventional pen. \nTime studies\
    \ were carried out on three research farms, which used new farrowing pens as well\
    \ as the conventional pens. For \ndata collection all operations were divided\
    \ into parts of an operation and work elements. For collecting labour input data\
    \ of the \nindividual work elements, the digital time measurement system Ortim\
    \ a3 and video analysis were used. Statistical evaluations of \nthe data were\
    \ done by means of ORTIMzeit Professional and SPSS 19.0. Basing on determined\
    \ standard times for the work \nelements model calculations were done for farms\
    \ with 140 sows. \nIn comparison to conventional farrowing pens, the additional\
    \ working time requirement in the examined novel pen types ranged \nfrom 0.18\
    \ (+4 %) to 3.47 (+ 85 %) man-hours per sow and year. The main causes were: \n\
    • poorer visibility into the pens, • greater freedom of movement for the sows,\
    \ • poorer accessibility of the pens, • larger area of the \npens. In addition\
    \ to the overall increase in working time requirement in the novel pens, labour\
    \ peaks were aggravated during \nintroduction to farrowing pens, birth monitoring,\
    \ catching of piglets, removing piglets from the farrowing pen and the cleaning\
    \ the \npen. \nContinuous Electronic Behaviour Monitoring of Growing-Finishing\
    \ Pigs with UHF-RFID \nAnita Kapun, Felix Adrion, Eva Gallmann \nUniversity of\
    \ Hohenheim, Germany \nSystems for automatic recording of activity and behaviour\
    \ can provide detailed information about the influence of a housing \nsystem on\
    \ the behaviour of the animals. This information is valuable for assessment and\
    \ comparison of different housing systems \nin terms of animal welfare and performance.\
    \ The objective of this contribution is to describe the feeding, drinking and\
    \ playing \nbehaviour of growing-finishing pigs in a conventional housing system\
    \ with fully slatted floor and a liquid feeding system with a \nsensor-controlled\
    \ short trough. \nThe behaviour of 300 growing-finishing pigs in three fattening\
    \ periods (four groups of 25 pigs per period) was recorded using an \nultra-high\
    \ frequency radio frequency identification system (UHF-RFID). The system consisted\
    \ of UHF ear tags, antennas, readers, \nand a monitoring software. The accuracy\
    \ of the detection of the animals was validated with video observations and was\
    \ between \n97 and 99% depending on the location. Occurring RFID registrations\
    \ at the trough, the drinkers and a playing device with straw \nwere recorded\
    \ constantly for every individual pig during the fattening periods. In addition,\
    \ the pigs were weighed every four weeks. \nThe average weight gain and the behaviour\
    \ of the animals were similar between the fattening periods. On average, the pigs\
    \ spent \nabout 60 ± 30 minutes (mean ± sd) per day at the trough, 10 ± 9 minutes\
    \ at the drinkers and about 37 ± 27 minutes at the playing \ndevice. The results\
    \ show a high inter- and intra-animal-variability of the behavioural data. The\
    \ analysis also reveals typical periods \nof activity during the day at the hotspots,\
    \ especially the playing device, with a higher duration of stay in the afternoons.\
    \ \nFurthermore, a strong influence of the feeding system on the behaviour can\
    \ be seen in the short time spent at the drinkers and a \nhigh level of competition\
    \ at the trough. \nOn Farm On-Line Somatic Cell Count Measurements \nPieter Hogewerf,\
    \ Marleen Purmer, Bert Ipema \nWageningen Livestock Research, The Netherlands\
    \  \nEarly detection of mastitis is important to keep cows healthy and to have\
    \ good quality milk. The somatic cell count (SCC) is an \nimportant mastitis indictor.\
    \ The company Mastiline has developed LUCI. With this instrument the SCC in the\
    \ milk can be \ndetermined by ATP value determination during the milking of a\
    \ cow. ATP method is scientifically proven to have good correlation \nwith the\
    \ flow cytometry results which currently remains the gold standard in somatic\
    \ cell counting. The instrument consist of a \nsampling module in which a milk\
    \ sample is collected and is brought into contact with a reagent. The ATP value\
    \ is then determined \nby comparing the measured sample with an internal standard.\
    \ The instrument is initially developed for application in a milking \nrobot,\
    \ but may eventually also be applicable in conventional milking stalls. The relationship\
    \ between the LUCI analysis and the \nstandard SCC analysis has been investigated.\
    \ \nIn 7 weeks’ time, spring 2018, during 4 periods of 3 consecutive days 50 milk\
    \ samples have been taken in a robotic milking \nsystem at a test farm in the\
    \ north of The Netherlands. The, in total 600, samples were randomly taken of\
    \ cows milked, by the \n \n \n \n97 \nstandard installed ICAR certified milk meter.\
    \ After milk sampling, the sample was split into two samples, one sample was directly\
    \ \nanalysed with LUCI and the duplicate was stored and sent to a certified laboratory\
    \ to compare with the flow cytometry results . \nFirst results show a high correlation\
    \ between LUCI analyses and the flow cytometry SCC analyses, final results will\
    \ be presented. \nAcknowledgements: The authors thank the collaborators at the\

    \ Environmental Quality on Commercial Pig Farms in Europe \nThomas Banhazi, Annamaria\
    \ Banhazi \nPLF Agritech, Australia \nA number of production related parameters,\
    \ such as air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, ventilation rates\
    \ were \nmonitored in a number of commercial piggery buildings in Spain and Hungary\
    \ over a 12 months period. Selected results from \nthese long term monitoring\
    \ events will be used in this article to highlight the beneficial effects of routine\
    \ monitoring of these \nimportant production related parameters in commercial\
    \ livestock buildings. The authors will argue that such information might be \n\
    used eventually to evaluate the ‘quality’ of management procedures used on specific\
    \ farms. The statistical analysis (using general \nlinear models) identified that\
    \ improved ventilation and thermal control conditions as key factors contributing\
    \ to improved \nproduction efficiency. Thus, it was concluded that monitoring\
    \ and better controlling these production parameters in piggery \nbuildings could\
    \ result in improved profitability of commercial livestock farms. \nLong Term\
    \ Investigations to Compare Different Renewable Energy Sources for Heating and\
    \ Cooling Pig \nHouses \nWolfgang Büscher, Manuel Krommweh, Hannah Licharz, Christian\
    \ Maack \nUniversity Bonn, Germany \nThree different renewable energy sources\
    \ were compared in practice under long term conditions for heating and cooling\
    \ in pig \nhouses. The investigations were done in Germany under summer and winter\
    \ conditions in different pig houses with typical \ninsulation and forced ventilation\
    \ systems. During the periods, the temperature of outdoor, fresh, supply and section\
    \ air were \nrecorded continuously, along with the relevant air flow volume, electricity\
    \ and gas consumption. The tested systems were: \n1) Geothermal heat exchanger\
    \ (GHE), 2) Ground water heat pump. 3) Air-to-air heat exchanger. The coefficient\
    \ of performance \n(COP) of each system was calculated by the equation: \nthermal\
    \ energy output for heating or cooling [kWh] \nCOP = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
    \ \nelectricity input [kWh] \nThe modular housing concept was a barn system with\
    \ an integrated GHE area where fresh air is led through a space between \nslurry\
    \ pit and soil to condition the supply air. This modular housing system was investigated\
    \ for the first time over a one-year \nexperimental period in in western Germany\
    \ (Krommweh et al. 2014). \nThe second pig farm used three heat pumps (each 40\
    \ kW electric performance) supplied with deep ground water. The heated \nwater\
    \ was used for floor heating systems in piglet rearing compartments. \nIn the\
    \ third measuring period in two pig houses air-to-air heat exchanger were evaluated\
    \ in different positions. One position was \ndirectly in the exhaust air without\
    \ outlet air purification (Rösmann & Büscher 2010). In the other barn the air-to-air\
    \ exchanger was \nintegrated in the bioscrubber for air cleaning. In that case,\
    \ the exchange area was drained and cleaned by the recirculation water. \nThat\
    \ effects the COP positive. Under strong summer conditions we observed first time\
    \ that the incoming air was cooled down by \nthe cleaning water (Krommweh & Büscher\
    \ 2017). That leads to the interesting conclusion that bioscrubbers have a usable\
    \ heating \nand cooling potential! \nOptimal Ambient Temperature with Regard to\
    \ Feed Efficiency and Daily Gain of Finisher Pigs \nRikke Koch Hansen, Bjarne\
    \ Bjerg \nUniversity of Copenhagen, Denmark \nOptimal thermal conditions for farm\
    \ animals are crucial preconditions for development of improved climate control\
    \ methods. \nTemperatures outside finisher pigs’ thermal comfort zone are known\
    \ to comprise both daily gain and feed efficiency. Literature \ndisagrees on at\
    \ which temperatures the productivity begins decreasing and at which temperatures\
    \ the reduction in daily gain and \nfeed efficiency is critical. The aim of this\
    \ work was to decide the optimal ambient temperature for finisher pigs with regard\
    \ to daily \ngain and feed efficiency. \nLiterature assessing daily gain and feed\
    \ efficiency at different ambient temperatures was gathered using Cab Abstract\
    \ and Google \nScholar. The results were transformed to relative values with 100%\
    \ being the temperature at which the highest productivity, in \nthat particular\
    \ study, was found. The slope corresponding to each degree Celsius was calculated\
    \ within the investigated range of \nthat particular study. The mean slope values\
    \ for all studies were calculated and the average response was illustrated in\
    \ a graph. \nResults showed that the two productivity parameters did not peak\
    \ at same ambient temperature. The daily gain peaked at 15.5°C \nand was within\
    \ its maximum 95% between 9.5 and 21°C. Feed efficiency peaked at 22.5°C and was\
    \ within its maximum 95% \nbetween 17 and 29°C. \nThe optimal ambient temperature\
    \ for finisher pigs was found in the range between 15.5°C and 22.5°C. For the\
    \ individual farmer, \nthe economic optimal temperature is dependent on feed costs,\
    \ energy costs, and on whether additional pigs are available to \nutilize the\
    \ housing capacity gained by increased grow rate. In the latter case, the optimal\
    \ temperature will be lower than if the \nfaster growth causes a reduced utilization\
    \ of the housing system. \n \n \n \n98 \nAnimal Welfare Indicators in Growing\

    \ Portugal \nThe application of different technological innovations in the intensive\
    \ systems of pig production has generated some problems \nrelated to health and\
    \ animal welfare in modern facilities. To measure animal welfare is necessary\
    \ to use a set of indicators \n(behavioural, physiological, productive and sanitary)\
    \ capable of expressing the animals’ adaptability to the environment. \nTemperature\
    \ is one of the main components of the environment, since it influences the physiology,\
    \ behaviour and productivity of \nthe pigs. The aim of this study is to verify\
    \ the adaptive evolution to different environmental conditions (winter, thermoneutrality\
    \ \nand summer) in growing and fattening pigs through physiological, behavioural\
    \ and productive indicators. Seven females with \ninitial weight of 45kg. The\
    \ animals were housed in a room equipped with an environmental control system.\
    \ The area per animal \nwas 1,5 m2. The environmental data collected were temperature,\
    \ relative humidity and wind speed. The physiological parameters \nmeasured were\
    \ body surface temperature, rectal temperature and salivary α-amylase. The feed\
    \ intake was monitored through \nan individual feed machine equipped with animal\
    \ weight scale. In order to monitor the behaviour of animals, video cameras and\
    \ \nmicrophones were installed. \nThe final weight of the animals was about 95\
    \ kg. The daily food intake and mean daily gain of live weight were 2,70 kg.day\

    \ Conditions – a Status Quo at Dairy Farms in North - East Germany \nJennifer\
    \ Löbel, Paul Gütschow, Clemens Fuchs, Sandra Rose-Meierhöfer \nHochschule Neubrandenburg,\
    \ University of Applied Sciences, Germany \nThe issue of animal welfare is in\
    \ the focus of politics and customers. This poses enormous challenges for the\
    \ future viability of \nmodern animal husbandry. The most deficits are the technical\
    \ design in dairy barns. The energy-efficient ventilation and air-\nconditioning\
    \ systems could improve the welfare and efficiency of dairy cows and are used\
    \ in the barn, the living area and the \nmilking parlour. In a research project\
    \ were collected 202 parameters in each barn of 34 dairy farms. The measurements\
    \ to \nevaluate the climate in different barns were implemented with the thermo-hygrometer\
    \ (temperature and humidity) and the \nanemometer (air velocity). The data collection\
    \ occurred three hours after feeding at five different places: at the feeding\
    \ table, at \nthe cubicles, at the feed alley and at the cubicle alley also once\
    \ in the milking parlour. Every barn has a climate system, like eave \nridge ventilation,\
    \ vertical transverse flow system with curtains and jalousie and ventilators,\
    \ but no barn has pipe aeration. Only \nthe use of ventilation systems which result\
    \ of the barn construction are in over 80% of the analyzed farms not sufficiently.\
    \ 29 of \nthe analyzed farms have old DDR barns. Especially with this type, a\
    \ technical assistance system like a ventilator is essential, but \nonly 16 of\
    \ them have ventilators installed. The temperature values are on average 20,21\
    \ °C in the barn and 18,47 °C at a outside \ntemperature on average of 22,5 °C.\
    \ The humidity is on average over 75% and except of three barns, no barn has a\
    \ continuous \nair circulation. The most air circulation (on average 1,2 m/s)\
    \ was at the feeding table. No air circulation occurred in the milking \nparlour.\
    \ The same deficits show the 19 new built barns either. The farmers don´t know\
    \ how to handle it and are often wrong \nadvice. \nEffects Of The Accumulation\

    In the course of the predicted climate change, the problem of welfare and heat\
    \ load of dairy cows has become increasingly \nimportant even under moderate climate\
    \ conditions. The objective of the present study was to analyze the effects of\
    \ the daily \nduration of different heat load levels (HLL) on the activity behavior\
    \ of lactating dairy cows. Additionally, the adaptation effects of \nthe cows\
    \ regarding the accumulation of heat load duration (HLD) on all three days preceding\
    \ the activity measurement day was \ninvestigated. \nThe study was conducted from\
    \ June 2015 to May 2017 in a naturally ventilated dairy barn. The barn climate\
    \ was measured at \nhigh temporal and spatial resolution, and the average temperature-humidity\
    \ index (THI) was calculated every ten minutes (n = \n842,112). The THI was used\
    \ to define the heat load the cows were exposed to. HLL were determined by defined\
    \ THI thresholds. \nThe activity behavior of the dairy cows (n = 176) was measured\
    \ using IceTag3DTM pedometers and described with several \nbehavioral traits per\
    \ cow and day. The analysis models included autocorrelations in time series as\
    \ well as effects of individual \ncows. \nThe results showed significant behavioral\
    \ adaptations (P < 0.01) regarding the increasing HLD within each HLL at the day\
    \ of \nmeasurement. There was a decrease in lying time, number of lying bouts,\
    \ average lying bout duration, and number of standing \nbouts per day. The average\
    \ number of standing bouts and the number of steps per day increased with increasing\
    \ HLD at the \nmeasurement day. The accumulation of HLD on all three days preceding\
    \ the measurement day lead to less behavioral \nadaptations at the day of measurement\
    \ (P < 0.01). This indicates that the cows could not further increase their adaptation\
    \ beyond \nsome limit, they reacted weakened and had to follow the need for more\
    \ lying time. \n\"Influence of Evaporative Cooling on Respiration Rate of Lactating\

    \ 79.5 ± 3.16 (mean ± SD). RR of cows differed between groups (P < 0.001). The\
    \ average RR of \nthe control group was 7 breaths per minute (BPM) higher than\
    \ experimental group. During the cooling, BPM of cows in the control \ngroup and\
    \ in the experimental group decreased by 31 and 20 BPM in comparison to the barn,\
    \ respectively (P < 0.001). Standing \ncows (69 and 56 BPM) inside the barn showed\
    \ higher RR than lying cows (62 and 53 BPM) in the control and experimental group,\
    \ \nrespectively (P < 0.001). The results showed that in hot climate zones, evaporative\
    \ cooling helps to relieve heat stress in dairy \ncows. An increase of evaporative\
    \ cooling frequency per day reduces RR and improves heat abatement in lactating\
    \ dairy cows \nregardless of cow body posture. \nIntegrated Analysis of Data Acquired\

    \ They \nare used for real time analysis of the conditions of productivity, oestrus,\
    \ animal welfare, and to record the main historical values \nreferred to each\

    \ Systems (AMS) and the related \ndevices and control software represent a highly\
    \ informative source of cow-specific data. At the same time, indoor climatic \n\

    \ \nOdour and Fine Dust (Particulate Matter) \nEffects of Feed and Litter Management\
    \ on Odour Emission from Broilers: An Exploratory Study to Develop \nMitigation\
    \ Measures \nNico Ogink, Hilko Ellen, Jan van Harn, Julio Mosquera \nWageningen\
    \ Livestock Research, The Netherlands  \nA first exploratory study was carried\
    \ out to develop odour mitigation measures for broiler barns. In a factorial experiment\
    \ effects \nof feed composition and litter management on odour emission were investigated.\
    \ Two feeds were compared that differed in \ncomposition to create a difference\
    \ in the dry matter content of the manure, with the hypothesis that drier manure\
    \ leads to less \nodour. In addition conventional litter management was compared\
    \ with treatments applying an extra layer of litter (at 17 and / or \n23 days\
    \ of age) once or twice, or replacing all litter with new one (at 23 days of age).\
    \ The research was carried out in a \nmechanically ventilated section with a total\
    \ of 16 pens of 2.7 m2. Each pen housed 40 male birds (Ross 308). They were given\
    \ \nunlimited feed and water during the entire 37-day growth period. During the\
    \ growth period in each pen the litter was regularly \nsampled to determine dry\
    \ matter. A dynamic flux chamber was used for the determination of odour and ammonia\
    \ emission rates \nfrom each individual pen. Odour concentration in samples were\
    \ determined by olfactometry (EN 13725). The results showed a \nthird lower odour\
    \ emission for the low odour feed composition, but only at the end of the growing\
    \ period. This was accompanied \nby a higher DM contents in the litter at the\
    \ last measurement day. In contrast the ammonia emission was more than a factor\
    \ 3 \nhigher for the low odour feed throughout the growing cycle. The litter management\
    \ treatments had no effect on odour and \nammonia emission. The results demonstrate\
    \ the possibility to reduce the odour emission by feed that stimulates dry manure.\
    \ In \ncontrast, the ammonia emission of the low odour feed was considerably higher.\
    \ This negative coupling requires attention in the \neventual further development\
    \ of low odor emission feed for broiler chickens. \nReduction of PM from Aviary\
    \ Houses for Laying Hens through Alternative Foraging Methods \nJan-Willem Kortlever,\
    \ Peter Groot Koerkamp, Albert Winkel \nWageningen University & Research, The\
    \ Netherlands  \nAviary houses for laying hens emit high amounts of particulate\
    \ matter (PM) and contribute substantially to increased background \nconcentration\
    \ in the neighbourhood. The foraging and dust bathing behaviour of hens on a floor\
    \ with litter (i.e., manure and \nfeather particles) contributes to the aerosolization\
    \ of small particles which are subsequently emitted with the ventilation air.\
    \ Air \nquality regulations require current sources to reduce their PM emission.\
    \ \nWe investigated two alternative methods for foraging, called SUNtastic and\
    \ bLokken, in comparison to foraging on standard litter. \nSUNtastic consisted\
    \ of artificial grass onto which grain was spread; bLokken consisted of movable\
    \ transparent blocks (38*38*34 \nmm) with two holes filled with feed on a concrete\
    \ floor (# blocks per m2). These methods were tested during three weeks in three\
    \ \nidentical, completely separated, units with 20 laying hens. An additional\
    \ room to each unit was equipped with one of the three \nsubstrates and the substrates\
    \ were switched between the units. During 3 weeks, 5 days a week, and 3 times\
    \ per day, laying hens \nentered the additional room with the foraging methods,\
    \ attracted by the supply of wheat. \n \n \n \n100 \nThe PM10 concentration in\
    \ the foraging room was measured with a DustTrak (TSI, model 8520) during 15 minutes\
    \ and the \nbehaviour of the laying hens was monitored. Mean PM10 concentrations\
    \ were 48.6 mg/m3 for the reference unit, 4.4 mg/m3 for \nSUNtastic (91% reduction),\
    \ and 3.6 mg/m3 for bLokken (94% reduction; all differences p<0.05). The absence\
    \ of a litter source \non the floor was attributed as the main cause for the reductions.\
    \ The behavioural observations showed a slight reduction of the \nforaging behaviour\
    \ for SUNtastic. We conclude that alternative foraging methods can reduce PM10\
    \ concentrations with more \nthan 90%, and offer promising perspectives for future\
    \ PM10 emission reduction from aviary laying hen houses. \nEffect of Odour Laboratory\
    \ in the Evaluation of Odour Removal Performance of Air Scrubbers \nNico Ogink,\
    \ Roland Melse \nWageningen Livestock Research, The Netherlands  \nEarlier research\
    \ in evaluating odour performance of air scrubbers demonstrated considerable differences\
    \ between laboratories \nwith different panel procedures and equipment that are\
    \ allowed within the European standard for odour concentration (EN13725). \nIn\
    \ the Netherlands odour regulations for livestock facilities include odour removal\
    \ percentages that are based on measurements \nby different laboratories. An exploratory\
    \ study was carried out with the aim to investigate whether systematic differences\
    \ exist \nbetween laboratory types when evaluating odour removal performance of\
    \ combined air scrubbers (combi-scrubbers). The odour \nsampling and measurements\
    \ were carried out both by a laboratory using the so-called forced choice method\
    \ (lab A) and a \nlaboratory using the yes/no-method (lab B). Also the olfactometric\
    \ equipment differed between lab A and B with regard to \nstabilisation time.\
    \ Measurements were carried out at two types of combi-scrubbers on four farm locations,\
    \ two farms per type. At \neach farm 6 odour removal measurements were done simultaneously\
    \ by the two laboratories in the summer of 2016. \nSystematic differences in reported\
    \ odour concentrations existed between both laboratories. Concentrations measured\
    \ by lab A \nwere on average 4.5 times as high as the values of lab B. The correlation\
    \ between the odour concentrations of identical samples \ntaken simultaneously\
    \ by both labs was weak (r = 0.24), which together with the large systematic difference,\
    \ indicates a low level \nof reproducibility. The study showed that both combi-scrubbers\
    \ achieved much lower odour removal efficiencies than their \nassigned values\
    \ of 85% and 70% in odour regulations, mean farm removal efficiencies varying\
    \ between -1 and 35%. Odour \nremoval performances did not significantly differ\
    \ between both laboratories at these low removal efficiencies. It is concluded\
    \ that \nthe observed low reproducibility between the two laboratories raise doubts\
    \ to the effectiveness of the current method for \ndetermining odour emission\
    \ factors and odour removal efficiencies in odour regulations. \nCurrent State\
    \ of Ionization Technique in Mitigation of Particulate Matter (PM) Emission from\
    \ Animal Barns \nAmirhossein Niroumand1, Sayed Derakhshani2 \n1Ragheb Isfahani\
    \ Higher Education Institute, Iran, Islamic Republic of; 2Wageningen University,\
    \ Farm Technology Group, \nWageningen, the Netherlands \nNowadays, there are some\
    \ significant challenges about designing of animal barns and the most important\
    \ one is finding effective \nways to reduce the rate of Particulate Matter (PM)\
    \ emission from them. Reducing the amount of dust in the indoor air of animal\
    \ \nbarns such as poultry houses not only reduces the overall emission of airborne\
    \ bacteria, ammonia, and odor emission into the \nenvironment but also has the\
    \ potential side benefit of improved animal productivity. \nCommon ways to reduce\
    \ PM emission are using the wet scrubbers, dry/biofilters, oil spraying systems,\
    \ and ionization technique. \nIn this study, the ionization technique is broadly\
    \ investigated and reviewed. After that, different methods for modelling ionization\
    \ \nincluding experimental, analytical, and numerical methods will be briefly\
    \ reviewed. At the end, the numerical techniques which \nhave been conducted to\
    \ model ionization will be determined to evaluate the pros and cons of those numerical\
    \ methods in \nmodelling the ionization. \nIn this study, the various numerical\
    \ methods are reviewed to determine their reliability and accuracy in the modelling\
    \ of ionization. \nIt is seen that the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique\
    \ is a suitable method for simulating the ionization phenomenon. \nAdditionally,\
    \ coupling this technique with the particle tracking methods such as Discrete\
    \ Element Method (DEM) could significantly \nincrease the accuracy of results.\
    \ In addition, the lack of sufficient study regarding the relation between the\
    \ electric filed and its \nimpact on the charging particle is observed. \nReviewing\
    \ the Current State of Particulate Matter (PM) Liberation Modelling Techniques\
    \ in Poultry Houses \nSayed Derakhshani1, Nico Ogink2, Peter Groot Koerkamp1,2,\
    \ Bram Bos2 \n1Wageningen University, Farm Technology Group, Wageningen, the Netherlands;\
    \ 2Wageningen Research, Wageningen \nLivestock Research, Wageningen, the Netherlands\
    \ \nLivestock housing, especially in the poultry and pig sectors, is a major source\
    \ of Particulate Matter (PM) emission into the \nenvironment. According to a report\
    \ in 2015, the Dutch agricultural sector makes up approximately 25% of the total\
    \ primary PM10 \nemission and almost 70% of this amount comes from poultry houses.\
    \ In other words, about 17% of total PM10 in the Netherlands \nis caused by poultry\
    \ houses which worries citizens and Dutch governments, and thus have to be reduced.\
    \ \nFactors such as manure property, poultry activities, and microclimate condition\
    \ of poultry house that influence the rate of dust \nliberation from poultry litter\
    \ are not sufficiently studied yet. Numerical modelling techniques are known as\
    \ cost effective and \nreliable methods for studying the effect of those factors\
    \ on the dust liberation. In this study, micro scale numerical models with \n\
    application in this field of study that are suitable for analysing systems of\
    \ approximately 1 m2 in size and about a minute in time \nwill be reviewed. \n\
    The review showed that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) coupled with Discrete\
    \ Element Method (DEM) can be used as a \nreliable and accurate technique for\
    \ modelling fine dust liberation from poultry litter. Considering the fact that\
    \ the dilute regime of \nPM10 has not any influence on the airflow pattern, it\
    \ was concluded that the Lagrangian particle tracking method along with one-\n\
    way coupling scheme should be used in CFD-DEM model to simulate fine dust liberation\
    \ from a simplified poultry bedding. \nSlurry Curtains for Improved Effect of\
    \ Point Extraction System in a Finishing Pig House \nAnders Leegaard Riis \nSEGES\
    \ Pig Research Centre, Denmark \n \n \n \n101 \nPoint extraction systems have\
    \ shown that they can collect the main part of odour and ammonia emissions in\
    \ a small amount of \nair that subsequently can be cleaned, and thereby be a cost-effective\
    \ solution in finishing pig houses. Due to the air flow pattern, \nthe highest\
    \ concentrations of ammonia and odour are found in the slurry channel underneath\
    \ the lying area, which is where the \nsuction points of the point extraction\
    \ system are placed. The aim of this study was to investigate if slurry curtains\
    \ improved the \neffect of a point extraction system in a finishing pig house.\
    \ The pig house had diffuse air inlet and a ventilation capacity of 100 \nm3/h/pig.\
    \ Of the total ventilation capacity, the first 10 m3/h/pig were ventilated through\
    \ the point extraction system. The remaining \n10-100% were ventilated through\
    \ a ceiling exhaust. In group 1, the experimental unit had only point extraction\
    \ system and group \n2 had point extraction system and two slurry curtains placed\
    \ in the slurry channel. The first slurry curtain was placed 2.2 m from \nthe\
    \ back end of each pen with a gap of 0.14 m underneath the slats. The second curtain\
    \ was placed 2.0 m from the other curtain \nand 1.5 m from the front of the pen\
    \ with a gap of 0.103 m. The results showed that 66%, 56% and 62% of the total\
    \ ammonia, \nodour and hydrogen sulphide emissions were collected in the exhaust\
    \ air by the point extraction system in group 1. In group 2, \n68%, 55% and 66%\
    \ of the total ammonia, odour and hydrogen sulphide emissions were collected by\
    \ the point extraction system. \nThe study confirmed that the point extraction\
    \ system could collect a significant amount of the total emissions. However, slurry\
    \ \ncurtains did not improve the collection of emissions significantly. \nClimate\
    \ and Light Control \nDifferences in Light Concepts of Animal Welfare at Dairy\
    \ Farms in North - East Germany \nJennifer Löbel, Paul Gütschow, Clemens Fuchs,\
    \ Sandra Rose-Meierhöfer \nHochschule Neubrandenburg, University of Applied Sciences,\
    \ Germany \nCow comfort is the basic requirement for the health and animal welfare\
    \ of dairy cows. Farmers underestimate many factors, \nespecially the installation\
    \ of extra equipment becomes neglected. In a research project was analyzed this\
    \ claim and were collected \n202 parameters in each barn of 34 dairy farms. The\
    \ farms are assorted to the number of milking cows (group 1: up to 300 milking\
    \ \ncows, group 2: 301 to 599 milking cows, group 3: 600 to 900 milking cows,\
    \ group 4: over 900 milking cows). For this study we \nonly looked at the housing\
    \ conditions, especially at the light types and light conditions in the barns\
    \ and milking parlours. The light \nconditions were measured with lux meters.\
    \ The data collection occurred three hours after feeding at three different places\
    \ in the \nbarn: the feeding table, at the cubicles and in the milking parlour\
    \ at the milker pit and the cow area. Each measurement was \ncarried out with\
    \ light turned on and off. On the feeding table the light conditions were in average\
    \ 878 lx (light turned off), so it was \nmore than the theoretical optimum value\
    \ of 200 lx. In the cow area, the light conditions were very bad in each barn:\
    \ on average \n64 lx (light turned off) and 96 lx (light turned on). The same\
    \ issue presented in the milking parlour. The broadest grievance is the \nchoice\
    \ and the intensity of the lamp types. Only one barn has LED lamps. The other\
    \ 33 farms have light pipes in their barns and \n5 of them have also metal halide\
    \ lamps. These types show that the light intensity cannot be well because light\
    \ pipes have no big \nilluminance. This inventory and unawareness of the farmers\
    \ show the biggest deficits in regards to light systems in new and old \nbarns.\
    \ \nInfluence of Increased Light Intensity on the Lying and Excretory Behavior\
    \ of Fattening Pigs \nSvenja Opderbeck1, Barbara Kessler2, Eva Gallmann1 \n1University\
    \ of Hohenheim, Germany; 2Bildungs- und Wissenszentrum Boxberg, Germany \nDue\
    \ to the increased demands on animal welfare in pig farming, animal welfare labels\
    \ have been introduced and set requirements \nfor the size, design and enrichment\
    \ of the different functional areas in pig husbandry. In this project lasting\
    \ from 2018 till 2020, \ndifferent options will be tested to rebuild conventional\
    \ fully slatted housing system for fattening pigs. One main aim is to design a\
    \ \ncomfortable lying area that is used as such throughout the year. \nOn a research\
    \ farm in two compartments with six pens à 18 pigs, the influence of different\
    \ pen structures and management tools \nare under investigation. In the two further\
    \ compartments with four pens à 28 pigs, the influence of a floor cooling or heating\
    \ will \nbe tested. In this paper, the first results of the effect of an increased\
    \ light intensity on the lying and excretory behavior of fattening \npigs are\
    \ shown. This was tested in four pens with identical pen design, with eighteen\
    \ pigs in each, over two fattening periods. In \ntwo of the four pens the light\
    \ intensity over the slatted floor (0,5 m² per pig) was increased by means of\
    \ two spotlights positioned \nabove the slatted area. The lying area was 0,6 m²\
    \ per pig and the total area was 1,1 m² per pig. With two lux meters, the light\
    \ \nintensity was measured over the lying and the excretory area. Weekly scores\
    \ were used to monitor the fouling of the pen and the \nanimals. Using video analysis,\
    \ the lying behavior was monitored three times a day, three days a week. First\
    \ results show a \ndecreased fouling of the lying area and animals in the pens\
    \ with increased light intensity and that more animals use the lying area \nfor\
    \ resting compared to the pens without increased light intensity. \nSensitivity\
    \ Analysis of Animal Modelling Approach on Airflow Pattern in a Pig House by Numerical\
    \ Study \nHao Li, Li Rong, Guoqiang Zhang \nAarhus University, Denmark \nKnowledge\
    \ of the airflow pattern in the animal housing is essential for ventilation system\
    \ design and animal welfare. \nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling has\
    \ been increasingly adopted in studies of airflow distribution within the animal\
    \ \nhouse. However, due to the limitation of the computational power, simplified\
    \ animal modelling approaches, e.g., rectangular \nprism, cylinder, and porous\
    \ media, are commonly used in the full-scale simulation study. To identify the\
    \ uncertainty of the \nmodelling approaches, numerical studies were conducted\
    \ first on single pen scale to compare the simplified approaches with the \napproach\
    \ with complex pig model. Additionally, two porous treatment methods were also\
    \ investigated for airflow pattern. The first \none is full porous treatment in\
    \ which defines the resistance coefficients of the pig pen as a whole part. The\
    \ second one is \nseparated porous treatment which separates the pig pen into\
    \ parts based on pigs location and defines the resistance coefficients \nof each\
    \ part separately. Full-scale simulations using both porous media and complex\
    \ animal geometric model were furtherly \nconducted to investigate the influence\
    \ of using porous media on large-scale simulations. The complex animal models\
    \ were placed \nat three locations in different cases, i.e., at the first pen\
    \ close to the inlet, at the pen in the middle of the pig barn, and at the pen\
    \ \nthat is close to the outlet. Results show that simplifications of animal models\
    \ do influence the airflow pattern, although those \napproaches can reduce the\
    \ computational requirement on both modeling process and iteration time. \n \n\
    \ \n \n102 \nSmart Complex Ventilation for Thermal Environmental Control of Livestock\
    \ Housing \nGuoqiang Zhang \nAarhus University, Denmark \nA sustainable livestock\
    \ production requires smart ventilation system design and control to ensure (1)\
    \ optimal thermal environment \nand (2) desired air quality in house; (3) minimum\
    \ environmental impact to the atmosphere and (4) consuming minimum energy \nfor\
    \ the operation. Such a system is very much region (local climate) dependent.\
    \ In a climate complex region, a smart complex \nsystem should be considered for\
    \ an optimal result. This paper provide a few examples of varied design and control\
    \ of such a \ncomplex system. \nCombination of tunnel ventilation with wet cooling\
    \ pad in summer hot weather and mixing ventilation mode in other period is one\
    \ \nof the complex systems. Using this method, the heat stress of animals can\
    \ be mitigated via high ventilation air speed in room and \ncooled supply air\
    \ during the hot summer; and the operation and control of mixing ventilation instead\
    \ of tunnel ventilation in other \nperiod can maintain the desired thermal condition\
    \ in rest of year and to avoid draft in cold winter weather. \nCombination of\
    \ diffusion ceiling air supply and ceiling (wall) jet supply can ensure very low\
    \ airspeed in animal occupant zone \n(AOZ) in winter by using diffusion ceiling\
    \ air intake to avoid draft issue; and switch to jet air supply when outdoor air\
    \ temperature \nabove a defined level, to increase airflow speed in AOZ to avoid\
    \ possible heat stress in summer. \nHybrid air exhaust design is another approach\
    \ to remove the most pollutant air via the pit exhaust and send it to an air purification\
    \ \nunit for cleaning. Such a design and control can greatly improve the indoor\
    \ air quality and effective cleaning the exhaust air for \nreducing the negative\
    \ environmental impact of livestock production. The hybrid air exhaust can not\
    \ only applied to a mainly \nmechanically ventilated housing but also a mainly\
    \ naturally ventilated housing. \nModelling of Environmental Time Series in Livestock\
    \ Facilities by Hybrid Model of ARIMA with Wavelet \nTransform \nRoberto Besteiro\
    \ Doval, Tamara Arango López, M. Dolores Fernández Rodríguez, M. Ramiro Rodríguez\
    \ Rodríguez \nUniversity of Santiago de Compostela, Spain \nEnvironmental control\
    \ in livestock buildings is a key element to ensure optimal animal welfare and\
    \ to reduce the environmental \nimpact of animal activity. Although environmental\
    \ control has been performed mainly by establishing a temperature setpoint, the\
    \ \ndevelopment of Big Data and smart farming have brought to light new methodologies\
    \ –such as those based on predictive control– \nthat allow for the incorporation\
    \ of different environmental variables. The statistical modelling of such variables\
    \ allows for the use \nof predictive control algorithms that are more precise\
    \ than traditional algorithms. Wavelet transform is a recent technique for \n\
    modelling time series that allows for multi-resolution analysis of the series,\
    \ which helps improve the performance of the generated \nmodels. This paper compares\
    \ the performance of hybrid models combining a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)\
    \ and an ARIMA \nmodel. For the purposes of comparison, we modelled a relative\
    \ humidity series from a weaned piglet building in northwest Spain \nusing an\
    \ ARIMA model and a hybrid Wavelet-ARIMA model, and implemented on-line and off-line\
    \ predictions of the hybrid model. \nWith the off-line hybrid model, prefiltering\
    \ the time series considerably reduced prediction errors as compared to conventional\
    \ \nARIMA modelling (Mean Absolute Relative Error, MARE: 0.4% vs. 1.5%), which\
    \ provided a more precise modelling. The \nprediction errors for real-time modelling\
    \ using the hybrid model (MARE: 1.5%) were very similar to those obtained with\
    \ the \nconventional model and therefore greater than the errors of the off-line\
    \ hybrid model. Such a decrease in the efficiency of the \nhybrid model was caused\
    \ by the influence of the border distortion on the wavelet transform technique.\
    \ \nIn conclusion, statistical DWT-based hybrid models significantly improve the\
    \ performance of traditional models. Yet, such an \nimprovent was not verified\
    \ for on-line predictions. Consequently, our research must continue on the search\
    \ of the optimal design \nfor these models. \n \n \n \n \n \n103 \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ daffodil-derived galanthamine production by integrating daffodil growing into\
    \ permanent upland sheep pasture. \nThe aim is to increase the economic sustainability\
    \ of hill farming by providing farmers with a high value supplementary daffodil\
    \ \ncrop while maintaining a traditional farming system. \nMachinery is readily\
    \ available for lowland daffodil production for the cut flower market and for\
    \ the production of bulbs. Soils are \ntypically deep, fertile and free draining.\
    \ However, the UK uplands are characterised by low temperatures; exposure to wind;\
    \ high \nrainfall; winter snow and frosts; thin impoverished stony soils; a shortage\
    \ of major nutrients and steep slopes. As part of the \nresearch project Harper\
    \ Adams University agricultural engineers have developed machines for planting\
    \ daffodil bulbs and \nharvesting the above ground daffodil biomass in these arduous\
    \ upland grassland pastures. The planter uses belts to meter and \ndeliver bulbs\
    \ from the storage hopper to two drop chutes positioned above the purpose built\
    \ ground opening winged tines spaced \nso as to produce rows 850 mm apart. The\
    \ harvester flails, removes and collects the above ground biomass which is then\
    \ \ntransferred to sealed containers before being processed. \nEvaluation of an\

    Engineering; 4SEGES, Denmark \nAn accurate and uniform seeding depth is crucial\
    \ for homogeneous crop development, as the depth affects the length of the crop,\
    \ \nemergence period, and the germination rate. A homogenous crop establishment\
    \ supports a robust crop development, which in \nmost cases has a positive effect\
    \ on the yield. Considerable seeding depth variations can be observed under practical\
    \ conditions \nfor low-cost as well as high-end modern seed drills. These variations\
    \ can be correlated to variable soil resistance affecting the \ndrill coulters\
    \ depths. The spatial field variability is caused by variations in the soil mechanical\
    \ properties, e.g. variations in texture, \nwater content or tillage treatment.\
    \ The results of these factors are unwanted low-frequent coulter depth vibrations\
    \ and, \nconsequently non-uniform and incorrect seeding depths. \nThe aim of the\
    \ study was to develop a seed drill with coulter depth sensing and an automatic\
    \ coulter pressure control system to \nmaintaining a consistent depth. Furthermore,\
    \ the focus was to evaluate system performance in a field experiment together\
    \ with \nan estimation of areas with poorly established crop. \nA survey study\
    \ among Danish crop production advisors indicates that suboptimal winter wheat\
    \ establishment may account for \nconsiderable yield loss (average of 8 pct. poorly\
    \ established crop area). A range of causes are assessed to have significance,\
    \ \ne.g. hill top, field depressions, poorly drainage, structural damage, suboptimal\
    \ tillage strategy, etc. However, between 75-94 pct. \nof the farmers established\
    \ their desired seedbed, seeded at the best estimated time and in their desired\
    \ depth. \nThe experimental evaluation of the developed depth control system included\
    \ a randomised split-plot field experiment and an \nanalysis of the data, by monitoring\
    \ the seed drill and quantifying the agronomic effect. \nThe research showed that\
    \ soil variation in the experimental field considerably impacted the coulter depths,\
    \ however, the \nmagnitude was reduced after activating the automatic coulter\
    \ depth control system. \nManaging Weeds in Wheat and Pulses by Optimising Plant\

    \ 2Analist Group, Italy; 3CREA-CI, Italy \nWeed competition is a major constrain\
    \ in both organic and non-organic cropping systems. In Mediterranean environments,\
    \ it can \nrepresent a major drawback of pulses, since breeding have scarcely\
    \ taken into account the competitive ability against weeds. \nSuch limits are\
    \ particularly important in organic cropping systems, where legumes are needed\
    \ to increase crop biodiversity and \nprovide or spare N through biological N\
    \ fixation or N sparing. Previous reports on wheat showed that the crop competitive\
    \ ability \nagainst weeds can strongly be improved by a proper management of the\
    \ plant spatial arrangement. We also have seen that such \n \n \n \n105 \nmanagement\
    \ consists, at one time, in an increase of the ability of nutrient uptake irrespective\
    \ of the presence of weeds, and such \nresults is likely mediated by a stimulation\
    \ of the growth rate during the early phases of the crop growth. \nThe objective\
    \ of this work was to evaluate the effects of sowing time and spatial arrangement\
    \ of chickpea, lentil and durum wheat \non weed biomass and yield using an unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platform equipped with visible, thermal,\
    \ and \nmultispectral sensors for precision agriculture applications. \nDurum\
    \ wheat and pulses were sown in two contrasting spatial arrangements (5-cm and\
    \ 17-cm rows) with constant seed rate per \nspecies. Legumes were sown both at\
    \ the end of autumn (December) and in the middle of winter (February), in a Vertisol\
    \ located \nin a semi-arid Mediterranean area in Italy. \nPreliminary results\
    \ showed a significant effect of sowing time and spatial arrangement on traits\
    \ evaluated. In particular, the \npercentage of soil coverage and weed biomass,\
    \ estimated using RGB (visible), multispectral (NDVI) and thermal images captured\
    \ \nduring the growing season, showed a better performance of treatments in which\
    \ the plants were sown with a reduced inter-row \ndistance (i.e. 5 cm). The discrimination\
    \ results will be presented and discussed. \nTillage and Controlled Traffic Farming\

    \ ApS, Denmark; 2Aarhus University, Denmark \nThe necessity of reducing production\
    \ costs in a demand growing food market has lead the agricultural manufacturers\
    \ to produce \nlarger and accordingly heavier machinery. This development can\
    \ indirectly cause adverse effects on crop development and yield \nin many fields\
    \ due to the deterioration of the soil physical properties caused by intense heavy\
    \ traffic. \nReducing traffic intensity by optimised route planning is one of\
    \ many strategies that have been profusely described in literature \nto mitigate\
    \ soil compaction problems. A fleet logistics optimisation tool has been used\
    \ to simulate optimised harvesting operations, \nin order to compare the traffic\
    \ intensity of simulated and recorded operations over a set of fields. The tool\
    \ optimises the harvest \ntime by planning the route for all the vehicles involved\
    \ in the operation, reducing idle times in the field and inefficient driving by\
    \ \nguiding the operators in the right directions at the right times. \nThe traffic\
    \ intensity has been calculated by dividing the field into a grid and for each\
    \ cell counting the number of vehicle passes, \nthe total vehicle weight, and\
    \ maximum weight at one time. Even though the logistics optimisation tool used\
    \ in the analysis is not \ndesigned to reduce traffic intensity in the field,\
    \ the results show reduced traffic in the field, principally in the main field\
    \ area where \nthe crop is most productive, as it confines most of the non-working\
    \ traffic to the headlands. \nThe benefits of such system are not only a higher\
    \ efficiency of the fleet operations, but the reduced impact on the soil also\
    \ \ncontributes to a more sustainable land management, which translates into sustainable\
    \ intensification in practise. \nControlled Traffic Farming “light”- A way to\
    \ Improve Soil Structure? \nAnnett Latsch, Thomas Anken \nAgroscope, Switzerland\
    \ \nTraffic induced soil compaction and the associated negative effects on soil\
    \ structure and soil functions have been shown to be \nsignificantly reduced by\
    \ the use of permanent traffic lanes for all field vehicles – known as Controlled\
    \ Traffic Farming (CTF). With \nregard to a sustainable management of agricultural\
    \ soils CTF is also an interesting approach for Switzerland, but with permanent\
    \ \nlanes only for heavy machines (contact pressure >0.8 bar) used for crop protection,\
    \ fertilisation and harvesting. Three-year trials \n(2015-2017) on 17 fields located\
    \ in the Swiss Central Plateau were used to investigate the practicability of\
    \ such a “CTF-light”-\nsystem with standard machinery and to examine the effects\
    \ of permanent lanes in combination with minimum tillage (depth max. \n10 cm)\
    \ on soil physical properties and yields. Soil and yield surveys were carried\
    \ out in four replications within and between \nharvest lanes. Penetration, infiltration\
    \ and yield data were collected once a year. In addition, soil samples from three\
    \ selected \nsites were taken in spring 2017 to determine macropore volume and\
    \ bulk density. \nHarmonization of machine working widths was challenging and\
    \ required intense planning, but “CTF-light” could be realized on all \nsites.\
    \ After three years of controlled trafficking an incipient differentiation of\
    \ soil properties could be observed. In untrafficked \nareas there was a tendency\
    \ to decreased penetration resistance and bulk density as well as increased infiltration\
    \ rate and \nmacropore volume. This had a significant positive effect on maize\
    \ yield, which is known to be very sensitive to soil compaction. \nFor other field\
    \ crops no consistent yield differences could yet be determined. Considering that\
    \ soil regeneration is a very slow \nprocess, results indicate that soil structure\
    \ and soil functions can be improved by “CTF-light”. However, the technical and\
    \ \norganizational effort to realize permanent traffic lanes for heavy standard\
    \ machines is not to be underestimated. \nOptimization of the Main-Headland Zone\

    \ a homogenous seedbed is crucial for successful crop establishments. A successful\
    \ crop establishment \nensures the desired germination and crop development, which\
    \ may increase the yield. Inversion tillage using mouldboard \nploughing may be\
    \ required – depending on climate, soil type and cropping system. If so, an adequate\
    \ ploughing operation \ncovering the entire field is highly preferred in order\
    \ to achieve a homogenous seedbed. \nSpecial attention should be given to the\
    \ intersection zone between headlands and the main working area of the field.\
    \ Overlapping \nwith multiple inversions causes uncontrolled mixing of the topsoil,\
    \ rather than the desired soil inversion. Thereby, it may lead to \n \n \n \n\
    106 \ninsufficient weed treatment and undesired incorporation of surface residue,\
    \ which may impair crop establishment and increase \nweed infestation. This issue\
    \ is relevant in organic farming as well as conventional. \nThe research aim was\
    \ to study and develop a full-scale mouldboard plough with individual section\
    \ control and to evaluate the \nagronomic effects as the result of the section\
    \ control. The concept of individual section control was verified using modelling\
    \ and \nthe controllable mouldboard plough was evaluated in a randomised plot\
    \ experiment on a temperate sandy loam soil in Denmark. \nThe research showed\
    \ that the plough was functional for individual section control, which significantly\
    \ reduced the overlapped \narea, hereby improving the conditions for crop establishment.\
    \ In additional, the functional system was developed with hydraulic \nstone release\
    \ and individually activation and deactivation of the sections. By deactivating\
    \ one section, a new traction force \nreduction control system was integrated,\
    \ usable when operating in hilly areas, as more traction force is needed uphill,\
    \ than \ndownhill. Furthermore, on-the-go deactivation of the individually sections\
    \ can also be used to improve wedge operations, when \nfinalizing the main working\
    \ area of the field. \nYield Response and Crop Damage Induced by Multipath vs.\

    \ experiment was conducted in the western part of Jutland, Denmark (56°3'34.09\"\

    \ and changes in fresh biomass (t/ha) induced by the three trailers by comparing\
    \ with a \ncontrol (no driving). Precisely, the effects of a multipath trailer\
    \ equipped with an offset steering system (i.e. lower load per width, \nkg/cm)\
    \ and two commonly used multidrive standard transport trailers were compared.\
    \ \nThis study reported that the yield harvested using the four different treatments\
    \ were not significantly different, thus, not affected \nby higher total load\

    \ (often fatal) accidents in agriculture; in Italy annually determines about 120-140\
    \ \nvictims. The ROPS (Rolling Over Protective Structure), in combination with\
    \ a seat belt regularly fastened, retain and protect the \ndriver from being hit\
    \ and crushed by the tractor in case of overturning. \nVarious types of ROPS are\
    \ available, from simple two post roll-bar to cabs. For narrow-track tractors,\
    \ used particularly in \nspecialized crops (fruit, grapevine, vegetable and nursery\
    \ gardening, greenhouse, etc.), two post roll-bar, fitted in front of the \ntractor\
    \ and that could be tilted to allow the travelling under canopy without damaging\
    \ foliage and fruits, were introduced for a long \ntime. These roll-bars were\
    \ designed to stay in vertical position (protection on), or be lowered when the\
    \ vehicle has to pass in the \nrows or under the trees. Unfortunately, very often\
    \ this type of roll-bar after being tilted, is not longer repositioned vertically,\
    \ \nneutralizing its protective function. \nFor eliminating this problem, INAIL\
    \ (National Insurance Institute for Occupational Accidents) has funded a research\

    \ deposition and \ndistribution in orchard trees of nowadays often used orchard\
    \ sprayers. Potential pathways of improvement are air amount, air \ndistribution,\
    \ nozzle type and therefore liquid distribution as the spray is transported by\
    \ the moving air into the tree canopy. \nComparative measurements of a reference\
    \ spray technique and multiple-row spraying techniques are performed for liquid\
    \ \n \n \n \n107 \ndistribution, air distribution and spray deposition in apple\
    \ trees. The objective is to find the optimum combination of application \nparameters\
    \ for different stages of canopy development to improve spray deposition (following\
    \ ISO-22522) in tree canopies and \nminimise emission to the environment. In the\
    \ experiments multiple-row orchard sprayers were compared to a conventional cross-\n\
    flow fan sprayer. First results of the Munckhof multiple-row sprayer are described\
    \ for spray deposition in the fruit trees showing \nthat spray deposition can\
    \ be increased by 25%. Spray drift measurements (following ISO22866) with the\
    \ Munckhof multiple-row \nsprayer incorporating adjusted nozzle and air settings\
    \ in the outside tree rows of the orchard show that spray drift reduction can\
    \ \nbe classified in the Drift Reduction Technology (DRT) classes DRT95, DRT97.5\
    \ and DRT99 (following ISO22369). When spraying \nwith multiple row sprayers,\
    \ the tree rows are sprayed from both sides at the same time, in contrast to standard\
    \ orchard sprayers \nthat spray the tree row only from one side at a time. Results\
    \ show that spray deposition is improved with multiple row sprayers \nand dose\
    \ can therefore be reduced accordingly, without reducing biological efficacy.\
    \ Spray drift of these multiple row spraying \nsystems is also reduced. The emission\
    \ of plant protection products to the environment can therefore be further decreased\
    \ \nbecause of the required lower input of plant protection products with these\
    \ systems. \nLaser-guided Variable-rate Pesticide Spray Technology for Specialty\

    \ retrofit for most orchard air-blast sprayers currently used \nin ornamental\

    \ the foliage \ndensity, measure the travel speed, calculate the sectional canopy\
    \ volume and spray volume designated to individual nozzles, \nand manage variable\
    \ numbers of nozzles to discharge variable spray outputs to match tree architectures.\
    \ Field tests of the new \nspray system retrofitted on four conventional sprayers\
    \ owned by growers and on six concept-proven sprayers started in 2017. \nEvaluations\
    \ included effectiveness of insect pest and disease control and new spray system\
    \ reliability under commercial \nnurseries, apple orchards, peach orchards, blueberry\
    \ and raspberry production, and vineyards in five different states of different\
    \ \nclimates. On-farm field tests demonstrated the pest control efficacies of\
    \ the spray systems with and without the laser-guided \nspray control function\
    \ were comparable, while the sprayers activated with the control function could\
    \ reduce pesticide use by more \nthan 60% with significant annual chemical savings.\
    \ This new spray control system will significantly advance conventional spray\

    \ specially adapted to traditional olive canopies was \ndeveloped and tested in\
    \ real field conditions. This work aimed to assess the main spray quality parameters\
    \ of this sprayer, its \ndrift losses and also its work capacity in comparison\
    \ with a conventional sprayer. \nA total of 30 ha were sprayed with both sprayers\
    \ ─ with Tartrazine as tracer ─ in a commercial olive farm with traditional cultivation\
    \ \npattern (quincunx disposition, 12 x 10 m). The two machines were monitored\
    \ with pressure and flow sensors and a GPS modem \nto record data every second\
    \ to track them. The theoretical applied volume was 900 L ha-1, with a forward\
    \ speed of 4 km h-1. A \ntotal of 2 trees per ha, selected at random, were monitored\
    \ to compare the coverage levels of both treatments by using water \nsensitive\
    \ paper (WSP). 5 more trees were completely monitored with WSP and filter paper\
    \ to assess the spray coverage and \ndeposition, respectively, in the whole tree\
    \ crown. 150-mm Petri dishes were placed on the ground to assess the spray drift\
    \ losses. \nThe results showed that the spray deposition and coverage were higher\
    \ and more homogeneous in the case of the prototype \n(25% and 85%, respectively),\
    \ especially in height, having the prototype much higher deposit in the top of\
    \ the crown. This fact \nwas also supported by the random coverage sampling. In\
    \ the case of the field work performance, it was similar in both cases, \nwith\
    \ effective work ratio of 67%. The drift was reduced by the prototype in about\
    \ 53%. These results confirm that adapting the \nspraying machinery is a necessary\
    \ step to match the European guidelines. \nSprayer Boom Optimization for Bed-Grown\

    \ & Research, The Netherlands \nFor full-field grown arable crops, the application\
    \ of evenly distributed sprays can be managed by selecting proper nozzles, nozzle\
    \ \nspacings and sprayer boom height. For bed-grown crops, ideally the spray is\
    \ applied evenly to the bed only, while no spray \nshould be applied onto the\
    \ paths in between the beds. This is a complicating factor that usually cannot\
    \ be fulfilled easily. \nA model has been developed to help design the adequate\
    \ set-ups of nozzles on a sprayer boom optimized for bed-grown crops. \nFor this\
    \ purpose, the spray distribution patterns of various single nozzles at different\
    \ boom heights have been measured on a \npatternator. The model combines these\
    \ spray patterns while varying nozzle types, nozzle spacings and the position\
    \ and tilting of \nend nozzles. The model searches for set-ups that fulfil the\
    \ requirements as defined by the user. \nCurrently, the model focussed on the\
    \ use of Lechler Varioselect fourfold nozzle bodies to find optimal solutions\
    \ for beds with \nwidths between 1.1 and 1.5 m and boom heights of 0.2 to 0.6\
    \ m above the crop, while being able to apply different dose rates \ndepending\
    \ on crop canopy height. Hundreds of thousands potential set-ups were simulated,\
    \ but only relatively few meet the \nrequirements. In the ideal set-up the application\
    \ rate would be manageable by merely opening or closing the nozzles while \nassuring\
    \ an even spray distribution on top of the bed. The model can be modified easily\
    \ to use different nozzle types and boom \n \n \n \n108 \nset-ups, provided that\
    \ the necessary spray patterns are available. Different user requirements can\
    \ be implemented as well, for \ninstance for band spraying or other user-definable\

    \ the biggest challenge of raspberry production is the reduction of sunburn related\

    \ Breeding of resilient species is a long period, it can take several years, while\

    Zande \nWageningen University & Research, The Netherlands  \nIn fruit production\
    \ reliable and accurate information is needed for optimal orchard management.\
    \ Due to an increase in farm size \nand high labour input, a grower gets less\
    \ information feedback from what is going on in the orchard. Besides that, more\
    \ detailed \ninformation about the fruit production is needed later in the chain\
    \ to meet consumer demands and regulation requirements. \nTherefore the goal in\
    \ the Fruit 4.0 project is to get a better insight in apple production by gathering\
    \ more data and improving data \nmanagement. \nIn order to improve current practices\
    \ we aim to quantify the most important parameters used in decision making during\
    \ the growth \nseason: number of blossom clusters, fruit number and size (> 10\
    \ mm), shoot length, leaf vitality, leaf quantity and fruit colour. \nThroughout\
    \ the growing season it is also a goal to measure tree parameters such as canopy\
    \ volume, height and vitality. Sensors \nused for these purposes are a 2d-lidar\
    \ system, a chlorophyll sensor and a RGB-d camera. \nApple trees produce variable\
    \ numbers of flowers per year, but in general high numbers, with a high variability.\
    \ To get to an optimal \nnumber, chemical, mechanical or manual thinning is applied\
    \ by the grower. To automate this process we are using RGB-d images \ntaken throughout\
    \ the flowering period and at fruitlet stage combined with different classification\
    \ techniques to estimate the number \nof blossoms and fruitlets per tree, to apply\
    \ tree-specific thinning in the future. \nAt later stages of the growing season\
    \ the number and size of fruits are determined to optimise yield estimations and\
    \ the harvest \ntime, so labour requirements can be better estimated and planned.\
    \ The demonstrated multi-sensor setup gives better insight into \nthe growing\
    \ conditions of the trees in order to optimise crop protection application and\
    \ management practices tree specifically. \nAnalysis of Different Mechanical Pruning\

    \ which represent around 15.3% of the total production costs. The objective \n\
    of this study was to analyse the effect of different mechanical pruning strategies\
    \ on the production of mandarins variety \n‘Clemenules’ comparing them with manual\
    \ pruning, and to determine their costs. \nA trial with a random blocks experimental\
    \ design with 5 repetitions was carried out in a commercial Clemenules orchard\
    \ located \nin Calicanto (Valencia). During season 2017, eight pruning strategies\
    \ were assessed: C (control, no pruning); M (manual pruning, \nwith hand saw and\
    \ pruning shears); and six mechanical pruning with disc pruner: TEW (Topping,\
    \ Hedging both sides, East and \nWest), TR (Topping, Manual follow-up), TER (Topping,\
    \ Hedging Est side, Manual follow-up), TE (Topping, Hedging Est side), \nEW (Hedging\
    \ both sides) and E (Hedging Est side). The results of trials showed differences\
    \ in production and costs between the \npruning strategies. C was significantly\
    \ the most productive with 157 kg/tree; the following more productive were M,\
    \ EW and E \nranging between 128 and 132 kg/tree with no differences between them;\
    \ and in a third level were all treatments where Topping \nwas carried out (TEW,\
    \ TE, TER and TR) that oscillate between 72 and 85 kg/tree without significant\
    \ differences between them. \nCost were higher for treatments with manual pruning.\
    \ Cost for M was 441 €/ha and for the treatments with manual follow-up \npruning\
    \ they oscillated between 459 and 293 €/ha. However, the cost for mechanical pruning\
    \ ranged between 25 to 110 €/ha \ndepending on the number of machine passes. To\
    \ get more consistent conclusions, more seasons must be performed. \n'Clemenrubi'\

    \ thinning is the operation of removing fruits on the tree in order to increase\
    \ final fruit size. Citrus fruit thinning is usually done \nby hand, selecting\
    \ the adequate fruits to remove. Mechanical thinning has been tested to reduce\
    \ costs. In this research work, \nfruit growth from trees with different thinning\
    \ treatments (intensities and dates of manual and mechanical thinning) were tested\
    \ in \norder to asses fruit size increase with a non-selective mechanical thinning\
    \ compared to the selective manual thinning. Early \nsevere thinning treatments\
    \ had fruits with higher diameter close to harvesting time. Mechanical thinning\
    \ treatments needed more \nthan 30 days to have fruits with higher diameter values\
    \ than the fruits from the non-thinned trees. However, when the thinning \ntreatment\
    \ is done close to the harvesting date, the fruits left on the tree do not have\
    \ enough time to increase fruit size. \nMechanical Pruning of Lemon Trees \nBernardo\

    \ of Cartagena, Spain; 2Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain \nManual pruning\
    \ of lemons in the Southeast of Spain entails approximately 39% of the total labour\
    \ costs of the crop. Mechanical \npruning can be integrated into a management\
    \ strategy to reduce pruning costs. However, this technique is not widely accepted\
    \ \nby farmers for many reasons, such as a lack of rigorous studies with varieties\
    \ and farm management justifying its potential \nbenefits. \nThis research evaluates\
    \ mechanical pruning combined with manual pruning in 'Fino 95' lemons over four\
    \ years. Five pruning \ntreatments have been carried out with different intensities\
    \ of mechanisation: hand pruning (Mcontrol) and four types of mechanical \npruning:\
    \ FTDR/FTIR (mechanical skirting, topping and hedging of one face of the orchard\
    \ plus manual pruning of the opposite \nface to the one hedged), FTR (mechanical\
    \ skirting and topping plus manual pruning of all the tree), FTDI (mechanical\
    \ skirting, \ntopping and both faces hedging). \nMoreover, each year different\
    \ types of pruning have been applied to each tree. In this work the results of\
    \ the two first years of \nexperiments are shown, that include the following combinations\
    \ (year 1 + year 2): FTDR + FTIR, Mcontrol + Mcontrol, FTR + \nFTR, FTDI + hand,\
    \ FTD + FTI. \nYield, fruit size, fruit quality, pruned biomass and pruning cost\
    \ have been analysed. \nThe accumulated production was significantly higher in\
    \ the treatment of mechanical pruning with alternate faces hedging during \nthe\
    \ two years and without manual intervention (FTD + FTI). On the other hand, the\
    \ least productive treatment was the one where \ntrees were pruned mechanically\
    \ with a subsequent hand pruning. The treatment with the highest yield was the\
    \ one with the lowest \nbiomass cut. Additionally, fruit size was inversely proportional\

    \ fields, and not all fields do not contain the same weed pressure. Therefore,\
    \ \nthere is a potential to apply pesticides in a non-uniform manner across a\
    \ single field based on a weed intensity map, and also a \nnew strategic option\
    \ to choose which fields to spray when the opportunity/the optional weather conditions\
    \ is present. Many \nexternal factors can limit the time window for applying pesticides\
    \ and plant protection efficiently, such as rain and heavy winds. \nIn this limited\
    \ time window, it is advisable to attend to the most problematic fields first.\
    \ \nIn this paper, we present an automated and low-cost method for measuring and\
    \ mapping weed intensities in row crop fields. An \nautomated weed intensity mapping,\
    \ may produce insight to the position of weed patches, allowing for graduated\
    \ spraying, and \naverage weed pressure across fields, to serve as an operational\

    \ weed treatment, as mechanical weeding also suffers from limited time windows\
    \ due to weather. In mechanical \nweeding, the knowledge of the position of weed\
    \ patches can also serve as a tool for in field prioritization. \nWe present weed\
    \ intensity data from multiple agricultural fields, and show how automated weed\
    \ intensity mapping can serve as \na tool to save time and pesticides in weed\

    \ University & Research developed a machine vision based intra row hoeing machine\
    \ in collaboration with Steketee, \na manufacturer of agricultural machinery.\
    \ Although the machine is used in agricultural practice for several years already\
    \ there is \nstill a lack of an experimental method to evaluate the field performance\
    \ of such a device. Reliable, quantitative information about \nthe performance\
    \ of the machine in the field is therefore not known and the effect of variations\
    \ in field conditions and machine \nsettings on the performance were not previously\
    \ researched. The relative number of crop plants damaged by the machine and \n\
    the relative amount of soil around the crop plants not hoed were used as criteria\
    \ to assess the field performance. The performance \nwas measured both manually\
    \ on the field and with the help of sensors by logging the actuation response\
    \ of the hoeing elements. \nIn th e field trial four treatments were combined:\
    \ 1) the relative number of lettuce plants, 2) the weed density on the field,\
    \ 3) the \ndriving speed during hoeing, and 4) the moment of hoeing. Each combination\
    \ was repeated three times. It was concluded that \nthe developed method was suitable\
    \ to determine statistically significant differences in the hoeing results for\
    \ the applied \ntreatments. The performance of the machine showed to be quite\
    \ sensitive for the settings of the user such as e.g. the value for \nthe plant\
    \ segmentation threshold and the not to be hoed safety zones. No difference in\
    \ the machine performance was found for \ndifferent numbers of missing crop plants\
    \ in a plant row. The machine performance decreased in terms of the relative number\
    \ of \ndamaged crop plants in case of high weed density treatments and decreased\
    \ in terms of the relative number of not hoed intra \nrow spaces in case of high\
    \ speed treatments. \nClassification of Herbicide Resistant Papaver rhoeas L.\

    \ exist at the market today, which are usable for plant status measurements. For\
    \ implementing a \nsuccessful sort- and long- term herbicide management strategy\
    \ it is of vital importance to identify herbicide-resistant populations. \nIn\
    \ the current study, we examined the classification of herbicide sensitive and\
    \ resistant plants with a spectrometer. A herbicide \nsensitive and a resistant\
    \ population of Papaver rhoeas L. and Stellaria media L. were sprayed with three\
    \ different acetolactate-\nsynthase (ALS) inhibitors, namely tribenuron-methyl,\
    \ metsulfuron-methyl, and florasulam. Water spraying was used for the \nuntreated\
    \ control plants. The spectrometer had a spectral range of 360-1000 nm with a\
    \ resolution of 10 nm. For each \nmeasurement, information for both the plant\
    \ reflectance and the current illumination was gathered. Four-leaf stage plants\
    \ were \nsprayed with the aforementioned herbicides and transplanted into two\
    \ different fields in southwest Germany. The trial was set up \nas a Latin square\
    \ split-plot design with the herbicide treatment as the Latin square factor, and\
    \ the populations as the plot \nsubfactor. Three plants of each population were\
    \ transplanted into each plot. Five measurements per plant were performed daily\
    \ \nfor the first seven days after the herbicide application and on the 14th day\
    \ after application. Data were preprocessed, normalizing \nfor the illumination,\
    \ removing non-plant measurements and then averaged per treatment, plant and measurement\
    \ day. Spectral \nfeatures, that could relate to biological parameters, and separate\
    \ between herbicide sensitive and resistant plants were examined. \nFor S. media,\
    \ the separation between sensitive and resistant plants was done from the third\
    \ day after the application. A \nnormalized index using 760 and 530 nm was able\
    \ to differentiate the sprayed sensitive plants from the rest. For P. rhoeas the\
    \ \nresult was inconclusive until the 7th day after treatment. \nSemantic Segmentation\

    \ the boom of a sprayer offers the opportunity to selectively apply herbicides\
    \ \nduring growth period, based on the detection of colour differences. Environmental\
    \ effects, that might change colour shades, are \neliminated by a sensor-internal\
    \ light source. \nOur studies show that the sensors reliably differentiate backgrounds\
    \ and green shades. Field use demonstrated that artificial and \nreal plants are\
    \ detected on vegetation-free and vegetation-covered backgrounds. \nThe basis\
    \ for field operation e.g. integration into a sprayer boom or even control of\

    \ use of insecticides. To prevent this and support Integrated Pest Management\
    \ (IPM), it is important to be able to \ndetermine the presence and number of\
    \ pest insects, the timing of attack and its economic effect. \nAn automated system\
    \ for insect monitoring (the BugIT-system) was constructed and tested. It consists\
    \ of five electric detectors, \nconnected with a microprocessor and a radio frequency\
    \ module for remote reading powered by solar panels and a battery. It was \nused\
    \ to monitor migration and presence of insects such as pollen beetle (Meligethes\
    \ aeneus) in spring oilseed rape fields. The \ninsects were attracted to the traps\
    \ by a yellow-coloured disc impregnated with an odorant lure consisting of allyl-isothiocyanate\
    \ \nand methyl-ethylisothiocyanate in equal proportions. The detector recorded\
    \ all insects that short-circuited the sensor. The \nautomatic estimate obtained\
    \ was compared with the number of pollen beetle counted in the traditional way\
    \ close to the monitor. \nThe BugIT device allowed the development of an insect\
    \ population to be monitored in detail under field conditions and to observe \n\
    the effect of spraying with insecticides on the level of insect activity. The\
    \ detectable level of infestation was 0.5-1 pollen \nbeetles/plant. This level\
    \ of detection is like the one used in guidelines for decision of treatment with\
    \ insecticide. Our result indicates \nthat the device could play an important\
    \ role in the development of improved Integrated Pest Management in oil seed rape.\

    \ in a \nuniform product for conservation. The SO- anticipating strategy has its\
    \ focus on maximising fertiliser efficiency. Soil-Plant places \nthat produce\
    \ efficient receive more fertiliser than the inefficient places. The Dairy Campus\
    \ strategy was used as reference and \nhad no spatial difference in the fertiliser\
    \ application. Soil characteristics were measured once with a Veris scan. Grass\
    \ production \nwas measured using an eBee Drones, a pasture reader and a Haldrup.\
    \ For every grass cut the average amount of fertiliser was \nbased on the Dairy\
    \ Campus year plan. The spatial WVDI information from the drone delivered the\
    \ grass information, that together \nwith the strategy was used to determine the\

    \ and \nthe Organic Content of the soil into account. The Fertiliser was applied\
    \ using a Kverneland fertiliser spreader. Harvest data for \ngrass cut 1 to 4\
    \ and spatial grass information from the Pasture reader showed that it was possible\
    \ to influence the growth of the \ngrass. The intended strategies could be realized,\

    \ application around \nthe end of June using the NBS-app. Contractors provide\
    \ services to make biomass maps with drones, planes and satellites. \nThese biomass\

    \ \nSlugs caused major problems in field drops. Today there is no evaluated and\
    \ established method for assessing the risk of field \nslug infestation in winter\
    \ crops in Sweden. The aim of the project was to develop an automatic slug detector\
    \ that enables remote \nreading of slug infestation in crops. Today traps consist\
    \ of a wooden disc (25 cm x 25 cm) with an attractant placed under the \ndisc.\
    \ The reading is performed manually including three readings before harvest of\
    \ the preceding crop and five readings after \ndrilling of the following winter\
    \ oil seed rape.In 2014 a demonstrator was launched and tested under field conditions\
    \ based on a \nlight beam being interrupted by slugs entering the trap. In 2017\
    \ field slugs were estimated using android phones, battery packs \nand the AtHome\
    \ Camera app from the iChano Inc. (www.ichano.com). Nine cameras (eg prepaid phones)\
    \ were tested. The trap \nconsists of a bucket (dia. 30 cm). The camera lens and\
    \ lamp of the mobile were centered over a hole in the reversed bucket and \na\
    \ second bucket is used as cover and protection against moisture and shades of\
    \ light. The bait was a mix of müsli, dried fruit, \nlight beer and water. Near\
    \ the bucket reference traps were placed, eg 25x25 plywood boards. Validation\
    \ of the bucket traps was \nmade by comparison between camera count and manual\
    \ reading under the plywood. The conclusion is that it works quit well to \ndetect\
    \ slugs with mobile cameras, but technical improvements are needed. The advantage\
    \ of automatic monitoring and 3/4G \nenables simplified remote monitoring of slug\
    \ populations.In future automatic monitor units could be included in both local\
    \ and \nregional IPM-forecasting and warning systems for pests. \nPreliminary\

    \ Spain \nThe present work has for general objective the development of a system\
    \ of sustainable management system of short rotation \ncoppice (SRC) suitable\
    \ for rain-fed conditions of central Spain, with a view to the diversification\
    \ of rural economy, the conservation \nof the environment, the mitigation of the\
    \ climate change and the security of biomass supply for solid biofuels, in line\
    \ with the \nSpanish Bioeconomy Strategy. \nUlmus pumila L. is a woody perennial\
    \ species used as a short rotation energy crop. These crops are relatively new\
    \ so there is \nnot much information about them. The trial was conducted at IMIDRA\
    \ (Madrid, Spain). The plant material most used, so far, for \nthe establishment\
    \ of energy crops of Elm, has been the seedling produced by seed. Due to this,\
    \ a very heterogeneous crop is \nstarted. \nSpecifically, the research is focused\
    \ on the sustainable management of Ulmus pumila L. (Siberian elm) in SRC (SRC-Elm)\
    \ in \nrain-fed conditions, unlike other SRC studies in Spain, that are conducted\
    \ in irrigated lands. The proposal benefits from the \navailability of already-established\
    \ plantations hold by the partners, and significantly, from the availability of\
    \ a long-term SRC-Elm \nplantation, that is considered as a reference in Spain.\
    \ \nThe objective of this activity is the multilocal study of the SRC-Elm system\
    \ in the first productive stage -from establishment to first \nshift of cutting-,\
    \ in order to optimize it. On the one hand, the use of intercropping between plantation\
    \ lines in newly established \nplantations, vetch and broom has been studied.\
    \ Control treatment has been used in monoculture (without legumes), the legume\
    \ \nbeing the variable. Different parameters were measured such as height, chlorophyll,\
    \ longest spread, diameter. From the analysis \nof these parameters, it can be\
    \ observed that there are significant differences between the different treatments.\
    \ Observing that \neach treatment has a different behaviours. \nControl Effect\

    \ was performed to evaluate control effect of a drone in rice sheath blight disease.\
    \ The developing control system \nof drones in rice cultivation can take advantage\
    \ of labor saving and lower costs. \nRice sheath blight occurs throughout temperate\
    \ and tropical production areas. Initial symptoms are usually lesions on sheaths\
    \ of \nlower leaves when plants are in the late tillering or early internode elongation\
    \ stage of growth. More than 50% yield losses would \nbe occurred if all the leaf\
    \ sheaths and leaf blades are infected. \n \n \n \n113 \nUnmanned helicopter control\
    \ has not only a similar effect of controlling the rice diseases with conventional\
    \ control, but also the \nadvantage of taking of costs down and labor savings.\
    \ However, it has disadvantages in optimum timing to control because of \ncontrolling\
    \ local area at a time. \nIn this experiment, we compared with 4 types of control\
    \ methods in paddy field, which were drones, unmanned helicopters, \nconventional\
    \ control and untreated. When the drone flew at flight level of 3 meters for spraying\
    \ pesticides, it has a downward \nwind of 2.6m/s, which was about 50％of unmanned\
    \ helicopters. \nThe drone showed similar results with unmanned helicopters in\
    \ terms of standard of grading pesticide deposit. It was 82.4% in \nControl value\
    \ of drone, 82.1% in Control value of unmanned helicopters and 84.7% in Control\

    \ among which chemical method is most widely used. The \nuniformity of spray and\
    \ droplet size are important parameters for effective disease control. Therefore,\
    \ selection of nozzles for \nagricultural sprayers is very important. The nozzles\
    \ were tested in the laboratory using Patternator to find volumetric distribution,\
    \ \nswath and spray angle at operating pressures of 1.5(147.1 kPa), 2(196.13 kPa),\
    \ 2.5(245.16 kPa), 3(294.2 kPa) and 3.5 kg/cm2 \n(343.23 kPa) and nozzle heights\
    \ 200, 300, 400, 500, 545 and 600 mm. The droplet size determination tests were\
    \ conducted at \noperating pressure of 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 kg/cm2 and fixed\
    \ nozzle height of 450 mm. The droplet size was measured using \nSpraytec laser\
    \ diffraction technique and the Number Median Diameter (NMD) and Volume Median\
    \ Diameter (VMD) of the droplets \nwere measured. The NMDs and VMDs of the hollow\
    \ cone nozzle varied between 34 to 23 and 200 to 114 µ, respectively while \n\
    for flat fan nozzle it was 108 to 23 and 199 to 129 µ , respectively in pressure\
    \ range from 1.5 to 3.5 kg/cm2. The flat fan nozzle \ngave most uniform volumetric\
    \ distribution at pressure of 2.5 kg/cm2 and 300 mm nozzle height while for the\
    \ hollow cone nozzle \nit was observed at pressure of 2 kg/cm2 and 400 mm nozzle\
    \ height. The swath and angle of spray of the nozzles were determined \nand it\
    \ was found that with increase in pressure and height the swath increased while\
    \ the spray angle increased with pressure. \nThe hollow cone nozzle produced droplets\
    \ ranging from extremely fine to extremely coarse droplets, while the flat fan\
    \ produced \ndroplets in the range of extremely fine to very coarse for the pressures\

    \ Nutrition Department, Estación Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD-CSIC); 2Technical\
    \ University of Madrid (UPM), Spain \nThe peach tree is one of the fruit species\
    \ with the highest production and area cultivated in Spain, which rootstock show\
    \ a marked \ninfluence on the mineral content of leaves and consequently on chlorosis.\
    \ The nutritional diagnosis of the peach tree, based on \nthe mineral analysis\
    \ of leaves, is often late for in-season amendments, while leaf diagnosis based\
    \ either on photosynthetic activity \n(non-destructive) or on iron chlorosis is\
    \ always late and in many cases imprecise. Previous work from Aula Dei (CSIC)\
    \ has \nestablished the possibility and efficiency of making a mineral prognosis\
    \ of leafs based on the mineral composition of flowers not \nonly in peaches but\
    \ in pear and cherry trees. This current work aims to go further in non-destructive\
    \ prognosis by selecting key \nfeatures from RGB images and validating them in\
    \ a set of 300 photographs. The test was carried out in a plot located in the\
    \ \nExperimental Station of Aula Dei (CSIC), the soil of the plot being heavy\
    \ and calcareous. Six plumxpeach trees have been used \ndetermining the foliar\
    \ and floral mineral concentration on flower at full blossom (FB), and corresponding\
    \ leaf samples at 120 days \naFB. The ions in flowers and leaves were determined\
    \ by plasma-mass spectroscopy, while the measurement of the \nphotosynthetic activity\
    \ of the leaves and their mineral composition was carried out 120 days after full\
    \ flowering using a SPAD \nmeter. The SPAD used as a reference for the identification\
    \ of chlorosis in peach leaf appears correlated with several leaf minerals: \n\
    Ca, S, Fe, Cu and Sr, restricted to Ca and Sr when compared with the mineral composition\
    \ in flowers. The mineral composition \nof the flowers allows anticipating extreme\
    \ cases of chlorosis based on Sr and Ca levels, while the methodology developed\
    \ based \non RGB images shows promising results and is still ongoing. \n \n \n\

    \ Georgiou Peteinatos1, Benjamin Kollenda1, Pei Wang2, Roland Gerhards1 \n1Univerisity\
    \ of Hohenheim, Germany; 2Jiangsu University, China \nLogarithmic sprayers are\
    \ commonly used for dose response studies for a wide range of pesticides. A typical\
    \ logarithmic sprayer \nconsists of a mixture tank and a pressurized water input.\
    \ Water is continuously transfered into the mixture tank, steadily diluting \n\
    the applied dosage. Therefore, the actual concentration applied in the field,\
    \ can be influenced by various factors like the fluctuation \nof the water pressure,\
    \ the quality of the pipelines, the nozzles, the application speed and the current\
    \ type and formulation of the \npesticide. One of the major drawbacks of the typical\
    \ logarithmic sprayers is that the pesticide dose decreases continuously. The\
    \ \nobjective of this study was to develop and test a logarithmic sprayer with\
    \ a stepwise dose reduction. In such a system, the \npesticide dose, delivered\
    \ to the spraying boom from the sprayer in a certain area is known and uniform\
    \ for each plot. \nThe principle of the proposed system is to separate the current\
    \ sprayed mixture in two distinct parts. One part is for performing \nthe current\
    \ pesticide application. The second part will be transferred in a second spray\
    \ bottle and refilled with water. By controlling \nthe volume of the mixture and\
    \ water inserted in the second bottle a specific new mixture can be realized.\
    \ When the current \nspraying dose has been applied in the field and the new mixture\
    \ created, the system is ready to apply a second dose of the same \nvolume, yet,\
    \ with a predefined dilution ratio. The proposed system has been realized and\
    \ tested in a field, using glyphosate as a \ngeneral purpose herbicide. The outcome\
    \ showed an increase in the weed population with the dose reduction, as expected\
    \ from \nthe dose response curve of glyphosate. The system can be proposed as\
    \ an improvement to the current logarithmic sprayers, \nenabling logarithmic applications\
    \ in various agricultural scenarios. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n115 \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \nthe goal of our work was to create an inventory of SFTs for farmers and farm\

    \ \nAnalysis of the data indicates that commercially available SFTs tend to lead\

    \ Sweden \nIn Sweden, nutrient leaching and fertilisation strategies have been\
    \ prioritised for approximately 30 years. The public project \n‘Focus on soils’\
    \ that started in 2000, focusing on fertilisation strategies considering fields\
    \ as homogenous entities. In parallel, the \ndevelopment of precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) enabled the farmers to treat fields heterogeneously. To succeed with PA,\
    \ farmers need \ncredible and usable agricultural decision support systems (AgriDSS).\
    \ However, uptake and acceptance of complex AgriDSS has \ngenerally been slow.\
    \ The Yara N-sensor (YNS) was introduced on the Swedish market in 2000. In 2016\
    \ a Yara representative \nclaimed that ‘the plug has gone out’; considering YNS\
    \ use and selling, meaning that finally farmers seem to accept, believe in \n\
    and use the YNS. This paper aims to investigate and analyse the YNS adoption process\
    \ in Sweden from 2000 to 2017 by \nanswering the following research questions:\
    \ 1) How can the innovation system concerning YNS be described? 2) What are the\
    \ \nmain implications for the regime shift from considering a field as a homogenous\
    \ entity to a heterogeneous ditto? \nA qualitative inquiry was conducted in 2017,\
    \ in which interviews with different actors within the Swedish AKIS were performed.\
    \ \nThe collected data were analysed, using thematic analysis based on theories\
    \ from the field of innovation systems. The findings \nrevealed a complex innovation\
    \ system, driven by a company with long-sightedness and a group of interested\
    \ farmers, closely \ncooperating with one Yara representative. Additionally, important\
    \ actors have been a regionally funded PA network. The general \ntechnology development\
    \ in society has supported the adoption of the YNS. Three identified success factors\
    \ are: 1) Cooperation \nbetween companies, organisations and universities concerning\
    \ PA development, research and field trials. 2) Established trust \namong different\
    \ actors within the Swedish AKIS and; 3) The weather conditions during 2015 which\

    \ agriculture \nplays a key role in land management and has a huge responsibility\
    \ in the preservation of natural resources. In order to practice \na sustainable\
    \ agriculture, farmers responsible for the management of farmland must adopt correct\

    \ with EU regulations for a sustainable agriculture. Recent developments \nin\
    \ science and technology, that could be an added value for farmers’ crop and land\

    \ by providing a \nlearning opportunity to students, but also by enabling universities\
    \ to validate real solutions to specific problems in applying SPA \nin field conditions\
    \ with the help of the farmer's experience. \nThe SPARKLE project will contribute\

    \ With this in mind, it will be possible for students to have the opportunity\
    \ to manage a real experience \nwith companies specializing in SPA. Therefore,\
    \ companies are given the opportunity to get directly involved in training and\
    \ the \nopportunity to interact with students and future technicians. \nIn the\

    \ Greece \nGreenhouses are light-weight low-rise structures made mainly of steel.\
    \ They are designed for several combinations of actions, \nincluding snow and\
    \ wind according to Eurocodes and EN 13031-1-2001. Strong winds are a frequent\
    \ cause of structural failures \nin greenhouses. The present research work focuses\
    \ on a greenhouse type widely used in the Mediterranean region, namely the \n\
    plastic-covered arched-roof greenhouse with sidewalls. Only a few published research\
    \ results concern wind loads on arched roof \ngreenhouses, in contrast to duo-pitch\
    \ structures, such as the Venlo type, and tunnels. \nDesign Codes and Standards\
    \ define the procedures for determining the design wind loads for different greenhouse\
    \ types \ndepending on their geometrical characteristics, duration of life, wind\
    \ climatic data etc. Recent research works have revealed \nseveral discrepancies\
    \ and the lack of detailed information regarding the provisions of the Eurocodes\
    \ and EN 13031-1 for the \nwind loads on arched roof structures with sidewalls.\
    \ For this reason, there is a strong need for updating the current versions of\
    \ \nthe Design Codes with new research results. \nA numerical investigation of\
    \ the wind pressures developed on a typical arched roof greenhouse as a function\
    \ of its geometric \ncharacteristics is presented. The numerical method is validated\
    \ against recently published experimental data (Kim, R., et al., \n2017. Biosystems\
    \ Engineering, 164: 235-256). The effects of different geometrical characteristics\
    \ of arched-roof greenhouses, \nsuch as height/span ratio, roof height/span ratio\
    \ and curvature radius of the roof, are studied through computational simulations.\
    \ \nThe obtained results indicate that the wind pressures are sensitive to key\
    \ design parameters. The present work is expected to \ncontribute to updating\
    \ or refining the relevant provisions of EN 13031-1-2001, currently under revision.\
    \ \nRule-based Versus Model-based Control of the Greenhouse Environment \nIdo\

    \ 2B-Mex, Wageningen, The Netherlands; 3Wageningen UR, Wageningen, The Netherlands\
    \ \nProblem: Current greenhouse environmental control is mostly rule-based, utilizing\
    \ rules such as “if it is daytime and the \ngreenhouse temperature is above T,\
    \ open the windows”. These rules are based on experimental results and on grower’s\
    \ \nexperience and are meant to insure an optimal environment for the crop. The\
    \ rules are adjusted to the type and state of the crop \nand they respond to the\
    \ changing weather. \nGrowers are reluctant to replace this approach by the model-based\
    \ control developed over the years by the academic community, \ndespite its theoretical\
    \ superiority. Apparently because they do not trust the crop models imbedded in\
    \ these systems. \nObjective: We attempt to show that a relatively simple model-based\
    \ optimal control algorithm can produce an environment which \nis at least as\
    \ good as the currently produced environment; probably better. \nMethod: An actual\
    \ year-long data-set, measured in a commercial tomato greenhouse, is mimicked\
    \ by our simulation-optimization \nalgorithm. The modelled system includes a water\
    \ tank for day-to-night heat storage, which is helpful mainly in summer-time CO2\
    \ \nenrichment. The simplified greenhouse model has no explicit crop and cover\
    \ temperatures and no explicit long wave radiation \nflux. Evaporation rate is\
    \ taken from standard practice. \nResults: The temperature and humidity levels\
    \ specified by the algorithm fit the measured levels mostly rather well, while\
    \ the \nachievable CO2 concentration, particularly in summer when it is most useful,\
    \ is considerably higher than in the actual greenhouse. \nOn-line adaptation of\
    \ the algorithm should be possible both in the short-term (evapotranspiration)\
    \ and in the long term (growth). \nConclusions: The results to date suggest that\
    \ the model-based system is safe enough to be considered practical. In particular,\
    \ it \nhas safe constraints on the greenhouse temperature and humidity. The optimization\
    \ inherent in the control algorithm assures that \nthe achievable environment\
    \ is economically the best. \nAnalysis of Greenhouse Cover Properties for Optimal\
    \ Net Financial Result \nYuexiang Chen, Bert van 't Ooster, Eldert van Henten\
    \ \nWageningen University, Farm Technology Group, Netherlands, The \nGreenhouse\
    \ cover parameters affect indoor light intensity and solar heat load, which in\
    \ turn influences temperature, plant growth, \nand economic profit. Cover parameters\
    \ are normally material related and considered constant over time. It is however\
    \ not known \nwhat parameter values result in highest Net Financial Result (NFR).\
    \ Also, it is expected that varying the cover parameters \ndynamically in time\
    \ might contribute to improving NFR. Therefore, the objective was to identify\
    \ the effects of optimizing constant \nparameters and of optimized time-variant\
    \ cover parameters on the NFR. This research used the genetic algorithm to obtain\
    \ the \noptimal values of constant and time-variant cover parameters for maximizing\
    \ NFR. Respecting time-invariant cover parameters, \nsensitivity analysis revealed\
    \ that NFR sensitivity was highest for the transmission coefficient of PAR (photosynthetically\
    \ active \nradiation), NIR (near infrared radiation), and the emission coefficient\
    \ for FIR (far infrared radiation). The optimal values of cover \nparameters for\
    \ Dutch climate maximizing NFR via time-invariant cover parameters showed high\
    \ τ_PAR (PAR transmission \ncoefficient) and ϵ_FIR (FIR emission coefficient),\
    \ and a low value of τ_NIR (NIR transmission coefficient); Theoretically best\
    \ \nvalues for τ_PAR, ϵ_FIR, and τ_NIR were 0.999, 0.999, and 0.001 respectively,\
    \ where nominal values were 0.85, 0.85 and 0.82 \nrespectively. NFR increased\
    \ from 16.14 € m-2 y-1 at nominal values to 18.98 € m-2 y-1 for optimized parameter\
    \ values. These \noptimum values were obtained from simulations with a validated\
    \ model but the optimization outcome could not be validated \nexplicitly. For\
    \ the time-variant cover parameters, NFR was hourly optimized using the genetic\
    \ algorithm. Due to the high demand \nfor computing power, this optimization was\
    \ executed for a time period of 50 hours only. It showed that optimization for\
    \ time-\nvariate cover parameter enhanced NFR with 57% compared to the simulation\
    \ of the same period with nominal cover parameter \nvalues. \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ RGB visual light cameras were used to capture \nimages of the tomato plants\
    \ (leaves) for diseases detection over thirty two days period. Algorithms for\
    \ image processing such as \nthresholding, color masking, segmentation et al using\
    \ MATLAB R2017b were developed to detect diseased areas as well as to \ndetermine\
    \ the rate of spread of this disease in the tomato leaves. The algorithm developed\
    \ was able to detect the diseases, \nclassify and quantify them by finding the\
    \ area of the spread region. The percentage rate of spread was analyzed from the\
    \ results \ngiven. It was concluded that the rate of spread increased with increasing\
    \ variations of temperature and humidity over time. The \nspread was at its peak\
    \ from the 12th to 26th day due to imbalances in temperature and other environmental\

    \ source of \nenergy (Photosynthetically Active Radiation, PAR) for photosynthesis,\
    \ and there is an optimum light level for each plant species. \nThe average light\
    \ levels for flower and vegetable varieties range from 150 to 750 mmol.m-2.s-1.\
    \ The amount of light may need to \nbe increased or decreased to keep the light\

    \ (SMLR), the principal component regression \n(PCR), and the partial least square\
    \ regression (PLS) were applied to investigate the feasibility of determining\
    \ the chlorophyll \ncontent of paprika seedlings. Significant wavelengths of 519,\
    \ 557, 590, 732, and 846 nm were selected for quantifying the \nchlorophyll content.\
    \ The results from the calibration models built by SMLR, PCR, and PLS showed strong\
    \ relationships between \npredicted and measured chlorophyll content. Determination\
    \ coefficients for calibration and validation data sets were 0.84 and \n0.81,\
    \ respectively. Standard error of calibration and standard error for prediction\
    \ were 2.41 and 2.04, respectively. It was \nconcluded that hyperspectral reflectance\

    \ Greenhouse system \nAnna Vatsanidou, Thomas Bartzanas, Nikos Katsoulas \nCenter\

    \ \nThe assessment of the environmental impact of agricultural production has\
    \ received increasing attention over the last years, \nbecause agriculture appears\
    \ to have a major impact on the environment. Modern, intensive crop production\
    \ is regarded as a \nsource of solid, liquid and gaseous emissions, which can\
    \ be both a nuisance and environmentally harmful. Plastic, waste water \nand greenhouse\
    \ gases, coming from direct or indirect sources, are the most important effluents\
    \ for polluting the air, the ground \nand surface water (nitrates and phosphate\
    \ emissions), causing climate change, acidification, eutrophication and ecotoxicity\
    \ (soil \nenrichment with heavy metals). Regarding protected cultivations, there\
    \ are some environmental studies that are restricted to the \nuse of national\
    \ or EU level guiding policy or in improving farm management by supplying information\
    \ to the farmer or advisor. To \nreduce pollution sources from intensive agriculture\
    \ production systems to the environment many technologies have been \ndeveloped\
    \ and applied, like close hydroponic systems, close greenhouse, degradable plastic\
    \ covering materials etc. However, \ntill today information and studies concerning\
    \ a complete environmental assessment of greenhouse cropping system are limited.\
    \ \nTherefore, there is an increasing interest in product-oriented and life cycle\
    \ based environmental assessments (LCA), because \nthere is a need to evaluate\
    \ global emissions and impacts from the whole production chain in relation to\
    \ types and amounts of \nproducts consumed. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a generally\
    \ accepted method to evaluate the environmental impact during \nthe entire life\
    \ cycle of a product. In the present paper, we built upon the results of previous\
    \ EU projects rational irrigation strategies \nin greenhouse and using the LCA\
    \ method through the SIMAPRO software we evaluate the environmental impact on\
    \ close, semi-\nclose and open greenhouse hydroponic systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ Jaren, Silvia Arazuri \nUniversidad Publica de Navarra, Spain \nAssessment of\
    \ meat quality parameters is a major concern in the food industry due to the continuously\
    \ demand for superior \nquality of meat. Therefore, it is crucial to assess meat\
    \ quality parameters correctly and also, do it using sustainable and efficient\
    \ \nmethods. In this respect, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique has been regarded\
    \ as a smart and promising tool for analyses \nconducted in research and industries.\
    \ It integrates both spectroscopy and imaging to directly identify different components\
    \ and \ntheir spatial distribution in the tested product. Thus, a quality evaluation\
    \ based on HSI would be beneficial to the meat industry. \nIn this study we evaluated\
    \ the usefulness of HSI to classify foal meat steaks based on ageing time, an\
    \ aspect that greatly \ninfluences meat tenderness. \nThe dataset used comprised\
    \ 88 foal steaks from twenty-four hours post-mortem Triceps Brachii muscles. Samples\
    \ were aged 0, \n4, 8 and 12 days at 4±1°C and then frozen at -18± 2ºC until analyses.\
    \ Steaks were scanned using a hyperspectral camera \n(Xenics, Xeva-1.7-320) with\
    \ a 320x256 pixel resolution and a spectrograph (ImSpector N17E, Specim) in the\
    \ 900-1700 nm \nspectral range. A Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (PLS-DA) method was used to classify steaks in 3 classes \naccording to their\
    \ ageing time (high, medium and low quality). High class was composed of steaks\
    \ aged 0 and 4 days, medium \nclass comprised steaks aged 8 days and, low class\
    \ included the rest (steaks aged 12 days). \nGood classification results were\
    \ obtained for high and low quality classes (76.9% and 66.7%, respectively) in\
    \ the prediction sets \nand a low percentage of correctly classified samples was\
    \ achieved for the medium quality class. Such misclassification for the \nlatter\
    \ was expected as this was a mixed quality class in which some steaks still maintained\
    \ an acceptable quality for consumption \nwhile others may had lost it. \nSimultaneous\

    \ objectives of this study were to obtain the functional lipids, and \nnatural\
    \ antioxidants from passion fruits seeds, applying sustainable technology. Passion\
    \ seeds oils were obtained using a lab-\nscale continuous press. The oxidative\
    \ stability of oils was evaluated using RANCIMAT method. Regarding the phenolic\
    \ \ncompounds extraction from pressed cake, a statistical factorial design was\
    \ applied to select the solvent polarity and temperature \nof extraction. The\
    \ antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of all extracts were the main response to select\
    \ the best operational conditions. \nThe higher antioxidant capacity extracts\
    \ was found using ethanol-water solutions (70:30) at 30 ºC. In these cases, the\
    \ total \nphenols, expressed as gallic acid equivalent, from P. setacea, P. alata,\
    \ and P tenuifila cakes were approximately 1800, 600 and \n900 mg/100 g of extract.\
    \ Using these extracts as natural antioxidant in their respective oils, the induction\
    \ periods for P. setacea, \nP. alata, and P tenuifila seeds oils increased of\
    \ 7.3 to 9.6 hours, 3.52 to 11.7 hours, and 6.87 to 10.27 hours respectively.\
    \ \nTherefore, the passion fruit seeds of the selected species can contribute\
    \ to increase the supply of vegetable polyunsaturated oils \nwith high oxidative\
    \ stability. \nEvaluation of a Citrus Mobile Platform Using a Wireless Impact\

    \ \nplatform prototype to assist in the harvesting of citrus fruits designed by\
    \ the IVIA (Spain) has been tested in order to reduce fruit \ndamages. The mobile\
    \ platform is fitted with conveyor systems. The multilevel platform can accommodate\

    \ \nto the in-line sorting system that classifies the fruit in two categories\
    \ using a computer vision system and directs the fruit to one \nof the two different\
    \ bin-fillers. During this process the fruits are subjected to mechanical stress\
    \ causing physical injuries, including \nskin punctures, pulp and cell rupture.\
    \ An impact recording device was used to evaluate damage produced to citrus fruits.\
    \ The \ncritical points at which damage occurs were determined, and the damage\
    \ levels assessed. The highest damage level was \nproduced from the bin-fillers\

    \ For Industrial Processing Aptitude \nAinara Lopez-Maestresalas, Silvia Arazuri,\
    \ Carlos Lopez-Mollina, Claudia Perez-Roncal, Carmen Jaren \nUniversidad Publica\
    \ de Navarra, Spain \nPotatoes stand out as one of the most important crop worldwide\
    \ both in terms of consumption and production. Tubers are \ncultivated according\
    \ to established quality parameters like colour, dry matter or starch content.\
    \ In the last years, producers have \nintroduced the aptitude for industrial processing\
    \ as a new quality parameter. In this respect, potatoes are classified as having\
    \ \n \n \n \n124 \nboiling, frying or baking aptitude, among others. We understand\
    \ that using a non-destructive analysis, specifically hyperspectral \nimaging,\
    \ could facilitate the classification process, leading to a cheaper, faster classification\
    \ of tubers and, consequently, to a \nwider adoption of the quality parameter.\
    \ However, this faces technical problems, a very relevant one being the heterogeneity\
    \ of \nthe potato flesh, which might hamper the correct classification of tubers.\
    \ The objective of this study is to determine whether the \nanalysis of different\
    \ parts of the tuber (e.g. more centric or peripheral flesh) can influence its\
    \ classification as a whole. In this \nregard, we are interested in an evaluation\
    \ of the level of homogeneity along the flesh. \nFor this, 20 different potato\
    \ cultivars (4 tubers per cultivar) identified as either suitable for boiling\
    \ or frying were used. Tubers \nwere scanned with a hyperspectral camera (Xenics,\
    \ Xeva 1.7-320) with 320x256 pixel resolution sensitive in the 900-1700 nm \n\
    spectral range. The images were automatically segmented, and each tuber was divided\
    \ into four non-overlapping, concentric \nregions of interest, each of them encompassing\
    \ the same number of pixels. Each region produced a representative spectrum, \n\
    later processed using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. \nThe results\
    \ showed that, the reflectance of the centre was the lowest but no clear zone\
    \ hierarchy was appreciated among the \ndifferent cultivars. Therefore, this indicates\
    \ a lack of homogeneity along the flesh of the tuber which could negatively influence\
    \ \nthe classification of cultivars based on aptitude for industrial processing.\

    \ Italy \nFresh food when harvested and/or processed continues to undergo changes\
    \ that involve spoilage and deterioration of the \nproduct. The food deterioration,\
    \ due to enzymes and bacteria, is related to texture and nutrients losses and\
    \ colour changes. \nFreezing is a valuable technique of food conservation to extent\
    \ food shelf life. The recommended temperature for frozen foods \nis -18°C as\
    \ this is the temperature at which enzymes and bacteria stop growing. \nWhen the\
    \ temperature of the food drops below freezing point, the unbound fraction of\
    \ water freezes and expands. The ice crystals \ncould cause the cell walls rupture\
    \ and, consequently, nutrients losses during food thawing. Quick freezing, assuring\
    \ the formation \nof small ice crystals in foods, can reduce or avoid cells wall\
    \ damage. \nThe design of an innovative plant for fast freezing of potato dumplings\
    \ at very low temperatures (even lower than -80°C) is here \npresented. The designed\
    \ plant is constituted by two separate loops: the first loop, where the cooling\
    \ energy is obtained at low \ntemperature, is based on a reversed Brayton cycle\
    \ while the second loop where, the dumplings are frozen, is a forced-air freezer\
    \ \nroom. Optimal plant parameters, such as temperature and velocity of the freezing\
    \ medium (air), to obtain the required fast freezing \ntime of the dumplings are\
    \ evaluated. Depending on the requested freezing time and on the mass per hour\
    \ of dumplings to be \nprocessed, the suitable plant solution, as batch or continuous\
    \ process, can be identified and finely designed. \nThe proposed solution overcomes\
    \ limits of traditional freezing plants, such as ones operated by vapour compression\
    \ cycles, \nwhich cannot reach such low temperatures without exceeding in complexity\
    \ and number of stages. For this reason, the plant is \nproved to be a viable,\
    \ cost-effective alternative to traditional freezing plants used in food industries.\

    \ nutritional value without preservatives and additives has increased. The cold\
    \ plasma is a novel non-\nthermal and dry processing technology without any need\
    \ to chemicals treatments, which is able to work continuously at \natmospheric\
    \ pressure. It can potentially clean the surfaces of the products by inactivating\
    \ the microorganism. In this study the \natmospheric pressure dielectric barrier\
    \ discharge plasma with air gas was used for treatment of the strawberry samples.\
    \ The \nbarrier discharge plasma is created by applying a 12 kV pulsed high voltage.\
    \ Two levels of 7% and 14% duty cycle and four \ndurations of 0, 5, 10 and 20\
    \ min for apply the plasma on the samples were used. Microbial load of aerobic\
    \ bacteria and \nyeasts/molds were enumerated immediately after the plasma application.\
    \ Structural variation in the microorganisms on the \nsurface of the samples was\

    \ regional survey determined that 76 dairies produce 756 m3 whey/day, of which\
    \ 69.7% are provided as \nanimal feed, 15.8% are used in the manufacture of other\
    \ products, 9.2% are sold to third parties, 5.3% are disposed as an effluent \n\
    and 1.3% are disposed in the environment without treatment. From the total whey,\
    \ 11.8% were of acceptable quality with no \nrequired infrastructure on cheese\
    \ maker sites. The decision-making model indicated that the most economical scenario\
    \ includes \nthe installation of whey collection centers where whey is pre-pasteurised\
    \ and concentrated, and selects optimal locations among \na set of cheesemaker\
    \ candidates. With a minimum regional development investment of US$ 14.2 million,\
    \ the model selects the \nPonte Nova plant as the recipient of the cluster’s whey\
    \ (mostly in pre-concentrated form) to produce 40% demineralised whey \npowder\
    \ with a return of investment in 2.9 years. Changes in transportation costs did\

    \ models applied were able to monitor the aging of the leaves. However, the models\
    \ developed \nspecifically for watercress spectra were more suitable for monitoring\
    \ the shelf-life of this vegetable leaf along the storage. There \nwere some differences\
    \ between the models applied for spinach and for watercress leaves. In spite of\

    \ continue to respire even after harvest. The most crucial factor to extend their\
    \ keeping quality is to minimize \nthe respiration rate as used in dynamic controlled\
    \ atmosphere storage based on respiration quotient (DCA-RQ). DCA-RQ system \n\
    monitors and identifies the critical O2 concentration at which the stored product\
    \ reaches anaerobic respiration. However, \nmeasurement of respiration of DCA\
    \ stored fresh produce is still challenging. In this study, a modular respirometer\
    \ was developed \nusing an in-house built O2 and CO2 measurement sensor (sphere).\
    \ The sphere records (every 1 minute) and wirelessly transmits \nmeasured data\
    \ to the receiver connected to the computer. The respirometer (3.3L) consisted\
    \ of a specially designed glass jar \nwith water seal at the bottom for leak proof\
    \ (Δ0.01%/h). The sensor sphere was placed inside the respirometer along with\
    \ the \nproduct. The collected data was used to calculate real-time respiration\
    \ rate using in-house built software. Experiments were \nperformed to test the\
    \ effectiveness of the newly developed respirometer under air and modified atmosphere\
    \ conditions for mango. \nFor modified atmosphere, respirometer was flushed with\
    \ gas mix containing 21, 15, 8, 2 and 1% O2 and balance nitrogen. First \nresults\
    \ showed that the respirometer was able to quickly measure respiration rate of\
    \ mango under air (30.1 ml O2/kg.h and \n38.73ml CO2/kg.h) and also under low\
    \ O2 concentration (10.8 ml O2/kg.h and 53.7 ml CO2/kg.h). It was also possible\
    \ to detect \nRQ change from aerobic respiration (1.3) to anaerobic respiration\
    \ (5.0) at low O2 concentration. Collection of such detailed data \nprovides exact\
    \ information on the respiration process, RQ, low O2 limit, thus, will enable\

    \ of the most important phases in quality wine production is the wine-ageing:\
    \ during this phase important chemical reactions \noccur in wine, improving specific\
    \ qualities such as, color, aroma and taste. Usually wine is aged in indoor rooms\
    \ and kept in \ntraditional containers such us bottles or wooden barrels. Since\
    \ temperature affects chemical reactions and the wine containers \nare usually\
    \ unconditioned, the room temperature plays a crucial role in the ageing procedure.\
    \ Moreover, if the wine is kept in \nwooden barrels also humidity should be controlled:\
    \ low humidity levels can ease the wine evaporation (loss of product), on the\
    \ \nother side high humidity values can favor the mold formation (spoiling the\
    \ container and the wine). Recent studies showed how \nair velocity can accelerate\
    \ wine evaporation and mold transportation, besides having a fundamental role\
    \ in temperature and \nhumidity distribution and control inside the cellar. Several\
    \ cellars are provided with temperature and humidity control systems, \nhowever\
    \ air velocity is usually uncontrolled. In this regard, CFD simulations represent\
    \ suitable tools to study these phenomena. \nThe aim of the study is to identify\
    \ the patterns of natural ventilation within a representative study case of wine-ageing\
    \ cellar in the \nEmilia-Romagna region (Italy), characterized by a concentration\
    \ of wine farms with average production of 1500 hl/year and \nworldwide export.\
    \ The selected farm has features in line with the average conditions of that area.\
    \ The built environment of the \nfarm includes a two-storey building with an underground\
    \ cellar for wine aging. The cellar is naturally ventilated through the access\
    \ \ndoor and a single window. Indoor airflows have been studied through CFD simulations\
    \ validated against experimental trails. \nVarious scenarios have been assessed\
    \ through simulation and the benefits and critical aspects of different ventilation\
    \ solutions \nhave been discussed. \n \n \n \n127 \nA New Method to Calibrate\
    \ Discrete Element Models of Fibrous Agricultural Materials \nAdam Kovacs, Gyorgy\
    \ Kerenyi \nBudapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary \nDiscrete\
    \ element method (DEM) is widely used to analyse technological processes (e.g.\
    \ discharging of silos, ploughing) in relation \nto bulk agricultural materials\
    \ such as grains and soil but fewer applications can be found in connection with\
    \ DEM models of crop \nstems. However, the mechanical and physical behaviours\
    \ of stems and pile or swath of stems and stalks play an important role \nin several\
    \ phases of agricultural production, e.g. during harvesting, mowing, baling, preparation\
    \ of forage etc. In practice, there \nis no suitable method to calibrate DEM models\
    \ of crop stems and stalks, and our study aims to fill this gap by focusing on\
    \ the \ndevelopment of a new calibration method. \nThe paper first analyses the\
    \ mechanical structure of fibrous agricultural materials in relation to typical\
    \ agricultural processes. The \nsteps of the calibration method were defined,\
    \ that provide comparison among the measured and simulated quantitative and \n\
    qualitative properties. Second, the specific laboratorial tests (transversal compression,\
    \ three-point bending and dynamic cutting) \nwere conducted on maize (Zea Mays)\
    \ stalks. Maize was selected for the study as a typical fibrous agricultural material.\
    \ Third, a \nsuitable discrete element model about an internodal section of a\
    \ maize stalk was formed and the calibration method was carried \nout. \nAs a\
    \ result, a new calibration method for complex DEM models about fibrous agricultural\
    \ materials was formed and validated on \nan internodal section of a maize stalk.\
    \ The results of the validation clearly demonstrate that the new calibration method;\
    \ that \nconsists of quantitative and qualitative comparison among the observed\
    \ and simulated values and phenomena of laboratorial \ntests and simulation results;\
    \ can be extended to complex DEM models about any fibrous agricultural materials.\
    \ \nApplication of the Inert Pressing Process for White Wines \nMariangela Vallone,\
    \ Pietro Catania \nUniversity of Palermo, Department of Agricultural, Food and\
    \ Forest Science, Italy \nThe aim of the research was to study the pressing process\
    \ of white grapes cv. Catarratto using a pneumatic press in two different \nmodes,\
    \ one called “Nitrogen Pressing” (NP), the other “Air Pressing” (AP) with the\
    \ aim of highlighting the influences of the \nproduction technique on the main\
    \ qualitative aspects of the wines obtained. The machine used during the tests\
    \ was the Prexa N \nmodel pneumatic press (by Willmes, Germany) with vertical\
    \ stainless-steel juice channels and the mash completely surrounded \nby a lateral\
    \ membrane. This press also allows to perform the pressing process under inert\
    \ gas (nitrogen) inside the pressurized \ntank during the working cycle (NP test).\
    \ Analytical determinations were made on musts and wines samples through Foss\
    \ \nIntegrator WineScan ™ (FOSS Italia, Italy), in particular alcohol, density,\
    \ sugar, pH, total acidity, volatile acidity, malic acid, citric \nacid, tartaric\
    \ acid, potassium, polyphenols, ash, gluconic acid, methanol, CO2, absorbance\
    \ at 280 nm, absorbance at 325 nm, \ncatechins and the oxygen concentration for\
    \ the musts. Finally, the volatile component of wines was evaluated using gas\
    \ \nchromatography / mass spectrometry (GC / MS). The results obtained indicate\
    \ that using the pneumatic press in NP mode, i.e. \nworking the grapes under nitrogen,\
    \ some qualitative aspects of the product were significantly preserved, such as\
    \ total acidity, \nvolatile acidity, polyphenols, catechins. Even the aromatic\
    \ component of the wines obtained at the end of the winemaking process \nhas been\
    \ positively affected by the use of the innovative technique, specifically some\
    \ primary and secondary aromas were \nenhanced by the use of the pneumatic press\
    \ in NP mode, allowing to obtain a better product compared to the wine obtained\
    \ with \nthe same machine used in traditional mode. \nDevelopment of a Machine\

    \ - University of Florence Academic Spin-off, Italy  \nDuring the winemaking process,\
    \ the alcoholic fermentation can be carried out either spontaneously or by inoculating\
    \ commercial \ndried yeasts. Commercial yeasts ensure effective and quick juice\
    \ colonization, allowing a better control of the fermentation. Thus, \nthey are\
    \ usually preferred by winemakers to reduce the fermentation quality-related risks.\
    \ However, the spontaneous fermentation \ncan produce wines with sensory properties\
    \ typical of a certain region or even of a specific cellar. This characteristic\
    \ is particularly \nappreciated by those winemakers that wish to produce a wine\
    \ easy to recognize. \nTo keep the advantages of both approaches, a machine able\
    \ to produce on-demand a liquid yeast biomass from selected local \nyeasts was\
    \ studied and developed. In this way, producers can inoculate a quantity of yeasts\
    \ able to reduce the fermentation \nrisks, with a local selected strain able to\
    \ give wines typical properties. \nThe machine is composed by two parts: a tank\
    \ and a centrifuge. The tank is where the yeasts increase in number. It is equipped\
    \ \nwith to supply systems for water and nutrients. The water supply system includes\
    \ an UV-lamp for water sterilization and a heat \nexchanger to set the temperature\
    \ of the medium water. The feeding system continuously doses the nutrients to\
    \ keep a low sugar \ncontent into the medium, promoting yeasts respiration instead\
    \ of fermentation. This increases the yeast-growing rate. \nFurthermore, the fermenter\
    \ is equipped with a heating/cooling jacket to maintain the set temperature, and\
    \ with an air supplier to \nmix the medium and provide the adequate oxygen. At\
    \ the end of this cycle, the medium is separated by the yeast biomass with \n\
    a vertical centrifuge. \nThe machine was tested during the 2017 vintage. The produced\
    \ yeast was used to inoculate must fermentations at industrial \nscale. The inoculated\
    \ yeast strains carried out the alcoholic fermentation, as confirmed by the microbial\
    \ molecular analysis. \nMicroencapsulated Functional Lipids by Association of\

    \ powder can be stored at room temperature for 90 \ndays with minor loss of antioxidant\
    \ capacity and oxidative stability. A drying temperature of 130 °C, lower than\
    \ is commonly used \nin literature, presented high encapsulation efficiency (95%),\
    \ indicating that it is possible to obtain functional microcapsules with \nlower\
    \ energy consumption. Compared to liquid oil blends, the microencapsulated blend\
    \ presented higher oxidative stability (about \n50%) due to the effective protection\

    \ France \nThe assessment of avocado fruit ripeness is typically based on skin\
    \ color and hardness by workers in greengrocers or \nsupermarkets. These parameters\
    \ are not directly associated with their maturity and a bad classification could\
    \ lead to an incorrect \nstorage. A correct classification of avocados will impact\
    \ in a greater consumer satisfaction and less waste generation. \nTraditionally,\
    \ maturity stage of avocados is measured using destructive, expensive and time-consuming\
    \ methods. Near-Infrared \nSpectroscopy (NIRS), in combination with multivariate\
    \ analysis, has been proven to be an effective method for assessing the \nmaturity\
    \ of the fruit in a non-destructive way. \nLaboratory NIR spectrometers have a\
    \ long spectral range and a high resolution and can be used to obtain large datasets\
    \ and \ncalibration models. Nevertheless, they are expensive and non-portable,\
    \ not suitable for industry applications. \nThe aim of this work is the design\
    \ and calibration of a NIRS-based low cost portable device to measure maturity\
    \ stage of the fruit \non a process line for improving the postharvest management.\
    \ For the design, the spectral range of interest, the spectral resolution \nand\
    \ the light source, among others, were considered. \nFor calibrating the device,\
    \ a calibration transfer was made between a laboratory device and a portable,\
    \ low cost one. Transferring \nmodels from laboratory datasets avoids repetition\
    \ of the calibration procedure, which saves time and money, and reduces impacts\
    \ \nrelated to optics and light sources, environmental changes, and variations\
    \ in sample characteristics, such as size or roughness. \nSince prediction models\
    \ developed on the master instrument (laboratory) cannot be applied directly to\
    \ the slave instrument (low-\ncost device), especially due to spectral differences,\
    \ different transfer techniques were tested and compared, such as Model \nUpdate,\
    \ Repfile, Piecewise Direct Standardization, Transfer by Orthogonal Projection.\
    \ Good prediction results were obtained, \nwith a determination coefficient (R²)\
    \ of 0.77 and an error (RMSECV) of 1.87. \nDetection of Astringent and Deastringent\

    \ is an astringent cultivar due to its content of soluble tannins. Traditionally,\
    \ the consumption of \nthis cultivar has been only possible when the astringency\
    \ has been naturally removed before harvest, when fruit is overripe and \nthe\
    \ manipulation is very delicate. In recent years, new postharvest treatments which\
    \ allow astringency removal while preserving \nhigh flesh firmness have been developed.\
    \ Among them, the most widely used in commercial settings is based on exposing\
    \ fruits \nto high CO2 concentrations for 24 h–36 h. This method promotes anaerobic\
    \ respiration in the fruit, giving rise to an accumulation \nof acetaldehyde and\
    \ insolubilizing tannins at the end of the treatment. \nThe effectiveness of this\
    \ treatment is controlled by means of methods which are destructive, time-consuming\
    \ and only a few \nsamples per batch can be analysed. For this reason, the objective\
    \ of this work is to study the application of hyperspectral imaging \ntechnology\
    \ in the detection of astringent and deastringent fruits non-destructively. A\
    \ total of 300 fruits were used and exposed to \nCO2 during different time to\
    \ obtain fruit with different content of soluble tannins. The hyperspectral images\
    \ of the fruits were \nacquired using a VIS-NIR hyperspectral system which covers\
    \ the spectral range 450-1040 nm. Reference analysis of soluble \ntannins was\
    \ performed in order to find out if the fruits were astringent or deastringent.\
    \ The spectral information of the two thirds \nof the fruits was used to build\
    \ the classification models by means of partial least squares (PLS) and support\
    \ vector machine \n(SVM) discriminant analysis methods. The remaining third was\
    \ used to validate the models as test set. As result, 92.6% astringent \nand 84.4%\
    \ deastringent fruits were classified correctly using the SVM method. This shows\
    \ the great potential of hyperspectral \nimaging technology for monitoring the\
    \ astringency removal in industrial setups. \nNon-destructive Assessment of Quality\

    \ Christos Lykas \nUniversity of Thessaly, Greece \nThe use of controlled release\
    \ fertilizers serves to cover crops needs during the plants growth period. The\
    \ release of nutrients \ndepends on solution temperature and fertilizers polymer\
    \ coating, which can control the diffusion of nutrients. However many other \n\
    parameters may affect the evolution of nutrients elements concentration in aqueous\
    \ solutions. The aim of this study was to \ninvestigate the effect of nutrient\
    \ solution’s pH, EC and volume as well as the time from its preparation on the\
    \ evolution of NO3, \nNH4, PO4 and K concentrations and to develop an empirical\
    \ model to describe the evolution of the above elements concentration \nduring\
    \ 16 days period. For this reason, 0.5g and 265g of Multicote fertilizer 14-14-14\
    \ dissolved in 100 ml and 2000 ml of deionized \nwater respectively. The solutions\
    \ remained at 24 oC and their pH was adjusted every day at 5.5 during a period\
    \ of 16 days. The \nEC of the nutrient solutions was measured every second day,\
    \ while the volume after sampling and the concentration of the above \nmentioned\
    \ elements was measured every two days. A linear empirical mathematical model\
    \ was developed for the prediction of \nthe above mentioned nutrients concentrations\
    \ (CX) in relation to the volume removed after sampling (Vs), the pH and the EC\
    \ of \nthe nutrient solution and the time (T) from its preparation. Values of\
    \ the above mentioned parameters were measured in six \nnutrients solutions (three\
    \ with volume of 100 ml and three with volume 2000 ml) and were used for the validation\
    \ of the model. \nFor the evaluation of the model data from nutrient solutions\
    \ prepared with the use of 14-14-14 CRF fertilizer with volume of 2000 \nml was\
    \ used. The predicted concentrations of PO4, NH4, K and NO3 compared favorably\
    \ with the measured one. \n \n \n \n \n \n132 \nAnnual Legume Cover Crops Enhance\

    \ economic, social, cultural and ecological relevance in the Mediterranean region,\
    \ where tillage \nand herbicides application still are generalized practices,\
    \ although the recommendations of UE policy for a more sustainable \nagriculture.\
    \ Cover crops with self-reseeding legumes of short-cycle, with mulch of dead vegetation\
    \ during the dry season, is our \noption for soil management in olive tree rainfed\
    \ orchards, as they provide protection against erosion, improve the physical and\
    \ \nchemical properties, nitrogen fixation and soil moisture, enhance biodiversity\
    \ and landscape beautification, while contribute to \nmitigation and adaptation\
    \ to climate change and enable the organic production mode. The experiment was\
    \ carried out during \n2016 and 2017 on a commercial orchard (cv. Cobrançosa)\
    \ in Northeast Portugal. The treatments laid out were: (1) ordinary tillage \n\
    techniques used by local growers (two tillage trips per year) and (2) a mixture\
    \ of 11 self-reseeding annual legumes (AL). The \nresults revealed that cover\
    \ crops influence positively the tree water status during the drought season,\
    \ as well the nutritional status, \nnamely the foliar concentrations of nitrogen,\
    \ magnesium and manganese, both during the winter resting period and in summer,\
    \ \nat endocarp sclerification. As a result, AL trees presented greater physiological\
    \ performance during the summer, as evidenced \nby higher net photosynthetic rate,\
    \ mainly due to inferior stomatal limitations, lower investment of resources in\
    \ defensive \nmetabolites, and enhanced yield. These results indicate that cover\
    \ cropping should be included in the portfolio of adaptive \nmanagement strategies\
    \ against climate change, contributing to the sustainability of rainfed orchards.\

    University Of Thessaly,School of Agricultural Sciences, Greece \nDuring this work,\
    \ experiments were conducted to determine Ca2+ absorption in relation to transpiration\
    \ rate of young rose plants \ngrowing in closed hydroponic system. For these reason\
    \ 96 rose plants (Rosa hybrida L. cv. Iceberg) were installed in a closed \nhydroponic\
    \ system following the Deep Flow Technique. After a period of twenty days from\
    \ the planting, the pH of the nutrient \nsolution, the Ca2+ concentration in the\
    \ different plant organs (roots, shoots and leaves) and in the nutrient solutions,\
    \ as well as \nplants transpiration, were measured every 24 h for a period of\
    \ seventeen days. The results of these experiments reviled a \ncorrelation between\
    \ the transpiration rate and leaves Ca2+ content (% dry weight), as well as Ca2+\
    \ increment in the entire plant. \nThe equations describing the above mentioned\
    \ correlations were included in an empirical model to predict the concentration\
    \ of \nCa2+ in the recycled nutrient solution of the soilless culture (R2=0.97).\
    \ This method can be used to assess the adequacy of calcium \nin a nutrient solution\

    \ \nKim \nGyeongsang National University, Jinju, Republic of South Korea \nThe\
    \ poultry industry is growing in South Korea, but there are problems associated\
    \ with the management of poultry manure, and \ncomposting is one solution that\
    \ could be valuable for crops and forage if managed properly. For achieving successful\
    \ compost, \naeration rate must be optimized to provide favorable condition for\
    \ composting process. We investigate physicochemical properties \ni.e. Temperature,\
    \ pH, EC, organic matter and seed germination index, in the composting of poultry\
    \ manure with wood shavings \nunder different aeration rates in closed reactor\
    \ system. Three cylindrical reactors with total volume 60 L were used in this\
    \ \nexperiment. The aeration rates in 3 reactors were 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 L/min\
    \ kg OM. All parameters were monitored over 30 days \nof composting. The highest\
    \ temperature in each treatment was 56.9, 55.8 and 48.1 C for 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75\
    \ L/min kg OM, \nrespectively, appearing on the 3rd day at center of compost.\
    \ Aeration rate of 0.25 L/min kg OM corresponded to a higher and \nlonger thermophilic\
    \ phase than other two reactors which had aeration rate of 0.50 and 0.75 L/min\
    \ kg OM. The maximum organic \nmatter degradation accrued with 0.25 L/min kg OM\
    \ of aeration rate which provided adequate oxygen concentration for \nmicroorganisms.\
    \ With 0.75 L/min kg OM of aeration rate lowest GI were recorded at day 30, suggesting\
    \ severe phytotoxicity in \nthe substrate. In all 3 reactors, aeration rate of\
    \ 0.25 L/min kg OM provided most favorable condition for composting poultry manure\
    \ \nwith wood shavings in closed reactor system. \nThe Spreadwise System for Predicting\
    \ Spread Patterns of Centrifugal Fertilizer Spreaders \nSimon Cool1, Jan G. Pieters2,\
    \ Koen C. Mertens1, David Nuyttens1, Tim Van De Gucht1, Jürgen Vangeyte1 \n1ILVO,\
    \ Belgium; 2UGent, Belgium \nOptimizing fertilizer inputs on agricultural fields\
    \ is an important strategy to achieve high yields while reducing their large \n\
    envionmental impact. Centrifugal fertilizer spreaders are by far the most commonly\
    \ used granular fertilizer spreaders due to their \nsmall size, low cost and large\
    \ working width. For this type of spreader however, the spreading process is difficult\
    \ to control since \nit depends on various parameters such as the physical properties\
    \ of the particles, spreader settings and external conditions such \nas wind.\
    \ In practice, this can lead to local under- and overapplications of fertilizer\
    \ on the field. The \"Spreadwise\" system was \ndevelopped to assess spreader\
    \ perfomance and calibrate these fertilizer spreaders in practice. With this system,\
    \ two-dimensional \npatterns can be determined in an automatic, accurate, cost-\
    \ and space-efficient way by simulating individual particle trajectories \nand\
    \ determining their landing positions. For this, a four-camera stereovision system\
    \ was used to determine the ejection \nparameters of the particles after being\
    \ spread by the spreading disks. Spreading experiments with commercially available\
    \ \nspreaders were executed. The system showed a high repeatability and predicted\
    \ spread patterns were similar to spread patterns \ndetermined in the field. \n\

    \ \nThe presented work will address a survey of different sizes slurry wagons\
    \ time efficiency through a one-year season. A continuous \nkey objective for\
    \ any contractor or farmers in an arable farming context, is to improve the economic\
    \ viability. The purpose of this \npaper is to present an efficiency study of\
    \ slurry application and show how to predict slurry operations time and distance\
    \ on field \nscale. \nA 24 m3 (W24) and a 33 m3 (W33) slurry wagon in the southern\
    \ part of Jutland, Denmark, was chosen for the study and operated \nthroughout\
    \ the 2017 slurry season (from 1. February to 1. October). Both used a 30 m trail\
    \ hoses boom, and W33 also used a 7 \nm injector. Data collection was done with\
    \ an implemented module that logged the GPS position and recorded outputs from\
    \ the \nwagons slurry flow sensor. Based on these data the wagons activities where\
    \ divided into 7 categories: Transporting empty, \ntransporting full, applying\
    \ slurry, transporting in-between applying slurry (partially loaded), collecting\
    \ slurry, stopped and parked. \nDuring the season the W24 trailer applied 38452\
    \ m3 slurry onto 1188.6 hectare and trailer W33 applied 32576 m3 slurry onto \n\
    980.6 hectare. W33 had a higher need for maintenance during the season which gave\
    \ W24 the overall highest time efficiency. \nHowever, in-field there was no difference\
    \ between the time efficiency of the wagons. Statistical modelling of the wagons\
    \ efficiency \nshowed that the total distance and time usage can be predicted\
    \ with high accuracy using predetermined factors. \nBoth wagons operated with\
    \ a similar time efficiency on all categories per field, indicating a generally\
    \ high efficiency independent \non field size. Same in-field time efficiency was\
    \ observed between the two wagons, though W33 is 37.5% larger. W33 was able \n\
    to improve distance and time efficiency when transporting slurry to the field.\

    Due to the lack of fertigation control reviews available in literature, this paper\
    \ presents an overview on these systems used both \nin scientific research and\
    \ commercial equipment. The increase in population and consequently on food consumption\
    \ requires the \nuse of water and nutrients with greater efficiency as well as\
    \ the reduction of soil and water pollution. The excessive use of \nfertilizers\
    \ and plant protection products is a major contributor to excessive standard values\
    \ concentrations in about one-third of \ngroundwater bodies in Europe. Traditional\
    \ methods usually involve applying a standard nutrient solution without any concern\
    \ for \nenvironmental aspects. One way to protect the environment is through the\
    \ irrigation water treatment and/or recirculation. \nFertigation techniques have\
    \ potential to provide optimum nutrients concentrations according to the crops\
    \ needs, enabling a more \nefficient use of both water and fertilizers. Plants\
    \ need several macronutrients and micronutrients, which are not easy to monitor.\
    \ \nTypically, the control of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK), which\
    \ are the main nutrients, is recommended. The vast \nmajority of fertigation systems\
    \ are based on Electrical Conductivity (EC) and pH sensors to allow nutrient solution\
    \ dosing. \nHowever, despite these variables being related with nutrient concentrations,\
    \ they do not provide precise measurements of NPK \ncontents. Moreover, current\
    \ available technologies for NPK measurement have several drawbacks, such as,\
    \ frequent need of \nmaintenance and calibration, large cost, unfeasible sampling\
    \ time for feedback control, among others. In this context, the \nEuropean project\
    \ Agrinupes comes up with the goals of developing new optical-based NPK sensors\
    \ to solve these drawbacks. \nThese sensors will be integrated in an easy-to-use,\
    \ robust and fault-tolerant fertigation controller, and evaluated under several\
    \ \ndemonstration cases. Besides presenting a fertigation control systems review,\
    \ this paper identifies current challenges and future \ntrends within this context.\

    \ the effects and interactions of crop rotations and different fertilization on\
    \ soil fertility \nand barley yielding and mineral nutrient composition. The research\
    \ were carried out at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences-\nSGGW Experimental\
    \ Station in Skierniewice. The long-term fertilizer experiments in Skierniewice\
    \ were founded in the years \n1922- 24 and are conducted without disturbances\
    \ still today. The soil of Skierniewice Experimental Station is mainly stagnic\
    \ \nluvisol (according to FAO classification).  \nThe experiment was conducted\
    \ in arbitrary rotation (without legumes) and five-field crop rotation (potatoes,\
    \ spring barley, red \nclover, winter wheat, rye). The fertilizer treatments applied\
    \ are CaNPK, CaPK (PK), CaPN (PN), CaKN (KN) and Ca (0). The \ncontent of C, N,\
    \ P, K, pH was determined in the soil samples as well as barley yield and nutrient\
    \ concentration in plant material \nwas investigated. Soil samples analizys indicated\
    \ that five-field crop rotation treatments reduced soil acidity, increased soil\
    \ total \nN and Corg content when compared to arbitrary rotation. \nSignificantly\
    \ higher yields of barley were obtained in five-field rotation, in which the forecrop\
    \ were potatoes grown on manure \nthan in arbitrary crop rotation where the forecrop\
    \ were other cereals. These results demonstrate a beneficial effect of five-field\
    \ \ncrop rotation upon soil fertility and barley mineral nutrition. This study\

    \ \nWarsaw University of Life Sciences, Poland \nThe aim of the research was to\
    \ evaluation of the possibility of using organic waste from agriculture to restore\
    \ marginal soils to \nagricultural production. The field experiment was established\
    \ on a field set aside for 20 years on sandy soil with low organic \ncarbon content\
    \ and low water holding capacity. Compost and pellets produced from waste organic\
    \ matter (spent mushrooms \nsubstrate, straw and the digestate from biogas plant)\
    \ were used for the research, The test plant was maize grown on a green \nmass.\
    \ The experiment included the following combinations: Control, Mineral fertilization\
    \ 100 and 200 kg N/ha, Compost 100 and \n200 kg N/ha, Pellet 100 and 200 kg N/ha,\
    \ Compost 100 and 200 kg N/ha + 50 kg N mineral, Pellet 100 and 200 kg N/ha +\
    \ 50 kg \nN mineral. \nCompost and pellets had a beneficial effect on soil properties\
    \ in relation to mineral fertilization. The results indicate that higher \norganic\
    \ carbon content in the soil was obtained in compost compared to pellets application.\
    \ The largest increase of organic \ncarbon content occurred in compost application\
    \ in a dose 100 kg N ha-1. \nThe largest increase in water holding capacity of\
    \ soils occurred under aplication of pellets in dose 200 kg N / ha + 50 kg N mineral\
    \ \n(23.7%) in comparison to the control object (18.29). The highest yield of\
    \ maize was obtained on the combination of pellets 100 \nkg N/ha + 50 kg N mineral\

    \ aims at valorisation of a resource, focused on different interests that converge\
    \ in the production and integrated \nmanagement (social, political, economic,\

    \ \nthe sustainable development. In all steps related to the management of these\
    \ flows (production, collection, storage, recovery and \nre-use under local conditions),\
    \ the aim of recovery will not to eliminate them but to reduce the exploitation\
    \ of natural resources. \nIdentification, quantification and hierarchization of\
    \ flows will be fundamental, allowing nutrient balances at farms and consequent\
    \ \nsustainable management. \nThe \"GO_Efluentes\" Operacional Group act across\
    \ the entire production system. Taking into account the different specificities,\
    \ it \nseeks to typify the main variables of the flows generated in the animal\
    \ production systems, testing efficient operational strategies \nfor their sustainable\
    \ valorisation and management. \nIn the management of livestock effluents from\
    \ intensive farms of cattle, pigs and poultry, the solutions already developed\
    \ and of \nrobust and proven use in these productive sectors will be inventoried\
    \ and a route of applicability will be defined according to the \ncharacteristics\
    \ of the farms and other regional constraints. At the same time, the impact of\
    \ the introduction of emerging solutions \nin the treatment of effluents (separation\
    \ of solids associated with the acidification of liquid fractions or the addition\
    \ of biochar and \nsolid fraction composting) will be evaluated experimentally,\
    \ as well as the reduction of emissions pollutants (ammonia and \ngreenhouse gases),\
    \ as well as the effects on the management of effluents, the economic feasibility\
    \ of applying these technologies \nto farms. \nThe development of a Operacional\
    \ Group of this typology allows an approximation between partners in the scope\

    \ space that relies on\ntechnology to connect \"things\" to the virtual world,\
    \ increasing the level of awareness of what is\noccurring in physical environments.\n\
    Besides IoT devices, IoT-based smart spaces include\nsoftware platforms and services,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data,\ncloud computing,\
    \ heterogeneous connectivity, virtual/mixed realities, and a huge range of\ntechnologies\
    \ to improve people’s quality of life, to decrease environmental impact, and to\n\
    optimize the use of physical resources.\nMost previous works provide a generic\
    \ high-level\nstructure of how a context-aware system can be operationalized,\
    \ but do not offer clues on how to\nimplement it.\nOn the other hand, there are\
    \ many implementations of context-aware systems\napplied to speciﬁc IoT-based\
    \ smart environments that are context-speciﬁc: it is not clear how they\ncan be\
    \ extended to other use cases.\nAdditionally, in recent years, a new business\
    \ paradigm has emerged which revolves around\neffectively extracting value from\
    \ data. In this scope, providing a secure ecosystem for data sharing\nthat ensures\
    \ data governance and traceability is of paramount importance as it holds the\
    \ potential\nto create new applications and services. Protecting data goes beyond\
    \ restricting who can access\nwhat resource (covered by identity and Access Control):\
    \ it becomes necessary to control how data\nare treated once accessed, which is\
    \ known as data usage control. Data usage control provides a\ncommon and trustful\
    \ security framework to guarantee the compliance with data governance rules\n\
    and responsible use of organizations’ data by third-party entities, easing and\
    \ ensuring secure data\nsharing in ecosystems such as Smart Cities and Industry\
    \ 4.0.\nThis thesis encompasses the design, implementation, and validation of\
    \ two architectures for\nenabling context-aware data analytics and data usage\
    \ control in smart spaces. Both architectures\nhave been implemented relying on\
    \ the building blocks of the FIWARE ecosystem, presenting\nagnostic end-to-end\
    \ solutions that take into consideration the complete data lifecycle, ﬁlling the\n\
    existing gap in the literature.\nOn the one hand, on the topic of context-aware\
    \ systems, I provide an architecture and a\nreference implementation that can\
    \ be readily operationalized in any IoT-based smart environment\nregardless of\
    \ its ﬁeld of application, providing a context-aware data analytics solution that\
    \ is not\ncontext-speciﬁc. I provide two sample application scenarios that showcase\
    \ how the reference\nimplementation can be used in a variety of ﬁelds, covering\
    \ from data acquisition and modeling,\nto data reasoning and dissemination.\n\
    On the other hand, regarding data usage control, I present an architecture proposal\
    \ and its\nsubsequent implementation that achieves access and usage control in\
    \ shared data ecosystems\namong multiple organizations. The proposed architecture\
    \ is based on the UCON (Usage Control)\nmodel and an extended XACML (eXtensible\
    \ Access Control Markup Language) Reference\nArchitecture, relying on key aspects\
    \ of the IDS (International Data Spaces) Reference\nArchitecture Model. The implementation\
    \ presented has been validated with a use case in the food\nindustry, presenting\
    \ a series of metrics of the response time of policy compliance veriﬁcation and\n\
    punishment enforcement.\nFinally, the results reported in this thesis contributes\
    \ to the advancement of data engineering\nnot only by enabling data analytics\
    \ capabilities in context-aware systems but also by providing a\ntrustworthy mechanism\
    \ to ensure that the data generated by those systems can be continuously\ncontrolled\
    \ and monitored using the proposed data usage control framework.\nResumen\nActualmente,\
    \ uno de los campos de aplicación más prometedores de los sistemas conscientes\
    \ del\ncontexto es el de los espacios inteligentes basados en el IoT (Internet\
    \ de las cosas). Un espacio\ninteligente es un espacio físico que se apoya en\
    \ la tecnología para conectar las \"cosas\" con el\nmundo virtual, aumentando\
    \ el nivel de conciencia de lo que ocurre en los entornos físicos.\nAdemás de\
    \ los propios dispositivos IoT, los espacios inteligentes basados en IoT incluyen\n\
    plataformas y servicios de software, inteligencia artiﬁcial (IA), aprendizaje\
    \ automático (ML), big\ndata, computación en la nube, conectividad heterogénea,\
    \ realidades virtuales/mixtas y una\nenorme gama de tecnologías para mejorar la\
    \ calidad de vida de las personas, disminuir el impacto\nmedioambiental y optimizar\
    \ el uso de los recursos físicos. La mayoría de los trabajos anteriores\nproporcionan\
    \ una estructura genérica de alto nivel sobre cómo puede funcionar un sistema\n\
    consciente del contexto, pero no ofrecen pistas sobre cómo implementarlo. Por\
    \ otra parte, hay\nmuchas implementaciones de sistemas conscientes del contexto\
    \ aplicadas a entornos inteligentes\nespecíﬁcos basados en IoT que son especíﬁcos\
    \ del campo de aplicación: no está claro cómo\npueden extenderse a otros casos\
    \ de uso.\nAdemás, en los últimos años ha surgido un nuevo paradigma empresarial\
    \ que gira en torno a la\nextracción efectiva de valor de los datos. En este ámbito,\
    \ proporcionar un ecosistema seguro para\nel intercambio de datos que garantice\
    \ la gobernanza y la trazabilidad de los mismos es de vital\nimportancia, ya que\
    \ encierra el potencial de crear nuevas aplicaciones y servicios. La protección\n\
    de los datos va más allá de la restricción de quién puede acceder a qué recurso\
    \ (cubierta por el\ncontrol de identidad y acceso): se hace necesario controlar\
    \ cómo se tratan los datos una vez que se\naccede a ellos, lo que se conoce como\
    \ control de uso de los datos. El control de uso de los datos\nproporciona un\
    \ marco de seguridad común y de conﬁanza para garantizar el cumplimiento de las\n\
    normas de gobernanza de datos y el uso responsable de los datos de las organizaciones\
    \ por parte\nde terceras entidades, facilitando y garantizando el intercambio\
    \ seguro de datos en ecosistemas\ncomo las Ciudades Inteligentes y la Industria\
    \ 4.0.\nEsta tesis abarca el diseño, la implementación y la validación de dos\
    \ arquitecturas para permitir\nel análisis de datos conscientes del contexto y\
    \ el control del uso de datos en espacios inteligentes.\nAmbas arquitecturas se\
    \ han implementado basándose en los bloques del ecosistema FIWARE,\npresentando\
    \ soluciones agnósticas de extremo a extremo que tienen en cuenta el ciclo de\
    \ vida\ncompleto de los datos, llenando el vacío existente en la literatura.\n\
    Por un lado, en lo relacionado con el tema de los sistemas conscientes del contexto,\n\
    proporciono una arquitectura y una implementación de referencia que puede ser\
    \ fácilmente\noperacionalizada en cualquier entorno inteligente basado en IoT,\
    \ independientemente de su\ncampo de aplicación, proporcionando una solución de\
    \ análisis de datos consciente del contexto\nque no es especíﬁca del mismo.\n\
    Proporciono dos escenarios de aplicación de ejemplo que\nmuestran cómo la implementación\
    \ de referencia puede ser utilizada en una variedad de campos,\ncubriendo desde\
    \ la adquisición de datos y el modelado, hasta el razonamiento de datos y la\n\
    difusión.\nPor otro lado, en lo que respecta al control del uso de los datos,\
    \ presento una propuesta de\narquitectura y su posterior implementación que logra\
    \ el control de acceso y uso de datos en\necosistemas de datos compartidos entre\
    \ múltiples organizaciones. La arquitectura propuesta se\nbasa en el modelo UCON\
    \ (Usage Control) y en una arquitectura de referencia XACML\n(eXtensible Access\
    \ Control Markup Language) ampliada, apoyándose en aspectos clave del\nmodelo\
    \ de arquitectura de referencia IDS (International Data Spaces).\nLa implementación\n\
    presentada ha sido validada con un caso de uso en la industria alimentaria, presentando\
    \ una serie\nde métricas del tiempo de respuesta de la veriﬁcación del cumplimiento\
    \ de las políticas y de la\naplicación de las sanciones.\nFinalmente, los resultados\
    \ reportados en esta tesis contribuyen al avance de la ingeniería de\ndatos, no\
    \ sólo al habilitar las capacidades de análisis de datos en los sistemas conscientes\
    \ del\ncontexto, sino también al proporcionar un mecanismo conﬁable para asegurar\
    \ que los datos\ngenerados por esos sistemas puedan ser controlados y monitoreados\
    \ continuamente usando el\nmarco de control de uso de datos propuesto en esta\
    \ tesis.\nContents\nAcknowledgments\nAbstract\nResumen\nList of Illustrations\n\

    Context can be deﬁned by as “any information that can be used to characterize\
    \ the situation of an\nentity where an entity can be a person, place, or object\
    \ that is considered relevant to the interaction\nbetween a user and an application,\
    \ including the user and applications themselves\" [Abowd 1999].\nIn turn, context-aware\
    \ systems are those that can use context for performing intelligent or smart\n\
    actions [Alegre 2016]. Currently, one of the most promising application ﬁelds\
    \ of context-aware\nsystems is that of IoT-based (Internet of Things) smart spaces.\
    \ A smart space is a physical space\nthat relies on technology to connect \"things\"\
    \ to the virtual world, increasing the level of awareness\nof what is occurring\
    \ in physical environments.\nAccording to [Hong 2009], one of the goals of context-aware\
    \ systems is to capture and\nprocess the information in the context of a device\
    \ to provide services built on a particular person,\nplace, time, event. etc.\
    \ Worded differently, context-aware systems capture context, analyze and\ninterpret\
    \ the context, and make adjustments to the system’s behavior for the user’s changing\n\
    situation without explicit intervention from the user.\nThe majority of existing\
    \ works in the ﬁeld of context-aware systems often provide a generic\nhigh-level\
    \ structure of how a system of that kind can be operationalized, but do not offer\
    \ many\nclues on how to implement it. On the other hand, there are many implementations\
    \ of context-aware\nsystems applied to speciﬁc IoT-based smart spaces use cases\
    \ (e.g., smart farming, smart cities).\nHowever, although these implementations\
    \ are context-aware, they are also context-speciﬁc: it is\nnot clear how they\
    \ can be extended to other use cases.\nAdditionally, in recent years, a new business\
    \ paradigm has emerged which revolves around\neffectively extracting value from\
    \ data. In this regard, smart spaces are considered as structures\nthat provide\
    \ trust and security for sharing data between multiple agents or stakeholders.\
    \ This is\nachieved thanks to the homogeneous data sharing by the use of combined\
    \ mechanisms of\ngovernance, legal and technical.\nThese spaces facilitate the\
    \ interoperability for accessing or\ntransferring data and allow the efﬁcient\
    \ and legitimate re-utilization of data in a context of data\nsovereignty and\
    \ control for all the parties over their own data. In this scope, providing a\
    \ secure\necosystem for data sharing that ensures data governance and traceability\
    \ is of paramount\nimportance as it holds the potential to create new applications\
    \ and services. Protecting data goes\nbeyond restricting who can access what resource\
    \ (covered by identity and access control\nrespectively): it becomes necessary\
    \ to control how data are treated once accessed, which is\nknown as data usage\
    \ control.\nData usage control provides a common and trustful security\nframework\
    \ to guarantee the compliance with data governance rules and responsible use of\n\
    INTRODUCTION\norganizations’ data by third-party entities, easing and ensuring\
    \ secure data sharing in ecosystems\nsuch as Smart Cities and Industry 4.0.\n\
    Due to these facts, this thesis provides an architecture and a reference implementation\
    \ that\ncan be used in any context-aware system development of an IoT-based smart\
    \ space. Afterward,\nthe data generated by these systems need to be protected\
    \ in terms of privacy and security. Due to\nthis reason, another contribution\
    \ is covered by this work in terms of providing a data usage control\nsolution\
    \ that can manage all the data generated by the context-aware systems used in\
    \ smart spaces.\n1.1\nContext and Motivation\nIn order to understand the motivation\
    \ for this doctoral thesis and to put all the contributions that\nthis work provides\
    \ in context, it becomes necessary to refer to the beginning of my research career.\n\
    In early 2013, I worked as a researcher at the Escuela Superior Politecnica del\
    \ Litoral (Ecuador),\nwithin the Telematics’ Systems research group. At that time,\
    \ the research lines of this group were\nwireless sensor networks, embedded and\
    \ distributed systems.\nWhen I started to work in this research group, we received\
    \ a grant for building a Smart\nIrrigation System for precision agriculture. In\
    \ this project, I was in charge of designing and\nimplementing an embedded system\
    \ capable of managing the wireless sensor network\ncommunication using the AODV\
    \ (Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector) protocol between multiple\nnodes. These nodes\
    \ were composed of a set of sensors capable of measuring the soil moisture as\n\
    well as the temperature and fertilizer levels.\nThe data gathered by each node\
    \ was sent to a\ngateway that allowed to store it in a cloud infrastructure for\
    \ later use. Also, in this project, I\ndeveloped a web application system to allow\
    \ to perform actions in each of the nodes (actuation),\ne.g., opening a valve.\n\
    This work was disseminated and materialized in the paper \"Ad-hoc\nnetwork implementation\
    \ and experimental testing using low cost and COTS components\"\n[Chavez-Burbano\
    \ 2014] in 2014.\nIt is at this point when I had my ﬁrst contact with the\ntechnologies\
    \ that I used in this thesis.\nAfterward, in 2015, my research group got another\
    \ grant.\nThis time, the topic was the\ndevelopment of Smart Buildings focused\
    \ on ensuring security in case of unforeseen events that\naffect the building\
    \ structure (e.g., ﬁre, ﬂooding, earthquakes, etc). My contribution to this project\n\
    was the design and implementation of a wireless sensor network architecture for\
    \ managing\nemergency responses inside of buildings. In this research, I had to\
    \ work with WSN, distributed\nsystems, and reactive signaling.\nThis work was\
    \ also presented as a journal paper entitled\n\"Adaptive evacuation management\
    \ system based on monitoring techniques\" [Munoz 2015]. At\nthis point, I decided\
    \ to acquire more knowledge about all of these technologies and the advances\n\
    in these topics. Thereby, I decide to start a Master’s Degree at Universidad Politécnica\
    \ de Madrid\nin 2016.\nDuring my master’s degree, I learned more about networking,\
    \ web services, cloud computing,\nbut also about big data and distributed systems.\
    \ With all of this knowledge I could identify a\n2\n1.1. CONTEXT AND MOTIVATION\n\
    set of technologies that can be used for improving the communication models with\
    \ which I had\nbeen working before. Thus, I decide to make my Master’s degree\
    \ thesis about the management of\nemergency systems, this time using big data\
    \ tools for facing the issues that had not been covered by\nthe previous project.\
    \ As a result, I published the paper \"Practical approach of fast-data architecture\n\
    applied to alert generation in emergency evacuation systems\" [Munoz-Arcentales\
    \ 2018] in the\n2018 International Symposium on Networks, Computers, and Communications.\n\
    In the last trimester of 2017, I started my PhD in Telematics Engineering and\
    \ I began to work\nas a researcher for Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in the\
    \ Next Generation Internet Research\nGroup (GING) of the Telematics Engineering\
    \ Department. In this group, I started to work on\nmultiple projects using technologies\
    \ like cloud computing and distributed systems focused on Big\nData applications.\
    \ Working in this group allowed me to identify the potential of Big Data and\n\
    Data Engineering tools for ﬁlling the gaps in the current literature about how\
    \ to manage smart\nspaces. During the subsequent years, I worked with this group\
    \ on many research projects about\ndata persistence models, big data connectors\
    \ and system deployment, building intelligent systems\nbased on machine learning\
    \ models, and AI for smart spaces. However, I noticed that despite\nthe fact that\
    \ the technologies used in these projects solved several of the issues of smart\
    \ spaces,\nthere were still some open challenges that needed to be addressed in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, a way\nof managing the whole data life-cycle and of providing\
    \ a structured manner to build and deploy\ncontext-aware systems that enable data\
    \ analytics in smart spaces was an important issue that had\nnot been faced so\
    \ far. Additionally, another key characteristic to consider in smart spaces is\
    \ that\nmultiple actors can be involved in the data-sharing process. Thus, it\
    \ is crucial to guarantee that the\ndata is processed and used according to alignments\
    \ speciﬁed by the owner of the data. Therefore,\nI determined that it was necessary\
    \ to go one step beyond and consider some additional design\nfactors.\nHence,\
    \ in order to investigate how to solve the identiﬁed open issues in context-aware\
    \ smart\nenvironments, I posed the following research questions:\n1. What should\
    \ be the design characteristics of an architecture capable of enabling context-\n\
    aware data analytics in smart spaces?\n2. How can advanced data processing and\
    \ machine learning techniques be integrated into the\naforementioned architecture?\n\
    3. How should an architecture for providing data usage control in smart spaces\
    \ be designed so\nthat it can be used in data sharing ecosystems with multiple\
    \ stakeholders?\n4. How can the implementation feasibility of the proposed data\
    \ usage control architecture be\nveriﬁed?\nThe motivation of this doctoral thesis\
    \ is to give answer to the aforementioned research\nquestions. In the last trimester\
    \ of 2017, I started to work in the research that led me to providing\n3\nINTRODUCTION\n\
    an answer to these questions and, as a consequence, accomplishing the objectives\
    \ that I present in\nthe next section.\n1.2\nObjectives\nThe main objective of\
    \ the study is to contribute to the advancement of data engineering for smart\n\
    spaces through Data Usage Control and Context-Aware Systems.\nIn order to provide\
    \ these\ncontributions, two points of action have been deﬁned. The ﬁrst point\
    \ deals with providing data\nengineering models, techniques, and architectures\
    \ for enabling context-aware data analytics in\nsmart spaces. The second point\
    \ is to identify the challenges and needs for providing data usage\ncontrol over\
    \ data spaces and to propose viable solutions.\nTo fully comply with the main\
    \ objective of this thesis, the following speciﬁc objectives are\nproposed:\n\
    • Deﬁne a conceptual model of context-aware systems adapted to smart spaces -\
    \ This research\nneeds to perform a review of the current solutions of context-aware\
    \ systems and identify\nwhat is the work that needs to be conducted for deﬁning\
    \ an architecture that can be applied\nin smart spaces.\n• Propose an architecture\
    \ and a reference implementation for enabling context-aware data\nanalytics in\
    \ Smart Spaces - This research has to be based on a conceptual architecture for\n\
    building context-aware systems capable of providing data analytics in smart spaces.\n\
    Afterward, a reference implementation needs to be provided in order to validate\
    \ the\nproposal using real use cases.\n• Identify the key characteristics and\
    \ needs of data usage control systems for being\nintroduced and applied in the\
    \ context of data spaces - This study has to be aware of the\nexisting solutions\
    \ for conducting a review of the literature that allows extracting possible\n\
    design references.\n• Propose a design, implementation and validation of an architecture\
    \ for providing data\nusage and access control in data spaces - This proposal\
    \ considers the design principles\nprovided for designing and implementing an\
    \ architecture that enables data usage control\nand its application in Industrial\
    \ Data Spaces.\n1.3\nMethodology and Document Structure\nThe methodological approach\
    \ of this study involves a documentary and experimental section. In\nthe documentary\
    \ part, an exhaustive review of the state of the art is described for each chapter,\n\
    allowing the development of overtures, schemes, and architectures to carry out\
    \ a set of experiments\nthat enable the analysis and validation of the different\
    \ proposals. Experimentally, implementations\n4\n1.3. METHODOLOGY AND DOCUMENT\
    \ STRUCTURE\nfor different environments have been proposed. The systems included\
    \ in these implementations\ngenerate a set of data that is used for training and\
    \ deploying machine learning models. Also, it\nprovides a mechanism for controlling\
    \ the use of the data generated by the systems all encompassed\nin the smart spaces\
    \ ecosystem. Moreover, considering the results obtained in the experiments,\n\
    some outstanding issues that need greater analysis, implementation, and experimentation\
    \ have\nbeen identiﬁed as a future line of research.\nThis document is divided\
    \ into the following sections:\n1.3.1\nChapter 2: State of the Art\nThis chapter\
    \ is intended to provide the context of the current technologies and disciplines\
    \ related\nto the work conducted in this thesis. It includes an overview of the\
    \ current cloud technologies,\nconcepts about context-aware, data spaces, data\
    \ engineering, data access, and usage control\npresenting the key characteristics\
    \ of each of these technologies, and their current state in the\nliterature.\n\
    1.3.2\nChapter 3: Context-aware Systems and Data Analytics in Smart Spaces\nThis\
    \ chapter presents the ﬁrst block of contributions of this thesis: the proposal\
    \ of an architecture\nfor enabling context-aware data analytics in smart spaces.\
    \ For this purpose, I take into account\nthe current solutions available and how\
    \ these can be adapted, implemented, and validated for\ntheir use in the scope\
    \ of smart spaces. In this regard, not only a conceptual model is presented,\n\
    but also an implementation using two use cases. Through this implementation, it\
    \ is possible to\nprovide a direct contribution to data engineering through the\
    \ provision of connectors and models\nfor managing data analytics of context data.\n\
    1.3.3\nChapter 4: Data Usage Control for Data Spaces\nThis chapter presents my\
    \ contributions to the ﬁeld of data usage control, presenting an architecture\n\
    capable of providing data usage control in shared data spaces in which multiple\
    \ stakeholders are\ninvolved. This work provides contributions at the design level,\
    \ implementation level, and semantic\nlevel.\n1.3.4\nChapter 5: Validation and\
    \ Results\nThis chapter presents the validation and results of the proposals presented\
    \ throughout the thesis.\nThis validation encompasses many international projects\
    \ where these contributions have been\nused. Moreover, I provide an overview of\
    \ the different results from the dissemination point of\nview, including the works\
    \ presented in journals and conferences.\n5\nINTRODUCTION\n1.3.5\nChapter 6: Conclusions\n\
    In the ﬁnal chapter of the thesis, I provide a brief overview of the work developed,\
    \ extracting the\nmain conclusions and verifying that all the objectives deﬁned\
    \ at the beginning of this work have\nbeen accomplished. Additionally, I analyze\
    \ the possible lines of research that can be generated\nfrom this thesis.\n6\n\
    Chapter 2\nState of the Art\nThis section presents the concepts and technologies\
    \ directly related to the topics proposed in this\nthesis. This section aims to\
    \ provide the reader with a global perspective of the status of the\ntechnologies\
    \ used in this proposal to understand how the work presented in this document\n\
    contributes to the current state of the art.\nSince all the contributions proposed\
    \ in this thesis are focused on the ﬁeld of application of\nSmart Spaces, I ﬁrst\
    \ present a conceptual review of this type of technological ecosystem, along\n\
    with its most relevant characteristics. As has been stated before, in order to\
    \ take advantage of the\ndata generated by the different data sources that are\
    \ presented in the SS, a robust infrastructure for\nmanaging the different types\
    \ of services is needed. For this reason, it is recommended to deploy all\nof\
    \ these services in a robust and scalable cloud service. Thus, the next technology\
    \ to be analyzed\nis Cloud Computing: I present a general review including the\
    \ concept and the overview of the\ndifferent Cloud Service Providers in all of\
    \ their levels of abstraction.\nIn the introduction of section 1, an overview\
    \ of smart space was presented.\nOne of the\nhighlighted aspects of this type\
    \ of environment was the wide range of services that need to be\ndeployed for\
    \ providing a full interaction among all the systems involved.\nA few years ago,\n\
    deploying this type of service was very costly at the computational level. However,\
    \ nowadays,\nwith the huge contribution of the Microservices technologies, a new,\
    \ scalable, robust, and\nefﬁcient way to manage and interact with a huge amount\
    \ of services is available. Hence, a review\nof the Microservices technologies\
    \ is the next topic that is covered in this Chapter.\nAnother topic that needs\
    \ to be faced in the smart spaces ecosystem is how to handle the vast\namount\
    \ of data generated by multiple sources. Traditional ways of data processing are\
    \ not the\nbest solution in this scenario. Accordingly, in this thesis, I propose\
    \ an architecture based on Big\nData tools for processing and managing the complete\
    \ data cycle. However, this contribution is not\nonly focused on the use of these\
    \ tools but also on how all of these components can be integrated\ninto the SS\
    \ ecosystem to gain knowledge from the analyzed data. This convergence is called\
    \ Data\nEngineering and it is another concept that is described in section 2.4.\n\
    After providing the reader with the necessary context and background about the\
    \ main concepts\nand components involved in smart spaces scenarios, it is turn\
    \ to describe the state of the art and\nrelated work of one of the main contributions\
    \ that this thesis proposes: the development of a\nContext-Aware System for smart\
    \ spaces. Thus, section 2.5 provides a conceptual description and\nrepresentation\
    \ of this type of system for providing all the background needed to understand\
    \ how\nthese systems work.\nSTATE OF THE ART\nFinally, the convergence of all\
    \ of these technologies and the need to provide a full framework\ncapable, not\
    \ only to take advantage of using the data, but also protecting and allowing to\
    \ control\ndata according to the current regulation. This leads to present as\
    \ a contribution the development\nof a fully compatible architecture for providing\
    \ a Data Usage Control framework in smart spaces.\nDue to this fact, in section,\
    \ 2.7 a conceptual review of the concepts of Access Control and Data\nUsage Control\
    \ is conducted.\n2.1\nSmart Spaces\nIn the introduction of this document is stated\
    \ that the main contributions of this thesis are directly\nrelated to the implementation\
    \ of solutions to some issues that need to be addressed in the ﬁeld of\nSmart\
    \ Spaces, due to this reason, in this section I present a conceptual review of\
    \ this concept and\nthe principal characteristics of this type of ecosystem.\n\
    2.1.1\nIntroduction to Smart Spaces\nOne of the ﬁrst concepts of Smart Spaces\
    \ was presented by the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (NIST)\
    \ [Rosenthal 2000] as work environments with embedded computers,\ninformation\
    \ appliances, and multi-modal sensors allowing people to perform tasks efﬁciently\
    \ by\noffering unprecedented levels of access to information and assistance from\
    \ computer and devices.\nAlso, the smart space support stationary and mobile information\
    \ environments that can be\nconnected to the Internet. Another more informal deﬁnition\
    \ is presented by [Pahl 2016] where\nthey called Smart Spaces to the physical\
    \ space where the Smart Devices are connected and\nworking together and also state.\
    \ Nowadays, in our daily lives connected sensors and IoT devices\nare omnipresent,\
    \ and interacting with people any time and any location. On the other hand,\n\
    [Oliver 2009] and [Cook 2007] states that a smart space also called smart environment,\
    \ can get\nand administer knowledge about its environment and adapt to its inhabitants\
    \ to improve their\nexperience in that environment. Moreover, according to [Balandin\
    \ 2009] the smart space needs\nsoftware that captures and represents all the information\
    \ of the space in programmable entities. A\nstructured way for capturing this\
    \ information is shown in Fig 2.1 in where segmentation of the\nsmart space into\
    \ the following three layers is provided:\n• Physical Space - with sensing devices\
    \ like buildings, vehicles, etc\n• Service Spaces - where all the connectivity,\
    \ information, retrieval, and processing\ncapabilities are placed.\n• User Space\
    \ - whit information about the user, like personal data.\n8\n2.1. SMART SPACES\n\
    Figure 2.1 : Smart Space Overview\n2.1.2\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nThe concept\
    \ of Internet of Things (IoT) was presented for the ﬁrst time by [Ashton 2009]\
    \ in 2009.\nHe explains that the idea of IoT relies on the importance of connecting\
    \ objects and making them\nsmart. According to [Mehmood 2017], IoT is a paradigm\
    \ of communication that has as the main\ngoal to establish an ideal framework\
    \ to connect devices to the Internet, i.e., multiple objects could\nbe interconnected\
    \ between them to build a network in which intercommunicate and execute actions\n\
    intelligently.\nThe practical applications of IoT embrace multiple domains such\
    \ as agriculture, transportation,\neducation, e-Health, among others. Multiple\
    \ applications represent a challenge for both academy\nand industry seeking to\
    \ improve the quality of life through this technology [Gubbi 2013].\nAt present,\
    \ multiple companies and cities use a large amount of data in order to determine\
    \ the\nbest option for statistical analysis and machine learning models.\nDue\
    \ to this fact,\n[Camargo-Vega 2015] concludes that data revolution is now quantiﬁable,\
    \ measurable, and then\ncan be processed and interpreted.\nCommunication Models\n\
    IoT uses communication models for sharing the data between them and establish\
    \ a common\nscheme of connection. Some of the principal communication models are\
    \ the following:\n• MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) - It is an OASIS standard protocol\
    \ for publish/subscribe\nmessaging.\nIt is lightweight, open, straightforward,\
    \ and simple to implement.\nThese\n9\nSTATE OF THE ART\ncharacteristics make this\
    \ communication model ideal for being used in (IoT) contexts in\nwhich the device\
    \ has very limited resources [Hunkeler 2008].\n• Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP) - It is a protocol that uses the client/server model\nfor communicating\
    \ through the internet using the UDP transport protocol. This model is\noriented\
    \ to limited low-power wireless nodes [Shelby 2014].\n• Common Object Request\
    \ Broker Architecture (CORBA) - It deﬁnes a standard that promotes\nthe development\
    \ of distributed applications in environments with multiple heterogeneous\ndata\
    \ sources [Siegel 2000].\nIoT Architectures\nThis section presents an overview\
    \ of some relevant IoT architectures solutions available at this\nmoment [Rodriguez\
    \ Espinoza 2017, Alberto 2014, Gubbi 2013].\n• SMART-SANTANDER - This proposes\
    \ the use of the smart city infrastructure currently\ndeployed for conducting\
    \ research and deploy new services to the citizens, SMART\nSantander is composed\
    \ of a wide IoT infrastructure at different levels as communication\nprotocols,\
    \ architectures, and IoT services to users [Vakali 2014].\n• SENSEI - It was designed\
    \ for business applications to focus his ﬁeld of action on the\nscalability for\
    \ a large number of devices [Genge 2014].\n• BRIDGE - Provides a solution for\
    \ security and software applications with two main\ninterfaces for queering a\
    \ request and capturing operations. [Uckelmann 2011]\n• CUBIQ - It is a solution\
    \ for data access, processing, and federation in IoT environments.\n[Dempo 2010].\n\
    • Zigbee - It is a commercial wireless technology based on IEEE 802.15.4 standards.\
    \ These\ndevices are designed for connecting things with minimum use of energy\
    \ resources and a low\ndata transmission rate.\n• WirelessHART - It is a wireless\
    \ communication technology based on IEEE 802.15.4. It\nenables secured real-time\
    \ communication with a central management routing the TDM slots\nand networking\
    \ mesh [Chen 2010].\n• Sensinode - It uses 6LoWPAN for providing network-embedded\

    \ business applications.\n• SunSPOT (Sun Small Programmable Object Technology)\
    \ - It is Sun Microsystems platform\nthat allows the developing sensor networks\
    \ and embedded systems. In order to provide that\nfeatures they have created their\
    \ own Java virtual machine named Squawk-VM\n[Castro 2011].\n10\n2.1. SMART SPACES\n\
    The advancement in communication technologies and the rapid adoption of the Internet\
    \ of\nThings have enabled the physical world to invisibly interact with actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other\ncomputational elements while maintaining continuous network\
    \ connectivity. Due to this fact,\nmany research efforts have been conducted for\
    \ integrating a new generation of smart spaces\ncentered in IoT being is known\
    \ as IoT-Based Smart Spaces.\n2.1.3\nIoT-Based Smart Spaces\nCurrently, Smart\
    \ Spaces also called Smart environments to take advantage of the IoT devices by\n\
    extending the capabilities of smart objects by enabling the user to monitor the\
    \ environment from\nremote. IoT can be integrated with different smart spaces\
    \ based on the application requirements.\nAccording to [Ahmed 2016] IoT-Based\
    \ Smart Spaces, can be classiﬁed by the following areas:\nsmart cities, smart\
    \ homes, smart grid, smart buildings, smart transportation, smart health, and\n\
    smart industry. A general picture of this classiﬁcation in showed in Fig 2.2\n\
    • Smart Transportation - One of the most important aspect to consider within Smart\n\
    ecosystems\nis\nmobility,\nwhere,\nthe\nsafety\nand\nefﬁciency\ncan\nbe\nimproved\n\
    [Kyriazis 2013, Janota 2016], quality of life, time, and routes of users within\
    \ cities, e.g. An\nautonomous vehicle can introduce a personal assistant, autonomous\
    \ driving and automatic\nparking, also, by the use of sophisticated sensors, the\
    \ intensity of the lights can be\ncontrolled or [Bodenheimer 2014] even improving\
    \ contaminant emissions like CO2. A\nmore expanded perspective is obtained when\
    \ it is introduce them in an entire city, the\noptimization of vehicle urban routes\
    \ allows to improve trafﬁc efﬁciency for example during\ntrafﬁc congestion hours\
    \ or massive public events.\nEven, can be included in dedicated\nbicycles lanes\
    \ [Barco 2017] contributing to minimizing the use of automobiles and also the\n\
    gases emission.\n• Smart Homes - It is focused on home applications for the digital\
    \ consumer. Some of the\nareas of home automation led IoT enabled connectivity,\
    \ such as lighting control, gardening,\nsafety and security, air quality, water-quality\
    \ monitoring, voice assistants, switches, locks,\nenergy, and water meters.[Verma\
    \ 2016]\n• Smart Cities - The aim is to improve the quality of life and safety\
    \ of citizens\n[Munoz-Arcentales 2017], e.g. Avoiding noise in cities [Montalvo\
    \ 2016], early warning of\nincidents or unexpected events, congestion maps of\
    \ people, and safe areas in case of natural\ndisasters, e.g., earthquakes [Velásquez\
    \ 2017], ﬂoods, volcanic eruptions, and forest ﬁres. It\nis also focused on the\
    \ creation of communities [Colldahl 2013], e.g., smart education uses\nlife-long\
    \ learning programs,\nwhich may focus on employability,\ndigital inclusion\n[Buscher\
    \ 2013], or speciﬁc citizens groups, e.g., elderly or those with physical disabilities.\n\
    Governance is also important in Smart Cities.\nThus, transparency in government\n\
    transactions, efﬁciency in local governments, and prevention of crimes against\
    \ citizens are\n11\nSTATE OF THE ART\nsome of the goals of the Smart Governance\
    \ [Belanche-Gracia 2015, SpliTech 2017]. For\nexample, through the use of open\
    \ data, cities can get immediate information from\ngovernments to prevent fraudulent\
    \ procedures.\nAlso, electronic appointments for\nprocedures in agencies help\
    \ to avoid waiting in long queues for getting that public service.\n• Smart Grid\
    \ the aim is the energy, gas, and light reduction to create and maintain a more\n\
    efﬁcient and sustainable city, e.g. Smart grid applications [Kurt 2017] and distributed\
    \ energy\nstorage.\n• Smart Buildings - The aim is to adopt or improve sustainability\
    \ capabilities to residencies,\nhomes, and commercial buildings, based on energy\
    \ efﬁciency to enhance the quality of life,\ne.g. smart buildings can monitor\
    \ their structural health [Stojkoska 2017], regulate lighting\nand heating based\
    \ on presence detection, and use intelligent appliances to automate\neveryday\
    \ tasks [Bartolli 2011].\n• Smart Health - The aim is to enhance health care systems,\
    \ improving the care of patients in\nterm of efﬁciency and effectiveness in both\
    \ ways manually or remotely [Torres 2017], e.g.,\nThe wearable devices could send\
    \ information from patients with a disease (cardiac\npathology’s, insufﬁciency’s,\
    \ arrhythmia’s, etc.) to real-time monitoring systems, allowing\ndoctors to act\
    \ in the minimum possible time when something unexpected is taking place\n[Narvaez\
    \ 2017].\nAmbulances could send real-time measurements of a patient to be\ntransferred\
    \ to the ER, in consequence when the patient arrives at the hospital, a doctor\
    \ can\nadminister medication for his/her speedy recovery, or even save a life.\
    \ Even, Ambulance\nDrones can be integrated into this ecosystem for being sent\
    \ to remote or difﬁcult access\nareas in optimal times. [Momont 2017].\n• Smart\
    \ Industry - The aim is to provide suitable environments for industries like\n\
    manufacturing or agriculture.\nIt is focused on providing ﬂexibility, optimized\
    \ decision\nmaking, mass customization, and remote monitoring, [Gadgil 2017],\
    \ e.g., in a Smart Farm,\nestablishing remote monitoring zones for plantations,\
    \ robots from collecting and planting\nvegetables, automated processing of products,\
    \ and breeding in closed environments of\nanimals and vegetables.\n2.1.4\nIoT-Based\
    \ Smart Spaces Taxonomy\nThis section describes the taxonomy of IoT-Based Smart\
    \ Spaces classiﬁed by: communication\nenablers, network types, technologies, wireless\
    \ standards, objectives, and characteristics. An\noverview can be seen in Figure\
    \ 2.3.\n• Communication Enablers - Correspond to the wireless technologies for\
    \ connecting the\ndevices across the Internet. The principal mediums of connection\
    \ are WIFI, 3G, 4G, and\nvery recently the 5G.\n12\n2.1. SMART SPACES\nFigure\
    \ 2.2 : IoT-Based Smart Space\n• Network Types - Rely on the different types of\
    \ networks to perform collaborative tasks. The\nmain networks are wireless local\
    \ area networks (WLANs), wireless personal area networks\n(WPANs), wide area networks\
    \ (WANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), and wireless\nregional area networks\
    \ (WRANs).\n• Technologies - Sensing technologies are used to collect data from\
    \ different data sources and\ntransmit it using communication technologies to\
    \ a central location. The emerging computing\ntechnologies, such as cloud computing\
    \ and fog computing, deployed in the central location\nlet the data fusion technologies\
    \ the task of integrating the data coming from heterogeneous\nresources.\n• Wireless\
    \ Standards - These standard technologies are used inside the smart space to share\n\
    the collected data to the different devices in the ecosystem.\n• Objectives -\
    \ IoT-based smart spaces are deployed to facilitate inhabitants’ lives in different\n\
    situations.\nThus, The objectives must be aligned regarding the requirements and\n\
    functionalities implemented.\nThe principal objectives of these environments are\
    \ cost\n13\nSTATE OF THE ART\nFigure 2.3 : IoT-Based Smart Space Taxonomy[Ahmed\
    \ 2016]\nreduction, utilization improvement, proactive maintenance, and minimal\
    \ user interaction.\n• Characteristics - IoT-based smart spaces have some unique\
    \ features that make them\nvaluable. These characteristics are prediction capabilities,\
    \ newly enhanced services, remote\nmonitoring, and decision-making capabilities.\n\
    Moreover, it can apply data fusion and\nmining techniques to make intelligent\
    \ decisions system with the gathered data from\ndifferent sources.\n2.1.5\nSystems\
    \ of Systems\nNowadays, initiatives such as Smart Cities are displaying how multiple\
    \ systems within the city\nlike transport, health, governance, etc. can work together\
    \ to exploit the potential to optimize the\noperations city. Fig 2.4 shows a general\
    \ overview of the different types of system integration’s,in\nwhere the architecture\
    \ of Smart Solution, Systems of Systems and Data Sharing Ecosystems is\npresented.\n\
    Due to this fact, the integration and collaboration between multiple systems inside\
    \ of a smart\nspace have become a standard requirement. This integration is known\
    \ as System of Systems (SoS)\nand its main goal is to allow the connection of\
    \ systems beyond their organizational boundaries\nlike city, automotive, personal\
    \ data coming from different domains like logistics, manufacturing,\nagriculture\
    \ and allowing their operation over multiple levels like city, building, home,\
    \ an individual\ncustomer.\nAccording to [Maier 1998], the following are the most\
    \ relevant features that describe a SoS:\n• Operational independence - It refers\
    \ that each of the systems that build the SoS can operate\n14\n2.1. SMART SPACES\n\
    Figure 2.4 : General Representation of Systems\nindependently from the SoS and\
    \ other systems.\n• Managerial independence - Each of the systems can be managed\
    \ by different entities.\n• Geographic distribution - It describes how the systems\
    \ are located being this widely spread\nor localized.\n• Evolutionary development\
    \ - It refers to the capability to maintain the consistency in the\ninterfaces\
    \ that are used to communicate systems due to the continuous evolutionary nature\n\
    of the systems.\n• Emergent behavior - It allows identifying each of the SoS changes.\n\
    2.1.6\nData Space\nThe concept of Data Space has emerged to take advantage of\
    \ the incoming phenomena of digital\ntransformation of the real world. This transformation\
    \ turns around the digitization of all the\nsystems and devices that conform to\
    \ a smart space in all of its levels.\n15\nSTATE OF THE ART\nFirst, for deﬁning\
    \ a Data Space is needed to know how a Data Ecosystem is built. A data\necosystem\
    \ can be formed in different manners, focusing on an organization, an activity\n\
    (mobility), a community of interest (music), a geographical location (city), or\
    \ within or across\nindustrial sectors (automotive, manufacturing, pharmaceutical).\
    \ In the context of smart space, the\ndata ecosystem is a deﬁnition that allows\
    \ us to understand the challenges in maximizing the value\nof data within the\
    \ environment [Curry 2018]. One of the main beneﬁts that a smart ecosystem\nprovides\
    \ is the cross-fertilization and data sharing of crucial resources and datasets\
    \ from different\nparticipants promoting new business opportunities and easier\
    \ access to knowledge and data.\nThus, a data space can be deﬁned as a decentralized\
    \ data ecosystem built around commonly\nagreed building blocks enabling an effective\
    \ and trusted sharing of data among participants.\nAdditionally, Smart Spaces\
    \ are considered as structures that provide trust and security for\nsharing data\
    \ between multiple agents or stakeholders.\nThis is achieved thanks to the\nhomogeneous\
    \ data sharing by the use of combined mechanisms of governance, legal and\ntechnical.\
    \ These spaces facilitate the interoperability for accessing or transferring the\
    \ data and\nallow its efﬁcient and legitimate re-utilization in a context of data\
    \ sovereignty and control for all\nthe parties over its owns data. The design\
    \ principles of data spaces are:\n• Data Sovereignty - Regarding data, the concept\
    \ of sovereignty deals with reaching a balance\nbetween the need for protecting\
    \ someone’s data and sharing these data with a third party.\n• Level Playing Field\
    \ - It refers that for all data space participants don’t face insurmountable\n\
    barriers for example avoiding a quasi-monopolistic data ecosystem.\nIt is ruled\
    \ by the\nconcept of cooperation instead of competition. The competence in this\
    \ principle is focused\non the quality of the data and services and not on the\
    \ amount of data that they control.\n• Decentralised soft Infrastructure - It\
    \ refers that data space must include a fully distributed\ninfrastructure for\
    \ providing interoperability, portability, ﬁndability, security, privacy, and\n\
    trustworthiness.\n• Public-private Governance - It foments the conﬁrmation of\
    \ strong governance with a high\nlevel of commitment that allows all the parties\
    \ to feel included and represented\nFrom a technical perspective, several technology\
    \ building blocks are required:\n• Data Interoperability - Data spaces should\
    \ provide a solid framework for an efﬁcient\nexchange of data among participants,\
    \ supporting full decoupling of data providers and\nconsumers.\nThis requires\
    \ the adoption of a “common lingua” every participant uses,\nmaterialized in the\
    \ adoption of common APIs for the data exchange, and the deﬁnition of\ncommon\
    \ data models. Common mechanisms for traceability of data exchange transactions\n\
    and data provenance are also required.\n16\n2.2. CLOUD COMPUTING\n• Data Sovereignty\
    \ and trust - Data spaces should bring technical means for guaranteeing\nthat\
    \ participants in a data space can trust each other and exercise sovereignty over\
    \ the data\nthey share. This requires the adoption of common standards for managing\
    \ the identity of\nparticipants, the veriﬁcation of their truthfulness, and the\
    \ enforcement of policies agreed\nupon in data access and usage control.\n• Data\
    \ value creation - Data spaces should provide support for the creation of multi-sided\n\
    markets where participants can generate value out of sharing data (i.e., creating\
    \ data value\nchains). This requires the adoption of common mechanisms enabling\
    \ the deﬁnition of terms\nand conditions (including pricing) linked to data offerings,\
    \ the publication, and discovery\nof such offerings, and the management of all\
    \ the necessary steps supporting the lifecycle of\ncontracts that are established\
    \ when a given participant acquires the rights to access and use\ndata.\n2.2\n\
    Cloud Computing\nThis section provides a review of the concept of Cloud Computing,\
    \ the key components of this\ntechnology, and also a brief overview of the commercial\
    \ providers and platforms available at the\nmoment.\n2.2.1\nIntroduction to Cloud\
    \ Computing\nAccording to the NIST Deﬁnition of Cloud Computing by [Mell 2011].\
    \ Cloud Computing is a\nmodel that provision ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand\
    \ network access to a shared pool of\nconﬁgurable computing resources, like: networks,\
    \ servers, storage, applications, and services\nwhich can be rapidly provided\
    \ with a minimal service provider or manager intervention. This\nmodel is structured\
    \ by the following ﬁve principal characteristics:\n• On-demand self-service. -\
    \ The users have access to manage the computational resources\nlike CPU, RAM,\
    \ Storage, etc Network according to their needs without the intervention of\n\
    the service provider.\n• Broad network access. - This capabilities are available\
    \ by the network and can be accessed\nby the use of standard mechanisms.\n• Resource\
    \ pooling. - The cloud platform, use a multi-tenant model allowing to provide\
    \ the\nresource provisioning to the different users.\n• Rapid elasticity. - The\
    \ resources can by provisioned and released in an automatic ways\naccording to\
    \ the users needs.\n• Measured service.\n- The resources are automatically monitored\
    \ and reported by\nmeasurement tools.\n17\nSTATE OF THE ART\nOn the other hand,\
    \ [Wang 2010] presents some factors to differentiate the could computing of\n\
    other technologies. They deﬁne ﬁve factors: User Centered Interfaces, On-demand\
    \ provisioning\nresources, Guarantee quality of services, Autonomous systems and\
    \ Adaptability and ﬂexibility to\nthe demand. Additionally, [Linthicum 2009] present\
    \ the relationship between could computing\nand software oriented services. Through\
    \ this relationship they conclude that cloud computing\nis presented as the next\
    \ generation of IT on-demand service and products. Despite each of the\nauthors\
    \ add some contributions to the deﬁnition of cloud computing, it is clearly stated\
    \ that the\nfundamental idea is basically the same.\nThere is no doubt that cloud\
    \ computing provides a huge range of advantages in term of the\nprovision of computational\
    \ resources. In this work a a full description of how it can take advantage\n\
    of cloud computing focused on deploying the services presented in a smart space.\
    \ However, the\ndesign of these type of solution is not trivial and involve another\
    \ additional components that will\nbe presented in the next sections.\n2.2.2\n\
    Cloud Computing Services\nAccording to [Zhang 2010, Hill 2012, Höfer 2011] cloud\
    \ computing services are divide into three\nmain categories in where some speciﬁc\
    \ services are placed. Fig 2.5 the services, the user proﬁle,\nand also the level\
    \ of control for each category.\nFigure 2.5 : Cloud Computing Services\n18\n2.2.\
    \ CLOUD COMPUTING\n• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - IaaS gives users access\
    \ to storage, networking, servers,\nand other computing resources via the cloud.\
    \ At this level, the user is still responsible for\nmanaging their applications,\
    \ data, and computer resources. However, IaaS gives automated\nand scalable environments\
    \ with a high degree of control and ﬂexibility for the user. This\ntype of automation\
    \ and ﬂexibility allows the services hosted in the cloud to manage\ncomplex situations\
    \ like control of workload spikes during busy seasons.\nEven could\ncomputing\
    \ providers are not described yet, I like to list some of the popular IaaS providers\n\
    like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE),\
    \ the\nIaaS component of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Openstack.\n• Platform\
    \ as a Service (PaaS) - PaaS provides a framework for providing the most efﬁcient\n\
    way to create, customize, and deploy applications. This service layer is primarily\
    \ used by\ndevelopers and operations professionals, currently know as DevOps.\
    \ Usually, the way of\naccess to these resources is through the rent of cloud-based\
    \ platforms for users to develop\nand deliver applications.\n• Software as a Service\
    \ (SaaS) - Nowadays, cloud application services are the well-known\nof the cloud\
    \ service models. Usually, the software is hosted, packaged, and delivered by\
    \ a\nthird party typically on a browser-based interface and all the workload is\
    \ directly managed\nby the cloud service. However, it also allows distributing\
    \ the workload between the cloud\nplatform and the client. In both cases, users\
    \ don’t need to execute all the workload on their\nside. This service offers to\
    \ the enterprises the possibility of ofﬂoad the costs of management\nand maintenance\
    \ to the vendor. A few examples of this type of service are Google Docs,\nOutlook,\
    \ Gmail, SalesForce, etc.\nTo understand not only the services that cloud computing\
    \ offer to the user but also the type of\ncloud computer available, this section\
    \ presents the three main cloud service types (see Fig 2.6):\nprivate, public,\
    \ and hybrid clouds.\nEach of the mentioned options has his advantages and\ndisadvantages\
    \ depending of the type of service that the user or enterprise need to deal with\n\
    [Furht 2010].\n• Private - A private cloud provides IT services for by different\
    \ interfaces like the Internet or a\nprivate network to a very speciﬁc set of\
    \ users, rather than to the general public. This type of\ncloud allows the organization\
    \ the capability of the cloud with a wide range of customization\nand security.\
    \ Private clouds can reside on-site or off-site. The differentiating characteristic\n\
    is that the single private tenant who rules the IT services. Usually, private\
    \ clouds are chased\nby organizations whit high priorities on security and compliance.\n\
    • Public - In a public cloud, all the services and infrastructure are administrated\
    \ off-site over\nthe Internet and shared across multiple tenants. Public clouds\
    \ are run by third parties, and\napplications from different tenants are expected\
    \ to be mixed on the cloud’s servers, storage\n19\nSTATE OF THE ART\nFigure 2.6\
    \ : Cloud Computing Types\nsystems, and networks. One of the most relevant advantages\
    \ of using a public cloud is the\nincreased efﬁciency and posterior cost-effectiveness\
    \ of shared resources. Public clouds are\nconsidered the cheapest solution of\
    \ the three types of cloud computing as well as traditional\non-premise computing\
    \ due to they rely on economies of scale.\n• Hybrid - The combination of both\
    \ private and public cloud elements are known as hybrid\ncloud environments. One\
    \ of the main features of this type of cloud is the independence\nof operation.\
    \ Regardless of how it way of operating, the clouds in a hybrid environment\n\
    permit the portability of data and applications over a secured and encrypted connection.\n\
    This solution is becoming very popular due to it allows organizations greater\
    \ ﬂexibility to\nmeet their IT needs.\n2.2.3\nCloud Computing Platforms\nIn this\
    \ section, a review of the principal features of the providers and cloud computing\
    \ platform is\nconducted. Fig 2.7 presents a picture of the most popular IaaS\
    \ classiﬁed by public cloud and open\nsource technologies.\nAmazon Web Services\
    \ AWS\nAWS is composed of a set of services IaaS and PaaS that nowadays has been\
    \ considered as one of\nthe most used platforms.\nEven, back in 2009 [Reese 2009]\
    \ considered the term \"cloud\n20\n2.2. CLOUD COMPUTING\nFigure 2.7 : IaaS Cloud\
    \ Providers and Technologies\ninfrastructure\" as a synonym of Amazon EC2 and\
    \ Amazon S3 that was the two principal cloud\nservices of that provider by that\
    \ time.\nCurrently, AWS has a full stack of components that\nprovides a wide range\
    \ of services. In Fig 2.8 is showed the AWS global infrastructure grouped by\n\
    levels classiﬁed by Foundation Services, Application Services, and Deployment\
    \ and Monitoring.\nThis division provides a good segmentation of the service that\
    \ each component provides. For\nexample, EC2 is the service in charge of manage\
    \ all the virtual servers that are deployed by the\nusers while S3 is focused\
    \ on providing an external persistence store system as a service and in the\n\
    same way provide load balancer service, network management, and monitoring all\
    \ in the same\nplatform but administered by independent components.\nMicrosoft\
    \ Azure\nAzure is the service for Cloud Computing provided by Microsoft in terms\
    \ of IaaS and PaaS.\nCurrently, it is one of the tops could service providers\
    \ in term of use together with AWS and\n21\nSTATE OF THE ART\nFigure 2.8 : AWS\
    \ Cloud Stack\nGoogle Cloud Platform.\nAs is showed in Fig 2.9 Azure provides\
    \ computation resources,\non-demand storage services in the same way as Amazon\
    \ and also provides a huge range of\ncomponents for managing, storage, data, analytics,\
    \ development tools and manage IoT devices.\nGoogle Cloud Platform\nGoogle Cloud\
    \ Platform (GCP) is the cloud platform that Google provides for its computation\n\
    service. It uses the same infrastructure where it hosted its services like the\
    \ search engine, Gmail,\nYoutube, etc. The service provided by offers also on-demand\
    \ storage, API translate, and his PaaS\nservice Google App Engine.\nIn the same\
    \ way that the most used service providers, google\nprovides some advantages features\
    \ that allow to the user work with complex tasks like\nMicroservices Orchestration\
    \ using Kubernetes, Big Data and Machine Learning, AI, and more. A\ngeneral view\
    \ of the stack of Google Cloud is shown in the Fig 2.10.\nRackspace\nThis platform\
    \ offers the possibility of host virtual machines in a similar way to Amazon EC2,\
    \ and\nalso storage, web services, and cloud infrastructure. The following are\
    \ the most relevant services\nof Rackspace:\n• Cloud Files - It offers Storage\
    \ and Content Delivery Network.\n22\n2.2. CLOUD COMPUTING\nFigure 2.9 : Azure\
    \ Cloud Stack [Microsoft 2019]\nFigure 2.10 : Google Cloud Stack [Carter 2021]\n\
    23\nSTATE OF THE ART\n• Cloud Servers - It provides the cloud computing infrastructure.\n\
    • Cloud Sites - It allows the deployment of featured for web platforms supporting\
    \ multiple\nlanguages like PHP, Python, etc.\nOpen Stack\nOne of the most relevant\
    \ Open Source tools for providing Cloud Computing Services is\nOpenstack. This\
    \ technology was impulsed by Rackspace and currently has an active community\n\
    with thousands of members and sponsor companies. Openstack is more oriented to\
    \ provide IaaS\nand it has sub-projects that are in charge of the speciﬁc task\
    \ inside of the infrastructure. Fig 2.11\nshows the complete view of the component\
    \ of Openstack. However, this document describes only\nthe most relevant components\
    \ for providing a general perspective of these services.\nFigure 2.11 : Openstack\
    \ Cloud Stack [OpenStack 2021]\n• Nova - It is the piece in charge of the computing\
    \ service. Manage the virtual machines,\nsecurity groups, key-pairs, etc.\n• Glance\
    \ - It manage the system images. It is an image repository where new operating\n\
    systems and pre-conﬁgured virtual machines can be uploaded.\n• Cinder - This component\
    \ deals with the virtual data volumes. It provides the capability to\nadd persistence\
    \ to virtual machines.\n• Swift - It is in charge of the management of containers,\
    \ being a separated component from\nthe volumes.\n24\n2.3. MICROSERVICES\n• Neutron\
    \ - It is in charge of the networking operations of the infrastructure like virtual\n\
    networks, routers, sub-networks, etc.\n• Keystone - It is the Identity management\
    \ and a key component of Openstack. Additionally,\nIdentity management also provides\
    \ authentication and authorization capabilities to the\nplatform.\n2.3\nMicroservices\n\
    As was stated before, IoT and cloud computing are enabling technologies in smart\
    \ space. However,\ndue to the nature of the devices and systems presented in this\
    \ type of environment a technology\nstack that allows communicating the services\
    \ between them but keeps their working independence\nhas to be included. The technology\
    \ that promotes these features is called Microservices. In this\nsection, an introduction\
    \ about microservices is presented exploring the concept of this technology\n\
    and also his architecture, patterns, and the most widely adopted open source technologies\
    \ to build,\ndeploy and manage microservices. Finally, an overview of the different\
    \ orchestration systems for\nmicroservices technologies is presented.\n2.3.1\n\
    Introduction to Microservices\nAs is stated by many authors in the current literature,\
    \ Microservices is an architectural style\nadopted from the Software Oriented\
    \ Architectures (SOAs).\nFollowing SOA, a system is\nstructured by small independent\
    \ building blocks (microservices) that have full communication\nbetween them through\
    \ message passing [Lewis 2014, Dragoni 2017]. This concept is extended\nby [Jamshidi\
    \ 2018] where they state that \"Microservices are an architectural approach emerging\n\
    out of service-oriented architecture, emphasizing self-management and lightweightness\
    \ as the\nmeans to improve software agility, scalability, and autonomy\". Worded\
    \ differently, Microservices\nis a software architecture design pattern, where\
    \ large or complex applications are decomposed in\na small, independent process\
    \ using as a communication interface language-agnostic APIs. These\nservices are\
    \ characterized for being small-scale, highly decoupled, and focus on doing a\
    \ tiny task.\nThe principles where the microservices are build was presented by\
    \ [Dragoni 2017] as:\n• Bounded Context - Deﬁned as one of the main points of\
    \ microservices and it is focused\non business capabilities. It principle states\
    \ that related functionalities are combined into a\nsingle business capability,\
    \ being implemented as a service.\n• Size - Size is a key principle of microservices.\
    \ This principle states that if a service is too\nlarge, it must be divided or\
    \ distributed into two or more service if is needed.\n• Independency - This concept\
    \ promotes the decoupling of the service for providing to each of\nthem the operational\
    \ Independence from the other microservices and pushing that the way\nof interoperation\
    \ is over their message interfaces.\n25\nSTATE OF THE ART\nAdditionally, the principal\
    \ system features of microservices are:\n• Flexibility - This feature provides\
    \ the systems support and adaptation of any change that the\nbusinesses need to\
    \ adopt.\n• Modularity - Provides that every system component works independently\
    \ but each of these\ncomponents contributes to the whole system operation.\n•\
    \ Evolution - Stating that the system must be maintainable and support a constant\
    \ evolution\nfro adding new features.\n2.3.2\nMicroservices Architecture\nThe\
    \ best way to describe the microservices architecture is by presenting a good\
    \ example of how a\nservice can be decoupled by a set of microservices. A graphical\
    \ representation of this is shown in\nFig 2.12 on the right side of the picture\
    \ a monolith application is presented. A monolith application\nis described as\
    \ a single piece of software in where all the components of the application such\
    \ as\nuser interface, business logic, and data access are combined into a single\
    \ program. This application\nputs all its functionality into a single process,\
    \ and scale by replicating the monolith on multiple\nservers. On the other hand,\
    \ the left side presents how that monolith can be decoupled in a set\nof microservice\
    \ that even can be replicated in different platforms. A microservice architecture\n\
    puts each element of functionality into a separate service and scales by distributing\
    \ these services\nacross servers.\nMicroservices Patterns\nMany patterns are applied\
    \ to microservices for helping to determine how an application can be\ndecomposed\
    \ into microservices.\nIn this regard, [Richardson 2018] states an overview of\
    \ the\nsuggested patterns to build a microservices application. A brief description\
    \ of the most relevant\npatterns are the following:\n• Decomposition patters -\
    \ It provides some insights into how the system can be segmented\ninto microservices\
    \ and is divided in:\n– Decompose by business capability\n- It deﬁnes services\
    \ that match with business\ncapabilities. A business capability usually is aligned\
    \ to a business object, e.g. Order\nManagement is responsible for orders.\n– Decompose\
    \ by sub-domain - This is focused on the segmentation by Domain-Driven\nDesign\
    \ where each sub-domain corresponds to a different part of the business: Core\n\
    supporting and generic.\n• Database per Service pattern - Deﬁnes that a database\
    \ must be included with each service\nin order to ensure loose coupling.\n26\n\

    \ ago many technologies have been developed for allowing the use of microservices.\n\
    According to [Jamshidi 2018], since 2008 many technologies have been developed\
    \ and the\ntechnology stack has been continuously increased.\nIn Fig 2.13 the\
    \ evolution and waves that\npromote the development of new solutions for addressing\
    \ challenges microservices are presented.\nThis ﬁgure shows the apparition of\
    \ the ﬁrst lightweight container technologies (for example,\nLXC and Docker) to\
    \ the technologies that manage the most complex tasks like Orchestration\n(Kubernetes)\
    \ Serverless computing (AWS Web Service Lambda), and Service mesh (Istio). The\n\

    2.4.1\nIntroduction to Big Data\nSince 2001, many researchers have pointed the\
    \ challenges and opportunities about the increased\ndata with the 3V model, Volume,\
    \ Velocity, and Variety, which can be considered how the ﬁrst\ndeﬁnition of the\
    \ concept of Big Data [Laney 2001, Zikopoulos 2011, Beyer 2011],. However a\n\
    formal concept was not presented until 2011 in an IDC report in where they deﬁne\
    \ Big data as\n29\nSTATE OF THE ART\n\"big data technologies describe a new generation\
    \ of technologies and architectures, designed to\neconomically extract value from\
    \ very large volumes of a wide variety of data, by enabling the\nhigh-velocity\
    \ capture, discovery, and/or analysis\"[Gantz 2011]. Another deﬁnition that expands\n\
    the previous one was presented by [Wang 2020] a refers to large growing datasets\
    \ build from\nheterogeneous sources and formats: structured, unstructured, and\
    \ semi-structured data in where\nthe traditional technologies, methods, and theories\
    \ can not be used for presenting, processing and\nanalyzing this data. The characteristics\
    \ of Big Data have been evolving from the 3V’s after adding\nValue for building\
    \ the 4V’s and ﬁnally including the Veracity to built the 5V’s that nowadays\n\
    compose the current components of Big Data:\n• Volume - It deﬁnes as a huge amount\
    \ of data. In Big Data volume play’s a key role in\ndetermining the value of the\
    \ data. It is also the property that allows determining if some\nparticular data\
    \ can be considered as Big Data.\n• Velocity - This refers to the speed of the\
    \ data accumulation. In Big Data, many sources\ngenerate a massive and continuous\
    \ ﬂow of data.\n• Variety - It classiﬁes the data by its nature, which could be\
    \ structured like data with ﬁxed\nlength and format, semi-structured like logs,\
    \ and unstructured such as text, pictures, videos,\netc.\n• Veracity - It deals\
    \ with the inconsistency and uncertainty in data, due to the wide data\ndimension\
    \ obtained from multiple disparate data types and sources.\n• Value - It deﬁnes\
    \ the characteristic for extracting valuable information from the data because\n\
    data in itself is not valuable.\n2.4.2\nBig Data Architecture\nAccording to [Wang\
    \ 2020] Big Data service architecture is divided into three layers: Data\nCollecting\
    \ and Storage, Processing and Application Layer each of these layers have a set\
    \ of tools\nfor performing a speciﬁc task inside of the architecture.\nA graphical\
    \ representation of this\narchitecture is shown in Fig 2.14 in where the three\
    \ layers are presented and also the operation\nand component of each layer:\n\
    • Data Collecting and Storage - In this layer, all the operation of Extract, Transform\
    \ and\nLoad (ETL) are performed in order to use and capture the data coming from\
    \ different data\nsources: Batch as Relational and No Relational Databases and\
    \ also streaming data sources\nthought Distributed message systems or Data-ﬂow\
    \ Systems.\n• Processing - It provides the processing capabilities for batch,\
    \ streaming, hybrid, and graph\ndata processing through the Big data processing\
    \ frameworks designed for this purpose,\nincluding also machine learning.\n30\n\
    2.4. BIG DATA\n• Application - It is the layer in where all Big Data applications\
    \ that use the processed data or\nmachine learning models generated by the processing\
    \ layer are placed.\nAdditionally, a transverse layer for providing the infrastructure\
    \ for deploying the Big Data\nservice over the cloud (Saas, PaaS, IaaS) is included.\n\
    Figure 2.14 : Big Data Service Architecture [Wang 2020]\nCurrently, the most used\
    \ tools for each of the aforementioned layers are represented in Fig\n2.15 and\
    \ can be summarized as it follows:\nEvent Streaming and Dataﬂow Systems\nApache\
    \ Kafka gives a scalable, reliable, and durable\nshort-term storage of data, segmented\
    \ into topics (similar to traditional message queues), which\ncan be consumed\
    \ by downstream applications. This data can then be persisted into long-term\n\
    storage using Kafka Connect and consumed by the four streaming engines, Akka Streams,\
    \ Sparki,\nFlinkii, and Kafka Streams, which might write the results to new Kafka\
    \ topics. A way of more\nefﬁcient administration which includes different aspects\
    \ of transmission and reception of data is\nApache Niﬁiii, it supports powerful\
    \ and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation,\nand system mediation\
    \ logic. Another tool that provides similar functionality to Kafka but includes\n\

    31\nSTATE OF THE ART\ncontext management and a standardized way to manage the\
    \ events is called Orion context Broker\n(Orion). Orion GEi manages the entire\
    \ lifecycle of context information including updates, queries,\nregistrations,\
    \ and subscriptions. The Context Broker offers the FIWARE NGSI (Next Generation\n\
    Service Interface) [Open Mobile Alliance 2012] APIs and associated information\
    \ model (entity,\nattribute, metadata) as the main interface for sharing data\
    \ among stakeholders.\nStreaming & Machine Learning\nApache Spark is a widely\
    \ used, highly ﬂexible engine for\nbatch-mode and stream data processing that\
    \ is well suited for scalable performance at high\nvolumes. Spark’s capabilities\
    \ include SQL-based analytics, dataﬂow processing, such as for ETL\n(extract,\
    \ transform, and load), a rich library of built-in machine learning algorithms\
    \ (Spark\nMLlib), and third-party libraries, such as Intel’s BigDL for deep learning.\
    \ Spark’s streaming\nmodel is an average latency ’mini-batch model, where data\
    \ is captured in ﬁxed time windows,\nthen each batch is processed at once. Moreover,\
    \ Spark MLlib provides tools for common learning\nalgorithms (classiﬁcation, regression,\
    \ clustering, and collaborative ﬁltering), feature extraction\n(transformation,\
    \ dimensionality reduction, and selection), and tools for constructing, evaluating,\n\
    and tuning ML pipelines.\nStorage inside Big-Data\nBig Data Platform’s architecture\
    \ con be integrated with various SQL\nand NoSQL databases, distributed ﬁle systems\
    \ such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),\ncloud-based object stores such\
    \ as AWS S3, and search technologies such as Elasticsearch.\nStorage\nDatabase\
    \ Management Systems (DBMS) are composed by a group of database used in\napplications\
    \ [Vargas 2014] as Relational Database (RDBMS) MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle,\netc.,\
    \ No-Relational Database (NoSQL) Mongo, Neo4j, Cassandra, etc. Additionally, new\
    \ DBMSs\nhave been released for generating values, decisions and statistics applied\
    \ to research and\nenterprise such as Elasticsearchii. With the use of Big Data,\
    \ now also logs are another important\nasset that is processed by applications.\
    \ This type of processing the identiﬁcation and resolution of\nmany security and\
    \ ICT failures [Kreps 2014].\n2.4.3\nData Engineering\nNowadays, it is very well\
    \ known that data is considered a very valuable asset. Technologies\nlike IoT,\
    \ Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Microservices have become in a complete stack\
    \ for\ngenerating, processing, and deploying many applications that use data as\
    \ a core component. Since\niFIWARE Orion:https://ﬁware-orion.readthedocs.io\n\
    iiwww.elastic.co/\n32\n2.4. BIG DATA\nFigure 2.15 : Big Data Tools Architecture\
    \ Representation\nevery one of these systems also generates new data and it is\
    \ an asset that is ﬂowing every day and\nevery moment, a new concept called Data\
    \ Engineering has emerged.\nData engineering is considered as a subdiscipline\
    \ of Big Data that focuses speciﬁcally on the\ntransportation, transformation,\
    \ and storage of the data. The main goal of Data Engineering is to\nenable organized,\
    \ consistent data ﬂow to provides data-driven work like Training machine learning\n\
    models, doing exploratory data analysis, and populate the ﬁeld in an application\
    \ outside the data\n[Stratis 2021].\nThis data ﬂow can be achieved by different\
    \ methods, and speciﬁc tools, techniques, and skills.\nOne of the key patterns\
    \ that data engineering introduces is the Data Pipeline. This is a system that\n\
    consists of independent programs that do various operations on incoming or collected\
    \ data. The\nprocess of pipeline creation is not trivial in most cases due to\
    \ the nature of the big data system it can\ninvolve 10 to 30 different Big Data\
    \ technologies working together. This leads the responsibilities\n33\nSTATE OF\
    \ THE ART\nto the optimal tool selection to the Data engineers which are who possess\
    \ the knowledge for\nunderstanding the various technologies and frameworks in-depth,\
    \ and how to combine them to\ncreate solutions to enable a company’s business\
    \ processes with data pipelines [Furbush 2018].\nFigure 2.16 : Data Engineering\
    \ Pipeline Example [GoogleCloud 2021]\nMoreover, Data engineering is focused on\
    \ the production readiness of that data and all that\ncomes with it: formats,\
    \ scaling, resilience, security, and more. The principal areas where data\nengineering\
    \ is focused are:\n• Data Flow - It refers to the building of the complete pipeline\
    \ for designing a system that\ncan take this data as input from one or many sources,\
    \ transform it, and then store it for their\ncustomers. Worded differently, This\
    \ is focused on the ETL process.\n• Data Normalization and Modelling - This part\
    \ of the process is focused on normalizing the\ndata to make the data more accessible\
    \ to the users. It involves: removes duplications, ﬁx\nconﬂicting data, and conforming\
    \ data to a speciﬁc data model. This process includes the\nnormalization and standardization\
    \ of the data sources and storing the normalized data in a\ndatabase system. Data\
    \ normalization and modelling are usually part of the transform step\nof ETL,\
    \ but they’re not the only ones in this category. Another common transformative\
    \ step\nis data cleaning.\n34\n2.5. CONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS\n• Data Cleaning - This\
    \ works together with the Data Normalization process But while data\nnormalization\
    \ is mostly focused on making disparate data conform to some data model, data\n\
    cleaning includes several actions that make the data more uniform and complete.\n\
    • Data Accessibility - This refers to how clear is the data available for the\
    \ customers, it does\nnot involve too many operations like the previous ones but\
    \ deﬁnes how the pipeline should\nbe deﬁned according to the customers like Data\
    \ Scientist, Analytic teams, or product teams.\nDue to data accessibility is closely\
    \ tied to how data is stored, it’s a major component of the\nload step of ETL,\
    \ which refers to how data is stored for later use.\nOn the other hand, Data engineering\
    \ is focused on some areas that involve knowledge in\nGeneral Programming concepts,\
    \ Databases, Big data, Microservices, distributed systems, and\ncloud computing.\
    \ All of these technologies involved allow us to build very complex tasks. One\n\
    example of that is shown in Fig 2.16 in where a pipeline for deﬁning a Machine\
    \ learning process\nfor data collection, processing, machine learning, and system\
    \ application is displayed.\n2.5\nContext-Aware Systems\nIn this section, I present\
    \ a review of the concept of Context-Aware systems pointing out the key\ncharacteristics,\
    \ architecture, and how these types of systems have been integrated with the\n\
    previously mentioned technologies: IoT, Could Computing and Big Data in order\
    \ to present a\nnew generation of Context-Aware Systems centered in IoT. This\
    \ overview provides a strong\nbackground for understanding one of the main contributions\
    \ of this thesis, the design and\nimplementation of Big Data Framework for Context-Aware\
    \ Systems in Smart Spaces.\n2.5.1\nIntroduction to Context-Aware Systems\nIn order\
    \ to provide an accurate concept about Context-Aware Systems, ﬁrst is needed to\
    \ understand\nthe concept of Context. Context is deﬁned by [Abowd 1999] \"any\
    \ information that can be used\nto characterize the situation of an entity where\
    \ an entity can be a person, place, or object that is\nconsidered relevant to\
    \ the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and\n\
    applications themselves\". The same author also deﬁnes a Context-Aware System\
    \ as the system\nthat uses context to provide relevant information or services\
    \ depending on the user tasks. Other\ndescriptions available in the literature\
    \ point that Context-Aware Systems are systems that can use\ncontext for performing\
    \ intelligent or smart actions [Alegre 2016]. According to [Hong 2009] one\nof\
    \ the goals of the Context-Aware Systems is to capture and process the information\
    \ in the context\nof a device to provide services build on a particular people,\
    \ place, time, event. etc. Worded\ndifferently Context-aware systems capture context,\
    \ analyze and interpret the context, and make\nadjustments to the system behavior\
    \ for the user’s changing situation without explicit intervention\nfrom the user.\n\
    35\nSTATE OF THE ART\n2.5.2\nContext Information Handling\nA good structure of\
    \ how context-awareness can be enable was presented by [Alegre 2016] where\nthey\
    \ state that Context-Aware systems need to separate the process of how the context\
    \ is captured\nfrom how it is used. This approach allows applications to be able\
    \ to use contextual information\nwithout concerning the speciﬁc details of devices\
    \ or how it was implemented. A lot of literature\nis available about the techniques\
    \ for context information management [Perera 2013] these\nresearches permit to\
    \ build a reference for deﬁning the life cycle of context information presenting\n\
    the following requirements:\n• Acquisition - It reefers to the operations that\
    \ need to be included for gathering the context\ninformation. This is not a trivial\
    \ phase, because, information comes from multiple devices\nand systems making\
    \ imperative the need to build and provide scalable systems that not only\ncapture\
    \ these data but also that have the capability to avoid overlapping contradictory\
    \ or\nmissing data.\n• Modelling - The next phase after capturing the information\
    \ is modelling. This phase is\nwhere the information is translated into usable\
    \ values through the use of real-world concepts\nin modelling constructs. These\
    \ models require to represent any kind of information into\nentities and relations,\
    \ providing uniquely contextual information, context, and entities.\n• Reasoning\
    \ - Using the modeled data, this phase is in where different type of conclusions\n\
    can be obtained or inferred. This process usually is conformed by three stages:\
    \ Context pre-\nprocessing, for cleaning the data to get rid of the non-desirable\
    \ values. Device data fusion\nis where the data from multiple data sources is\
    \ combined from producing more accurate\ninformation, and Context Inference, from\
    \ low-level information to high level one, IN this\nphase is where different techniques\
    \ like fuzzy logic, rule bases reasoning, machine learning\nare applicable.\n\
    • Dissemination - Finally, this phase is in where all the information is distributed\
    \ to the\nconsumer considering both the low level and high level. One of the most\
    \ desirable features\nis that the context information could be distributed in\
    \ real-time.\nMoreover, security and privacy concerns need to be addressed due\
    \ to the proper nature of\ncontext information to provide the right balance between\
    \ privacy and system potential.\n2.5.3\nAbstract Architecture of Context-Aware\
    \ Systems\nOne architecture proposal for Context-Aware Systems was stated by [Baldauf\
    \ 2007] they\npresented a conceptual framework segmented by ﬁve layers:\nsensors,\
    \ raw data retrieval,\npre-processing, storage and management, and application.\n\
    On the other hand, [Hong 2009]\npresents an abstract architecture of this type\
    \ of system based on a review of the literature\n36\n2.6. ACCESS CONTROL\navailable\
    \ at that moment. That proposal of four layers architecture was presented involving\
    \ the\nfollowing layers: Network, Middleware, Application, and User Infrastructure.\
    \ The second of that\nproposals show a better way for representing these systems.\
    \ However, these proposals still lack\ncovering the integration of new devices\
    \ like IoT and also security aspects. A more recent study\nwas conducted by [Symeonaki\
    \ 2020] in where they were focused on providing a context-aware\nmiddleware cloud\
    \ approach for integrating precision farming facilities into the IoT toward\n\
    agriculture 4.0.\nThis proposal also presented the conceptual architecture of\
    \ Context-Aware\nSystems divided into three layers: Physical Layer, Middleware\
    \ layer, and Application layer.\nDespite the last architecture shows a good level\
    \ of abstraction of the conceptual model, this\nproposal was presented for a scenario\
    \ Precision Farming leading its application only to that speciﬁc\nﬁeld.\n• Physical\
    \ Interface - This ﬁrst layer corresponds to the interface for managing the different\n\
    data sources that not only cover the physical devices like, sensors, actuators,\
    \ IoT devices, etc\nbut also the data generated by other systems like AI and web\
    \ applications, REST systems,\netc.\n• Middleware - The second layer named middleware\
    \ is composed of two segments for one\nside the Context Management which provides\
    \ the Context-Aware services involved in the\nacquisition storage and manipulation\
    \ of the context data and for the other side is also\nincluded the Context processing\
    \ that is in were is placed all the components in charge of\nproviding all the\
    \ Big Data processing and machine learning capabilities for managing the\ndata\
    \ coming from the different sources and as a result being capable of providing\
    \ the\nknowledge discovery phase.\n• Application - The application layer is which\
    \ provides the interface to the applications and\nservices that it can be provided\
    \ to the different users and entities depending on the ﬁeld of\noperation.\n•\
    \ Security - Finally, a transverse layer is included to provide security at authentication\
    \ and\nauthorization level for the whole components that are part of the context-aware\
    \ systems\ncovering and protecting the three previously mentioned layers.\n2.6\n\
    Access Control\nAccess Control (AC) refers to a technique that determines who\
    \ a user is and what are the\noperation that the users are allowed to do over\
    \ some determining system or resource\n[Sandhu 1994]. Access Control allows that\
    \ authorized users have access to determined resources\nand ensure that those\
    \ authorized users are not banned from such access [Yuan 2005]. The ﬂow of\nthe\
    \ processes involved in access control is deﬁned by the following sequence and\
    \ operations:\nIdentiﬁcation, Authentication, and Authorization.\nTraditionally,\
    \ larger systems security was\n37\nSTATE OF THE ART\nsimpliﬁed by the use of Role-Based\
    \ Access Control (RBAC), a policy mechanism deﬁned around\nroles and privileges.\
    \ This approach improves the scalability of other models like Identity-Based\n\
    Access Control (IBAC) which is based on the authenticated identity of an individual\n\
    [Coyne 1996]. Another method of AC is Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) this\
    \ model\nsolves the issue of managing a high number of rules through the generation\
    \ of dynamic access\npolicies.\n2.6.1\nAccess Control Models\nCurrently, there\
    \ are a considerable number of access control models. This review is it showed\
    \ a\nbrief description of the most used access control model: Role-Based Access\
    \ Control (RBAC) and\nAttribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):\n• Role-Based Access\
    \ Control (RBAC) - Due to its simplicity this model is used for a huge\nnumber\
    \ of applications. This model turns all of his features over the concept of a\
    \ role. A\nrole a set of permissions over speciﬁc resources. Permissions grant\
    \ or restrict what the user\ncan access.\n• Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)\
    \ - In contrast to RBAC, ABAC deﬁnes the operations\nover resource attributes\
    \ and environment attributes instead of roles. Due to this reason, the\nABAC model\
    \ allows the deﬁnition of more ﬁne-grained permissions over resources but is\n\
    needed to consider that this can increase the complexity at the time of deﬁning\
    \ rules and\npermissions.\n2.6.2\nXACML\nThe models commented in the previous\
    \ section allow conceptualizing how to perform access\ncontrol. However, they\
    \ do not specify a software architecture or a policy language to accomplish\n\
    that mission. The principal standard for deﬁning and enforcing access control\
    \ policies is the one\ncreated\nby\nOASIS:\nXACML\n(eXtensible\nAccess\nControl\n\
    Markup\nLanguage)\n[OASIS Standard 1994].\nThis standard mainly implements ABAC\
    \ or RBAC access control\nmodels. However, it can be extended or modiﬁed to provide\
    \ other models, such as UCON, as\nchapter 4.2 shows.\nThe XACML standard provides\
    \ the language for deﬁning the policies based on the XML\nmarkup language. The\
    \ language allows creating policies as a set of rules, including targets and\n\
    conditions. It also provides the architecture for enforcing the rules. Fig 2.17\
    \ broadly describes the\nprincipal elements and how they interact.\n38\n2.7. USAGE\
    \ CONTROL\nFigure 2.17 : XACML Architecture\n• Policy Administration Point (PAP)\
    \ - This provides the capabilities for creating and managing\nthe XACML policies.\
    \ Also, it provides an interface for being used by the PDP.\n• Policy Enforcement\
    \ Point (PEP) - This component is in charge of enforces the decisions\nprovided\
    \ by the PDP including grant or deny access to a speciﬁc resource.\n• Policy Decision\
    \ Point (PDP) - It evaluates access requests against authorization policies\n\
    before issuing access decisions.\n• Policy Information Point (PIP) - This is the\
    \ system entity that acts as a source of information\nand interacts with the resource,\
    \ subject, and environment.\n2.7\nUsage Control\nIn the scope of Usage Control,\
    \ the Usage Control model (UCON) stated by Sandhu and Park\n[Sandhu 2003] was\
    \ presented as a new framework for providing not only traditional data Access\n\
    Control but also enabling the control of the data during and after the usage.\
    \ The UCON model\nextends the traditional Access Control models, not only by introducing\
    \ new concepts of mutability\napplicable to attributes of subjects and objects\
    \ but also by providing a new way of guaranteeing\nthe continuity of policy enforcement.\
    \ Moreover, UCON presents a family of ABC models built\naround three decision\
    \ factors: authorizations (A), obligations (B) and conditions (C), which can all\n\
    be used for pre-decision and ongoing decisions. As a complementary part of the\
    \ conceptualization\nof UCON, one of the formal model proposals of policies aligned\
    \ with Usage Control is presented\nby [Bettini 2003], in which they attach two\
    \ sets of predicates, namely provisions and obligations.\n• Provisions - These\
    \ are concerned with the pre decision phase (past and present),\ncorresponding\
    \ to the traditional Access Control.\n39\nSTATE OF THE ART\n• Obligations - These\
    \ deal with the rules applied to the future use of data and are related\nto the\
    \ ongoing decision phase which, instead, is executed after the access is initiated\
    \ and\nimplements the continuity of control over the data.\nFig 2.18 shows in\
    \ a) graphical representation of UCON model and b) the provisions and\nobligations\
    \ in a timeline.\nFigure 2.18 : UCON model\nUsage control is a promising approach\

    \ computer environments. It encompasses and enhances traditional access\ncontrol\
    \ models, Trust Management (TM) and Digital Rights Management (DRM), and its main\n\
    novelties are mutability of attributes and continuity of access decision evaluation.\

    Chapter 3\nContext-Aware Systems and Data Analytics for Smart Spaces\n3.1\nIntroduction\n\
    As I stated in the introduction of chapter 1 at this time, one of the most promising\
    \ application\nﬁelds of context-aware systems is that of IoT-based (Internet of\
    \ Things) smart spaces, and further\nof IoT devices, IoT-based smart spaces include\
    \ software platforms and services, artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI), machine learning\
    \ (ML), big data, cloud computing, heterogeneous connectivity,\nvirtual/mixed\
    \ realities, and a huge range of technologies to improve people’s quality of life,\
    \ to\ndecrease environmental impact, and to optimize the use of physical resources\
    \ [Alberti 2019].\nSince context-aware systems may include data from multiple\
    \ sources and, at the same time, a\nsingle data source may be used for multiple\
    \ applications, they need to separate the process of\nhow the context is captured\
    \ from how it is used, as pointed out by [Alegre 2016]. By so doing,\napplications\
    \ may use contextual information without accounting for the speciﬁc details of\
    \ devices\nor how they have been implemented. This is of special relevance in\
    \ IoT-based smart spaces.\nMoreover, context-aware systems need to consider the\
    \ security and privacy aspects of data,\nproviding the right balance between privacy\
    \ and system potential. A number of prior works have\nprovided frameworks and\
    \ architectures for designing context-aware systems. However a huge\nnumber of\
    \ the existing works often provide a generic high-level structure of how a context-aware\n\
    system can be operationalized, but do not offer many clues on how to implement\
    \ it. On the other\nhand, there are many implementations of context-aware systems\
    \ applied to speciﬁc IoT-based\nsmart spaces use cases (e.g., smart farming, smart\
    \ cities).\nHowever, although these\nimplementations are context-aware, they are\
    \ also context-speciﬁc: it is not clear how they can be\nextended to other use\
    \ cases.\nIn this chapter, I provide an architecture and a reference implementation\
    \ that can be used in\nany context-aware system development of an IoT-based smart\
    \ space. For that purpose, I rely on the\nbuilding blocks of the FIWARE ecosystem,\
    \ providing an agnostic end-to-end solution that takes\ninto consideration the\
    \ complete data lifecycle, ﬁlling the existing gap in the literature. In other\n\
    words, the architecture can be readily operationalized in any IoT-based smart\
    \ space regardless of\nits ﬁeld of application, providing a context-aware solution\
    \ that is not context-speciﬁc. I provide\ntwo sample application scenarios that\
    \ showcase how this proposal can be used in a variety of ﬁelds,\ncovering from\
    \ data acquisition and modelling, to data reasoning and dissemination.\nThe remaining\
    \ of the chapter is structured as follows. Next section shows the objectives and\n\
    research questions of this thesis covered by this chapter. Section 3.3 presents\
    \ the related work on\ncontext-aware systems and their speciﬁc application to\
    \ IoT-based smart spaces.\nSection 3.4\nCONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS\
    \ FOR SMART SPACES\npresents an overview of the conceptual representation of the\
    \ architecture and the description of\neach of its layers.\nSection 3.5 shows\
    \ the implementation of the previous architecture using\nFIWARE GE’s including\
    \ the data modelling and the building blocks. Section 3.6 describes two\nexample\
    \ application scenarios in which the posed implementation has been operationalized.\n\
    Lastly, Section 3.7 presents the conclusions of the chapter and proposes some\
    \ lines of future\nwork.\n3.2\nObjectives\nThe two objectives of this chapter\
    \ are:\n1. Deﬁne a conceptual model of context-aware systems adapted to smart\
    \ spaces\n2. Propose an architecture and a reference implementation for enabling\
    \ context-aware data\nanalytics in Smart Spaces\nIn this chapter, I provide a\
    \ conceptual architecture and its posterior implementation that can\nbe used in\
    \ any context-aware system development of an IoT-based smart space. For that purpose,\
    \ I\nrely on the building blocks of the FIWARE ecosystem, providing an agnostic\
    \ end-to-end solution\nthat takes into consideration the complete data lifecycle,\
    \ ﬁlling the existing gap in the literature.\nThis chapter also covers the following\
    \ research questions:\n• What should be the design characteristics of an architecture\
    \ capable of enabling context-\naware data analytics in smart spaces?\n• How can\
    \ advanced data processing and machine learning techniques be integrated into\
    \ the\naforementioned architecture?\nThese questions are answered based on the\
    \ results of the implementation and the use cases\npresented.\n3.3\nRelated Work\n\
    3.3.1\nContext-aware systems architectures\nResearchers have diverging opinions\
    \ when it comes to how to structure a context-aware system.\nIn the work by [Baldauf\
    \ 2007], the authors presented a conceptual framework for context-aware\nsystems\
    \ segmented into ﬁve layers: sensors, raw data retrieval, pre-processing, storage\
    \ and\nmanagement, and application. Not long after, the authors of [Hong 2009]\
    \ presented an abstract\narchitecture for context-aware systems based on a thorough\
    \ review of the literature, in which four\nlayers were included: network, middleware,\
    \ application, and user infrastructure. Although the\nlatter proposal shows a\
    \ more generalizable way of representing context-aware systems, both of\nthem\
    \ fail to cover the integration of new devices like IoT and to take into consideration\
    \ the\n44\n3.3. RELATED WORK\nsecurity aspects.\nA more recent study by [Symeonaki\
    \ 2020] presented a context-aware\nmiddleware cloud approach for integrating precision\
    \ farming facilities into the IoT toward\nagriculture 4.0.\nThis proposal also\
    \ presented the conceptual architecture of context-aware\nsystems divided into\
    \ three layers:\nphysical layer, middleware layer, and application layer.\nAlthough\
    \ this last proposal shows a higher level of abstraction of the conceptual model,\
    \ it was\ncontextualized in the ﬁeld of Precision Farming and its operationalization\
    \ was limited only to that\nscenario.\nAlthough the number of layers in which\
    \ context-aware architectures are segmented differs\nacross the literature, most\
    \ of them share the same key elements combined in different\nconﬁgurations. For\
    \ example, in the works mentioned above, the sensors and raw data retrieval\n\
    layers proposed by [Baldauf 2007] are equivalent to the network layer proposed\
    \ by [Hong 2009]\nand to the physical layer described in [Symeonaki 2020].\nRegardless\
    \ of how the different\nelements in the architecture are organized, a crucial\
    \ aspect to take into account is data\nstandardization, which provides an effective\
    \ communication mechanism between the different\nlayers and also with the outside\
    \ or complementary systems.\n3.3.2\nImplementations of context-aware systems to\
    \ IoT-based smart environments\nA burgeoning number of implementations of context-aware\
    \ IoT-based smart environments have\nbeen developed in the last decades. In the\
    \ case of Smart Transportation, proposals like Taxi-aware\nmap [Phithakkitnukoon\
    \ 2010] present the development of context-aware systems for identifying\nand\
    \ predicting vacant taxis in the city, based on three parameters: time of the\
    \ day, day, and weather\nconditions. These systems use contextual information\
    \ provided by a historical record of data stored\nin a database, for building\
    \ an inference engine, using a naive Bayesian classiﬁer to make the\npredictions.\
    \ For building the predictor, a dataset with GPS traces of 150 taxis in Lisbon-Portugal\n\
    was used. As a result, they provide a system able to predict the number of vacant\
    \ taxis in a 1x1 km2\narea with a 0.8% error rate. Additionally, the authors of\
    \ [Dobre 2014] present a platform designed\nto automate the process of collecting\
    \ and aggregating context information at a large scale. They\nintegrate services\
    \ for collecting context data like location, users’ proﬁle and environmental and\n\
    validate that platform through the implementation of an intelligent transportation\
    \ system to assist\nusers and city ofﬁcials better understand trafﬁc problems\
    \ in large cities. They use domain-speciﬁc\nontologies to describe events, dates,\
    \ locations, user activities, and relations with other people and\nobjects. Also,\
    \ a set of XML-based format rules are deﬁned for triggering a series of actions\
    \ when\ncertain conditions are met. The most recent work was provided in [Liu\
    \ 2020]. In this article, a\nrecommendation system that offers multi-modal transportation\
    \ planning and is adaptive to various\nsituational contexts is presented. They\
    \ use multi-source urban context data as an input to deﬁne\ntwo recommendation\
    \ models using gradient boosting decision tree and deep learning algorithms\n\
    for building multi-modal and uni-modal transportation routes. They conclude that\
    \ their extensive\nevaluations on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness\
    \ and efﬁciency of that proposal.\n45\nCONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS\
    \ FOR SMART SPACES\nAlthough the previous works present suitable proposals of\
    \ context-aware systems in the ﬁeld of\nsmart transportation, they also provide\
    \ some insights into the challenges that need to be addressed.\nScalability is\
    \ one of the most relevant concerns expressed in those articles. The need to provide\n\
    ways to not only capture context but also processing it efﬁciently must be considered.\
    \ Another\nimportant challenge identiﬁes is the need of unifying the way to capture\
    \ and store the data, every\nof the presented proposal uses its methods and structure\
    \ for dealing with this topic, as a result,\nmany compatibility issues can be\
    \ derived from this in case that many systems need to share data\nor coordinate\
    \ between them.\nMoreover, context-aware systems have been operationalized in\
    \ the development of smart\nhomes and smart buildings. The authors of [Najem 2017]\
    \ presented a context-aware wireless\nsensors system for IoT-centric energy-efﬁcient\
    \ campuses. They used context-based reasoning\nmodels for deﬁning transition rules\
    \ and triggering to reduce the energy consumption on a\nuniversity campus. Another\
    \ study [Hangli 2018] described a proposal for creating an elevator\nsystem in\
    \ smart buildings capable of reducing the passenger waiting time by preregistering\n\
    elevator calls using context information. This system captures the context data\
    \ of the location of\nthe passenger and based on a 3D localization model makes\
    \ automatic preregistration to the\nelevator considering the distance between\
    \ the passenger and the elevator. These two proposals\nare only two examples of\
    \ how context-aware systems play a key role in any space considered\nsmart. However,\
    \ these two proposals present some ﬂaws in terms of how heterogeneous and\nunstructured\
    \ data are managed.\nOne of the most widespread uses of context-aware systems\
    \ is in Smart Industry, speciﬁcally\nin Smart Farming. In [Dobrescu 2019], the\
    \ authors present a context-aware platform serving as\nmiddleware mechanism for\
    \ interfacing environmental sensors with IoT and Cloud for providing\nreal-time\
    \ process control agriculture application.\nTo achieve that goal, they combine\
    \ many\nsoftware platforms and tools, such as IBM Bluemix IoT form managing the\
    \ IoT data, a Java\napplication form data acquisition and storing in the cloud,\
    \ and a C# application for handling\nstored data. One of the most novel approaches\
    \ was presented in [Symeonaki 2020], in which a\ncomplete framework is proposed\
    \ including a middleware service that acts as a decision support\nsystem for the\
    \ entire framework. Moreover, several reviews of the IoT technologies used in\n\
    agriculture\nhave\nbeen\nperformed\nin\nthe\nlast\nfew\nyears\n[Gómez-Chabla 2019,\
    \ Khanna 2019, Symeonaki 2019, Madushanki 2019].\nThese reviews\nconcluded that,\
    \ despite the fact that IoT technologies are continuously advancing and promoting\n\
    the creation of novel agricultural applications and services, some critical issues\
    \ concerning the\ninteroperability as well as the semantic annotation of heterogeneous\
    \ data need to be addressed.\nTo that end, in recent years, many efforts have\
    \ been developed not only for providing semantic\nand interoperability within\
    \ this type of environment but also for including the data models,\nuniﬁed standards,\
    \ vocabularies, connectors, and platforms.\nMany of these efforts have been\n\
    materialized\nas\ndifferent\nproposals\nfor\ndifferent\napplication\nscenarios\n\

    \ thing in common, they consider the use of FIWARE as an enabler open-source\n\
    platform for providing context management, storage, data analytics, and security\
    \ for each of their\nservices.\nTable 3.1 : Summary of context-aware applications\

    \ I present a conceptual overview of the proposed architecture.\nThe complete\n\
    architecture turns around NGSI-LD as enabling standard for proving data harmonization,\n\
    contextual acquisition, storage, reasoning, representation, and systems integration\
    \ in smart\nspaces. I state an overview of NGSI-LD key aspects. Afterward, I describe\
    \ Smart data models as\na reference data structure for managing NGSI-LD representation\
    \ of contextual data. With all of\nthis background in the following subsections,\
    \ I present the conceptual view of the proposed\narchitecture providing a description\
    \ of every layer stating all of the services and systems that each\nof them provides\
    \ to the whole architecture.\nFinally, a materialization of the conceptual\narchitecture\
    \ is presented using FIWARE generic enablers and big data open-source tools for\n\
    providing a standardized and interoperable context-aware system in smart spaces.\n\
    3.4.1\nData Standardization\nModelling data is a key aspect for building context-aware\
    \ systems. This phase is required because\ndeﬁning predeﬁned data models allows\
    \ to merge data, which may come from different origins, in a\n47\nCONTEXT-AWARE\
    \ SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\nunique and understandable format;\
    \ and it eases the integration with other external systems. When\nmodelling data,\
    \ there are two main alternatives: (1) developing a new data model for each context\n\
    entity, or (2) modelling the data using data models widely extended in the industry.\
    \ The second\noption is preferable because it eases the integration with external\
    \ systems, and it is less error-\nprone as these data models are, in most cases,\
    \ developed by standards organizations and validated\nby the developers community.\
    \ In this section, I propose the NGSI-LD standard for modelling the\ndata in this\
    \ reference implementation. I further propose using available smart data models\
    \ to ease\ninteroperability with other systems existing in the industry.\n3.4.2\n\
    NGSI-LD\nThe Next Generation Service Interfaces-Linked Data (NGSI-LD) API (Application\
    \ Programming\nInterfaces) is an evolution of the NGSI interface for managing\
    \ context information following the\nprinciples of linked data. It was standardized\
    \ by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards\nInstitute) with the aim of integrating\
    \ the NGSI entities in the semantic web. The API deﬁnes a set\nof HTTP methods\
    \ for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities.\nIn NGSIv2, context\
    \ information is modelled as a set of entities (i.e., a representation of a real\n\
    object). An entity is determined generically by its type (e.g., Building) and\
    \ speciﬁcally by its\nidentiﬁer (e.g., Building:1). The state of the entity is\
    \ modelled with attributes which include the\nname of the attribute (e.g., height),\
    \ the type (e.g., Integer), and the value (e.g., 30). Lastly, the\nattributes\
    \ can be enhanced with metadata, including again its name (e.g., unitCode), type\
    \ (e.g.,\nString), and value (e.g., FOOT). Consequently, it resulted in a rigid\
    \ model, difﬁcult to integrate\nwith external systems with their own deﬁnition\
    \ of each entity (e.g., Building2).\nIn contrast,\nNGSI-LD was developed to increase\
    \ interoperability and enable to build a graph of knowledge\nthrough the establishment\
    \ of relationships. In the NGSI-LD case, the center piece of context\ninformation\
    \ is again the entity, which is deﬁned by its type (e.g., Building) and its identiﬁer\
    \ (e.g.,\nurn:ngsi-ld:Building1). The difference from NGSIv2 is that both the\
    \ identiﬁer and the entity type\nare identiﬁed unequivocally by URIs. In NGSI-LD,\
    \ there are not attributes: instead, there are\nproperties (e.g.,\nheight with\
    \ value 30) and relationships (e.g.,\nhasParking with value\nurn:ngsi-ld:Parking1),\
    \ deﬁned with URIs too. In the case of NGSI-LD there are no metadata for\nproperties,\
    \ but instead there can be properties of properties, relationships of properties,\
    \ properties\nof relationships, and relationships of relationships. Based on a\
    \ set of entities, along with their\nproperties and relationships, an RDF graph\
    \ can be established composed by triples in the form of:\n<subject (URI or blank\
    \ node)> <predicate (URI)> <object (URI,\nliteral, or blank node)>\nwith the following\
    \ possible structures:\n<entity> <property> <value>;\n<entity> <relationship>\
    \ <entity>;\nand the mentioned variants:\n48\n3.4. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\n<property>\
    \ <property> <value>;\n<property> <relationship> <entity>;\n<relationship> <property>\
    \ <value>;\n<relationship> <relationship> <entity>.\nSmart Data Models\nThe FIWARE\
    \ Smart Data models i is an initiative that aims to integrate reference data models\n\
    with the NGSI-LD API. As I mentioned above, the NGSI-LD API is agnostic to its\
    \ domain of\napplication, in other words, it provides the mechanisms to access\
    \ context information but it does\nnot deﬁnes how the context information is modelled.\
    \ This initiative is impulsed by the FIWARE\nFoundation ii in collaboration with\
    \ other institutions as TM Forum iii, IUDX iv, or OASC v. All\nthe data models\
    \ are public and they grant the adopters adopters the rights All the data models\
    \ are\npublic and they grant the adopters the rights of free using, free modifying,\
    \ and free sharing the\nmodiﬁcations. Multiple institutions are participating\
    \ in this initiative both publishing new data\nmodels (e.g., Atos vi, Telefónica\
    \ vii, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid viii), and validating them\nthrough their\
    \ adoption in real projects (e.g., KWR Water Research Institue ix, Métropole Nice\n\
    Côte d’Azur x, National Technical University of Athens xi). Smart data models\
    \ are compliant with\nboth NGSIv2 and NGSI-LD, coded in JSON and JSON-LD, respectively.\
    \ The structure of the data\nmodels is hierarchical, divided into three levels:\n\
    • Data Model - It is the lowest level.\nA data model is deﬁned by its schema which\n\
    determines the structure of its NGSI properties and relationships. The schema\
    \ is coded\nwith the JSON Schema vocabulary xii which allows to ensure if the\
    \ payload ﬁts the model\ndeﬁnition. This JSON Schema enables to set restrictions\
    \ on the data types of properties and\nrelationships, and determine the list of\
    \ properties and relationships which are compulsory.\nA data model deﬁnition is\

    \ a\ncommon schema for all of them.\n• Domain - It is the highest level, it is\
    \ an umbrella for subjects divided by sectors. Examples\nof domains are Smart\

    \ deﬁned spread over more than 40 different\nsubjects which compound 11 domains\
    \ (e.g., Smart Cities, Smart Energy, Smart AgriFood, Smart\nAeronautics). All\
    \ data models are published on GitHub i. Every domain has a repository with\n\
    pointers to its subjects, and every subject has a repository with its data models\
    \ deﬁnition. There\nare three special repositories: data-models ii, incubated\
    \ iii, and harmonization iv. The ﬁrst, includes\ntemplates for how to build a\
    \ new data model; the second, data models under development; and the\nthird, data\
    \ models that have to be updated. All data models follow the same life-cycle which\
    \ is\ncomposed by three states:\n• Incubation - If it does not exist a smart data\
    \ model that represents an entity, it should be\ncreated.\nThere are two possibilities\
    \ offered to the developers, (1) work on their own\nrepository, or (2) ask for\
    \ permission to work in the ofﬁcial incubated repository.\nThe\nsecond option\
    \ is recommended by the community because it enhances collaboration. At\nthis\
    \ point, the developers have to write the schema and examples of payloads in different\n\
    formats (JSON for NGSIv2, and JSON-LD for NGSI-LD). For these tasks, the initiative\n\
    provides a set of tools that help developers to write and validate the schema,\
    \ and to create\nand validate payloads compliant with the schema deﬁnition. From\
    \ this information, other\ndocuments are generated automatically (speciﬁcations,\
    \ license, swagger ﬁles, etc.).\n• Harmonization - A data model relies on this\
    \ state when it has been approved but it has to be\ncompleted or curated.\n• Ofﬁcial\
    \ publication - The process of publication of a new data model depends on the\n\
    existence or not of the subject and the domain which the data model belongs. If\
    \ both exist,\nthe contributor can make a pull request directly to the ofﬁcial\
    \ subject repository. In other\ncases, a new subject and/or domain has to be created\
    \ in the incubation repository before\npublishing. When a data model is published,\
    \ it is considered an ofﬁcial smart data model\niSmart Data Models GitHub organization:\

    \ the authorship of contributors and adopters\nare included.\n3.4.3\nArchitecture\n\
    As discussed in section 3.3 context-aware systems usually present an architecture\
    \ divided into a\nfew layers. Depending on the ﬁeld of application these layers\
    \ can be expanded or redistributed.\nHowever, in the case of smart spaces, a wide\
    \ range of data sources and systems are involved, even\none of the problems that\
    \ are currently presented in this type of ecosystems is the need of managing\n\
    the vast amount of data that is generated at every moment. Thus, I consider that\
    \ a fully compatible\narchitecture for managing context-aware systems in a smart\
    \ space not only needs to include context\nmanaging but also the big data components\
    \ for processing it. In this thesis, I propose a four layers\narchitecture that\
    \ covers the whole context data life-cycle in smart spaces. Fig 3.1 shows the\
    \ general\narchitecture proposed which is divided into physical, middleware, application,\
    \ and security layer.\nFigure 3.1 : Abstract Architecture for Context-Aware Systems\n\
    Physical layer\nData sources in smart spaces are heterogeneous by nature.\nThus,\
    \ accounting for this\ncharacteristic is a central part of the architecture of\
    \ smart spaces.\nThe physical layer in the\narchitecture provides all the tasks\
    \ related to collecting data from heterogeneous sources. On the\none hand, this\
    \ layer includes common IoT, wired and wireless sensors and actuators, that often\n\
    use well-deﬁned communication interfaces and protocols like MQTT, COAP, OMA-LWM2M,\n\
    OneM2M, etc. On the other hand, systems that generate data in a structured and\
    \ unstructured\nway are also included in this layer. Examples of such systems\
    \ are log servers, web applications,\nREST services, information systems, and\
    \ databases. These sources of information have another\nparticularity: they share\
    \ data using multiple communication protocols. For example, data can be\nshared\
    \ through transport messages via TCP/UDP or retrieved by querying a database.\
    \ Collecting\ndata is not the only process that needs to be performed over the\
    \ data sources. However, the\n51\nCONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR\
    \ SMART SPACES\nphysical layer is only in charge of providing communication mechanisms\
    \ for capturing the data.\nIn turn, all the aspects of data transformation, standardization,\
    \ and cleaning are performed in the\nmiddleware layer.\n3.4.4\nMiddleware\nThe\
    \ middleware layer provides all the operations needed for managing the complete\
    \ context life-\ncycle after its collection. First, the raw data coming from the\
    \ physical layer needs to be pre-\nprocessed so it can be accessed by the rest\
    \ of the components of the architecture in a uniﬁed way\nas well as further processed\
    \ if complex operations on the data are needed.\nPreprocessing\nData coming from\
    \ the physical layer can be real-time data (streaming) or static data (batch).\
    \ The\nway in which each of these data types is handled is different. In the case\
    \ of streaming data,\naccounting for its instability is crucial. Moreover, this\
    \ type of data is usually structured in small\nchunks. Therefore, raw data can\
    \ be deleted after preprocessing, without the need to store the\ncomplete original\
    \ dataset. In the case of batch data processing, the regular ETL (Extract Transform\n\
    and Load) procedure can be applied. For example, when retrieving data from a database,\
    \ the ﬁrst\nstep is to deﬁne the extraction mechanism (polling, programmed, incremental,\
    \ etc). Then, a data\nﬁltering and cleaning process for discarding duplicates,\
    \ redundant, and erroneous data should\nbe applied. Finally, the data must be\
    \ sent to the correspondent recipient system. Regardless of\nthe nature of the\
    \ data, it is necessary to provide a way to facilitate the deﬁnition and capture\n\
    of the context. This can be achieved through standardization of the data to a\
    \ common format\nand structure. To facilitate this process, I take advantage of\
    \ a data-ﬂow management system like\nApache NiFii which is capable of capturing\
    \ and processing raw data from streaming, batch, and\nheterogeneous data sources,\
    \ as well as of transforming this data to the NGSI-LD format through\ndifferent\
    \ processors. At this point, data is ready to be used by the next component of\
    \ this layer:\nthe Context Management\nContext Management\nAccording to [Sezer\
    \ 2017], context life-cycle refers to how data are gathered, modeled,\nprocessed,\
    \ and how knowledge is deduced from the captured data. In this regard, the context\n\
    management component is where all the logic for representing the context is deﬁned.\
    \ There are\nmany\ntechniques\navailable\nfor\ndata\nmodelling,\ne.g.,\nlogic-based,\n\
    markup,\nkey-value,\nobject-oriented, graphical and ontology-based are available[Al-Shdifat\
    \ 2018]. In this proposal,\nthe ontology-based modelling technique was selected,\
    \ taking advantage of the wide set of smart\niApache NiFi: https://nifi.apache.org\n\
    52\n3.4. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\ndata models currently available. These data models\
    \ allow deﬁning multiple entities and attributes\nwith a common structure for\
    \ multiple application domains as was stated in subsection 3.4.2. The\ncontext\
    \ management component is also responsible for providing an interface to access\
    \ the\nmodeled context data, acting as a context broker between the physical layer\
    \ and the application\nlayer through a publish/subscribe mechanism.\nThis system\
    \ allows to retrieve the context\ninformation previously modeled using two different\
    \ approaches, querying and subscribing.\nQuerying allows to access the current\
    \ context information available. In turn, subscribing allows\nto receive notiﬁcations\
    \ when context information changes. Ontology-based reasoning capabilities\nare\
    \ introduced in this component, which allow to deﬁne rules to notify of context\
    \ changes only\nwhen some special behavior is reached. For example, a system can\
    \ subscribe to changes in Entity\n\"A\" if the attribute b is greater than 10.\
    \ If that condition is not met, a notiﬁcation will not be sent\neven if the value\
    \ of b changes in any other way.\nContext storage is also an aspect to consider\
    \ in context management. The context broker only\nstores the latest context information\
    \ available.\nThus, another component needs to provide\nconnections to multiple\
    \ storage systems, capable to store the context data in relational and\nnon-relational,\
    \ graph, cloud-oriented or distributed databases. By so doing, it is possible\
    \ to keep\ntrack of the evolution of context data. It is important to remark that\
    \ data standardization is also\napplicable to the storage of context data. This\
    \ process is also achieved through the NGSI-LD\nstandard that deﬁnes guidelines\
    \ like name conventions, for tables databases, tables, and column\nattributes\
    \ mapping some encoding parameters for saving context data in different storage\n\
    systems.\nAlthough context management provides some basic reasoning functionalities\
    \ using\ncontext, in a wide range of applications more complex tasks need to be\
    \ performed, e.g, complex\nevent processing and machine learning. As such, in\
    \ this proposal, the component of context\nprocessing is introduced for extending\
    \ the features that context management provides.\nContext Processing\nThe context\
    \ processing component is introduced to handle the processing of large amounts\
    \ of\ncontext data coming from smart environments.\nAs was stated before, smart\
    \ environments\ngenerate high volumes of data with high velocity. Thus, traditional\
    \ methods for data processing\nin which this process is done by a single computing\
    \ instance is not sufﬁcient.\nInstead, it is\nnecessary to distribute or parallelize\
    \ the processing jobs.\nHence, in the context processing\ncomponent of this proposal,\
    \ the processing capabilities rely on well know big data processing\nengines.\
    \ A processing engine is a software system in charge of performing operations\
    \ on data. It\nusually consists of a series of computing nodes that implement\
    \ some clustering technology for\nparallelizing operations in order to process\
    \ data at a large scale. Some of the most well-known\ntechnologies for this purpose\
    \ are Apache Sparki and Apache Flinkii. These technologies offer a\niApache Spark:\
    \ https://spark.apache.org\niiApache Flink: https://flink.apache.org\n53\nCONTEXT-AWARE\
    \ SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\nprogramming interface that facilitates\
    \ the task of performing transformations on data. Both of\nthem provide a wide\
    \ assortment of resources and libraries for processing data both in streaming\n\
    and batch modes, such as complex event processing and machine learning. For example,\
    \ Spark\noffers the MLLib library which provides a set of resources and algorithms\
    \ that can be used for\nbuilding, e.g., recommendation systems, predictors, classiﬁcation\
    \ systems, deep learning and\nmore.\n3.4.5\nApplication Layer\nThe application\
    \ layer includes the components that provide high-level services. It serves as\
    \ an\ninterface between the user and the middleware layer to provide different\
    \ solutions that need to be\ndeveloped for each application ﬁeld. These can be\
    \ provided as generic Software as a Services\n(SaaS) solutions or a speciﬁc development\
    \ can be created ad-hoc. From a functional point of\nview, some examples of services\
    \ included in the application layer could be dashboard views,\nartiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ systems, advanced analytic, real-time monitoring, data sharing, etc. The\ndata\
    \ that is needed to operationalize these systems can be retrieved from the middleware\
    \ layer,\neither directly through the context management component or through\
    \ the context processing\ncomponent if complex and costly transformations are\
    \ necessary before the data can be consumed\nby the applications.\n3.4.6\nSecurity\
    \ layer\nEnsuring security and privacy is essential in any context-aware system\
    \ due to the own nature of\nthe data generated and collected[Li 2015]. This becomes\
    \ more important when such systems\ncollect information from smart environments\
    \ like Smart Heath, where security and privacy play a\nkey role. In this proposal,\
    \ a security layer has been included for securing the data exchange\nbetween all\
    \ of the components of the architecture. The security aspects of authentication\
    \ and\nauthorization are provided by an access control mechanism based on the\
    \ XACML reference\narchitecture [OASIS Standard 1994].\nI consider a combination\
    \ of Attribute-Based Access\nControl (ABAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\
    \ [Sandhu 1996, Yuan 2005] to control\nthe access of users, groups, or applications\
    \ to individual contextual data based on their level of\nprivacy.\n3.5\nImplementation\
    \ using FIWARE\nIn this section, I present the complete reference implementation\
    \ based on the architecture detailed\nin section 3.4 (Fig 3.2). The implementation\
    \ relies on the building blocks of FIWARE, which\nare called Generic Enablers\
    \ (GEs). Each GE is responsible for providing a speciﬁc feature that is\nnecessary\
    \ for handling data in smart environments. They can be easily conﬁgured for a\
    \ speciﬁc\nsetting without the need to develop ad-hoc software components. Moreover,\
    \ the NGSI standard,\n54\n3.5. IMPLEMENTATION USING FIWARE\ndescribed in section\
    \ 3.4.1 is the ofﬁcial format supported by all the GEs, easing communication\n\
    among each one of them.\n3.5.1\nPhysical layer\nIn this section, I describe the\
    \ GEs that are used for providing an interface to interact with IoT\ndevices,\
    \ wireless sensor networks and other third party systems .\n• IoT Agent GE i -\
    \ It is a set of software modules handling South IoT Speciﬁc protocols and\nNorth\
    \ OMA NGSI interaction. These agents allow working with the IoT devices that use\n\
    communication\nprotocols\nlike\nLWM2M\nover\nCoaP,\nJSON,\nor\nUltraLight\nover\n\
    HTTP/MQTT, OPC-UA, Sigfox, or LoRaWAN. By using this component, the IoT devices\n\
    will be represented in a FIWARE platform as NGSI entities in a Context Broker.\n\
    Additionally, the IoT agents GE allows to trigger commands to actuation devices\
    \ just by\nupdating speciﬁc command-related attributes in their NGSI entities\
    \ representation at the\nContext Broker.\nAdditionally, another set of incubating\
    \ GE’s are provided for allowing to manage other devices\nor systems that are\
    \ not considered by IoT Agents. This component allows the interaction with a\n\
    wide range of devices and systems providing full integration in smart spaces.\

    55\nCONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\nContext Management\n\
    Context Management is the central piece of the whole architecture. It handles\
    \ the whole context\nlifecycle, providing a standard way to manage, store, and\
    \ model the context. As stated in section\n3.4.4 a piece of software that provides\
    \ these capabilities is known as a Context Broker. In this\nregard, FIWARE has\
    \ a set of GEs that provide context management capabilities using NGSI-LD\nas\
    \ standard. The following is a list of the implementations currently available:\
    \ Orion-LD Context\nBroker, Scorpio Broker, and Stellio Context Broker. This reference\
    \ implementation is based on the\nOrion-LD Context Broker, which is the most extended\
    \ GE and the one endorsed by the European\nCommission as a CEF Building Block.[Digital\
    \ CEF 2018]\n• Orion-LDi: The Context Broker (Orion-LD) GE manages the entire\
    \ lifecycle of context\ninformation including updates, queries, registrations,\
    \ and subscriptions. It manages context\ninformation through the implementation\
    \ of a publish-subscribe system through an NGSI\ninterface. Users can create context\
    \ elements, query and update them, and subscribe to\nchanges in context information\
    \ that they can receive as notiﬁcations.\nOther elements\ninteract with Orion\
    \ through HTTP/HTTPS requests.\nThe Context Broker offers the\nFIWARE\nNGSI-LD\n\
    and\nNGSIv2\n(Next\nGeneration\nService\nInterface)\n[Open Mobile Alliance 2012]\
    \ APIs and associated information model (entity, attribute,\nmetadata) as the\
    \ main interface for managing context data.\nIn this architecture, Orion-LD provides\
    \ a complete solution for managing the latest context\ndata available. However,\
    \ storing the evolution of context data needs to be performed separately.\nFor\
    \ that purpose, this reference implementation relies on the Draco GE, which receives\
    \ each\ncontext update as a stream of data and injects them into multiple data\
    \ storage systems:\n• Dracoii is a dataﬂow management system based on Apache NiFiiii\
    \ that supports powerful\nand scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation,\
    \ and system mediation logic\nusing a set of processors and controllers. Draco\
    \ is aimed at providing storage of historical\ncontext data, allowing to receive\
    \ data events and dynamically recording them with a\npredeﬁned structure in several\
    \ data storage systems. In the scope of this implementation,\nDraco is proposed\
    \ to cover the context storage in the Context Management component.\nPreprocessing\n\
    As stated in section 3.4.4, in this proposal, I also consider alternative data\
    \ sources that can feed\nthe context management and processing components. On\
    \ the one hand, there are REST APIs\niFIWARE Orion: https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io\n\

    56\n3.5. IMPLEMENTATION USING FIWARE\nor Database systems that need to be queried\
    \ periodically. On the other hand, there are systems\nlike TCP or HTTP servers\
    \ that send a continuous ﬂow of data. These data, possibly coming from\nexternal\
    \ applications, also need to be converted into NGSI-LD data and sent to the Context\
    \ Broker.\nIn order to deal with this type of systems that are not covered by\
    \ the IoT Agents, FIWARE relies\non the Draco GE. The suite of processors and\
    \ controllers provided in this GE allows converting the\nincoming data into NGSI-LD\
    \ entities and attributes, required for their publication in the Context\nBroker.\n\
    Context Processing\nThe context processing component relies on big data technologies\
    \ to extract valuable insights or\nderive smart actions. Although big data frameworks\
    \ provide well-deﬁned interfaces and systems\nthat can be integrated with a wide\
    \ range of systems and devices, standardized data injection is\nstill an open\
    \ issue in these systems. In this regard, FIWARE provides a set of connectors\
    \ and\nlibraries that allow to process NGSI (NGSIv2 and NGSI-LD) context data\
    \ using two of the most\nwell-known big data frameworks through the Cosmos GE.\n\
    • Cosmosi provides an interface for integrating Apache Flink and Apache Spark\
    \ with the\nrest of the components in the FIWARE Ecosystem. Over the last years,\
    \ Apache Flink and\nApache Spark have established themselves as the most popular\
    \ open-source data\nprocessing frameworks with the rest of the components of the\
    \ FIWARE Ecosystem. This\nGE consists of a set of connectors that allow receiving\
    \ data from the Context Broker\n(through its subscription/notiﬁcation feature)\
    \ directly within data processing jobs running\nin these engines, enabling the\
    \ processing of context data in real time, as well as to send the\nresult from\
    \ this processing back to a given entity in the Context Broker so other\ncomponents\
    \ in the architecture can subscribe to changes in its attributes.\n3.5.3\nSecurity\n\
    In the FIWARE Ecosystem, several GEs manage authorization and authentication concerning\
    \ users\nand devices:\n• Keyrockii The Keyrock GE is responsible for Identity\
    \ Management.\nUsing Keyrock\nenables OAuth 2.0-based authentication and authorization\
    \ security to services and\napplications, as described in [Alonso 2017, Fernández\
    \ 2017].\nIn the context of this\nimplementation, Keyrock plays the role of IdM:\
    \ it manages authorization policies (PAP)\nand decides who can access which resources\
    \ in smart environments.\niFIWARE Cosmos: https://fiware-cosmos.readthedocs.io\n\
    iiFIWARE Keyrock: https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io\n57\nCONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS\
    \ AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\n• Wilmai:\nThe Wilma GE brings support\
    \ of proxy functions within OAuth 2.0-based\nauthentication schemas.\nIt also\
    \ implements Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) functions\nwithin an XACML-based access\
    \ control schema [OASIS Standard 1994]. In the scope of\nthis implementation,\
    \ several Wilma instances might be needed depending on what service\nthe users\
    \ want to provide or control the access to. Wilma is in charge of enforcing access\n\
    policies over requests sent to a speciﬁc endpoint. When a user or device is authenticated\n\
    through Keyrock, an OAuth 2.0 token is generated, which must be included in every\n\
    request sent to any protected component. Wilma intercepts requests and asks Keyrock\
    \ to\nvalidate the token, verifying the identity. Since Keyrock also acts as the\
    \ Policy Decision\nPoint (PDP), it checks the DC’s access authorization policies.\
    \ In case that the request\ncomplies with the established policies, Wilma grants\
    \ access to the requested resource.\n• AuthZForceii: The AuthZForce GE brings\
    \ additional support to PDP/PAP functions within\nan access control schema based\
    \ on the XACML standard.\n3.5.4\nApplication\nIn this section, I describe a set\
    \ of GE’s aimed at facilitating the processing, analysis and\nvisualization of\
    \ context information for the purpose of implementing the “smart behavior”\nexpected\
    \ in some of the context-aware systems:\n• Wirecloud GEiii brings a powerful web\
    \ mashup platform making it easier to develop\noperational dashboards which are\
    \ highly customizable by end-users.\n• Kurento\nGEiv\nenables\nreal-time\nprocessing\n\
    of\nmedia\nstreams\nsupporting\nthe\ntransformation of video cameras into sensors\
    \ as well as the incorporation of advanced\napplication functions (integrated\
    \ audiovisual communications, augmented reality, ﬂexible\nmedia playing and recording,\
    \ etc)\n•\nFogFlow GEv is a distributed execution framework to support dynamic\
    \ processing ﬂows\nover cloud and edges.\nAlthough FIWARE provides a set of software\
    \ components that facilitate the visualization and\nrepresentation of the data,\
    \ third-party applications can also be easily integrated into this\necosystem\
    \ by using the NGSI-LD format to represent the data. For example, data generated\

    \ proposed\nframework in different scenarios. First, I present a complete implementation\
    \ of a Smart Farm that\nuses big data techniques for building a ruled-based threshold\
    \ system to trigger automatic actions\ndepending on the inputs received by a set\
    \ of IoT devices. Afterward, another example is the\nbuilt-in Food Industry.\n\
    In this example, a static dataset of purchases is used for building a\nmachine\
    \ learning prediction system capable of determining the number of purchases in\
    \ a given\ndate and time.\n3.6.1\nSmart Farm\nThis section presents an example\
    \ of use case based on the FIWARE step-by-step tutorialsi. This\nscenario shows\
    \ a complete digital infrastructure that emulates a Smart Farm.\nihttps://ngsi-ld-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/iot-sensors.html\n\
    59\nCONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\nData Modelling\n\
    All the context data in this scenario are modeled using the Smart Data models\
    \ deﬁned for\nAgriculturei. These Data models deﬁne a set of mandatory and optional\
    \ attributes that every\nentity needs to include. The context of an entity represents\
    \ the state of a physical or conceptual\nobject which exists in the real world.\n\
    In this scenario, the following set of entities and relationships have been created\
    \ in order to\nbuild a Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) based on NGSI-LD.\
    \ For this simpliﬁed\nFMIS, it is only needed a small number of entities. The\
    \ relationship between the entities is\ndeﬁned as shown in Fig. 3.3. A Buildingii\
    \ is a real-world brick and mortar construct. Building\nentities would have properties\
    \ such as name, address, physical location, ﬁllingLevel, temperature,\nand an\
    \ association to the owner of the building.\nOn the other hand, smart devices\
    \ such as\ntemperature sensors or ﬁlling level sensors would extend a common Device\
    \ data modeliii. Each\nDevice entity would have properties such as: description,\
    \ category of device, and association to\nthe asset (controlledAsset). A Personiv\
    \ is an entity representing a farmer or farm laborer. Each\nPerson entity would\
    \ have properties such as: name, jobTitle, and an association to the farm\nbuildings\
    \ they own (owner).\nAdditionally,\nan agricultural parcel operation or task\n\
    (AgriParcelOperationv) is a conceptual entity used to associate workers, agricultural\
    \ products,\nand locations. AgriParcelOperation entities would have properties\
    \ such as: name, status of the\ntask and an association to the worker (i.e., a\
    \ Person entity, hasOperator) who performs the task,\nan association to the product\
    \ (i.e., an AgriProductTypevi entity, hasAgriProductType) to be used,\nan association\
    \ to the parcel (i.e., an AgriParcelvii entity, hasAgriParcel) where applied,\
    \ which\npoints to the crop (i.e., an AgriCrop entityviii entity, hasAgriCrop)\
    \ grown.\nAs can be seen, multiple entities are involved in this scenario. I now\
    \ present an example of\nthe command for creating the TemperatureSensor entity\
    \ in the Context Broker. In this regard, as\nshown in Fig.\n3.3, the TemperatureSensor\
    \ entity is composed by the attributes: id, type,\ndescription, category, controlledProperty\
    \ and temperature.\nThis entity can be created in the\ncontext broker by the HTTP\
    \ request presented in Listing in 3.1:\niSmart Agrifood Domain: https://github.com/smart-data-models/SmartAgrifood\n\

    CONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\nIoT Devices\nThe scenario\
    \ is composed by a collection of IoT devices. Each one of the devices uses UltraLight\n\
    2.0 as a communication protocol on top of HTTP. UltraLight 2.0 is a lightweight\
    \ text-based\nprotocol for devices and communications where bandwidth and device\
    \ memory resources are\nlimited [?].\nThis protocol is structured as a list of\
    \ key-value pairs divided by the pipe (“|”)\ncharacter. Below (3.1) is an example\
    \ of an UltraLight 2.0 payload containing two attributes \"a\"\nwith value of\
    \ \"10\" and \"b\" with value \"xyz\".\na|10|b|xyz\n(3.1)\nIn this example, the\
    \ following IoT sensors and actuators are included:\n• Soil Sensor - It reports\
    \ the quantity of humidity in the soil.\n• Temperature Sensor - It measures the\
    \ ambient or soil temperature at that instant.\n• Filling Sensor - It shows the\
    \ feed quantity available in an speciﬁc silo.\n• Irrigation System - It is an\
    \ actuator that can be activated and open the valves for a small\nperiod of time.\n\
    • Animal Collars - These are devices that allow showing the current location,\
    \ the health, and\nstress level of the animals.\n• Farm Management Information\
    \ Systems - These are devices installed in the agricultural\nmachinery that allows\
    \ communication (send/receive) messages or instructions to laborers,\nand monitor\
    \ the current state of the work assigned.\nThe communication between IoT devices\
    \ and the Context Broker is achieved by using IoT\nAgents. These agents deﬁne\
    \ two interfaces for the communication with the Context Broker:\nsouthbound and\
    \ northbound. On the one hand, southbound trafﬁc includes the requests originated\n\
    by the Context Broker and redirected to an IoT device. Southbound trafﬁc is formed\
    \ by a set of\nmessages with instructions for the actuator devices in order to\
    \ change the state of the\nenvironment by the execution of those actions. On the\
    \ other hand, northbound trafﬁc collects the\nrequests originated by the IoT devices\
    \ and sends them back to the Context Broker. Northbound\ntrafﬁc instead has the\
    \ measurements gather by the sensors and collect the state of the environment\n\
    for including it into context data of the system.\nIn this regard, the communication\
    \ schema deﬁned for this example is presented in (3.2), where\nthe entity id represented\
    \ in the Context broker is < device_name > , and one of the commands\nthat can\
    \ be executed is represented by < command > and any other needed values can be\
    \ added\nin subsequent parameters < param >.\n62\n3.6. APPLICATION SCENARIOS\n\
    < device_name > @ < command > | < param > | < param >\n(3.2)\nFor example, the\
    \ message presented in (3.3) sends a message to a device with the following\n\
    content: \"The Context Broker knows me as ’urn:ngsi-ld:Robot:001’. I need that\
    \ the device that is\nconnected to this endpoint execute the command of turn.\
    \ I have provided the parameters left and\n’30 (degrees) in order to the device\
    \ to accomplish the task\".\nurn : ngsi−ld : Robot : 001@turn|left|30\n(3.3)\n\
    The corresponding response deﬁned in the northbound interface will be as is stated\
    \ in (3.4): \"I\nhave complied with a request from the entity known as ’urn:ngsi-ld:Robot:001’\
    \ within the Context\nBroker. The command I have performed was a turn command.\
    \ The result was ’Turnok’\".\nurn : ngsi−ld : Robot : 001@turn|Turnok\n(3.4)\n\
    Real-time processing and Big Data analysis\nFIWARE relies on microservices for\
    \ building Smart Solutions. One of the advantages of using\nthis approach is that\
    \ they are designed to scale up, from basic or simple applications to city-wide\n\
    systems by means of a huge amount of IoT sensors, actuators, and many other systems\
    \ like context\ndata providers. As mentioned, any Smart solution has as a core\
    \ context data, and we take advantage\nof the Context Broker for providing a mechanism\
    \ that allows us to keep updated about the changes\nof state and provide notiﬁcations\
    \ as the context changes. In the case of small scenarios, each of\nthe notiﬁcation\
    \ events can be treated and processed as it comes by a single endpoint.\nOur example\
    \ implementation in Smart Farming uses the elements and dummy IoT devices\npreviously\
    \ described. In this regard, the FIWARE components used in this example are chosen\n\
    for providing a speciﬁc task in the whole system. The context broker was chosen\
    \ as the core\nfor manage all the context data. The IoT Agent for managing the\
    \ devices that work with the\nUltralight 2.0 protocol, and Cosmos Orion Spark\
    \ Connector for providing the connection between\nthe Context Broker and the Spark\
    \ Cluster in where the program is running. The Spark cluster\nconsists of a single\
    \ master that acts as a cluster manager to coordinate the execution and some\n\
    worker nodes to execute the tasks. For providing the historic context information,\
    \ Orion Context\nBroker relies on Draco to store the historic in MongoDB. Therefore\
    \ the overall architecture is\npresented inf Fig. 3.4 and it consists of the following\
    \ elements:\n• Two independent microservices using the FIWARE GEs:\n– The Orion\
    \ Context Broker for managing the context data by receiving the NGSI-LD\nrequests.\n\
    63\nCONTEXT-AWARE SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\nFigure 3.4 : Graphical\
    \ overview of the smart farming scenario\n– The FIWARE IoT Agent for UltraLight\
    \ 2.0 which will receive southbound requests\nusing NGSI-LD and convert them to\
    \ UltraLight 2.0 commands for the devices.\n• An Apache Spark cluster consisting\
    \ of a single Cluster Manager and Worker Nodes.\n– The FIWARE Cosmos Orion Spark\
    \ Connector will be deployed as part of the dataﬂow\nwhich will subscribe to context\
    \ changes and make operations on them in real-time.\n• One MongoDB database :\n\
    – Used by the Orion Context Broker to hold context data information such as data\n\
    entities, subscriptions, and registrations\n– Used by the IoT Agent to hold device\
    \ information such as device URLs and Keys\n• This Application does the following:\n\
    – Offers static @context ﬁles deﬁning the context entities within the system.\n\
    – Acts as a set of dummy agricultural IoT devices using the UltraLight 2.0\nOnce\
    \ all the components and their connection have been established, it is the time\
    \ to deﬁne the\nprogram that will be run over the spark cluster. In this case,\
    \ I deﬁne a scala program for providing\na rule-based decision application able\
    \ to detect and trigger actions depending on the sensor values.\nFor this speciﬁc\
    \ use case, I have deﬁned a program that opens a water faucet when the soil humidity\n\
    is too low and turns it back off when the soil humidity is back to normal levels.\
    \ This way, the soil\nhumidity is always kept at an adequate level. In this regard,\
    \ Cosmos provides two mechanisms for\nworking with streaming data one for reading\
    \ Context data as a Source Operator NGSILDSource\n64\n3.6. APPLICATION SCENARIOS\n\
    and other for pushing Context data back to the context broker as a Sink Operator\
    \ NGSILDSink\nThe dataﬂow stream uses the NGSILDSource operator in order to receive\
    \ notiﬁcations and ﬁlters\nthe input to only respond to motion sensors and then\
    \ uses the NGSILDSink to push processed\ncontext back to the Context Broker. The\
    \ code written in scala for building this program is shown\nin 3.2. In that program,\
    \ LOW_THRESHOLD and HIGH_THRESHOLD have been set to 30 and\n35 respectively.\n\

    Once all the services are deployed and entities and subscriptions are created.\
    \ I can deﬁne the\nworkﬂow of the system presented in 3.5 and described as follows:\n\
    1. The system begins to generate context data when the user starts some of the\
    \ devices via\nthe device monitoring interface (Context Provider CP). For example,\
    \ the user raises the\ntemperature through Temperature Sensor (TS) in Farm001.\n\
    2. The temperature value sent from Orion is in NGSI-LD format. Thus, the IoT agent\
    \ (IoTA),\ntakes this value and transforms it into UltraLight 2.0.\n3. While the\
    \ temperature TS in Farm001 is rising, the value of the Humidity Sensor (HS) is\n\
    decreasing, the value of the HS is sent messages to the context broker via IoTA\
    \ converting\nthe messages from UltraLight 2.0 to NGSI-LD to forwarding to Orion.\n\
    4. Orion receives the data generated by HS and only when detects that the humidity\
    \ value is\nupdated, it sends a notiﬁcation to the Spark Job (SJ) via cosmos.\n\
    5. Since the application is running in the spark cluster, it is ready for receiving\
    \ the streaming\ndata from the Orion. Thus, when Orion sends a notiﬁcation, the\
    \ SJ reads the stream of data\nand map the humidity attribute value for determining\
    \ if it is below or under the deﬁned\nthresholds.\n6. Once that the SJ detects\
    \ that the humidity value is under the LOW_THRESHOLD (35). It\nsends an update\
    \ for tuning on the water faucet in the corresponding water entity hosted in\n\
    the Orion.\n7. When Orion receives the update request from the SJ. It performs\
    \ the update and sends back\nto the Water Actuator(WA) the order via IoTA.\n67\n\

    \ Workﬂow\n8. IoTA translates to Ultralight the turn-on action to the WA and send\
    \ it.\n9. The WA ﬁnally receives the message and turns on the water faucet.\n\
    10. This workﬂow continues until the HS value is above the HIGH_THRESHOLD (50).\
    \ And,\nwhen this happens the process is repeated but in this time sending back\
    \ the action for turning\noff the water faucet to the correspondent device.\n\
    3.6.2\nSupermarket purchase prediction\nIn this section, I present an example\
    \ use case in which I use the described reference implementation\nto build a prediction\
    \ system in the Food Industry. A static dataset of purchases in a grocery store\n\
    68\n3.6. APPLICATION SCENARIOS\nis used for building a machine learning system\
    \ capable of determining the number of purchases in\na given date and time.\n\
    This case presents two independent processes: training the model and deploying\
    \ the predictor\nsystem. First I use a dataset for building a machine learning\
    \ model based on the Random Forest\nRegression Algorithm. This process includes\
    \ all the stages of the training process such as: data\ncleaning, feature extraction,\
    \ algorithm selection, scoring, and tuning. Afterward, the trained model\nis deployed\
    \ as a job in a Spark cluster for providing the predictor system. In this stage,\
    \ I provide\nan implementation based on FIWARE GEs for providing a complete solution\
    \ that not only makes\npredictions but also includes all the context-aware capabilities\
    \ provided by the Context Broker. A\nrepresentation of the whole system components\
    \ is presented in Fig. 3.6\nFigure 3.6 : Graphical overview of the supermarket\
    \ scenario\nData Modelling\nIn this scenario, all data are modeled as Ticket entities.\
    \ However, there does not exist any data\nmodel in the FIWARE Smart Data Models\
    \ initiative for modelling tickets. Consequently, a new\ndata model should be\
    \ created and published in the Smart Cities domaini under a new subject named\n\
    Shop. The ﬁrst step for creating a new data model is deﬁning its schema. In this\
    \ model, a Ticket\nentity would have compulsory properties such as: id and type;\
    \ optional properties such as: type of\niSmart Cities Domain: https://github.com/smart-data-models/SmartCities\n\

    \ collection process is the ﬁrst step for building the dataset.\nA diagram with\
    \ the\nrepresentation of this process is shown in Fig. 3.6. In this case, the\
    \ data is generated by a set of\nPoint of Sale Terminals (POS) located in two\
    \ different malls.\nEach of the POS Terminals\ngenerates a ticket with the purchase\
    \ information of each one of the customers that buy a product\nin that mall. In\
    \ order to collect this data, each of the terminals sends the ticket to Draco\
    \ for\nperforming the preprocessing task, transforming the raw ticket data into\
    \ an NGSI-LD ticket.\nAfter the preprocessing the NGSI-LD ticket is sent to the\
    \ Ticket Entity created in the CB. When\nthe CB detects a change in the Ticket\
    \ entity send a notiﬁcation to the second instance of Draco\nthat is conﬁgured\
    \ to be connected to a MongoDB for storing the ticket information received by\n\
    the context broker. Using this data collection pipeline, I can provide a structured\
    \ way NGSI-LD\ncompliant to store the information of each of the tickets generated\
    \ in the two stores. Using this\napproach I can build a dataset with a well-known\
    \ data structure that can be easy used by any\nsystem for its further processing.\n\
    Dataset\nThe dataset was built using data from a Supermarket Company located in\
    \ Europe. It consists of a\n1 GB JSON ﬁle. The ﬁle contains a sample of more than\
    \ 580,000 tickets for two different stores\nthat date from Jan 2016 to May 2016\
    \ containing more than 50,000 different products and over\n60,000 clients. The\
    \ dataset has the following ﬁelds:\n• id - Number id for that individual ticket.\n\
    • mall - Store where the ticket was printed. It has two values, 1 and 2.\n• date\
    \ - Date and time the ticket was printed.\n72\n3.6. APPLICATION SCENARIOS\nTable\

    Training\nIn order to train the model, the ﬁrst step was the perform a data cleaning\
    \ to avoid erroneous data.\nAfterward, the features extraction and data aggregation\
    \ process was made over the previously\ndescribed dataset obtaining, as a result,\
    \ the structure, showed in Table 3.2. In this new dataset\nthe columns of time,\

    \ The training process was performed using SparkMLlib. The data was split into\
    \ 80% for\ntraining and 20% form testing. According to the data provided a supervised\
    \ learning algorithm is\nthe best that suite in this case. The algorithm selected\
    \ for building the model was Random Forest\nRegression[Liaw 2002] showing a mean\

    and the Cosmos-Orion-Spark-connector for reading the streams of data coming from\
    \ the context\nbroker. Once the prediction is made this result is written back\
    \ to the context broker. A graphical\nrepresentation of the prediction process\

    In this subsection I provide an overview of the whole components of the prediction\

    This chapter presented a conceptual representation of context-aware systems that\
    \ enable data\nanalytics in smart spaces. The underlying architecture is divided\
    \ into four layers, informed by\navailable literature in the ﬁeld: physical, middleware,\
    \ application, and security.\nAs such, it\nconsiders the complete data lifecycle,\
    \ from data acquisition through sensors and other IoT\ndevices, to data processing\
    \ using Big Data technologies and presentation to the end user. The\nimplementation\
    \ relies on FIWARE GEs and commonly used open source technologies, a\ncombination\
    \ that has proven useful in the past for building other types of smart solutions\
    \ such as\ndigital\ntwins\n[Conde 2021],\ndata\nusage\ncontrolled\nsharing\nenvironments\n\
    [Munoz-Arcentales 2020,\nMunoz-Arcentales 2019],\nand\nenhanced\nauthentication\n\
    systems\n[Alonso 2020]. In this chapter, I show how, by combining these building\
    \ blocks, I provide a\nrobust, ﬂexible, scalable, and secure way to provide context-aware\
    \ data analytics in smart spaces.\nFurthermore, I take advantage of the existing\
    \ Smart Data Models based on the NGSI standard\nto easily adapt this implementation\
    \ to different domains. I provide two example use cases to\n77\nCONTEXT-AWARE\
    \ SYSTEMS AND DATA ANALYTICS FOR SMART SPACES\nvalidate the generalizability of\
    \ this proposal: one in Smart Farming and the other in Smart Retail.\nThese two\
    \ settings highlight how this implementation supports data from a number of different\n\
    sources, as well as a variety of operations including complex event processing\
    \ and machine\nlearning. I hope is that this reference implementation, along with\
    \ the step-by-step description of\nthose example use cases, offers some clues\
    \ to researchers, developers, and practitioners on how\nto operationalize their\
    \ own context-aware smart environments based on FIWARE.\nFurther research is needed\
    \ to determine how the reference implementation presented in this\nwork can be\
    \ applied to emerging paradigms such as edge computing and fog computing. These\n\
    new settings bring a set of additional requirements in terms of, e.g., privacy,\
    \ that would require\nadditional investigation, exploring options such as federated\
    \ learning to implement machine\nlearning capabilities in distributed environments.\
    \ Another line in need of further investigation is\nthat of providing customized\
    \ visualization dashboards to end users. Although the implementation\ncontemplates\
    \ the use of the Wirecloud GE for creating web dashboards that allow to easily\n\
    visualize the available data, I aim to explore how end user could customize their\
    \ interface by\nadding, e.g., personalized recommendation systems and alarms.\
    \ For this purpose, I have been\nworking as part of the YODA Action (2019-ES-IA-0121\
    \ co-ﬁnanced by the Connecting Europe\nFacility of the European Union), aimed\
    \ at empowering European citizens in the Big Data era.\n78\nChapter 4\nData Usage\
    \ Control for Data Spaces\n4.1\nIntroduction\nExtracting value from data is one\
    \ of the key aspects leading the development of applications and\nservices, especially\
    \ for Industry 4.0 [Jeschke 2017]. Consequently, ensuring data governance and\n\
    traceability becomes imperative in order to promote the exchange of data in this\
    \ new business\nparadigm. Another crucial aspect of the data economy is interoperability\
    \ [Lu 2017], since sharing\ndata between different stakeholders brings many new\
    \ opportunities for all parties involved. In this\nscope, the use of trusted and\
    \ secure platforms for sharing and processing personal and industrial\ndata is\
    \ essential for the creation of a data market and a data economy.\nRegarding data\
    \ sharing and in terms of security, not only is it important to control who can\n\
    access what resource (covered by identity and access control respectively), but\
    \ also how data are\nallowed to be used once accessed. This is of special relevance\
    \ in publish/subscribe scenarios in\nwhich data are sent in real-time to data\
    \ consumers.\nIn such cases, after providing the data,\nproviders have no knowledge\
    \ or control over how data are treated, leaving consumers the\npossibility to\
    \ make unauthorized or outlawed actions over data that may have implications such\n\
    as privacy or anonymity violation, which are some of the major concerns of the\
    \ General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) [Voigt 2017]. Access Control seems\
    \ to be insufﬁcient to protect\ndata trafﬁc in these scenarios. This measure needs\
    \ to be extended to a more comprehensive\nmodel, such as usage control, in order\
    \ to meet the industry’s new requirements, guaranteeing that\ndata consumers make\
    \ appropriate use of data.\nOne of the foundations of data sharing environments\
    \ is trust. Trust management concerns\nguaranteeing privacy and securing the exchange\
    \ of data among different stakeholders.\nStandardizing trust systems fosters data\
    \ transactions in the marketplace and eases compliance\nwith the data governance\
    \ framework deﬁned by each organization. The International Data Spaces\n(IDS),\
    \ formerly known as Industrial Data Spaces, Reference Architecture Model establishes\
    \ a\ntrust model to fulﬁll these requirements in the scope of Industry 4.0 and\
    \ deﬁnes data usage\ncontrol as one of the fundamental pillars to be addressed\
    \ in the new digital revolution\n[Otto 2018].\nIn the scope of usage control,\
    \ the Usage Control model (UCON) stated by Sandhu and Park\n[Sandhu 2003] was\
    \ presented as a new framework for providing not only traditional data access\n\
    control but also enabling the control of the data during and after the usage.\
    \ The UCON model\nextends the traditional access control models, not only by introducing\
    \ new concepts of mutability\napplicable to attributes of subjects and objects\
    \ but also by providing a new way of guaranteeing\nDATA USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA\
    \ SPACES\nthe continuity of policy enforcement. Moreover, UCON presents a family\
    \ of ABC models built\naround three decision factors: authorizations (A), obligations\
    \ (B) and conditions (C), which can\nall be used for pre-decision and ongoing\
    \ decisions.\nAs a complementary part of the\nconceptualization of UCON, one of\
    \ the formal model proposals of policies aligned with usage\ncontrol is presented\
    \ by [Bettini 2003],in which they attach two sets of predicates, namely\nprovisions\
    \ and obligations. On the one hand, provisions are concerned with the pre decision\n\
    phase (past and present), corresponding to the traditional access control. On\
    \ the other hand,\nobligations deal with the rules applied to the future use of\
    \ data and are related to the ongoing\ndecision phase which, instead, is executed\
    \ after the access is initiated and implements the\ncontinuity of control over\
    \ the data. The new features that by UCON derives in several attempts to\nimplement\
    \ usage control. However, the development of a complete framework of data usage\n\
    control applied to industrial data sharing ecosystems is still an open issue.\n\
    This chapter relies on a comprehensive architecture for providing data access\
    \ and usage\ncontrol in industrial data sharing ecosystems. This proposal incorporates\
    \ the core concepts from\nthe UCON model, the key aspects of the IDS Reference\
    \ Architecture Model and the extended\nXACML\n(eXtensible\nAccess\nControl\nMarkup\n\
    Language)\nReference\nArchitecture\n[OASIS Standard 1994]. In addition, the architecture\
    \ is integrated into a complete identity and\naccess control solution with support\
    \ to delegated application-scoped security management\n[Alonso 2017, Fernández\
    \ 2017]. Thanks to this integration, data providers can easily manage\naccess\
    \ and usage policies scoped to different scenarios of application. The conceptual\
    \ model of\nthe architecture was previously described in [Munoz-Arcentales 2019]\
    \ . This chapter extends\nsaid work by providing an implementation of the proposed\
    \ architecture and a validation with an\noriginal case study in the food industry.\n\
    The proposed architecture fulﬁlls the main requirements [Ravidas 2019] of Internet\
    \ of Things\n(IoT) applications developed in shared data scenarios.\nIt guarantees\
    \ reliability and\ninteroperability through the trusted and standardized environment\
    \ established thanks to the IDS\nframework. Likewise, IoT applications are usually\
    \ very demanding in terms of scalability. Thus,\nthe data usage control architecture\
    \ needs to meet this requirement. The extended XACML-based\narchitecture separates\
    \ each component based on its role, so each of these components can be\nscaled\
    \ as needed. In terms of dynamism, the proposed architecture can easily apply\
    \ predeﬁned\naccess and usage policies to the new dynamically added nodes, as\
    \ it stores and manages those\npolicies in a centralized way.\nIn this scenario,\
    \ the FIWARE platformi seems particularly suitable for implementing a usage\n\
    control architecture. FIWARE is an open initiative whose mission is to ease the\
    \ development of\nnew Smart Applications in multiple sectors by providing a set\
    \ of components, known as Generic\nEnablers (GE), that enable the connection among\
    \ IoT devices and Context Information\nManagement and other services such as security\
    \ or big data analysis.\nIn a previous work\niFIWARE: The open-source platform\
    \ for our smart digital future, https://www.ﬁware.org/\n80\n4.2. OBJECTIVES\n\
    [Alonso 2018], they proposed an implementation of the IDS architecture using FIWARE\n\
    components focused on data brokering, identity and trust management, and the development\
    \ of\nIDS Connectors. In the present work, I extend such implementation by adding\
    \ the components\nthat are needed to achieve usage control by data providers on\
    \ the basis of the architecture I\npropose. The newly added components introduced\
    \ in this work are the Policy Translation Point\n(PTP), the Usage Policy Decision\
    \ Point (uPDP) and the Policy Execution Point (PXP). A\nthorough explanation of\
    \ every one of these components is presented in Section 4.\nThis chapter is structured\
    \ as follows.\nNext section presents the objectives and research\nquestions of\
    \ this thesis covered in this chapter. Section 4.3 reviews the most relevant related\
    \ work\non data usage control. Section 4.4 presents a brief description of the\
    \ architecture that I took as a\nreference for this implementation including some\
    \ additional considerations for this proposal. In\nSection 4.5, an implementation\
    \ of the proposed solution using FIWARE components is\ndescribed. Section 4.6\
    \ presents a validation of said implementation by means of a use case in the\n\
    food industry, which includes the results obtained from measuring the enforcement\
    \ time when\napplying usage control policies. Lastly, Section 4.7 ﬁnishes with\
    \ the conclusions of the chapter\nand an outlook on future work.\n4.2\nObjectives\n\
    After the introduction, the two objectives of this chapter are:\n1. Identify the\
    \ key characteristics and needs of data usage control systems for being introduced\n\
    and applied in the context of data spaces\n2. Propose a design, implementation\
    \ and validation of an architecture for providing data usage\nand access control\
    \ in data spaces\nIn this chapter, I present an implementation of an architecture\
    \ for enabling data access and\nusage control in data-sharing ecosystems among\
    \ multiple organizations using the FIWARE\nEuropean open-source platform. Additionally,\
    \ a validation of this implementation through a real\nuse case in the food industry\
    \ was conducted.\nThis chapter also covers the following research questions:\n\
    • How should an architecture for providing data usage control in smart spaces\
    \ be designed\nso that it can be used in data sharing ecosystems with multiple\
    \ stakeholders?\n• How can the implementation feasibility of the proposed data\
    \ usage control architecture be\nveriﬁed?\nThese questions are answered based\
    \ on the results of the literature review conducted, the\nimplementation, and\
    \ the validation of the architecture proposed.\n81\nDATA USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA\
    \ SPACES\n4.3\nRelated Work\nAccording to [Xu 2019, Lee 2014, Yin 2015], the adoption\
    \ of big data and industrial IoT (IIoT)\nis rapidly growing in Industry 4.0. Previous\
    \ works have provided industrial solutions that make\nuse of this type of technologies\
    \ such as recommendation and prediction systems, process\noptimization\ntechniques,\n\
    intelligent\nmanufacturing,\nand\nAI\napplications\n[Mourtzis 2016, Gölzer 2015].\n\
    In this regard, many open source big data tools have been\ndeveloped to enable\
    \ companies to process the vast amount of data that are generated by the IIoT.\n\
    Several proposals present a general view of the big data architecture needed to\
    \ manage industrial\nscenarios in which multiple sources of data are present [Gokalp\
    \ 2016, Osman 2019]. The authors\nof [Zhu 2019] present a ﬁve-layer architecture\
    \ for big data processing and analytics (BDPA):\ncollection, storage, processing,\
    \ analytics, and application. Since each layer involves different\ntasks, many\
    \ open source tools have been developed to help overcoming some of them. Some\n\
    examples include:\n• Collection: ApacheKafka (Apache Kafka:\ni), Apache NiFi (Apache\
    \ NiFi:\nii), Orion\nFIWARE Context Broker (FIWARE Orion: iii).\n• Storage: CassandraDB\
    \ (CassandraDB: iv), HDFS (HDFS: v), MongoDB (MongoDB: vi).\n• Processing and\
    \ analytics: Apache Spark (Apache Spark: vii), Apache Flink (Apache Flink:\nviii),\
    \ Apache Storm (Apache Storm: ix), FIWARE Cosmos (FIWARE Cosmos: x).\n• Application:\
    \ Apache Zeppelin (Apache Zeppelin:\nxi), Kibana (Kibana:\nxii), GeoSpark\n(GeoSpark:\
    \ xiii).\nAs stated in [Mosavi 2017], big data processing in industry is different\
    \ in several aspects\nfrom other scenarios. One of the major concerns in this\
    \ sort of environments is the way in which\ndata are collected, considering that\
    \ data can derive from multiple sources. This issue has become\nihttps://kafka.apache.org/\n\

    \ in data ecosystems shared among multiple organizations, since each organization\n\
    can process and store data in different ways and has different access and usage\
    \ rights over data.\nThus, I identify the need to use a common standard, compatible\
    \ with the existing big data tools\nand IoT devices, that provides a standardized\
    \ way to gather, extract, process and store data in\nindustrial contexts. In this\
    \ regard, NGSI-LD provides a simple and powerful open API published\nas an ETSI\
    \ speciﬁcation for the management of context information [NGSI-LD 2020].\nThis\n\
    speciﬁcation promotes the adoption of a standard way to manage data in the whole\
    \ industrial data\nprocessing pipeline. However, the use of a common standard\
    \ makes it imperative to use big data\ntools that can work with data in this format.\
    \ To address this issue, I include the FIWARE GEs in\nthe industry’s BDPA pipeline\
    \ since they comprise a set of libraries, connectors, and protocols on\ntop of\
    \ the most widely used big data frameworks provided by the Apache Community, providing\n\
    these components with full support for the NGSI-LD standard.\nWith the adoption\
    \ of this\napproach, any organization can not only perform big data operations\
    \ more easily using a common\nstandard, but also mitigate additional needs such\
    \ as enforcing data Usage Control and securing\ndata exchange.\nAs far as data\
    \ Usage Control is concerned, most of the proposals in the literature take the\n\
    UCON model [Sandhu 2003] as a starting point for the development of their solutions.\
    \ However,\ndepending on the ﬁeld of application, these works take different approaches.\n\
    For instance,\nRussello and Dulay presented xDUCON [Russello 2009b], a cross-domain\
    \ Usage Control\nproposal for coordinating and enforcing Usage Control policies\
    \ across different collaborating\norganizations.\nIn said framework, a cross-domain\
    \ data space instance is shared among the\norganizations to be used as a local\
    \ enforcement point of the control policies.\nAs a result,\nthe coordination of\
    \ the enforcement policies is easier to specify since it is not necessary to\n\
    include details of the receiving organization structure.\nA posterior paper was\
    \ presented by the same authors [Russello 2009a]. As a complementary\npart of\
    \ the xDUCON framework, they deﬁned cross-domain policies, which are capable of\n\
    dealing with the mutability issues of the UCON model and providing a ﬁne-grained\
    \ decision\nmechanism that can be captured by the deﬁned policies. The xDUCON\
    \ framework provides a\ngeneral perspective for providing capabilities of policy\
    \ enforcement and speciﬁcation.\nFurthermore, Di Cerbo et al. present a solution\
    \ for avoiding security risks and providing a\nmechanism for allowing the data\
    \ owners to keep the data under their control.\nThey\npresent [Cerbo 2015] a solution\
    \ that allows the provision of a secure data sharing across the cloud\nand mobile\
    \ engines. This is achieved by relying the enforcing mechanism and rules deﬁnition\
    \ on\nPolicy Deﬁnition Languages (PSLs) like XACML and an extended version of\
    \ PPL (PrimeLife\nPolicy Language) [Ardagna 2009]. However, these works fall short\
    \ of providing an architecture\nthat not only covers the enforcement and deﬁnition\
    \ mechanisms for access and Usage Control but\nalso provides a full description\
    \ of the whole process that data Usage Control involves.\nLikewise, Lazouski et\
    \ al. use the principles presented in [Jiao 2011] for providing a Usage\n83\n\
    DATA USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\nControl solution mainly focused on cloud systems\
    \ applications. The conducted research is based\non the UCON model and the OASIS\
    \ XACML standard to regulate the usage of cloud\nresources [Lazouski 2012].\n\
    This proposal was validated by implementing the authorization\nsystem integrated\
    \ with OpenNebula (OpenNebula:\ni).\nMore comprehensive research was\npresented\
    \ by Wu et al. [Wu 2015], in which data Usage Control is enforced in industrial\
    \ Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSN). Not only do they provide cross-domain ﬁne-grained\
    \ Access Control,\nbut they also use fuzzy clustering to analyze industrial sensing\
    \ data. This work uses a set of\nsimulations for verifying the suitability of\
    \ the overhead time and the effectiveness of the\nproposed model. A comparable\
    \ proposal was presented by Marra et al. [Marra 2017]. They used\nthe core concepts\
    \ of UCON model and the XACML reference architecture in order to implement\na\
    \ Java application for providing Usage Control operations over IoT devices. They\
    \ developed a\ncase study in which they evaluate the performance of the IoT devices\
    \ and determined the\nfeasibility of the system by implementing their proposal\
    \ on real devices.\nRecent works provide some interesting solutions for data Usage\
    \ Control based on the\nXACML\nreference\narchitecture\nproposal.\nFor\ninstance,\n\
    Barsocchi\net\nal.\nuse\nGLIMPSE [Bertolino 2011], a ﬂexible monitoring infrastructure\
    \ for performing Usage Control\non operations over sensors in a smart home. They\
    \ demonstrate the feasibility of carrying out\nUsage Control in this type of environments.\
    \ In addition, in said study, the authors provide a low\ncost, easy to install,\
    \ user-friendly, dynamic and ﬂexible infrastructure, capable of performing\nrun-time\
    \ resource management using control rules [Barsocchi 2018]. Similarly, Gkioulos\
    \ et al.\npresent a model that can integrate access and Usage Control mechanisms\
    \ for dealing with the\ndistributiveness and heterogeneity of systems like IoT\
    \ and online banking. At the same time they\nbring several improvements regarding\
    \ resilience on active attacks, policy writing simpliﬁcation,\nrun-time efﬁciency\
    \ and scalability [Gkioulos 2019] .\nAnother proposal by Martinelli et al.\npresents\
    \ a framework for applying QoS in a network in a Smart Building environment.\n\
    They combine UCON and SDN (Software Deﬁned Networks) in order to enforce a set\
    \ of\nmanagement, security, and safety policies aimed at ensuring the appropriate\
    \ QoS for the provided\nservices according to both the tenants’ Service Level\
    \ Agreements (SLAs) and the current\ncontext [Martinelli 2019].\nLastly,\nan approach\
    \ presented by Milan Petkovi´c et al.\nin [Petkovi´c 2011] uses the business model\
    \ of an organization to detect privacy infringements and\nto verify that data\
    \ have been processed only for the intended purpose. The work presents a strong\n\
    point in formal speciﬁcation using Calculus of Orchestration of Web Services (COWS).\
    \ These\nproposals show the growing interest of the scientiﬁc and industrial community\
    \ in exploiting all\nthe capabilities of Usage Control, and also demonstrate its\
    \ application in speciﬁc scenarios (IoT,\nCloud, etc.). Nevertheless, these overtures\
    \ do not cover topics like cross-domain data exchange,\ndata governance and trust\
    \ environments, highlighting the need to deal with these topics before\nusing\
    \ this type of architecture in industrial data-sharing ecosystems. Moreover, in\
    \ Industry 4.0,\nihttps://opennebula.org\n84\n4.3. RELATED WORK\ndata sharing\
    \ between multiple organizations is a key factor to be considered. Thus, guaranteeing\n\
    the compliance with data governance rules and the responsible use of organizations’\
    \ data by\nthird-party entities is one of the requirements that needs to be addressed.\
    \ Therefore, the need to\ngenerate a more ﬂexible framework, capable of adapting\
    \ to these mixed data ecosystems,\nis identiﬁed.\nMoreover, the Data Privacy Directive\
    \ 95/46/EC [Poullet 2006], currently replaced by the\nGDPR, played an important\
    \ role in data protection. In this regard, many Access Control solutions\nare\
    \ currently presented for protecting personal data. For instance, Bartolini et\
    \ al. proposed a\nsystematic approach for authoring Access Control policies that\
    \ are aligned with GDPR\nprovisions.\nThey present a methodology for generating\
    \ templates from the GDPR text and\nidentifying if a GDPR article can be deﬁned\
    \ as an Access Control policy. This is achieved by\nmatching actual attributes\
    \ gathered from the legal use cases and translating the resulting policies\ninto\
    \ a given formalism or language [Bartolini 2019b] in order to comply with GDPR’s\
    \ principle\nof “data protection by design and by default” [Bartolini 2019a].\
    \ In the same line, Calabró et al.\nconducted a preliminary study for integrating\
    \ Access Control and business processes for GDPR\ncompliance. The main goal of\
    \ said study was to extend the currently adopted Access Control\nmechanisms to\
    \ enforce GDPR compliance during business activities of data management and\n\
    analysis [Calabró 2019]. Nevertheless, although these works provide a ﬁrst step\
    \ towards a formal\ndeﬁnition of an Access Control solution based on GDPR, they\
    \ do not cover the Usage Control of\nthe data once access is granted, opening\
    \ an issue that needs to be addressed. Another interesting\nproposal was presented\
    \ by Arfelt et al. who identiﬁes formalizable GDPR articles and, by using\nMetric\
    \ First-order Temporal Logic (MFOTL), formalizes and monitors the articles in\
    \ which\ncontrollers, processors, or data subjects are required to take speciﬁc\
    \ and observable actions\n[Arfelt 2019].\nMoreover, the policies generated with\
    \ the previous process are deployed over\nMONPOLY, a monitoring tool for compliance\
    \ checking [Basin 2012]. Although previous works\nsolve the problems of GDPR formalization\
    \ and monitoring, these proposals do not consider other\nfactors such as data\
    \ governance and trust that affect data sharing in cross-domain industries.\n\
    Prior works have sought Access Control solutions based on Blockchain for distributed\n\
    environments [Neisse 2017, Outchakoucht 2017, Ouaddah 2016].\nIn particular, the\
    \ authors of\n[Neisse 2017] describe how contracts can be deployed in the ledger\
    \ to perform Usage Control\nfollowing GDPR provisions and avoiding central entities\
    \ in the authorization and authentication\nprocesses. Overall, the cited studies\
    \ outline that relying on Blockchain provides transparency and\ntrust\nsolutions\n\
    for\nAccess\nControl\nbut\nit\nmay\nimpose\nscalability\nlimitations\nfor\nreal-time\
    \ scenarios.\nAs can be seen, much of the research up to now has been descriptive\
    \ in nature. Table 4.1\npresents a comparison of the Usage Control architectures\
    \ found in the literature. Most solutions\nrely only on ABAC (Attribute Based\
    \ Access Control) for Access Control and just a few proposals\nsupplement it with\
    \ RBAC (Role Based Access Control) or IBAC (Identity Based Access\n85\nDATA USAGE\
    \ CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\nControl), which play a crucial role in data-sharing\
    \ scenarios in which it is necessary to provide\nparticular access and usage permissions\
    \ to different stakeholders. In addition, the existing Usage\nControl solutions\
    \ focus on policy infringement detection. Only about half of the works studied\n\
    provide remediation capabilities for policy violation, rather than just detection.\n\
    Remediation\nactions are essential to automatize the enforcement of consequences\
    \ for policy noncompliance\nrather than issuing warnings or notiﬁcations and leaving\
    \ it up to the wrongdoer to redress the\nsituation.\nIn order to univocally deﬁne\
    \ obligations, prohibitions and permissions, and the\nconsequences for noncompliance,\
    \ it is convenient to use a Policy Speciﬁcation Language (PSL).\nMost works found\
    \ in the literature rely on XACML or U-XACML as their PSL, although some of\n\
    them do not use a speciﬁc language or deﬁne one of their own. Another important\
    \ aspect is the\nsupport for multi-actor architectures. About half of the works\
    \ studied provide support for several\nactors involved in the data-sharing process,\
    \ whereas the rest of them focus on one-on-one\nexchanges. The former is a key\
    \ requirement for scenarios in which multiple stakeholders share\ndata with one\
    \ another. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies analyzed\
    \ in\nthis section fail to provide a data Usage Control solution that is independent\
    \ of the context in\nwhich data are generated (WSN, IoT, SDNs, etc.), with only\
    \ a couple of them being\ndomain-agnostic. Lastly, far too little attention has\
    \ been paid to the topic of trust environments as\na pillar for providing capabilities\
    \ for secure and trusted data exchange and sharing between\nmultiple organizations.\n\

    \ capabilities in\n86\n4.4. DATA USAGE CONTROL ARCHITECTURE DESIGN\narchitectures\
    \ with several agents involved, while supporting an expressive policy deﬁnition\n\
    language that allows the deﬁnition of obligations, prohibitions and permissions\
    \ and providing\nremediation functionalities in the event of policy infringement.\
    \ This research contributes to ﬁll\nthe gap in the existing literature by providing\
    \ a generic multi-actor architecture to achieve\nadvanced data access and usage\
    \ control capabilities in real-time data-sharing scenarios. This\nproposal incorporates\
    \ the core concepts from the UCON model, the key aspects of the IDS\nReference\
    \ Architecture Model and the extended XACML Reference Architecture, and relies\
    \ on\nODRL as its PSL. In addition, I provide an implementation using one of the\
    \ core CEF\n(Connecting Europe Facility) building blocks and FIWARE GEs for providing\
    \ a reference\nframework fully adapted to the requirements of Industry 4.0.\n\
    4.4\nData Usage Control Architecture Design\nThis section presents an overview\
    \ of the design principles that have been considered for\ndesigning this proposal.\
    \ It is also summarized the resultant architecture as well as a workﬂow\nthat\
    \ illustrates the interaction between the described components.\nDetails about\
    \ both the\nprinciples and the architecture can be found in our previous work\
    \ [Munoz-Arcentales 2019].\n4.4.1\nDesign Principles\n• Trust. IDS Connectors\
    \ provide a trusted environment that enables the achievement of data\nusage control\
    \ [Otto 2018].\n• Interoperability.\nStandardization of protocols is crucial to\
    \ ensure the understanding\nbetween all the components involved in the architecture,\
    \ for managing both usage control\nand identity.\n• Governance. Emerging data-centered\
    \ businesses need to deﬁne data governance programs\nin order to exploit data\
    \ in a cost-effective manner [Panian 2010].\nData sharing should\ncomply with\
    \ the data governance rules deﬁned by each of the organizations involved. In\n\
    this scope, providing ways to respect and protect the data of all the parties\
    \ involved is one\nof the main requirements that data usage control must fulﬁll.\
    \ Thus, data providers must\nhave access to monitoring and conﬁguration tools\
    \ that allow them to control what becomes\nof their data.\nNevertheless, as pointed\
    \ out by [Paci 2018], in collaborative systems,\nresources can be administered\
    \ by multiple data owners. Due to this fact, the aspects of data\ngovernance model,\
    \ policy composition and conﬂict resolution need to be addressed. In this\ncontext,\
    \ the concept of \"data governance model\" deﬁnes the authority that entities\
    \ have\nover a resource; \"policy composition\" describes how the authorization\
    \ requirements\nauthored by multiple entities are combined or reconciled to regulate\
    \ the access to a\nresource, and \"conﬂict resolution\" indicates the method used\
    \ to resolve policy conﬂicts in\norder to obtain a conclusive decision [Paci 2018].\
    \ In this regard, the preliminary version of\n87\nDATA USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA\
    \ SPACES\nthis proposed architecture takes the work presented by Mahmudlu et al.\
    \ as a reference, in\nwhich they deﬁne multiple ownership, authoritative and predeﬁned\
    \ mechanisms for\naddressing the main aspects of governance model, policy combination\
    \ and conﬂict\nresolution respectively [Mahmudlu 2016].\n• Performance.\nThe accomplishment\
    \ data usage control policies can be only ensured if\nreaction to policies violation\
    \ is quick and efﬁcient.\n• Flexibility. As many data sharing scenarios and use\
    \ cases are contemplated, the solution has\nto be adaptable to the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of such scenarios.\n4.4.2\nAgents involved\nAccording to the the International\
    \ Data Spaces Association and IDS Reference Architecture\npresented by Fraunhofer\
    \ [Otto 2018] four agents have to be provided in every system that\nconsiders\
    \ data sharing: Data Owner (DO), Data Provider (DP), Data Consumer (DC) and Data\n\
    User (DU). However, it is very frequent to assume a two actors model in which\
    \ the DP and the\nDO play the same role as well as the DC and the DU. Taking into\
    \ account this assumption, the\nDP is the organization or user who is the proprietary\
    \ of the data and decides what data is\navailable for sharing.\nAdditionally,\
    \ the DP deﬁnes the usage and access control policies\napplicable to the data\
    \ that the DC can consume. On the other hand, the DC represent every entity\n\
    that has the legal rights to use the data provided by a DP according with the\
    \ previously deﬁned\nusage control policies.\nBesides these two actors, the GDPR,\
    \ deﬁnes an additional component named Data Controller\n(DCr) [European Data Protection\
    \ Supervisor 2019]. According to the DCr deﬁnition, a third actor\nneeds to be\
    \ included in order to cover the IDS reference architecture and the one proposed\
    \ by\nthe GDPR. In this case, the DCr and the DP are responsible for guaranteeing\
    \ the protection of\ndata owners’ rights and for providing access to data respectively.\
    \ Nevertheless, I consider that a\nmodel capable of being GDPR-compliant needs\
    \ to contemplate some other factors, as stated in\n[Calabró 2019] that are out\
    \ of the scope of this work. Thus, I concentrate my efforts on presenting\na preliminary\
    \ version of data usage control with a two-actor model (DP-DC), mainly focused\n\
    on data sharing ecosystems in Industry 4.0. However, below I present an alternative\
    \ proposal\narchitecture including the three-actor model.\nFinally, I also consider\
    \ the Identity Provider (IdP) as an actor presented in the IDS Reference\nArchitecture:\
    \ The IdP veriﬁes the authenticity of all the actors involved in the architecture\
    \ and also\nprovides all the characteristics related to identity management. These\
    \ include actor registration,\nauthentication, password management and, the option\
    \ of grouping actors in organizations in order\nto manage them under identical\
    \ conditions.\n88\n4.4. DATA USAGE CONTROL ARCHITECTURE DESIGN\n4.4.3\nArchitecture\
    \ and Workﬂow\nBuilding on the design principles established and the simpliﬁed\
    \ agent model identiﬁed for data\nprocessing scenarios (DC, DP and IdP), I have\
    \ presented an architecture for providing data usage\nand access control in shared\
    \ ecosystems. Fig. 4.1 shows the proposed two-actor architecture,\nwhereas Fig\
    \ 4.2 presents the aforementioned alternative architecture including the DCr as\
    \ a\nseparate agent.\nOn the other hand, Figs 4.3 and 4.4 show the workﬂow of\
    \ the two main scenarios of data\nsharing: (1) DP deﬁnes the policies that apply\
    \ to the shared data and (2) DC preforms operations\nto the received data.\nThe\
    \ DP uses the Policy Administration Point (PAP) to deﬁne access and usage control\n\
    policies. Usage policies are deﬁned using an Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)\
    \ extension\nmaterialized by the W3C [McRoberts 2014] and translated by the Policy\
    \ Translation Point (PTP)\nto a program that runs on the usage Policy Decision\
    \ Point (uPDP) and that is updated every time\npolicies are modiﬁed by the DP.\
    \ Once both access and usage policies are deﬁned, the data in the\nData Infrastructure\
    \ (both real-time and stored) can be made available in the Shared Data Space\n\
    (SDS).\nWhen the DC requests access to data available in the SDS (to save them\
    \ in its Storage System\nor to process them using a Processing Engine), the Policy\
    \ Enforcement Point (PEP) checks with\nthe access Policy Decision Point (aPDP)\
    \ if the DC has the necessary access permissions to make\nthe subscription effective.\
    \ If the result is positive, the DC starts receiving data from the SDS and\nprocessing\
    \ them performing the desired operations. As a result of such operations, traces\
    \ are\ngenerated and sent to the PEP that, after validating an authentication\
    \ token previously generated\nby the IdP, redirects them to the uPDP. The uPDP\
    \ checks the usage policies and in case of\nnoncompliance delegates the responsibility\
    \ of enforcing the established action for policy\nnoncompliance to the Policy\
    \ Execution Point (PXP) by sending the corresponding control signal.\nOne concern\
    \ identiﬁed in this proposal is that the logs generated when performing operations\n\
    on data could be easily manipulated due to the fact that log generation takes\
    \ place outside the\nscope of the DP. Nevertheless, the reference architecture\
    \ used in this work relies on the guidelines\nof the IDS connectors, which determine\
    \ that all the connectors involved in a data exchange must\nrun a trusted (certiﬁed)\
    \ software stack. Worded differently, IDS Connectors require a certiﬁcation\n\
    from the IDS Certiﬁcation Body in order to establish trust among all participants.\n\
    Moreover, the IDS guidelines also establish that any communication between connectors\
    \ from\ndifferent organizations should be encrypted and integrity protected. Thus,\
    \ by including the DP\nand DC inside IDS connectors, each DP is capable of ensuring\
    \ that their data are handled by the\nConnector of the DC according to the usage\
    \ policies speciﬁed, or else the data will not be sent\n[Otto 2018].\n89\nDATA\
    \ USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\nFigure 4.1 : Data usage control architecture\n\
    4.5\nData Usage Control Implementation\nThis section presents an implementation\
    \ of the proposed architecture using the generic enablers\n(GEs) provided by FIWARE\
    \ and other open-source tools. Speciﬁcally, the GEs utilized in this\nimplementation\
    \ of the data usage architecture are the following:\n• Keyrock The Keyrock GEi\
    \ is responsible for Identity Management.\nUsing Keyrock\nenables OAuth 2.0-based\
    \ authentication and authorization security to services and\napplications, as\
    \ described in [Alonso 2017, Fernández 2017].\nIn the context of this\nimplementation,\
    \ Keyrock plays the role of IdP, manages authorization policies (PAP) and\ndecides\
    \ which DCs can access which resources in the data infrastructure (aPDP).\nTherefore,\
    \ DPs and DCs perform the authentication process relying on Keyrock.\nGuaranteeing\
    \ the unequivocal identiﬁcation of all the agents involved in the data usage\n\
    architecture is mandatory in order to ensure a secure way of providing or consuming\
    \ data.\nBy using Keyrock, DPs can create authorization policies to constrain\
    \ DCs’ access to the\ndata infrastructure.\niFIWARE Keyrock: https://ﬁware-idm.readthedocs.io\n\
    90\n4.5. DATA USAGE CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION\nFigure 4.2 : Data usage control with\
    \ three actors architecture\n• Wilma:\nThe Wilma GEi brings support of proxy functions\
    \ within OAuth 2.0-based\nauthentication schemas.\nIt also implements PEP functions\
    \ within an XACML-based\naccess control schema [OASIS Standard 1994]. In the scope\
    \ of this implementation, two\nWilma instances are needed. One Wilma instance\
    \ is in charge of enforcing access policies\nover requests sent to the data infrastructure\
    \ [Alonso 2018]. When a DC is authenticated\nthrough Keyrock, an OAuth 2.0 token\
    \ is generated, which must be included in every\nrequest sent to the DP’s data\
    \ infrastructure. Wilma intercepts requests and asks Keyrock to\nvalidate the\
    \ token, verifying the DC’s identity. Since Keyrock also acts as the aPDP, it\n\
    checks the DC’s access authorization policies. In case that the DC’s request complies\
    \ with\nthe established policies, Wilma grants access to the requested resource.\
    \ With regard to data\niFIWARE Wilma: https://ﬁware-pep-proxy.readthedocs.io\n\

    the traces sent from the DC’s processing engine to the uPDP.\n• AuthZForce: The\
    \ AuthZForce GEi brings additional support to aPDP/PAP functions\nwithin an access\
    \ control schema based on the XACML standard. It has not been included\nin the\
    \ present implementation, but it could be used to create more advanced ﬁne-grained\n\
    authorization policies and to make decisions over requests received from PEPs.\n\
    • Orion:\nThe Context Broker (Orion) GEii manages the entire lifecycle of context\n\
    information including updates, queries, registrations and subscriptions.\nThe\
    \ Context\nBroker\noffers\nthe\nFIWARE\nNGSI\n(Next\nGeneration\nService\nInterface)\n\
    [Open Mobile Alliance 2012] APIs and associated information model (entity, attribute,\n\
    metadata) as the main interface for sharing data among stakeholders. In addition\
    \ to being\nthe centerpiece of any platform “powered by FIWARE”, the Context Broker\
    \ has been\nrecognized as a CEF Building Block, which is one step forward on its\
    \ path towards\niFIWARE AuthZForce: https://authzforce-ce-ﬁware.readthedocs.io\n\

    \ IMPLEMENTATION\nFigure 4.4 : Workﬂow for the DC\nbecoming a global standard\
    \ for large scale contextual information management\n[Digital CEF 2018] . In the\
    \ context of this implementation, it constitutes the DP’s data\ninfrastructure\
    \ and SDS, which enables the sharing of data between the DC and the DP in\na secure\
    \ way. In other words, the DP makes use of the NGSI API provided by the Orion\n\
    Context Broker in order to publish or expose the data they have to offer, whereas\
    \ DCs\nretrieve or subscribe to said data.\n• Cosmos: The Cosmos GEi provides\
    \ an interface for integrating Apache Flink and Apache\nSpark with the rest of\
    \ the components in the FIWARE Ecosystem. Over the last years,\niFIWARE Cosmos:\
    \ https://ﬁware-cosmos-ﬂink.readthedocs.io\n93\nDATA USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\n\
    Apache Flink and Apache Spark have established themselves as the most popular\
    \ open-\nsource data processing frameworks. Both of them provide a wide assortment\
    \ of resources\nfor processing data both in streaming and batch modes. Since Apache\
    \ Spark and Apache\nFlink provide similar functionalities, an implementation with\
    \ only one of these frameworks\nis enough to validate the proposed architecture.\
    \ Therefore, for the implementation presented\nin this work, I have relied on\
    \ the Apache Flink as the processing engine on the DC’s side,\nin charge of performing\
    \ operations on the DP’s data.\n• Draco: The Draco GEi is aimed at providing storage\
    \ of historical context data, allowing to\nreceive data events and dynamically\
    \ recording them with a predeﬁned structure in several\ndata storage systems.\
    \ In the scope of this implementation, Draco is proposed as the building\nblock\
    \ for providing the storage system in the DC’s infrastructure.\nThe aforementioned\
    \ FIWARE GEs provide all the features needed to implement the\ncomponents on the\
    \ DC’s side (processing engine and data storage), the access control\ncomponents\
    \ (PAP, PEP, and aPDP), the SDS, and the IdP. As the FIWARE catalogue lacks any\n\
    GEs that aid in the implementation of usage control capabilities, I have developed\
    \ several ad-hoc\ncomponents for this purpose that will be included as FIWARE\
    \ GEs in the near future:\n• The PTP is a piece of software written in Python\
    \ in charge of translating the ODRL usage\npolicies deﬁned through Keyrock into\
    \ a Complex Event Processing (CEP) program using the\nFlink CEP Scala API. Every\
    \ time the usage policies that apply to a certain DC are modiﬁed\nby the DP, a\
    \ new program is generated by the PTP containing a CEP rule for each policy.\n\
    This program is then compiled, packaged, and sent to the uPDP.\n• The uPDP is\
    \ an Apache Flink computation cluster that runs all the CEP programs generated\n\
    by the PTP: one for each DC. These programs take advantage of the CEP capabilities\
    \ of\nApache Flink in order to verify whether the DC complies with the policies\
    \ deﬁned by the DP\nor not. This is done by analyzing the traces generated by\
    \ the processing engine on the DC’s\nside (Apache Flink in this case) which are\
    \ sent to the uPDP. In the event of noncompliance,\nthe PXP is notiﬁed.\n• The\
    \ PXP is a piece of software that is notiﬁed each time the uPDP detects policy\n\
    noncompliance. It is written in Scala and attached to each program that runs on\
    \ the uPDP.\nThe PXP enforces the control signal established by the DP for the\
    \ unfulﬁlled policy. For\ninstance, in order to stop a DC from receiving data\
    \ as a punishment for policy\nnoncompliance, the control signal sent by the PXP\
    \ is an unsubscription request to Orion. If\nthe DC is, in turn, processing data\
    \ in an incorrect manner, one way to punish this policy\nviolation would be to\
    \ send a control signal that kills the processing job on the DC’s side.\niFIWARE\

    Figure 4.5 : Data usage control architecture using FIWARE\nThese are the control\
    \ signals that have been implemented so far, but the goal is to extend\nthe capabilities\
    \ of the PXP in order to support custom control signals written by the DP.\nFig.\
    \ 4.5 shows the data usage architecture proposed using the aforementioned FIWARE\
    \ GEs\nand ad-hoc components developed, as well as the workﬂow mechanism presented\
    \ in subsection\n4.4.3. The operation ﬂow during one usage decision process is\
    \ deﬁned as follows:\n• The DC sends a subscription request to the Orion Context\
    \ Broker in order to retrieve data\nfrom the DP.\n• The subscription request is\
    \ intercepted by the access PEP Proxy and validated by the IdP\nand the aPDP by\
    \ checking whether the token containing the user information is valid an if\n\
    the user has the right to access the requested resource.\n• Once the subscription\
    \ is done, the DC starts receiving data from the Orion Context Broker\nat the\
    \ processing engine. The traces generated by the program containing all the operations\n\
    performed on data are sent to the uPDP, verifying the DC’s identity through the\
    \ usage PEP\nProxy. Moreover, this instance of the PEP Proxy is in charge of redirecting\
    \ the traces to\n95\nDATA USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\neach speciﬁc uPDP CEP\
    \ program. When translating the deﬁned ODRL policies for a DC,\nthe PTP generates\
    \ a new CEP program and maps the port where it runs to the DC. Thus,\nwhen receiving\
    \ the traces and after verifying the DC’s identity, the PEP Proxy knows the\n\
    port in which the corresponding CEP program is running and can redirect the traces\
    \ to it.\nThe uPDP then veriﬁes that the DC complies with all the policies deﬁned\
    \ through the PAP.\nOtherwise, the uPDP notiﬁes the PXP, who sends the corresponding\
    \ control signal.\n4.6\nValidation: A case study in the food industry\nIn order\
    \ to validate the proposed architecture and implementation using FIWARE, a case\
    \ study\nhas been developed in the food industry. The components presented in\
    \ the implementation section\nhave been deployed in order to perform the policy\
    \ deﬁnition and enforcement in a shared data\necosystem. The main goal of this\
    \ case study is to perform access and usage control over industrial\ndata.\n4.6.1\n\
    Scenario overview\nThe scenario is composed by two actors: a food company (DP)\
    \ and a marketing company (DC).\nThe former generates a great amount of data on\
    \ a daily basis every time a client makes a purchase\nat one of their grocery\
    \ stores, which are later used for internal big data analysis. One data record\n\
    is generated for each purchase, which consists of the client id, the payment method,\
    \ and the list\nof products purchased, including the product name, price and quantity.\
    \ The board of the company\nrealizes that if they were to share these data, they\
    \ would allow other businesses to ﬁnd new ways of\nextracting value from them,\
    \ thus creating another source of revenue for the company. A marketing\ncompany\
    \ is interested in the food company’s real-time data in order to identify trends\
    \ and carry\nout instantaneous special offers that take these into account. In\
    \ order for the marketing company\nto be able to make this analysis, the food\
    \ company has to provide a real-time channel to make\ntheir data available to\
    \ them. However, the food company wants to keep the marketing company\nfrom making\
    \ an incorrect use of the data that would jeopardize customers’ privacy. For the\
    \ sake\nof data protection, a set of usage control policies are deﬁned in order\
    \ to enforce some constraints\nover the shared data. In this scenario, the DC\
    \ deploys one Flink Cluster for performing all the data\nprocessing operations.\
    \ On the other hand, the DP deploys all the components showed on the right\nside\
    \ of Fig 4.4, including the data generated and published by the cash registers\
    \ on the Context\nBroker as part of the data infrastructure stakeholder.\n4.6.2\n\
    Policy speciﬁcation\nIn the proposed scenario, the DP deﬁnes two main policies\
    \ regarding data usage that apply to any\nexternal DC. The natural language deﬁnition\
    \ for these policies is:\n96\n4.6. VALIDATION: A CASE STUDY IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY\n\
    • Policy A: The DC shall NOT save the data without aggregating them every 15 minutes\
    \ ﬁrst\nor else the processing job will be terminated\n• Policy B: The DC shall\
    \ NOT receive more than 200 notiﬁcations from the Context Broker\nin a minute\
    \ or else the subscription to the entity will be deleted\nAs mentioned, in order\
    \ to take full advantage of all the capabilities of data usage control, usage\n\
    policies must be deﬁned by using a policy speciﬁcation language and, although\
    \ ODRL provides\na powerful interface to deﬁne these [Steyskal 2015], in the future,\
    \ it will be necessary to develop\nof new vocabularies and ontologies for tackling\
    \ some currently uncovered cases. However, in this\ncase study I include a ﬁrst\
    \ approximation of the use of ODRL in order to declare the two policies\nthat\
    \ have been presented in natural language. The aim of using ODRL is to provide\
    \ dynamic\ncapabilities so as to enable the PTP to generate an extended automaton\
    \ on the basis of the policies,\nthat will run on the uPDP.\n{\n\"@context\":\

    4.6.3\nData processing and policy enforcement\nOnce the policies have been deﬁned,\
    \ the DC may start to deploy processing jobs on their own\ninfrastructure with\
    \ the aim of extracting value from the supermarket data received. In order to\n\
    validate the two policies deﬁned by the DP, I have created two sample jobs that\
    \ operate on the\nDP’s data:\nJob I: Direct sinking of ticket data\nThe ﬁrst job\
    \ reads the data received from the DP and sends\nthem somewhere else, outside\
    \ of the scope of the data usage architecture, where operations on\ndata are not\
    \ monitored. Since this use allows the DC to process each piece of data individually,\n\
    without prior aggregation, it is a clear violation of Policy A. When the DC deploys\
    \ this job in the\nFlink Cluster, an execution graph is calculated from the program\
    \ code, such as the one in Fig. 4.6.\nFigure 4.6 : Simpliﬁed Execution Graph of\
    \ Job I\nThe log containing the chain of operations is sent to the uPDP, which\
    \ will detect that the\nexecution graph contains no aggregation of data, thus\
    \ failing to comply with Policy A. The uPDP\nwill inform the PXP of this violation,\
    \ which will send the corresponding control signal described\nin the policy; in\
    \ this case, terminating the job as a punishment for noncompliance.\n99\nDATA\
    \ USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\nJob II: Calculating average ticket price\nThe\
    \ second job calculates the average ticket price for\nall the clients of each\
    \ store every hour. This operation is an aggregation of data so, when the\nExecution\
    \ Graph is checked by the uPDP, it will be veriﬁed that it complies with Policy\
    \ A. Fig.\n4.7 shows the execution graph generated for this use case.\nFigure\
    \ 4.7 : Simpliﬁed Execution Graph of Job II\nEach time the DC receives information\
    \ from one ticket, this event is logged and sent to the\nuPDP. If the uPDP detects\
    \ that the DC has received more tickets than the amount speciﬁed by\nPolicy B\
    \ (200), the PXP will be notiﬁed and will enforce the corresponding punishment\
    \ (i.e.\nremoving the subscription to the tickets’ data).\nOverall, the case study\
    \ presented in this section, including the deployment of both DC’s jobs,\nshows\
    \ that the data usage architecture provides a way of verifying that the DC complies\
    \ with a set\nof predeﬁned policies by the DP and of executing punishments in\
    \ case of noncompliance.\n4.6.4\nResults\nThis subsection presents a series of\
    \ metrics carried out in the case study presented that aim to\ncalculate the enforcement\
    \ time of the policies deﬁned. To this end, the two jobs presented were\ndeployed,\
    \ achieving noncompliance conditions for both of them.\nIn accordance with the\
    \ scheme presented in the implementation section, I deﬁne the\ndeployment of all\
    \ the components as follows: every building block of the DC and DP was\ndeployed\
    \ using Docker Containersi. However, in order to test the usage control policies\
    \ and\nobtain more accurate metrics, I deployed the DC and the DP in different\
    \ platforms. On the one\nhand, the DP’s containers were placed inside of a VM\
    \ (Virtual Machine) in an Edge Computing\nInfrastructure using OpenStackii, this\
    \ VM has the following features: 2VCPU’s, 4GB RAM,\n40GB Disk. On the other hand,\
    \ the DC’s containers were placed in a local server located in the\nsame network\
    \ as the DP’s VM with the following speciﬁcations: 4.0 GHz Intel core I7 CPU with\n\
    8GB RAM and 256 SSD Disk. This deployment allowed testing different policies and\
    \ measure\noverhead time.\nThe workﬂow of submitting a job on the DC’s side, detecting\
    \ the policy\nnoncompliance, and enforcing the due punishment was repeated N times\
    \ (N = 100) for each\npolicy.\nThrough the system logs generated by the DC’s and\
    \ DP’s containers, three different\nmetrics were calculated:\niDocker: https://www.docker.com\n\
    iiOpenStack: https://www.openstack.org\n100\n4.6. VALIDATION: A CASE STUDY IN\
    \ THE FOOD INDUSTRY\n• Decision time (Td): Time between the policy infringement\
    \ on the DC’s side and the\ndetection of said infringement at the uPDP on the\
    \ DP’s side.\n• Execution time (Tx): Time between the policy infringement detection\
    \ at the uPDP and the\nexecution of the punishment at the PXP.\n• Total enforcement\
    \ time (Tt): Sum of Td and Tx.\nTable 4.2 summarizes the results obtained for\
    \ each policy and interval, including the mean\ntime (M) and the standard deviation\
    \ (SD). The results for each iteration can be seen in Fig. 4.8\nand 4.9.\nFigure\

    \ CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\nFigure 4.9 : Policy B enforcement metrics\nAs is apparent\
    \ from the results shown in Table 4.2, the times registered for Td are signiﬁcantly\n\
    larger than those recorded for Tx. The main reason for this difference is the\
    \ fact that Td involves\ngenerating the logs on the DC’s side, writing them on\
    \ the processing engine’s log ﬁle and sending\nthem to the uPDP, which will receive\
    \ them after they are ﬁrst veriﬁed by the PEP. By contrast, the\nTx is very low\
    \ since the PXP is embedded in the same program that the uPDP is running, which\n\
    means that the delay introduced stems from the time it takes to receive an acknowledgement\
    \ from\nthe control signal sent to the system in charge of performing the actual\
    \ punishment (to the Context\nBroker in order to remove a subscription, or to\
    \ the DC’s processing engine to cancel the job).\nFurthermore, the slight difference\
    \ in measurements for Tx between policies A and B draws\nfrom the difference in\
    \ response times between the Context Broker and the processing engine on\nthe\
    \ DC’s side. On the other hand, the difference in Td between policies A and B\
    \ is due to the\nfact that, in the former, the noncompliance is detected by inspecting\
    \ the execution graph, which is\nreceived by the uPDP as a single log, whereas\
    \ in the latter, the uPDP needs to inspect the message\nhistory to conﬁrm that\
    \ the notiﬁcation limit established within the policy has been exceeded, which\n\
    is a more costly operation.\nAs far as the total time (Tt) is concerned, the Tx\
    \ can be neglected for its calculation if the\npunishment does not involve interacting\
    \ with stakeholders outside a shared network (the Context\nBroker, for instance).\
    \ Otherwise, the network latency needs to be taken into account. This holds\n\
    true for the Td as well, since typically the DC and the DP are in physically separate\
    \ networks.\n102\n4.7. CONCLUSIONS\nThe results obtained for Tt fall within a\
    \ reasonable range of values for most use cases, in which\nnew data are generated\
    \ every second or few seconds. However, in scenarios in which new data are\npublished\
    \ within milliseconds, there could be a period between the infringement of the\
    \ rules and\nthe enforcement of the punishments in which new data are unduly received\
    \ by the DC. In order to\nverify that this was not the case, I tested the solution\
    \ under different stress situations. I deployed\nthe use case scenario using different\
    \ frequencies of generation of new data. The main goal was to\ncorroborate that\
    \ no additional data events arrived from the moment an infringement was committed\n\
    and the moment that the due punishment was executed. The use case scenario was\
    \ tested for\ndata generation periods ranging from 5s to 25ms (5s, 1s, 500ms,\
    \ 250ms, 100ms, 50ms, 25ms),\nrepeating each simulation 100 times. I found that\
    \ all the situations of data infringement were\ndetected and the appropriate punishment\
    \ was enforced in due time in 100% of the cases. Thus, no\nnew information was\
    \ unduly received after failing to comply with a certain policy. Nevertheless,\n\
    it is worth pointing out that, for periods under 25ms, I have to consider the\
    \ throughput limit of the\nSDS (in this case the Context Broker) since this component\
    \ is the one that determines the actual\nspeed at which data will be sent to the\
    \ endpoints that are subscribed to new data.\nPrior works [Wu 2015, Marra 2017]\
    \ have also collected a series of metrics in order to validate\ntheir models.\
    \ For example, [Marra 2017] determines if the performance of their usage control\n\
    system is higher whether it is applied to local or remote attributes.\nFurthermore,\
    \ instead of\nmeasuring enforcement time, [Wu 2015] focuses on performance at\
    \ the access control level.\nAlthough an exact comparison between said models\
    \ and the one presented in this work cannot be\nperformed, since none of the works\
    \ found in the existing literature provide measurements of the\ndecision and enforcement\
    \ times, it can be seen that the measurements for delay and response\ntimes are\
    \ in the same order of magnitude.\nThe implementation of the architecture presented\
    \ in this thesis provides a comprehensive and\naffordable solution for providing\
    \ access and usage control in industrial data ecosystems. One of\nthe advantages\
    \ of this proposal stems in the fact that it is suitable for being implemented\
    \ in a\nwide range of different scenarios since it is a technology-agnostic solution.\
    \ Moreover, this piece\nof research also presents an implementation of the referenced\
    \ architecture using FIWARE\nGeneric Enablers that completes the previously proposed\
    \ implementation of IDS architecture\n[Alonso 2018]. The implementation presented\
    \ has been validated with a use case in the food\nindustry, presenting a series\
    \ of metrics of the response time of policy compliance veriﬁcation and\npunishment\
    \ enforcement. The data usage control components developed in the scope of this\
    \ work\n(uPDP, PXP and PTP) have been proposed and accepted as a new Generic Enabler\
    \ in the\nFIWARE catalogue.\n4.7\nConclusions\nThe implementation of the architecture\
    \ presented in this chapter provides a comprehensive and\naffordable solution\
    \ for providing access and usage control in industrial data ecosystems. One of\n\
    103\nDATA USAGE CONTROL FOR DATA SPACES\nthe advantages of this proposal stems\

    \ a policy speciﬁcation language\ncapable of handling the ﬁne-grained policy deﬁnitions\
    \ in order to provide the data usage control\ncapabilities in Industry. Furthermore,\
    \ I consider this architecture could be expanded to provide\nGDPR compliance by\
    \ introducing the GDPR regulation rules inside the deﬁnition of the policies\n\
    and deploying them inside this architecture.\nI will focus the future efforts\
    \ on the Policy\nSpeciﬁcation Language deﬁnition, conceived as an extension of\
    \ ODRL, as Ill as the deﬁnition of\na common vocabulary that allows to standardize\
    \ and identify the events and traces of the system\nfor the different processing\
    \ engines. Additionally, I intend to develop new and more complex\ntests that\
    \ allow us to extract additional metrics in the scope of data protection.\n104\n\
    Chapter 5\nValidation and Results\nIn this chapter, I describe the work developed\
    \ during these four years of research serving as\nvalidation of the results obtained.\n\
    First, I present the works made in international research\nprojects. In his section,\
    \ I will provide details about the work conducted in each of them according\n\
    to the proposals of this thesis. The second block of this section corresponds\
    \ to the dissemination\nof the results. These are composed by the publication\
    \ of articles in Journals and Conferences and\neven are considered some seminars\
    \ and curses imparted about the contributions presented in this\ndocument.\n5.1\n\
    International Projects\n5.1.1\nFIWARE, FICORE and FI-NEXT\nThese are projects\
    \ with European ﬁnancing that are very closely related between them FICORE\nis\
    \ the continuation of FIWARE and the goal of both is the creation of a technological\
    \ ecosystem\nbased on generic and re-utilizable components known as General Capabilities\
    \ for the Internet of\nthe Future.\nThe aim of the FI-NEXT project is to put in\
    \ place all the measures necessary in order to make\nFIWARE materializing such\
    \ a potential. This will achieved pursuing the following objectives: a)\nbringing\
    \ FIWARE from an European Open Source project to a global Open Source Community,\
    \ b)\nensuring FIWARE meets the highest quality standards and best technical support,\
    \ c) positioning\nFIWARE as the de facto standard for the development of smart\
    \ applications, and d) ensuring\nFIWARE Lab to be a self-sustainable environment.\n\
    Our group has been contributing to this project on three main topics, Security,\
    \ Data\nPersistence, and Data Analytics. In this regard, we are owners of three\
    \ Generic enables that have\nbeen presented in the previous chapters. First Keyrock\
    \ in the security chapter. Second, Draco for\ndata persistence and prepossessing\
    \ system and connectors for context-aware systems and ﬁnally\nCosmos, for providing\
    \ data connectors in order to provide big data analytic of the Data. In this\n\
    project, I centered my work on developing a new data persistence model for Draco\
    \ and\nparticipate in the migration of the previous model of NGSIv1, to NGSIv2\
    \ and ﬁnally to\nNGSI-LD. Moreover, I developed a set of templates and processors\
    \ for allowing data\npre-processing capabilities compatible with big data systems.\
    \ Additionally, in terms of Big Data,\nI participated in the analysis and design\
    \ of the data connector between the core GE and the most\npopular Big Data frameworks.\
    \ As is clearly stated the main contributions of this thesis are clearly\nVALIDATION\

    \ useful during daily operations. This project presents a tool will act as a single\
    \ source of\ninformation for airport operators.\nSome of its most notable features\

    In this regard, our research group was in charge of\nconﬁguring and deploying\
    \ the FIWARE infrastructure, modelling data and customizing FIWARE\ncomponents\
    \ to the requirements of the service. This solution was implemented at the Aberdeen\n\
    International Airport, located in Scotland, UK. The airport is owned and operated\
    \ by AGS\nAirports which also owns and operates Glasgow and Southampton airports.\
    \ A total of just under\n3.1 million passengers used the airport in 2018 with\
    \ more than 90,000 movements. Thanks to the\nA/RporTWIN deployment, operators\
    \ can visualize and manage turnaround operations and\ncommunicate with airport\
    \ staff for scheduling ﬂights and reporting delays in near real-time with a\n\
    digital solution.\nThe work developed in this project serves as a starting point\

    \ a review of the conclusions extracted throughout the work presented in\nthis\
    \ thesis. I started this document by conducting an analysis of the current services\
    \ developed\nfor providing context-aware data analytics in smart spaces and their\
    \ evolution in the latest years.\nMoreover, I stated how the data generated by\
    \ these systems has become an important asset in the\nindustry, and also a concern\
    \ about how it can be guaranteed that this data is treated according to\nthe permissions\
    \ provided by the data owner.\nOne of the goals of context-aware systems is to\
    \ capture and process the information in the\ncontext of a device to provide services\
    \ built on a particular person, place, time, event, etc. Worded\ndifferently,\
    \ context-aware systems capture context, analyze and interpret the context, and\
    \ make\nadjustments to the system’s behavior for the user’s changing situation\
    \ without explicit intervention\nfrom the user. The majority of existing works\
    \ often provide a generic high-level structure of how a\ncontext-aware system\
    \ can be operationalized, but do not offer many clues on how to implement it.\n\
    On the other hand, there are many implementations of context-aware systems applied\
    \ to speciﬁc\nIoT-based smart spaces use cases (e.g., smart farming, smart cities).\
    \ However, although these\nimplementations are context-aware, they are also context-speciﬁc:\
    \ it is not clear how they can be\nextended to other use cases.\nAdditionally,\
    \ providing a secure ecosystem for data sharing that ensures data governance and\n\
    traceability is of paramount importance as it holds the potential to create new\
    \ applications and\nservices.\nProtecting data goes beyond restricting who can\
    \ access what resource (covered by\nidentity and access control respectively):\
    \ it becomes necessary to control how data are treated\nonce accessed, which is\
    \ known as data usage control. Data usage control provides a common and\ntrustful\
    \ security framework to guarantee the compliance with data governance rules and\n\
    responsible use of organizations’ data by third-party entities, easing and ensuring\
    \ secure data\nsharing.\nThis thesis provided a reference implementation that\
    \ can be used in any context-aware system\ndevelopment of an IoT-based smart space.\
    \ Afterward, the data generated by these systems need to\nbe protected in terms\
    \ of privacy and security. As such, another contribution covered by this thesis\n\
    deals with providing a data usage control solution that can manage all the data\
    \ generated by the\ncontext-aware systems used in smart spaces.\nThese challenges\
    \ motivate the questions that I presented in the introduction of this document\n\
    and serve as a starting point for beginning to develop the contributions of this\
    \ thesis. Now with\nall of this background, I will try to give the answers to\
    \ these questions based on the knowledge\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\nobtained\
    \ in this work.\nWhat should be the design characteristics of an architecture\
    \ capable of enabling context-\naware data analytics in smart spaces?\nThe ﬁrst\
    \ step for answering this question is conducting an analysis of the structure\
    \ that context-\naware systems often have but also identify the additional components\
    \ that need to be included in\norder to enable data analytics for these systems\
    \ in smart spaces.\nThe study of the structure of context-aware systems was conducted\
    \ in section 3.3. As was\nstated in that section, context-aware systems are presented\
    \ as a layered architecture segmented by\nthe different types of service that\
    \ provide every of the described components. This structure can\nadd or subtract\
    \ layers depending on the use case or the ﬁeld of application, making more complex\n\
    the adoption of a common framework to manage these types of systems. Moreover,\
    \ smart spaces\ncan have several devices and systems that generate a huge amount\
    \ of data. According to the review\nof the literature conducted in this work,\
    \ current solutions of context-aware systems are not ready\nto deal with these\
    \ types of issues. For ﬁlling this gap, big data and data engineering tools play\
    \ an\nimportant role in improving the architecture of context-aware systems.\n\
    This analysis serves as a starting point for determining how an architecture capable\
    \ of\nproviding context-aware data analytics in smart spaces should be designed,\
    \ that I conducted in\nsection 3.4. This proposal was used and validated in several\
    \ European projects such as FIWARE,\nFI-Core, and YODA, which promote the use\
    \ of Generic enablers for providing a technological\necosystem for Smart Cities\
    \ and in consequence give to the European Citizens the opportunity to\nextract\
    \ the value of the data. From this model, I proposed design patterns that were\
    \ fundamental\nfor designing the proposed architecture:\n• Service Oriented Components\
    \ - The architecture should be generic and modular. This\npattern aims to provide\
    \ a strong segmentation of the services by means of that every\ncomponent must\
    \ be dedicated to a speciﬁc task in the whole system. For example, the\nContext\
    \ Management layer has focused only in managing the context while the physical\n\
    layer is focused only on data collection from devices and systems.\n• Scalability\
    \ - For allowing replication, in case that more resources were needed, the system\n\
    is able to add more components for allowing the continuous availability of the\
    \ system.\n• Generic - Providing a reference architecture that can be used in\
    \ any data space regardless\nof the ﬁeld of application. This means that the systems\
    \ can be used and deployed in ﬁelds\nlike Smart Transportation, Smart Health,\
    \ Smart Industry, etc. without having to change the\ncore structure of the system.\n\
    • Distributed Processing - Depending on the needs in every moment or the load\
    \ of data\nmanaged, the system can distribute the work to different instances\
    \ for processing the data\n112\nwithout any interruption of the system.\nThis\
    \ also has a direct impact on reducing the\nresponse time of the system.\n• Data\
    \ Standardization - For providing a common framework for collect, store and retrieve\n\
    data in addition to promote cross-domain data sharing.\nThrough these patterns,\
    \ I designed an architecture that not only enables data analytics in\ncontext-aware\
    \ systems but also is scalable, standardized, fully distributed, and agnostic\
    \ to the\nﬁeld of application.\nHow can advanced data processing and machine learning\
    \ techniques be integrated into\nthe aforementioned architecture?\nIn the review\
    \ of the architecture proposed, one of the layers is dedicated to Context Processing.\n\
    Context processing is introduced in this proposal for providing big data processing\
    \ using context\ninformation coming from the data generated in smart spaces. Also,\
    \ I stated that, in this component,\nthe processing capabilities are relied on\
    \ well-know big data processing engines like Apache Spark\nand Apache Flink.\n\
    In addition to the usual tasks performed by these engines, advanced operations\
    \ like complex\nevent processing can be performed and even extended by the use\
    \ of libraries for including machine\nlearning resources to be used with data,\
    \ providing a set of resources and algorithms that can be\noperationalized for\
    \ build things like recommendation systems, predictors, data clustering, deep\n\
    learning and more.\nAt this point, it is clearly identiﬁed that the proposed architecture\
    \ and technological tools allow\nthe use of machine learning techniques for deﬁning\
    \ these type of system application. To provide a\nfull view of how these systems\
    \ can be implemented in a real scenario, I provide the implementation\nof a purchase\
    \ prediction system using the proposed architecture in a food industry scenario.\n\
    The implementation presented in section 3.5 provides all the details needed to\
    \ build and\ndeploy solutions based on Machine learning models that can be fed\
    \ with a static dataset and work\nwith data coming from external applications.\n\
    Here I pose the deﬁnition of the pipelines for\nimplementing this application.\
    \ These pipelines are based on Data Engineering techniques for\ndeﬁning connections\
    \ between the components and being able to provide the capabilities needed\nby\
    \ machine learning-based applications.\nAs part of the solution presented in that\
    \ section, additional descriptions are provided about\nhow to connect the components\
    \ of the architecture, which components are needed for that type of\nscenario,\
    \ and what the life cycle of the whole process is for deﬁning the machine learning\
    \ model\nbased on a real dataset. Thus, due to the design patterns deﬁned for\
    \ building the architecture and\nthe reference implementation provided in the\
    \ prior sections, the integration of advanced data\nprocessing using machine learning\
    \ techniques is fully achieved not only by the proposed\narchitecture but also\
    \ by the detailed use case presented.\n113\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\nHow\
    \ should an architecture for providing data usage control in smart spaces be designed\n\
    so that it can be used in data sharing ecosystems with multiple stakeholders?\n\
    In order to answer this question, I made a review of the current solutions available\
    \ in the literature.\nAfterward, I identiﬁed and deﬁned a set of design principles\
    \ needed for posing an architecture for\nproviding data usage control in smart\
    \ spaces.\nAs was presented in section 4.3 previous works have failed to provide\
    \ a standard solution for\nachieving data Usage Control in data-sharing ecosystems.\
    \ None of the works reviewed provides\nadvanced Access Control and Usage Control\
    \ capabilities in architectures with several agents\ninvolved, while supporting\
    \ an expressive policy deﬁnition language that allows the deﬁnition of\nobligations,\
    \ prohibitions and permissions and providing remediation functionalities in the\
    \ event\nof policy infringement.\nThis research contributes to ﬁll the gap in\
    \ the existing literature by\nproviding a generic multi-actor architecture to\
    \ achieve advanced data access and usage control\ncapabilities in real-time data-sharing\
    \ scenarios.\nSubsequently to the conducted analysis. I deﬁne the design principles\
    \ for this architecture, and\nthese can be summarized as follows:\n• Trust. It\
    \ is a pillar of any data-sharing ecosystem. In this case, I rely on this design\
    \ principle\non IDS Connectors to provide a trusted environment that enables the\
    \ achievement of data\nusage control.\n• Interoperability.\nStandardization of\
    \ protocols is crucial to ensure the understanding\nbetween all the components\
    \ involved in the architecture, for managing both usage control\nand identity.\n\
    • Governance. For providing ways to respect and protect the data of all the parties\
    \ involved\nis one of the main requirements that data usage control must fulﬁll.\n\
    • Performance. The accomplishment of data usage control policies can be only ensured\
    \ if\nreaction to policies violation is quick and efﬁcient.\n• Flexibility. As\
    \ many data sharing scenarios and use cases are contemplated, the solution has\n\
    to be adaptable to the speciﬁc requirements of such scenarios.\nThese design principles\
    \ were taken as the core consideration for building the architecture\npresented\
    \ in this thesis, considering not only a single data space but also providing\
    \ a solution\nwhen a multiple actors are involved. In this architecture ,I also\
    \ present a solution that provides a\ndata usage control in data sharing ecosystems\
    \ with multiple stakeholders.\nHow can the implementation feasibility of the proposed\
    \ data usage control architecture\nbe veriﬁed?\nThe answer to this question is\
    \ described in section 4.6. I present a validation of the proposed\n114\n6.1.\
    \ CONCLUSIONS\narchitecture and implementation using FIWARE, presenting a case\
    \ study in the food industry. The\ncomponents presented in the implementation\
    \ section have been deployed in order to perform the\npolicy deﬁnition and enforcement\
    \ in a shared data ecosystem. The main goals of this case study\nare to validate\
    \ and perform usage control over industrial data.\nIn this use case, I present\
    \ an overview of the scenario used for this validation, which uses the\narchitecture\
    \ proposed in chapter 4 for performing data usage control over that deployment.\
    \ The\ngoal of this use case is to determine the enforcement and execution times\
    \ of the policies deﬁned\nover the data that feed the previously mentioned infrastructure.\n\
    In this regard, a set of usage policies were deﬁned by a set of jobs. Overall,\
    \ the case study\npresented in that section, including the deployment of both\
    \ DC’s jobs, shows that the data usage\narchitecture provides a way of verifying\
    \ that the implementation complies with a set of predeﬁned\npolicies by a Data\
    \ Provider and of executing punishments in case of noncompliance.\nThe use case\
    \ scenario was tested for data generation periods ranging from 5s to 25ms (5s,\
    \ 1s,\n500ms, 250ms, 100ms, 50ms, 25ms), repeating each simulation 100 times.\
    \ I found that all the\nsituations of data infringement were detected and the\
    \ appropriate punishment was enforced in due\ntime in 100% of the cases. Thus,\
    \ no new information was unduly received after failing to comply\nwith a certain\
    \ policy. Thus, this validation analysis provides a feasible way to demonstrate\
    \ that the\nsolution presented is not only trustfully but also effective in terms\
    \ of infringement detection and\npunishment enforcement.\n6.1\nConclusions\nOnce\
    \ I have veriﬁed that the content proposed during this work is valid to answer\
    \ the questions\nposed at the beginning and in consequence the set objectives\
    \ are achieved. In this section, I\nsummarize the two main contributions that\
    \ this thesis promote to the research in data engineering,\ndata analytics for\
    \ context-aware systems and data usage control. These contributions match with\n\
    the work presented in the two core chapters of this document, chapters 3 and 4:\n\
    • Enabling Context-aware Data Analytics in Smart Spaces.\nFirst, I have conducted\
    \ an analysis of the challenges and opportunities that are presented in\ndata\
    \ analytics for context-aware systems focused on smart spaces. This analysis provided\n\
    me with a general overview to determine the key characteristics that I have to\
    \ include for\ndesigning an architecture that enables context-aware data analytics\
    \ in smart spaces.\nOnce I had the knowledge of all the pieces that I needed to\
    \ include, I designed the\narchitecture using generic components with a service-oriented\
    \ approach. After, I provided\nan implementation of this architecture relying\
    \ on the FIWARE Generic enablers and\npresenting this solution in that open source\
    \ community.\nThe last part of this contribution consists in presenting a set\
    \ of uses cases that provides a\nwalk-through guide for deploying this architecture\
    \ in different ﬁelds of application, not only\n115\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n\
    providing a typical example but also an advanced use case for providing a predictive\
    \ model\nusing machine learning algorithms.\n• Promote Data Usage Control in Smart\
    \ Spaces with multiple stakeholders\nThe ﬁrst part of this contribution is focused\
    \ on providing solid design principles for building\nan architecture for providing\
    \ data usage control in data spaces over data sharing ecosystems.\nThis is achieved\
    \ by conducting a deep review of the current literature.\nAfterward, an implementation\
    \ is provided using FIWARE components for building the\nusage control infrastructure\
    \ and using as monitored infrastructure the food industry use\ncase developed\
    \ in Chapter 3. Additionally, a new proﬁle of a Policy Deﬁnition Language\n(ODRL)\
    \ is proposed and accepted by the W3C as a proﬁle for deﬁning data usage control\n\
    policies for big data environments.\nAnother contribution of this work is providing\
    \ all the software pieces needed for creating,\nconnecting, and monitoring data\
    \ usage control policies over data assets that are processed\nin streaming.\n\
    Finally, the last contribution of this chapter is providing a validation mechanism\
    \ that can be\nadopted by different data usage control platforms for determining\
    \ compliance time through\nthe analysis of the enforcement and execution time\
    \ of the data usage policies.\n6.2\nFuture Work\nIn each of the core chapters\
    \ of this document, I have presented some ideas for future work that can\nimprove\
    \ or provide new lines of research related to the contributions presented. In\
    \ this section, I\nsummarize a list of proposals of future research lines that\
    \ could be interesting for being added as\nnew works or as a continuation of the\
    \ posed in this document.\n• Provide an Edge computing Adaptation - Nowadays,\
    \ multiple researchers have focused on\ndeveloping solutions for contributing\
    \ to the ﬁeld of edge computing in a smart spaces. I\nhave identiﬁed that at a\
    \ conceptual level, this architecture can be easily adapted for its use\nin edge\
    \ computing. However, some further research needs to be conducted for adopting\
    \ in\nterms of implementation and the components that need to include for dealing\
    \ with the new\nrequirements of this type of environments.\n• Improvements for\
    \ managing Federated Learning Models - In the same line of the previous\nfuture\
    \ work, in order to take full advantage of edge computing, a new type of processing\n\
    has become a good solution for avoiding privacy issues and the problems that generate\n\
    the use of big computational resources. In this regard, Federated Leaning has\
    \ become an\ninteresting line of research for providing pre-processing in the\
    \ same place where the data is\ngenerated. Thus, this architecture also can be\
    \ improved for providing also federated learning\ncapabilities in the environment\
    \ that need to adopt this type of technology.\n116\n6.2. FUTURE WORK\n• Include\
    \ a data lake oriented Approach for data persistence - In recent years the adoption\
    \ of\ndata Lake as a way to persistence in different storage systems has become\
    \ very popular due\nto the advantages that this technology introduces in all the\
    \ systems considered as smart. An\ninteresting future work could be to adopt a\
    \ data lake approach for the presented\ninfrastructure.\nDespite that the current\
    \ architecture provides multiple connectors to\ndifferent storage systems, a data\
    \ lake approach could facilitate the exchange and\nstandardization of the data\
    \ in smart spaces.\n• Expand the architecture to provide GDPR compliance - I consider\
    \ this architecture could\nbe expanded to provide GDPR compliance by introducing\
    \ the GDPR regulation rules inside\nthe deﬁnition of the policies and deploying\
    \ them inside this architecture.\n• Expansion of the policy speciﬁcation language\
    \ - I identify the need of deﬁning a policy\nspeciﬁcation language capable of\
    \ handling the ﬁne-grained policy deﬁnitions in order to\nprovide the data usage\
    \ control capabilities in the Industry.\n117\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n118\n\

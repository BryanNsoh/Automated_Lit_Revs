However, it has a short time span and irregular revisit schedules. Utilizing a state-of-the-art time series deep learning neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), we created a system that predicts SMAP level-3 moisture product with atmospheric forcings, model-simulated moisture, and static physiographic attributes as inputs. The system removes most of the bias with model simulations and improves predicted moisture climatology, achieving small test root-mean-square errors (<0.035) and high-correlation coefficients >0.87 for over 75% of Continental United States, including the forested southeast. As the first application of LSTM in hydrology, we show the proposed network avoids overfitting and is robust for both temporal and spatial extrapolation tests. LSTM generalizes well across regions with distinct climates and environmental settings. With high fidelity to SMAP, LSTM shows great potential for hindcasting, data assimilation, and weather forecasting. Key Points With 2 years of data, SMAP L3 data can be extended at high fidelity using a deep learning network (LSTM), showing potential for hindcasting Despite significant, spatially varying bias in Land Surface Models, LSTM can remove bias, correct moisture climatology, and capture extremes LSTM is more generalizable than simpler methods, and its strength seems to derive from its memory and ability to accommodate large data Plain Language Summary Soil moisture is the water content in soil, and it is a critical component of the water cycle. It controls whether crops or wild vegetation can function properly, the risk of wildfire, and the likelihood of floods. The NASA satellite SMAP, launched in 2015, measures soil moisture near the ground surface over Earth at high accuracy. SMAP data are of great value to global communities to which soil moisture is relevant. However, since it was launched only recently, there is only little overlap with other data sets, which limits its use. To extend SMAP's observations in time, we employ a \\u201cdeep learning\\u201d technology called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is one of the pillars of artificial intelligence and is bringing revolutionary changes in many scientific fields and our daily lives. We use LSTM to learn patterns of soil moisture dynamics and where physics-based models make mistakes in describing moisture changes. This approach shows great promise for projecting SMAP observations into the long past: because soil moisture has a short memory, 2 years of data seem sufficient to train LSTM to successfully capture its dynamics. Because LSTM can handle large and diverse data, it offers valuable alternatives to older statistical methods. 1 Introduction Soil moisture is a key variable that controls various hydrologic processes, including infiltration, evapotranspiration, and subsurface flow. It is of central importance to drought monitoring (Narasimhan & Srinivasan, 2005), flood prediction (Norbiato et al., 2008), weather forecasting (Koster, 2004), irrigation planning, and many other scientifically and socially important applications. Launched in 2015, NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission (Entekhabi et al., 2010) is designed to measure top 5 cm soil moisture globally with a standard deviation of \\u00b10.04 cm3/cm3 volumetric ratio when vegetation water content (VWC) \\u22645 kg/m2 (O'Neill et al., 2012). It achieved this goal in most core evaluation sites (Colliander et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2016). Notwithstanding its great value, SMAP passive radiometer-based observations only have a short time span (since April 2015) with an irregular revisit time of 2\\u20133 days, which makes it difficult to observe soil moisture responses immediately after storms or snowmelt. Compared to SMAP's limited resolution and time span, land surface models (LSMs), for example, VIC (Nijssen et al., 2001), Noah (Ek et al., 2003), CLSM (Koster et al., 2000), and MOS (Koster & Suarez, 1994), simulate soil moisture seamlessly over much longer time spans. Despite their frequent use, these models may differ significantly from observations (Dirmeyer et al., 2016; Leeper et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2015; Yuan & Quiring, 2017). Biases (mean difference from the observed) are notable in all models evaluated in Xia et al. (2015). Their error patterns generally vary by region, model, season, and soil depths, yet there are systematic patterns in them. For example, moisture tends to be overestimated in the arid western continental United States (CONUS) and underestimated in wetter eastern U.S. (Yuan & Quiring, 2017); the Noah model tends to underestimate moisture in wet seasons and overestimate in dry seasons (Xia et al., 2015). These systematic error patterns could be exploited to improve predictions. To correct systematic model errors, we turn to deep learning (DL), a rebranding of artificial neural network. DL has made revolutionary strides in recent years and helped to solve problems that have resisted artificial intelligence for decades (LeCun et al., 2015). With earlier generation machine learning methods, human experts extract features from data that are strongly correlated with dependent variables. DL, on the other hand, automatically extracts abstract features via their hidden layers. Two highly successful network structures are convolutional neural networks for image domain tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter et al., 1997; Greff et al., 2015) for time domain tasks, although the separation is not absolute. No study, to our knowledge, used recurrent time series deep learning in hydrology, especially for large data sets. Earlier work applied nonrecurrent deep belief network on trend, period, and random elements extracted from a dam inflow time series, without directly learning from raw observations or forcings (Bai et al., 2016). Given DL's success in other disciplines (Voosen, 2017), it is plausible that DL can capture model error patterns that humans have yet come to explicitly formulate. The parameter space of deep networks is substantially large in order to provide the flexibility in mapping diverse, complex functions. Thus, one might be concerned about overfitting, which means coefficients are fitted to noise rather than meaningful information. However, there are recent breakthroughs in regularization techniques, for example, Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), which penalize overfitting and reduce mutually dependent coefficients. Nevertheless, since LSTM has not been applied to hydrology, it is important to examine its robustness compared to conventional statistical methods. The central hypothesis of this work is that with 2 years of SMAP data, LSTM can learn patterns in soil moisture dynamics and LSM errors and, by utilizing them, extend SMAP data over long time spans. Our objectives are the following: (1) to produce a seamless top surface soil moisture data set for continental United States (CONUS) with high fidelity when compared with SMAP data, (2) to provide an initial investigation of LSTM's capability in correcting process-based model errors, and (3) to compare LSTM's generalization capability to conventional methods in spatial and temporal extrapolation tests. Here, by \\u201chigh fidelity,\\u201d we mean a high consistency with the target data resulting in its faithful reproduction. SMAP's retrieval algorithm for the passive product derives soil moisture from brightness temperature readings using radiative transfer and soil dielectric models (O'Neill et al., 2012); thus, it also incurs biases (Colliander et al., 2017). Nevertheless, a high-fidelity hindcast product has a wide range of applications, for example, data mining of past fire hazards, calibration of hydrologic models, or benchmarking satellite product with historical in situ data. 2 Methods and Data Sets As an overview, we trained an LSTM network to predict SMAP L3 product with, as inputs, atmospheric forcing time series, LSM-simulated surface soil moisture, and static physiographic attributes. We compared LSTM to regularized multiple linear regression, autoregressive models, and a simple one-layer feedforward neural network. Their performances were tested by (i) temporal generalization test: training over 1 year and testing over another, (ii) regular spatial generalization test: training over a uniformly down-selected subset of SMAP pixels and testing over other cells; and (iii) regional holdout test: training on some subregions of CONUS and test on the rest. All data sources are aggregated to a daily time scale and interpolated to SMAP L3 grid. Each SMAP pixel is an instance. 2.1 Data Sources and Inputs For the learning target, we focus on the L3 passive radiometer product (L3_SM_P) that combines swaths available in each day. The spatial resolution of L3_SM_P is 36 km. For inputs, we obtained atmospheric forcing data including precipitation, temperature, radiation, humidity, and wind speed from North American Land Data Assimilation System phase II (NLDAS-2) (Xia et al., 2015). NLDAS-2 also provides, from 1979 to present, simulations of land surface states and fluxes by several LSMs. We chose Noah's (and also compared with MOS's) outputs (Ek et al., 2003) because it ranks in the middle among models (Xia et al., 2015) and is not as extensively calibrated as some other models, for example, SAC. Our work does not require the best LSM, as we can observe how LSTM and other methods correct LSM errors. Noah has four soil layers that are of depths 0\\u201310, 10\\u201340, 40\\u2013100, and 100\\u2013200 cm, respectively. To match with the 0\\u20135 cm sensed by SMAP, we tested (i) directly using 0\\u201310 cm data, (ii) polynomial interpolation, and (iii) integral interpolation where we find polynomials whose integrals agree with Noah-simulated values. Static physiographic attributes (Table S1 in supporting information) include sand, silt and clay percentages, bulk density, and soil capacity from World Soil Information (ISRIC-WISE) database (Batjes, 1995). County level annual-average irrigation data for 2010 (USGS, 2016) was overlaid with land use data to assign irrigation in each county to agricultural land uses. The values are then aggregated to SMAP grid. Also among inputs are SMAP product flags that indicate mountainous terrain, land cover classes, VWC, urban area, water body fraction, and data quality (time averaged). SMAP product flags indicate lower data quality in dense forested areas. However, instead of removing all regions labeled as low quality, we hypothesize that including the flags as inputs allows LSTM to implicitly assign less focus to high-uncertainty regions. 2.2 LSTM Setup As a type of Recurrent Neural Network, LSTM makes use of sequential information by updating states based on both inputs of the current time step (xt) and network states of previous time steps, as illustrated in Figure S1 in the supporting information. Following the notation in Lipton et al. (2015), we can write an LSTM as LSTM: x(t),h(t \\u2212 1),s(t \\u2212 1)\\u2192h(t),s(t). The sequential update formula are (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) where \\u03c3 is the sigmoidal function, \\u2299 is element wise multiplication, x(t) is the input vector (forcings and static attributes) for the time step t, Ws are the network weights, bs are bias parameters, y is the output to be compared to observations, h is the hidden states, and s is called the cell states of memory cells, which is unique to LSTM. Readers are referred to the literature for the detailed functionality of these units. Summarized briefly, i, f, and o control, respectively, when the input is significant enough to use, how long the past states should be remembered for, and how much the value in memory is used to compute the output. During training, Ws and bs are adjusted using back propagation through time (BPTT). In BPTT, the network is first unrolled over a prescribed length before the difference between the output and target propagates into the network. We used the LSTM implemented in Recurrent Neural Network library for Torch7 (L\\u00e9onard et al., 2015), which is a scientific computing framework for the programming language Lua. We employed Dropout regularization, which randomly sets a fraction (dropout rate, dr) of its operand to 0. Dropout prevents the coadaptation of neurons and thus reduces overfitting. We used dropout regularization (Zaremba et al., 2015), with constant dropout masks to recurrent connections as in Gal and Ghahramani (2015). We also implemented dropout for the memory cell as described in Semeniuta et al. (2016). At each time step, the network outputs one scalar value (y(t)), which is compared to SMAP L3 passive product. The loss function to be minimized is the mean-square error calculated for the time series: (8) where 1o(t) is 1 when time step t has SMAP observation and is 0 otherwise, \\u03c1 is the length of the time series, and y\\u2217(t) is SMAP observation. For computational efficiency and stability reasons, the training is done through \\u201cminibatches\\u201d: for each batch, a number of instances or SMAP pixels are randomly collected from the training set. The loss function is then averaged over all the instances in a batch. 2.3 Tests, Conventional Algorithms, and Evaluation Metrics In our temporal generalization test, the training set is SMAP data from April 2015 to March 2016. For computational efficiency, we picked 1 pixel from every 4\\u00d74 patch, resulting in a 1/16 coverage of CONUS. The test set is SMAP data for the same pixels, but for the period from April 2016 to March 2017. In the regular spatial generalization test, the training set is the same as described above, but the test set is the neighboring cells for the same period. In the regional holdout test, we trained models over 4 of the 18 two-digit Hydrologic Cataloging Units (HUC2s) and tested on others. This test challenges the ability of different methods to generalize across characteristically different climates and physiographic conditions. There are a large number of such 4-HUC2 combinations. As an initial investigation, we chose four of such combinations (C1\\u2013C4). Two combinations have a broad coverage of the range of Noah's bias over CONUS, while the other two cover only part of that range. These tests inform us about the effect of biased training sets on generalization. LSTM predictions are compared to three conventional methods: the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), autoregressive model (AR), and a single-layer feedforward Neural Network (NN), given the same inputs. Lasso, shorthanded as LR here, is multiple linear regression with a regularization term that penalizes large regression coefficients (Tibshirani, 1994). NN can construct nonlinear transformations of inputs but does not have memory, and therefore cannot retain time dependencies. LR and NN are operated in (1) the CONUS-scale mode, where a single model is trained for the entire training set; and (2) point-by-point mode, with subscript \\u201cp,\\u201d where a separate model is trained for each pixel. AR models are trained only point-by-point (ARp). More details are provided in supporting information Text S1. Three statistical metrics, bias (the time-averaged difference), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and Pearson's correlation (R) are calculated between predicted and SMAP-observed soil moisture on training and test sets separately. R measures the agreement between simulated and observed climatology. While short-term forecast employs observations to continuously update solution, long-term hindcast has no observations to use. As a \\u201cproof-of-concept\\u201d test of LSTM's appropriateness for long-term hindcast, we trained LSTM and ARp using 2 years of Noah-simulated soil moisture as the target and hindcasted it 10 years back. 3 Results 3.1 Overall Test Performance For the temporal generalization test, we note substantial improvement with respect to both bias and R compared to Noah (Figure 1). We report results from directly using the 0\\u201310 cm Noah layer, although other choices are similar, as will be discussed later. The Noah solutions have a significant, spatially varying bias in many parts of CONUS, as shown in Figure S3a in supporting information, especially in southeastern Coastal Plains (annotated in Figure S2 in supporting information). The LSTM correction reduces the bias by an order of magnitude and mostly removed the spatial pattern of bias (Figure 1a). We note there is a CONUS-scale spatial trend of larger reduction of absolute bias in the Eastern CONUS, except the southeast coast (Figure 1b). The gradient appears to be related to the CONUS annual precipitation map, as it corrects Noah's bias to overestimate in the arid west while overestimate in the humid east (Figure S3a, also noted in Xia et al. (2015)). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Performance of LSTM (evaluated against SMAP) in the test set of the temporal generalization test. (a) . Each pixel in this figure is patch of 4\\u00d74 SMAP pixels. Bias in most parts of CONUS is between \\u22120.02 and 0.015. (b) Change of absolute bias due to LSTM correction. LSTM reduces the absolute bias significantly over CONUS. (c) LSTM anomaly correlation (R(LSTM)). (d) Change of R due to LSTM correction. (e) RMSE(LSTM). (f) Since the RMSE improvement over Noah looks similar to Figure 1b, here we show the difference in RMSE between LSTM and NN predictions. Noah's performance is provided in Figure S3 in supporting information. LSTM does not only reduce bias. The improvement in predicted climatology is much more noticeable, according to R (Figures 1c and 1d). LSTM R is mostly above 0.8, and 50% pixels are over 0.9, significantly above Noah. In most CONUS the R improvement is greater than 0.1, while it can be 0.4 \\u223c 0.6 in the eastern CONUS, especially the agricultural regions in Central Lowland and on the Appalachian Plateau (Figure 1d). We note that this map is no longer similar to the bias map of Noah, suggesting mechanisms that correct seasonality are different from those correcting bias. We hypothesize LSTM significantly improves soil moisture dynamics in agricultural regions, for example, irrigation, and helps better capture the influence of shallow soils on the Appalachian highlands (Fang & Shen, 2017). On the other hand, over the majority of CONUS, the RMSE of LSTM is lower than 0.035 (Figure 1e). A continental-scale west-to-east increasing trend in RMSE(LSTM) is apparent. The higher errors in the east may result from higher annual precipitation, which results in (i) higher annual-mean soil moisture and (ii) high VWC, which reduces SMAP data quality. However, the southeast regions facing the Atlantic has a medium-to-low RMSE(LSTM). Figure 1f suggests that the improvement of LSTM over the one-layer NN is obvious, especially in the Central Lowland and Coastal Plains. 3.2 Comparison of Generalization Capability With Other Methods In the temporal generalization test, time series prolonged by LSTM compares favorably against ARp across a wide range of LSTM performance levels R(LSTM) (Figure 2). For the 10th to even 75th percentile pixel, LSTM is able to closely follow SMAP, except that peaks are underestimated in the 50th percentile pixel in 2016. The frequent rain events in April\\u2013May 2016 in Figure 2a and their recessions are well captured. For the 75th percentile pixel, all peaks are captured, but we notice some overestimation near the troughs in August 2016. In contrast, while ARp is also behavioral, we notice it often noticeably underestimates the troughs, overestimates the seasonal rising limbs, and overshoots some peaks. In the 10th percentile cell, ARp performs poorly between October 2016 and early 2017. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparisons between SMAP observations and soil moisture predicted by LSTM, Noah, and ARp at five locations. We chose sites around 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles as ranked by R(LSTM). Summarized over CONUS, LSTM shows the lowest test RMSE and bias, and the highest R (Figure 3), followed by NN, LRp, ARp, LR, NNp, and lastly Noah. Neither the vertical interpolation procedure nor the choice of LSM (MOS or Noah) has much impact on LSTM's prolongation performance (see Figures S4 and S5 in supporting information). The test RMSEs of LSTM are 0.022, 0.027, 0.036, and 0.057 for the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile pixel, respectively (Figure 3a). With lasso regularization, LR has similar training and test RMSEs, but its 25th percentile test RMSE is similar to the 75th percentile of LSTMs. Therefore, the more complex relationships permitted by LSTM are beneficial. The LRp improves from LR as it specializes in each pixel, and the lasso regularization appears to have prevented overfitting, but its error is still larger than the CONUS-scale LSTM. NNp and ARp appear more overfitted than LRp. LSTM's test bias is only moderately smaller than that of NN, ARp, and LRp, but R is much higher. The 75% and 50% of R(LSTM) are greater than 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Boxplots comparing LSTM, Noah, NN, AR, LR, NNp, and LRp in the temporal generalization test and the regular spatial generalization test. Each box and whisker element summarize SMAP pixels over CONUS with percentiles annotated in the panel. Y axis limits truncate Noah boxes to focus on the central part of other boxes. (left column) Temporal generalization test. (right column) Regular spatial generalization test. The three rows are for RMSE, Bias, and R, respectively. A paired t test suggests RMSE(LSTM) and RMSE(NN) are significantly different. Note that ARp has subpar performance in both training and test periods. The test RMSE box for ARp is wider, suggesting its formulation works well for some pixels but not so well in others. Furthermore, the extended proof-of-concept long-term hindcast experiment shows a similar contrast. LSTM has robust prolongation performance at a 10 year hindcast scale while ARp generates larger errors. Errors for both methods are independent of hindcast lengths, that is, 10 years prior hindcast error is not much different from 2 year hindcast (Text S2 and Figure S6 in supporting information). Meanwhile, in the regular spatial generalization test, LSTM again exhibits the smallest RMSE and bias (Figures 3c and 3d). The contrast in bias is smaller than the temporal test, but the R comparisons are similar. In 4-HUC2 combinations 1 and 2 (C1 and C2), the Noah bias covers a wide range from \\u22120.25 to 0.15 cm3/cm3, which appears to be the whole range of the Noah biases we see over CONUS. In both cases, LSTM is able to greatly reduce the bias and improve soil moisture climatology (much higher R) compared to both NN and Noah (Figure 4a-b). The boxes corresponding to LSTM bias are very narrow, and its centers are nearly 0. For the case C3, we note that it has few points with bias <\\u22120.2, so for this HUC2 combination, the training set undersamples the Noah errors that lead to strong negative biases. As a result, LSTM's bias is no longer near 0, although still much better than NN's and Noah's. On the other hand, for C4, the training set is strongly biased. It lacks any basin with a Noah bias of <\\u22120.1. We note the narrow box corresponding to Noah's bias in the training set for C4. Unsurprisingly, LSTM's performance deteriorates: LSTM is no longer able to correct the bias, and its range of bias is large. NN, similarly, also fails to correct the bias. We obtained LSTM's self-assessment of Noah bias by subtracting Noah's solution from LSTM's prediction. The self-assessed bias (Figure 4a) has little overlap with the Noah bias in the training set. This may be a signal we can utilize in the future to identify biased training sample and large predictive uncertainty. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Test biases for cases C1\\u2013C4 (distinguished by different colors), which are four combinations of four HUC2s. Each group consists of four boxes, which are, respectively, LSTM, NN, Noah in the training set, and self-assessed test bias. The self-assessed bias is Noah's prediction over the test set minus LSTM's predictions. (b) Test R. We note significantly better seasonality captured by LSTM in cases C1\\u2013C3 but not necessarily in C4. (c) Distributions of Noah's biases in the training sets for C1\\u2013C4. 4 Discussion In many parts of CONUS, LSTM's RMSE is smaller than SMAP's design measurement accuracy. It appears even 1 year of CONUS-scale data, when grouped together, has enough information to train an LSTM to hindcast SMAP data. A factor that contributes to such performance is the short memory length of soil moisture, which was found to range between 5 and 40 days (Orth & Seneviratne, 2012) in previous work. As a result, 2 years of data, when grouped together, contain many complete wet-dry cycles. The hindcast quality should improve as SMAP data increase. On a side note, because true random noise cannot be predicted in the test set, it follows that SMAP L3's RMSE could be below 0.027 in 50% of CONUS. Also, the official SMAP data quality flag labels the forested southeast Coastal Plains and South Atlantic regions as \\u201cnot recommended\\u201d quality (Figure S3). Our LSTM has a RMSE of 0.02\\u20130.035 there, which suggests SMAP may be functional in these regions, but the impacts of the retrieval algorithm should be carefully examined. It seems nonrecurrent NN can already remove a large part of bias by capturing how environmental factors lead to certain type of biases. However, NN cannot maintain time dependencies, which may explain its performance difference from LSTM. Therefore, we argue an advantage of LSTM originates from its recurrent nature. Meanwhile, alternative recurrent models, for example, AR and moisture loss functions (Koster et al., 2017), are useful due to their interpretability, parsimony, and great value in \\u201cnowcasting\\u201d or short-term forecasting (see Koster et al. (2017) for a robust application), but they require continuous updates by observations to avoid drift from true dynamics. At 1 year scale, injected data already have little effects on hindcast solutions. For longer-term hindcast, pattern-based methods like LSTM appear to be more suitable. Previous soil moisture comparisons mainly focused on anomalies, but the prevalent bias with Noah-simulated moisture can introduce large errors to downstream applications such as weather modeling (Massey et al., 2016). The continental-scale bias pattern suggests some systematic errors with Noah's model structure/parameters. Some hypotheses include (i) Noah's soil pedo-transfer functions are fundamentally inadequate in resolving regionally heterogeneous soil responses to rainfall, which could explain the need for calibration in most large-scale flood forecasting systems, or (ii) groundwater flow, which is important in thick-soiled, high-infiltrating capacity regions like the southeast (Fang et al., 2016), is not properly simulated in LSMs (Clark et al., 2015). However, LSTM appears to be able to integrate information from raw data and compensate for the inadequate representation uniformly over CONUS. Conventional statistical wisdom suggests simpler models are more robust, and models with high degrees of freedom may be easily overfitted. However, the present work shows that the CONUS-scale deep learning networks have smaller test errors than three alternative methods trained point by point. In fact, we hypothesize an important strength of LSTM originates from its flexibility to simultaneously learn from a large and heterogeneous collection of data and identify commonalities and differences. Its generalization capability stems from building internal models (in the attribute space) to capture biases and temporal fluctuations. Despite widely different climates, topography, land cover, and soils over CONUS, just a small subset of these combinations seem sufficient for training accurate LSTM models, provided that the sample is not too biased, for example, C1\\u2013C2 in Figure 4. 5 Conclusion We have trained a CONUS-scale LSTM network to predict SMAP data. This network is capable of correcting spatially heterogeneous model bias as well as climatological errors between Noah-simulated and SMAP-observed top-surface soil moisture, creating a CONUS-scale seamless moisture product that has high fidelity to SMAP. Despite having high degrees of freedom, when properly regularized, LSTM exhibits better generalization capability, both in space and time, than linear regression, autoregressive models, and a one-layer neural network. Its test error approaches the instrument accuracy limit with SMAP. LSTM will be helpful in long-range soil moisture hindcasting or forecasting, weather modeling, and data assimilation. Its generalization capability arises from building internal models from physical attributes and synthesis of climate forcing. It does not necessarily require similar examples in the training set. Unless the training set is strongly biased, LSTM has a good chance of success. 6 Limitations and Future Work As a first paper using LSTM in hydrology, this work is by no means a thorough or optimized investigation. Our work does not address the question about the accuracy of SMAP data, which is addressed by other studies. The hindcast performance with respect to capturing soil moisture during drought should be further examined with in situ data. We should further assess LSTM's performance in comparison with regionally trained models. The implications of low LSTM RMSEs in forested region warrant further investigations.

Nazemi and H. S. Wheater Abstract. Human activities have caused various changes to the Earth system, and hence the interconnections between human activities and the Earth system should be recognized and reflected in models that simulate Earth system processes. One key anthropogenic activity is water resource management, which determines the dynamics of human\\u2013water interactions in time and space and controls human livelihoods and economy, including energy and food production. There are immediate needs to include water resource management in Earth system models. First, the extent of human water requirements is increasing rapidly at the global scale and it is crucial to analyze the possible imbalance between water demands and supply under various scenarios of climate change and across various temporal and spatial scales. Second, recent observations show that human\\u2013water interactions, manifested through water resource management, can substantially alter the terrestrial water cycle, affect land\\u2013atmospheric feedbacks and may further interact with climate and contribute to sea-level change. Due to the importance of water resource management in determining the future of the global water and climate cycles, the World Climate Research Program's Global Energy and Water Exchanges project (WRCP-GEWEX) has recently identified gaps in describing human\\u2013water interactions as one of the grand challenges in Earth system modeling (GEWEX, 2012). Here, we divide water resource management into two interdependent elements, related firstly to water demand and secondly to water supply and allocation. In this paper, we survey the current literature on how various components of water demand have been included in large-scale models, in particular land surface and global hydrological models. Issues of water supply and allocation are addressed in a companion paper. The available algorithms to represent the dominant demands are classified based on the demand type, mode of simulation and underlying modeling assumptions. We discuss the pros and cons of available algorithms, address various sources of uncertainty and highlight limitations in current applications. We conclude that current capability of large-scale models to represent human water demands is rather limited, particularly with respect to future projections and coupled land\\u2013atmospheric simulations. To fill these gaps, the available models, algorithms and data for representing various water demands should be systematically tested, intercompared and improved. In particular, human water demands should be considered in conjunction with water supply and allocation, particularly in the face of water scarcity and unknown future climate. How to cite.

Irrigated area in India has increased substantially after the Green revolution and both surface and groundwater have been extensively used. Under warming climate projections, irrigation frequency may increase leading to increased irrigation water demands. Water resources planning and management in agriculture need spatially-explicit irrigated area information for different crops and different crop growing seasons. However, annual, high-resolution irrigated area maps for India for an extended historical record that can be used for water resources planning and management are unavailable. Using 250\\u2009m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and 56\\u2009m land use/land cover data, high-resolution irrigated area maps are developed for all the agroecological zones in India for the period of 2000\\u20132015. The irrigated area maps were evaluated using the agricultural statistics data from ground surveys and were compared with the previously developed irrigation maps. High resolution (250\\u2009m) irrigated area maps showed satisfactory accuracy (R2=0.95) and can be used to understand interannual variability in irrigated area at various spatial scales.

Irrigation water use is projected to increase under climate warming to maintain or increase agricultural production. Irrigation is estimated to use about 70% of world\\u2019s total available freshwater for food production using 18% of cultivated area globally1,2. Irrigation practices can play a significant role in agriculture production to meet the projected food demand in several parts of the world by maintaining or increasing crop yields under changing climatic conditions. As a result, accurate information of irrigated agricultural water use and its spatial extent and variation is essential for water resource and crop productivity assessments. In India, agriculture is the largest sector of employment and a significant fraction of total population depends on it for sustenance and economic livelihood through both traditional and modern agricultural practices3. However, agricultural production and food security are highly influenced by short-term weather anomalies, episodic extreme events, and long-term changes in air temperature and precipitation3. An increase in winter temperature, erratic monsoon season rainfall, extensive use of ground water resources, and absence of effective adaptation strategies are likely to negatively affect crop productivity4,5. In the future, the Indian region may experience stress to meet its water demand due to extreme weather and climate events such as droughts and heat waves, specifically in arid and semi-arid regions, where groundwater extraction is prominent for irrigation3\\u20135. A remarkable change in agriculture practices occurred in India after 1970, with a massive agricultural expansion called the \\u2018green revolution\\u20194,6. This revolution resulted in the agriculture sector benefiting from the introduction and expansion of different types of irrigation, fertilizers, and high yield crop varieties4,6,7. Monitoring irrigation water demands and consumption requires mapping irrigated areas either through agricultural census or using remotely sensing data. The current spatiotemporal extent of irrigated lands and inter-annual change at regional scales in India is still relatively uncertain and available maps are often outdated or prepared with spatially-coarse resolution data. The primary sources of irrigation data in India are the Directorate of Economics and Statistics of the Ministry of Statistics (DES), Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR), and Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations (FAO). During the past few years, several spatial data sets of irrigated area at global scale have been developed. For instance, the USGS Global Land Cover Map8 was developed using 1\\u2009km monthly composite of NDVI obtained from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The Global Map of Irrigation Areas (GMIA) published by the FAO was developed by Siebert, et al.9 using approximate information of total irrigated area from national information and other data sources (irrigated area per national statistical unit, irrigated area from point, polygon, and raster maps of land cover and other satellite data) at a spatial resolution of 5-arc minutes. Recently, International Water Management Institute (IWMI) released global irrigated area map for a 10-km grid resolution using methods described in Thenkabail, et al.10. Moreover, Zhao and Siebert11 developed crop class based irrigated area maps for India using net sown area and extent of irrigated crops from the census and land use land cover data at 500\\u2009m spatial resolution for year 2005. For the Indian region, a high resolution (250\\u20131000\\u2009m) irrigation map based on remote sensing data was completed10,12 for the Ganga, Indus, and Krishna River basins. Siddiqui, et al.13 developed irrigated area map for Asia and Africa regions using canonical correlation analysis and time lagged regression, which is available at 250\\u2009m resolution for the year 2000 and 2010 and can be obtained from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI, http://waterdata.iwmi.org/applications/irri_area/) portal. However, high resolution (250\\u2009m) irrigated area maps that cover the period of 2000\\u20132015 and all the agroecological zones of India are unavailable, which are required for estimation of irrigation water use and hydrologic modelling. Here, we develop annual irrigated area maps at a spatial resolution of 250\\u2009m for the period of 2000\\u20132015 using data from the MODIS and high resolution land use/land cover (LULC) information in India. Methods Irrigated area in this study refers to the partial or full application of water at least once to meet minimum annual water requirements for crops in the agricultural area. In India, about 94% of farmers have land holdings smaller or equal to 4\\u2009ha (ref. 14). Based on the Cultivable Command Area (CCA), which is an area that is physically irrigated from an irrigation scheme (based on surface or groundwater sources) and is fit for cultivation, irrigation schemes are categorized into major (area more than 10000\\u2009ha), and medium (area between 2000 and 10000\\u2009ha) projects utilizing surface water sources and minor (area less than 2000\\u2009ha)7 projects tapping into groundwater resources. Irrigated binary maps are developed in this work where each cell of 250\\u2009m resolution represents an approximate area of 6.25\\u2009ha and in case of partial or full irrigation, a grid cell was considered 100% irrigated. In India, irrigation expansion has changed remarkably during the last few decades increasing from 20.6\\u2009mha in 1950\\u20131951 to nearly 56\\u2009mha in 2002\\u20132003 (ref. 7). Due to variations in agro-climatic conditions there is large inequality in the irrigation potential of different states. For instance, south Indian states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu generally have low irrigation potential compared to the other regions, which can attributed to availability of surface and groundwater resources. Additionally, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Haryana have already developed over 70% of its major and moderate irrigation potential. Moreover, states like Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat have utilized over 80% of their irrigation potential. States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu have irrigated area more than 50% of cropped area, while 95% of arable land in the state of Punjab is irrigated. Wheat, sugarcane, and banana are the major irrigated crops in the country with other crops occupying relatively less irrigated area include groundnuts, pulses, cotton, and coarse cereals. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from MODIS The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used as an indicator for irrigated area12,15\\u201317 as it represents the amount of green biomass with index values varying in response to changes in vegetation conditions18\\u201320. MODIS data products are available at different spatial and temporal resolutions providing a daily global coverage of observations with enhanced spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric quality for improved mapping and monitoring of vegetation dynamics21,22 and can be used to detect unique multi-temporal, spectral vegetation signatures for crop-type mapping21\\u201324. The MODIS NDVI composite data are currently available with enhanced vegetation sensitivity with minimal influences from the atmosphere, view and sun angles, clouds, and inherent non-vegetation influences of canopy background and litter. To separate irrigated and non- irrigated areas, MODIS NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 250\\u2009m and a 16-day temporal composite period were used to ensure the highest spatial resolution and least amount of cloud contamination. For each year during the study period of 2000\\u20132015, MODIS-NDVI data were projected to the geographic coordinate system and mosaicked using the NASA reprojection tool (mrtweb.cr.usgs.gov). The16-day composite NDVI data were used without any smoothing as smoothing techniques typically result in only subtle increases in overall classification accuracy and some of these techniques lead to large inconsistencies in previous classification efforts2,25. Irrigated and non-irrigated crops show considerable differences in NDVI for the same crop type or cropping pattern. For instance, irrigated crops exhibit higher NDVI especially for corn and wheat16,17,20,26, which can be used to separate those from the non-irrigated crops10,17,21 (Fig. 1c). Increased soil moisture availability from irrigated water applications during the growing season helps the agricultural crops to attain maximum NDVI exceeding the peak NDVI of non-irrigated crops16. The temporal NDVI profile also reflect variations from sowing to harvest and different types of vegetation indices can depict biophysical characteristics of a particular crop type27,28. Colombo, et al.29 showed that Leaf Area Index (LAI) has a positive correlation with NDVI of different crop types, which can be used to identify crops from their phenological phases of vegetation dynamics such as green up, maturity, and senescence28,30\\u201333. In addition, NDVI and LAI are strongly correlated, with NDVI saturating (reduced sensitivity) when LAI reaches a value of 4 or more, which is identified as non-crop vegetation. LAI rarely approaches such a value for crop and this would be no issue for irrigation classification therefore NDVI alone can be used to differentiate irrigated from non-irrigated areas as well as crop types. In rainfed areas, NDVI may not achieve saturation during the crop growing period, which also provides a basis to map irrigated areas using NDVI. Moreover, NDVI helps to segregate classes of same crops within an agricultural area, which in turn can be used to differentiate between irrigated and non-irrigated areas due to difference in peak value of NDVI.

Full size image Identifying potential agricultural area and defining cropping schedule The methodology consists of two main steps as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1: 1) classifying crop types using spectral similarity along the n-dimensional space vectors based on decision rules of physically-interpretable thresholds selected from spectral features, and 2) a decision tree model formulated using the vegetation condition index (VCI)34,35 for each pixel in the selected agroecological region to accommodate the weather component in separating irrigated and non-irrigated areas. A LULC map derived from the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS)\\u2014P6 AWiFS available at 56\\u2009m resolution was used to map agriculture areas under different seasons (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid). Agricultural land located on slopes of 8% or less are suitable for surface irrigation16. As a result, areas with a slope greater than 20%, as well as non-agricultural areas were masked from the composite NDVI data. Agroecological zones (http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0257e/A0257E02.htm) in India are well defined and mapped using the ArcGIS shape files. The analysis was performed for each zone separately to account for variations in climate, soil types, and phonological cycle of crops. More information on the input data used in our work can be obtained from Table 1. Table 1 Data sets used for irrigated area mapping as input and validation. Full size table The crop calendar and growth stages are prepared for each agro-ecological zones using the data from the National Food Security Mission (http://nfsm.gov.in/nfmis/RPT/CalenderReport.aspx). However, natural variations in sowing and harvesting dates may differ because of other factors related to varying topographic conditions, soil moisture in the earlier growth stages, soil salinity intrusion during the dry season, flooding in wet season, general weather conditions, and farmer management decisions. Since vegetation health depends on the region of growth, data preparation and decision tree model development was carried out separately for each agro-ecological zone. A lookup table consisting of average height of crop and major crop types for different agroecological zones was prepared as discussed in Gajbhiye and Mandal36. Here average height refers to the difference in crop type value of NDVI achievable during its time of growth in an agroecological zone. Average height data were prepared based on visual analysis of different crops profiles of peak NDVI value for rain fed and irrigated time period from published literature. Since locations of specific crop type were not available NDVI height were prepared from published literature. Thus each threshold value was assigned for each crop type based on the NDVI in hierarchal manner. The scheme of implementation at first was based on three broad grouping of crops in the Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid seasons. Identification of each crop (Rice, Wheat, Cotton, Maize, Sorghum, Pulses, Barley, Soybean, Sugarcane, Pearl Millet, Jowar, Groundnut, Sesamum, Bean, Gram and Berseem) was done on the basis of crop-specific average height at the time of sowing, seedling growth, tillering, flowering, ripening and harvest. Multi-temporal NDVI profiles were extracted from the time-series MODIS data of each selected area for each 250\\u2009m pixel over agricultural land, while n-dimensional temporal NDVI data were used to separate probable crop type using a lookup table. Emergence and senescence periods for a crop were identified using cumulative NDVI departure (departure was estimated against the mean value and when cumulative departure is minimum the date was identified) for a water year (i.e., from month of June of current year to the month of May next year (June to May)). A NDVI composite (NDVIC) was created for every water year by layer stacking MODIS images. The NDVIC selected samples were used to define crop type based on their NDVI temporal profiles. For each NDVIC sample, the start of growing season, duration and height information were used to assign the crop type based on the condition prepared in the corresponding lookup table. The obtained crop type class information was then used as a training sample to segregate crops of spectral similarity, which was finally used in the irrigated/non-irrigated classification algorithm. Since each pixel may represent more than one crop type because most of the crop fields are small in comparison with the pixel size of the data, a spatial sample size of 250\\u2009m which is equivalent to a pixel of MODIS NDVI was selected uniformly throughout the entire agro-ecological zone. Considering the boundary of each district, the selected pixels were spaced at an average distance of 4\\u2009km. Maximum attainable NDVI value range considered for cropped area is normally in range between 0.1 and 0.8, and corresponding height was scaled in a range between 1 and 100. The created crop classes were used as an end member signature for further crop type classification of the entire agroecological-zone. Classification of NDVIC (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Composite) was performed using Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) where each end member defined as a crop is considered as a spectrum representative of the spectral class property of n-dimension space vector. The SCM is a modification of the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) approach37 with the major difference from latter technique being that the data are standardized and centered on two spectra, i.e., the reference and the image spectrum, which allows a better spectral difference by using pairs of deviation and by detecting false positive. The basic limitation of the SAM is its inability to distinguish negative and positive correlations because only absolute values are considered. The SCM is a derivative of the Pearson correlation coefficient that excludes negative correlation and varies between \\u22121 and 138. Hence SCM presents a more accentuated contrast between targets of interest (i.e., irrigated and non-irrigated crops) and highlights pixels representing negative correlations allowing the algorithm to distinguish the targets of interest more accurately. Decision tree irrigation model Shahriar Pervez, et al.16,20 and Ozdogan, et al.15 demonstrated that the NDVI threshold approach was promising for identifying irrigated areas. A decision tree classifier was developed by applying a NDVI threshold for individual class clusters (crop type belong to same class obtained from the SCM) (Supplementary Fig. 2). The framework was based on the fact that individual \\u2018seasonal pools\\u2019 (refers to growing stages of a specific crop) of crop type (i.e., spectral subclasses of individual crop and rotating crop) were assessed and used to establish a NDVI threshold to differentiate irrigated from non-irrigated areas. This approach addresses the temporal dynamics of cropping frequency, which has an unique advantage in that it does not require calibration to match the reported irrigated area from agricultural census data using a technique such as that of Shahriar Pervez, et al.16. Moreover, the NDVI threshold was obtained by transforming the original NDVI into the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI; Kogan34). VCI is generally used for drought monitoring which needs separation of short-term weather related fluctuations from long-term ecosystem changes in vegetation. Since VCI can provide information on stressed or unstressed condition of a crop, it can be used to separate irrigated and unirrigated areas. Normalized VCI can be used to identify NDVI differences between irrigated and non-irrigated areas. To date, the VCI has mainly been used to monitor weather impacts on vegetation such as drought detection and monitoring34,35,39. VCI of every individual crop class was analyzed for each year to get the mean VCI (MVCI). Here, the VCI is considered a key proxy for separating an irrigated and a rainfed crop from the same crop system because it includes weather-related information expressed by NDVI fluctuations in the intra- and inter-annual NDVI time-series data. A NDVI threshold (NDVIirclass) value was identified for each crop type. Initially, maximum value of NDVIiclass i.e., NDVIimclass was segregated based on each crop class obtained from SCM for the every seasonal pools. The mean NDVI was obtained for each class (NDVIiclass) using maximum of NDVIiclass from every seasonal pool of the crop growing period. Here irrigated area separation is based on crop type of the same class or cropping pattern. Moreover, it is evident that the stress condition can be identified using the maximum vegetation index value of a particular crop class compared to the index value of the same crop class in a water-stressed condition. MVCI was estimated using equation ii and multiplied by 100 to measure percentage change of the current NDVImp from the NDVIiclass. The percentage variation was then used as a proxy for the stressed condition for the same class types. This stressed percentage was then used as a multiplier coefficient to separate irrigated from non-irrigated area, which was given in equation (1). Therefore, NDVIirclass was best suited to separate cropped area under irrigation. (1) N D V I irclass = ( M V C I \\u00d7 N D V I mp ) + N D V I mp where (2) M V C I = ( NDVI mp \\u2212 NDVI mclass N D V I mclass ) and N D V I mclass = 1 n \\u2211 i = 1 n N D V I imclass where NDVIirclass is a threshold for separating irrigated class NDVIiclass value present in each class of SCM, NDVIimclass mazimum value of NDVIiclass, NDVImp is the minimum value of NDVIimclass, MVCI is the Mean Vegetation Condition Index, and NDVImclass is the mean NDVI value for particular class. Each seasonal pool and each crop type was evaluated separately and using a minimum NDVIirclass value equivalent or greater than 0.2 of NDVI for irrigated area. The irrigated area uses NDVIirclass as threshold when a minimum difference of 0.15 or greater exists between values of NDVIiclass, and NDVImp. The details of decision tree classification are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. For post classification analysis, Space Time Spiral Curves (ST-SCs) were used to verify irrigated area for spatial and temporal consistency which further differentiate irrigated and non-irrigated crops even both falls in same region as explained below (Fig. 1c). ST-SCs use two-dimensional feature space (i.e., NIR and RED reflectance) of the MODIS data to track near continuous changes in class spectral behaviour over time and space. As presented in Thenkabail, et al.10 ST-SCs curve demarcate the class territory as for each class that is rain-fed in \\u2018brightness territory\\u2019, the water class in \\u2018wetness territory\\u2019 and the irrigated class in \\u2018greenness territory\\u2019. Nonetheless, it can categorize changes in magnitude difference of features like built-up, forest, and crop growth. The ST-SCs can identify when two classes have similar spectra and provide excellent class separability on most dates from different classes and even show differences in irrigated and non-irrigated crop class for one or more dates (Fig. 1a,b). In addition to this the time series trend in irrigation with respect to rainfall was also analyzed for agro-ecological zones and states. Data Records The study area extends spatially from 68\\u00b0\\u2009E to 97\\u00b0\\u2009E and 6\\u00b0\\u2009S to 37\\u00b0\\u2009N, which covers the entire Indian region. Irrigation data sets are available to the public through an unrestricted repository in a Geotiff format (Data Citation 1). The data is in binary format i.e., 0 and 1. The value 1 represents irrigated area with a pixel size of 250\\u2009m. The data provide a static representation of irrigation during a water year and cover the entire period of 2000\\u20132015. The data repository delivers only irrigation raw data obtained for the entire Indian region. The repository updates of irrigated area will be done every year upon the availability of new data set. Technical Validation The application of the model over the 15-year study period resulted in 15 annual irrigation maps for the time period of 2000 to 2015 (Figs 2 and 3). The validation section presents two sets of results: 1) temporal validation of irrigated area with agricultural statistics data for the entire country and for each state (DES) and 2) an irrigated area comparison of the Ganga River Basin. Since no ground based observed irrigated area data are available, we provide accuracy assessment against the DES data for each state, which is based on ground based survey for irrigated area. Moreover, we selected the Ganga basin for the analysis as it is one of the most irrigated basins in the world. Both surface and groundwater based irrigation is being used in the Ganga basin, which can provide us an excellent case for the evaluation of our approach. The irrigated area for the Ganga basin during 2001\\u20132002 was developed by Thenkabail et al.10 using a series of 500\\u2009m MODIS images. The Ganga Basin irrigated area comparison was done using space time spiral curves (SC-STs) introduced by Thenkabail, et al.10 to check near continuous changes in class behaviour over time and space to match the irrigation area obtained for the years 2001 and 2002. The accuracy of irrigated area obtained from 500\\u2009m MODIS reported by Thenkabail, et al.10 is based on fuzzy approach and the produced six irrigated-area classes had an accuracy of 100, 75, 84, 56, 79 and 100 (%) with a mean accuracy of 82%. The accuracy assessment of these maps was challenging due to lack of ground truth and site-specific information on irrigated areas, however, better information on accuracy can be achieved through direct comparison with DES data based on ground survey of irrigated areas. These comparisons allow us to examine the accuracy in terms of temporal correlation and spatial variability of irrigated class at the 250-m resolution. Since the irrigated area maps were developed for a water year, the evaluation represents the same period. Figure 2: Changes and variability in irrigated area in the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

Full size image Irrigated area comparison for the Ganga River basin using SC\\u2014STs curve The irrigated area for the Ganga River basin was reported to have an area of 26.9\\u2009mha during the period of 2001\\u20132002 based on the 500-m resolution data developed by Thankbeil et al.10. Our estimate for the same period for the Ganga River basin for irrigated area was 30.75\\u2009mha. Some differences in the two estimates can be attributed to classification errors and difference in spatial resolutions (250 and 500\\u2009m) between the two classified maps. Moreover, uncertainties in irrigated area estimation in 500 and 250\\u2009m maps may also be due to insufficient ground reference points that are needed to avoid misclassificiation. Spatial resolution may be an important factor as a 500 or 250\\u2009m pixel is considered fully irrigated if there is partial irrigation in small fields within a pixel. We adopted the space- time spiral curves method for validating irrigated area, were ST-SCs have the capability to demarcate spectral class territory and the validation was carried out for \\u2018greenness territory\\u2019, which contains the irrigated and non-irrigated areas. Irrigated and non-irrigated areas were well separated during different time period of growth for the years 2001 and 2002 (Fig. 1a,b). Figure 1 shows a good agreement between our estimates and results in other reports that show a similar trend, where ST-SCs during 2001 and 2002 of irrigated area significantly overlap one another for most of dates. Given that 2002 was a drought year, the greenness of agricultural land was reduced because of less water availability in non-irrigated areas compared to 2001, which was evident in the results shown in the Fig. 1. For instance, a noticeable difference can be seen in both images on 241th day, which may be due to the fact that 2002 was a drought year with low greenness as discussed in Thenkabail, et al.10. Multiyear irrigated area A multi-year irrigated area for different states was estimated using statistics data of Net Irrigated Area (NIA) obtained from DES (http://www.aps.dac.gov.in/LUS/Index.htm) for the period of 2000\\u20132013. A detailed description of data used as input for validation are given in Table 1. To our knowledge, the DES dataset is the most reliable and provides areal information on the temporal variation of irrigated area to validate our result. Moreover this dataset is used by several government agencies for adoption and mitigation efforts in response to weather fluctuations and extremes6,40. The temporal variation in irrigated area in the DES data and MODIS 250\\u2009m irrigated area maps for all India is shown in Table 2. Our results showed an overestimation in irrigated area estimated using 250\\u2009m MODIS NDVI data (Table 2). Since our estimates are based on 250\\u2009m spatial resolution, irrigated area may be overestimated due to small land holdings in India. This highlights the need of higher resolution irrigated area maps in India that can resolve the boundaries of majority of small land holdings. Table 2 Comparison of all India irrigated area (mha) from of statistical data (DES) and developed data at 250\\u2009m spatial resolution using the MODIS NDVI in this study. Full size table The effect of classification algorithm, and threshold considered here for irrigation mapping are somewhat subjective and may have uncertainty associated with them, hence it is important to communicate to users this information before using these irrigated agricultural land data sets. The misclassification may introduce positional uncertainties even in the cropping area, which could result in selecting the incorrect NDVI threshold for defining irrigation. Another source of potential error could be attributed to the 250-m spatial resolution of the MODIS source data, where non-irrigated areas smaller than the pixel size are often classified as irrigated and can only be distinguished with higher spatial resolution data. However, the multi-year irrigation data set produced in this study was robust enough to capture the overall decline of irrigation during drought years (Fig. 3), which can be attributed to less shown area during drought years. The results validated with published literature10 using a different technique give substantiate evidence in support of the representative of the accuracy of the overall irrigation patterns obtained using our methods (Tables 2 and 3). Table 3 State wise mean irrigated area from DES, MODIS NDVI (250), and IWMI (250) for the period of 2000\\u20132010. Full size table Since ground based survey data of irrigated area are available at state level, we compared estimated mean irrigated area between 2000 and 2013 from the 250\\u2009m MODIS data against the DES for each state (Table 3). Using the 250\\u2009m MODIS NDVI, the irrigated area for all the states showed root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83\\u2009mha and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95. These results indicate the effectiveness of our approach to map irrigated area against ground based survey of DES. We notice that the states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh showed an overestimation in estimated irrigated area that ranged between 1.02 and 2.31\\u2009mha. The bias in our estimates is random as in some states irrigated area was overestimated while in other it was underestimated. However, in most of the states, our results provided better estimates of irrigated area in comparison to the product developed by the International Water Management Institute13 (IWMI) [R2=0.76 and RMSE=7.99\\u2009mha] at the same resolution (Table 3). Apart from the spatial resolution (250\\u2009m), which may not be able to resolve boundaries of small land holdings41,42, bias in estimated irrigated area may also be caused due to variation in peak NDVI. Since NDVI is an indicator of vegetation health, the effectiveness of our approach may be higher in semi-arid or arid regions, where water is a limiting factor for crop growth. For instance, in humid and sub-humid regions, the difference in peak NDVI, that is used as a threshold to identify irrigated and non-irrigated areas may not be high leading to errors and bias in the classification. Since a majority of agroecological zones of India fall in water limited conditions, we assume that our method is effective for India. Other than these factors (resolution and difference in peak NDVI), management related factors (differences in soil productivity, fertilizer application, and sowing time) can also influence the classification of irrigated and non-irrigated regions in India. Notwithstanding sources of uncertainty, our results provide better estimates of irrigated area in comparison to the other existing dataset (IWMI). Standardized anomalies in rainfall and irrigated area A comparison of the first difference time series of rainfall and irrigation is presented to show the trend and response of irrigation to rainfall variations. The areas were grouped by agroecological region, state, and country and the time series difference data were evaluated at a spatial scale of 250\\u2009m. Supplementary Fig. 3 presents the temporal irrigation pattern and first difference map of rainfall with irrigation for the Indian region. The latter were normalized by subtracting the mean from the actual value and dividing it by corresponding standard deviation using annual average of rainfall and irrigation area for a particular region. Declines in irrigated area were fairly constant for some years with values ranging between \\u22121.46 and \\u22122.60\\u2009mha, however, other years 2003\\u20132004, 2005\\u20132006 and 2012\\u20132013 showed a larger decrease in irrigated area with values ranging from \\u22126.21 to \\u221213.38\\u2009mha. One reason for the latter case is that the preceding year had a pronounced rainfall deficit as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 3c. In addition, Panda and Wahr43 reported during 2012 year that the GRACE-derived negative water storage anomaly for the post monsoon and monsoon were less compared to previous years. In addition to that post monsoon of 2012 (October to December) and pre monsoon (January to May) of 2013 having a consistent temporal behaviour of groundwater level anomaly was noticed by in situ data for the years 2011 and 2012. Terrestrial and ground water storages withdrawal were also less during 2012 drought year (may be because of less sown area), which could be a possible reason to decrease irrigation for this time period. A notable finding in the Indo-Gangetic plain is shown in Fig. 2 for irrigation during the 2002 water year where irrigation was not affected by the observed rainfall deficit, which was calculated as a positive difference of 2.15\\u2009mha from other obtained techniques as discussed in Thenkabail, et al.10. Other studies also showed the same trend for the same water year10, which can be attributed to substantial groundwater-based irrigation in the region. In contrast, for the Indo-Gangetic plain, the spatial extent of irrigated area was reduced during the 2012 drought year because of a decline in net cropped area due to rainfall deficit in the early monsoon season (June) [Figs 2 and 3]43. Interestingly for the state of Punjab, a negative anomaly in irrigated area was seen for most of the years since 2008 (Supplementary Fig. 3b), and had almost recovered to a comparable pre-2008 irrigated area by 2015. Reports claim this state had faced consecutive dry years43, which may have attributed to such trend. A more detailed view of irrigation at different time period is shown in Fig. 3, which shows irrigation condition during water surplus year and water deficit years of 2012 and 2015 to represent recent periods. A clear difference in irrigated area estimated using 250\\u2009m MODIS NDVI can be noted from Fig. 3a,b, in which most of northern and eastern plain have higher variability in irrigated area, whereas in southern belt and all over the country there was an increase in irrigation during 2015 year compared to 2000 (Fig. 3). A Taluk-based irrigation map (political boundary of India, which divides a district into smaller regions) was prepared to show the applicability of our data for agencies interested in seeing how irrigation was affected at a regional scale. Figure 3d\\u2013f well represent severe drought year of 2012, which was the lowest irrigated area during the period of 2000\\u20132015. The entire eastern and lower northern plain was affected by severe drought. For the three targeted time periods, temporal variations due to rainfall anomalies were reflected in our irrigation maps. More detailed regional representation of irrigation mapping results for four locations with different climatic and regional LULC patterns across India are shown in Fig. 4. We considered Landsat (Table 1) satellite data collected during the 2000\\u20132001 crop growing season to show surface conditions (at higher spatial resolution) of the obtained irrigated area and LULC for more specific thematic image information. The 250-m irrigated area estimates from the MODIS NDVI and IWMI data (250\\u2009m) were used to compare irrigated area in the selected locations in the north, south, east and western parts of India with respect to different LULC types to check whether any of these irrigated area data (250\\u2009m MODIS and IWMI) were subjected to under or over estimation (Fig. 4). A noticeable difference in the MODIS-based 250\\u2009m data and that obtained from IWMI was found suggesting an overestimation of irrigated area in the IWMI data, which is consistent with the comparison against the ground based DES data (Fig. 4). A substantial decline in irrigation was shown in MODIS 250\\u2009m results compared to the IWMI data. Disparities in both the datasets can be primarily attributed to classification approaches13. We also considered central and south regions where the majority of area under either forest and agriculture, and IWMI based irrigated area maps overestimated the irrigated areas in several of these forested locations that were none, whereas the 250\\u2009m MODIS-derived maps were free from such effect due to removal of such area prior to the irrigation classification phase. Availability of ground reference data of irrigated area can be used for accuracy assessment of irrigated area maps developed at higher resolution. These findings highlight the importance of moderate resolution 250\\u2009m irrigated area maps for a country like India that has small irrigated land holdings. The irrigated area maps developed using the moderate resolution satellite information and the classification methodology outlined in this paper can be used to estimate irrigation water demands and water resources planning. It is also important to emphasize that irrigated area estimation should be conducted annually to get better understanding of influence of climatic variations on irrigation.

Each column from left to right represent north, east, central and southern region of India. Full size image Usage Notes A simple but effective classification method for mapping irrigated areas was presented in this paper that uses seasonal peaks of NDVIiclass in a hierarchal decision model for mapping irrigated area for India annually between 2000 and 2015. The classification method was calibrated separately for each agroecological region considering the region\\u2019s ecological potential and short-term weather fluctuations. The SCM classification for crop mapping along with the application of decision tree model produced relatively accurate irrigated maps that were comparable with irrigated area reported by other studies for Indian region during the same period and also well depicted its inter-annual variability during water deficit years. Due to the lack of traditional ground reference data of known irrigated fields, areal statistical data were used to verify the classified irrigated area between 2000 and 2013 and SC-ST curves for cross verifying the published result for the 2001\\u20132002-time period. Irrigation area results from the maps produced in this study were consistent with the irrigated area of the DES and other published reports, which provides confidence that our technique is robust enough to be applied in other parts of the south Asian region. Uncertainty and bias in the estimated irrigated area can be further reduced by using a high resolution NDVI data that can capture the variability in the small land holdings in India. In general, high resolution irrigation data are required to study irrigation water requirement, for applications such as cropping pattern changes, combining hydrologic modeling to determine ground water recharge in arid and semi-arid regions, assessment of water demands at catchment scale, characterizing spatial and temporal variation of crop yields caused by irrigation, temporal and spatial pattern of evapotranspiration in highly irrigated area. For example, high resolution maps can be used to assess the fraction of areas under irrigation in Taluks in India as displayed in Fig. 3. Figure 3 highlights the substantial irrigation fluctuations in areas of north and southern regions. Around 19% decline in irrigated area was noticed during 2012 drought year as compared to the previous years, which shows that the region was affected by this severe drought event. A sub-region scale irrigation climatology can also be developed using this annual times-series irrigation data set. The dataset can also be used to estimate irrigation water demands and water management under the water stress conditions. The irrigated area maps can be used for planning in water resources and agriculture in India. Irrigated area maps are presented in tiff format for each water year (2000\\u20132001, 2001\\u20132002 and 2014\\u20132015). The maps can be easily imported in ArcGIS for analysis of irrigated area in any region in India. Additional Information How to cite this article: Ambika, A. K. et al.

This paper presents two case studies of applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Water Footprint (WF) approaches to tea and margarine. The WF, excluding grey water, of a carton of 50 g tea is 294 L green water and 10 L blue water, and that of a 500 g tub of margarine is 553 L green water, 109 L blue water. The inventory results in the LCA studies (blue water) are 13 L for tea and 114 L for margarine. In the impact assessment phase of WF, Coonoor in Southern India appears as a potential hotspot for tea production, although the water consumed in energy to boil the kettle and by the consumer are also significant. For margarine the main potential hotspot is irrigated sunflower around Zaporizhia in Ukraine. The impact assessment results of LCA for tea causes the water in the consumer use phase to be down-weighted and stresses the contribution from Coonoor due to the higher water scarcity of this region. Similarly the LCA impact assessment of margarine causes the palm oil contribution to be down-weighted due to the low water scarcity of Medan in Indonesia. From these case studies we identify similarities, differences and synergies at both the water accounting and impact assessment levels for both approaches with the purpose of improving and advancing the water resource assessment process.

Introduction Freshwater in sufficient quantities and adequate quality is a fundamental resource to all ecological and societal activities, including food production, industrial activities, and human sanitary conditions. One of the biggest water problems around the world is scarcity. Currently, about one third of the world's population is threatened by a lack of freshwater to meet their daily needs (IWMI, 2007), and yet increased water scarcity is expected in the future in many regions, due to a variety of factors such as population growth, pollution of existing resources, climate change, urbanization and changing lifestyles. In many regions, water supplies are not sufficient to satisfy all agricultural, industrial and environmental demands. Given that severe freshwater scarcity is a common phenomenon in many regions of the world, improving the governance of the world's limited annual freshwater supply is a major challenge, not only relevant to water users and managers but also to final consumers, businesses and policymakers in a more general sense. About 86% of all water used in the world is to grow food. Therefore, the need for the food industry to take a responsible approach towards the sustainable use and conservation of freshwater is vital. However, collecting and disseminating meaningful water-related information is a complicated and difficult undertaking, since corporate water accounting methods are still under development and require further refinement (Morrison et al., 2010). It seems nevertheless agreed that methods aiming to measure impacts on water consumption from consumer products must take a supply-chain or life-cycle perspective, due to the majority of burden on water resources being indirect (Morrison et al., 2010). There are currently two main approaches enabling such a comprehensive assessment of products, namely Water Footprint (WF) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The WF concept was introduced by Hoekstra in 2002 (Hoekstra, 2003), and subsequently elaborated by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2004) as an indicator of human appropriation of freshwater resources that incorporates both direct and indirect water use of a consumer or producer. This method has a wide applicability; it is possible to derive the WF of an individual, a community, a business or a nation. In the particular case of products, the WF is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the product, summed over the various steps of the production chain. WF is a multi-dimensional indicator, showing water consumption volumes by source and polluted volumes by type of pollution; all components of a total water footprint are specified geographically and temporally (Hoekstra et al., 2009a). The blue water footprint refers to consumption of blue water resources (surface and ground water) along the supply chain of a product. \\u2018Consumption\\u2019 refers to loss of water from the available ground-surface water body in a catchment area, which happens when water evaporates, is incorporated into a product or returns to another catchment area or the sea (Hoekstra et al., 2011). The green water footprint refers to consumption of green water resources (rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture). The grey water footprint refers to pollution and is defined as the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on existing ambient water quality standards. LCA is a tool to measure the various environmental impacts caused by products from cradle to grave (Finnveden et al., 2009). However, in most LCA studies water consumption has been traditionally omitted (Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2009). Nevertheless, through the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative and ISO, the LCA community has started pushing the development of comprehensive methods for water accounting at both the inventory and impact assessment levels. In a recent paper, Berger and Finkbeiner (2010) reviewed thirteen different methods enabling the assessment of water use impacts in LCA. One of the main purposes of both LCA and WF is the identification of so-called \\u2018hot-spots\\u2019. This commonly refers to identifying activities within the life cycle of a product or service that have a significant contribution to the total potential impact attributed to the product. This means identifying regions where the water footprint of the product is large and water scarcity is high too. This paper presents a practical comparison of these two approaches, illustrated using pilot studies on tea and margarine. These studies were conducted in order to quantify water consumption associated with these products and to understand their potential impact on water scarcity taking a life cycle perspective. In addition, the general goal of this work was to explore strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and to identify areas where the LCA and WF communities might learn from one another. We sought to apply the methodologies as they were applied at the time (2010), and where relevant we discuss how both approaches have moved on since the pilot. 2. Data, methods and assumptions 2.1. Products under study The case study on tea was based on a specific pack of 25 Tea Bags, which includes 50 g tea. The tea for the product is grown in Kenya, Indonesia and India (specific locations in Table 1). Dry tea leaves are transported to Manchester in the UK, where they are blended and sent for packing in Brussels, from where the product is distributed. It is assumed that consumption of the product occurs in Belgium. Table 1. Summary of data used in calculating the supply chain water footprints of tea and margarine.

The case study on margarine was based on a specific 500 g tub of margarine, produced in Pratau (Germany) and sold in the German market. The main ingredients for margarine production are several vegetable oils produced in several countries (locations in Table 1). Fig. 1 shows a simplified diagram of the products' life cycles.

Packaging waste management is only included in LCA. Arrows indicate terrestrial or maritime transport steps. 2.2. Water Footprint The WF of products was calculated following the methodology described in Hoekstra et al. (2009a) and Ercin et al. (2010). However, grey water was excluded from this work, with the focus on only green and blue water footprints. Water quality is currently addressed separately from quantity within Unilever, and the LCA models addressing various potential impacts on water quality (e.g. eutrophication, acidification, aquatic eco-toxicity) were outside scope of this work and therefore grey water was also excluded. Both operational and supply-chain water footprint consist of two parts: the water footprint that can be directly related to inputs applied in or for the production of our product and an overhead water footprint. The overhead water footprint refers to freshwater use that in first instance cannot be fully associated with the production of the specific product considered, but refers to freshwater use that associates with supporting activities and materials used in the business, which produces not just this specific product but other products as well. 2.2.1. Supply chain WF The supply-chain water footprint is defined as the amount of freshwater consumed to produce all the goods and services that form the input of production at the specific business unit. In the scope of this study, the ingredients (tea, rapeseed oil etc.) and other components (packing materials, labelling materials etc.) are included in the supply chain water footprint calculations. The green and blue water footprints of the agricultural ingredients (tea, rapeseed oil, maize oil, sunflower oil, palm oil) are calculated using the methodology described in Hoekstra et al. (2009a). The green and blue water evapotranspiration were estimated using the CROPWAT model (FAO, 2003). Within the CROPWAT model, the \\u2018irrigation schedule option\\u2019 was applied, which includes a dynamic soil water balance and keeps track of the soil moisture content over time. The calculations are done using climate data from the nearest and most representative meteorological stations located in the major crop-producing regions obtained from the CLIMWAT database (FAO, 2006) and a specific cropping pattern for each crop according to the type of climate. For tea, actual irrigation data averaged over several years was available. These water volumes, which referred to water abstraction, were lower than the theoretical evapotranspiration requirement, and were used in preference. Yields (tonne/ha) were obtained where possible from suppliers, and the remainder were taken from FAO (2009a), using averages over 2005\\u20132007. It must be highlighted that there was a lack of specific sourcing information for crops in the margarine study, since only the country of origin was known, but not the region within a country. Therefore regions had to be assumed based on general information on crop growing regions, for example Monfreda et al. (2008) and the United States Division of Agriculture (USDA, 2004). Water consumed during processing of raw materials involves blue water consumption, especially in edible oils production. Inventory data from a recent LCA study on margarine provided data from oil mills on water abstraction (Nilsson et al., 2010). It was assumed that water used in the mills for steam production is not consumed, as it is basically used in a closed system. With regard to cooling water, it was assumed that only 5% of the abstracted water is consumed (evaporated), whereas the remaining 95% is discharged again to the environment (Rosiek et al., 2010; Mu\\u00f1oz et al., 2010). In order to derive WFgreen and WFblue per tonne processed ingredient, product and value fractions were applied. The product fraction is used to reflect mass balances when processing raw materials, whereas the value fraction is used to allocate burdens between co-products based on economic value. Table 1 summarises the data used for all ingredients, including product and value fractions. The blue water footprint associated with the production of packaging materials was estimated using the ecoinvent database (Hischier, 2007). It was estimated assuming that abstracted freshwater is consumed, with the exception of cooling water, where only 5% is assumed to be evaporated, as described above. Green water for paper and cardboard production was estimated based on the amount of green water consumed by tree growth (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2008), and the amount of wood required in the paper and cardboard production processes, according to the ecoinvent datasets used (see Table 1). The overhead supply-chain WF included several goods and services used in the factories that are not directly used in the production process. Following Ercin et al. (2010), only water footprints of concrete, steel, paper and energy (electricity and fuel) are selected in the overhead calculations. Water consumption for these inputs was also estimated from the ecoinvent database (Hischier, 2007; Kellenberger et al., 2007; Dones et al., 2007) with the same assumptions described above. Finally, green and blue water consumption in electricity production was estimated on a country basis (Table 1). 2.2.2. Operational WF The operational water footprint is defined as the amount of freshwater consumed at a specific business unit, i.e. the direct freshwater consumption. In this study, the operational water footprints of the products included water incorporated into the product as an ingredient, water consumed during the production process, and an overhead WF related to e.g. drinking water and toilets. These components of the WF were calculated from data obtained from the tea and margarine factories. 2.2.3. Consumer WF Margarine does not require water during use, as it is mainly used as spread. However, the indirect WF of keeping the product cool in the fridge was taken into account (Table 2). The electricity consumed was estimated as 0.074 kWh per tub of margarine (Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2010a). For tea preparation the energy used to boil water was taken into account. According to Mu\\u00f1oz et al. (2008), the human body evaporates (through breathing and perspiration) 35% of the ingested water. This percentage was used to account for evaporated water in the tea study. The remaining 65% was assumed to be discharged to the same watershed where it had been previously abstracted, thus constituting a non-consumptive use. Table 2. Summary of data used in the life cycle inventories of tea and margarine. Process Data and sources Tea Agriculture (weighed average from Kenya, India, Indonesia) Fertiliser dosage (1.8E-3 kg NH4H2PO4, 0.029 kg NH4HCO3, 1.3E-3 kg KCl, 5.8E-3 kg K2SO4, 0.062 kg phosphate rock, 1.2E-3 kg (NH4)2SO4, all figures per 50 g dry tea) obtained from suppliers, and from FAO (2009b) where supplier data were not available. The inventory included irrigation (3.9 L/50 g dry tea), calculated with the water footprint method, diesel fuel for machinery (4.1E-4 kg/50 g dry tea) and pesticide application (1.5E-7 kg active ingredient/50 g dry tea) Processing Fuel and electricity consumption for tea drying was obtained from suppliers, as 90 MJ kg\\u22121 dry tea (95% of the fuel input as biomass, 1% light fuel and 4% electricity) Transport to UK Road distance from 300 to 1000 km. Maritime transport distances range from 11,000 to 16,000 km Blending Energy for blending in the Trafford Park factory is 2.54 MJ kg\\u22121 dry tea (98% electric, 2% gas) Packaging production Packaging materials for a 50 g tea pack are the tea bag (kraft paper, 4.75 g), tag (kraft paper, 3.25 g), string (cellulose, 0.5 g), envelope (kraft paper, 14 g), box (solid bleached board, 13 g), overwrap, secondary, tertiary packaging (polyethylene film, 2.1 g), and secondary packaging (corrugated cardboard, 14 g) Packing Energy for packing in the Brussels factory is 4.9 MJ kg\\u22121 dry tea (98% electric, 2% gas) Use 125 L tap water are assumed to be used per kg tea (250 mL per cup) and 49.5 MJ electricity per kg tea (DEFRA, 2008) to boil the water with a kettle. 35% of ingested water is evaporated by the human body (Mu\\u00f1oz et al., 2008). Waste management Packaging recycling rates in Belgium were obtained from Duncan (2007). Recycling process is cut-off. Disposal of non-recycled packaging and tea leftovers consists of 13% landfilling and 87% incineration, which is the average disposal scenario for household waste in Belgium according to EUROSTAT (2010). Margarinea Agriculture Includes fertilizers, diesel fuel and pesticide use Edible oil extraction Includes steam, electricity and hexane consumption. Allocation between co-products is based on economic value. Transport to refinery Transport of palm oil and palm kernel oil involves a maritime distance of 14,800 km. The distance for sunflower oil is 11,500 km. Road transport of maize oil (150 km) and rapeseed oil 9650 km) is also included Oil refining Includes consumption of chemicals (activated carbon, bleaching earth) and energy (electricity, diesel fuel and steam). Allocation between refined oil and acid oil co-product is based on economic value. Interesterification Includes the energy use for the previous step of palm oil fractionation to obtain palm olein and estearine. Mass allocation was used in this co-production process. Enzymatic interesterification of palm kernel oil and palm estearine includes the consumption of bleaching earth and energy (natural gas and electricity) Packaging production Includes production of polypropylene tub and lid, aluminium-polyethylene sealing, as well as cardboard and shrinkwrap for secondary and tertiary packaging Margarine production Includes energy use in the plant (electricity, light fuel oil and natural gas) Distribution Not required, as the regional distribution centre and the factory are located in Pratau (Germany). Retail operations were excluded from the study. Use We estimated the energy requirements to keep the product refrigerated at home as 0.074 kWh per 500 g, based on the following assumptions (Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2010a, Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2010b): 21 days storage time, 75% of fridge volume actually usable, 0.0127 MJ L\\u22121 day\\u22121 and volume-to-weight ratio of the product of 1.5 L kg\\u22121 Waste management Waste packaging is recycled, landfilled or incinerated according to the German scenario for each material. The recycling process is cut-off. a For further details on margarine see Nilsson et al. (2010). 2.2.4. Impact assessment The water footprint assessment starts with quantifying, localizing and describing the colour of the water footprint. Ideally the next step is identifying the vulnerability of the local water systems where the footprint is located, the actual competition over the water in these local systems and the negative socio-economic and environmental externalities associated with the use of the water. The impact assessment reported in this paper reflects an earlier stage of development in identifying impacts within water footprint studies. It focuses on identification of hotspots, following the approach of Ercin et al. (2010). We compare the blue water footprints of the ingredients with the water scarcity in the different regions where the water footprint is located. We defined the hotspots as the regions where the blue water footprint of products is large and where water scarcity is high. The level of water scarcity is taken from Smakhtin et al. (2004a, 2004b). We considered the water scarcity as high when the environmental water stress index (WSI) defined by Smakhtin is higher than 0.6. The environmental WSI is the ratio of the annual withdrawals in an area over the annual water availability in that area. The latter measured as the mean annual runoff (MAR) minus the environmental water requirements (EWR). Most recently an improved global water scarcity map has been published by Hoekstra and Mekonnen (2011). The environmental WSI thus represents the withdrawal-to-availability ratio with accounting for environmental water requirements. Assessment of the green WF sustainability is excluded from this study. The reason for this is that quantitative analysis of the sustainability of the green WF is a largely unexplored field. The difficulty lies in the estimation of green water availability. Particularly, data are lacking on the environmental green water requirement for preserving ecosystems and on the quantities of evapotranspiration that cannot be made productive in crop production. 2.3. LCA 2.3.1. Scope The LCA studies aimed to quantify only impacts on water consumption, whereas other impact categories commonly assessed in LCA studies, such as global warming, acidification or eutrophication, are not discussed in this paper. The system boundaries included all the life cycle stages from cradle to grave. In summary this involves: \\u2022 Production and processing of raw materials \\u2022 Packaging production \\u2022 Transport of materials \\u2022 Product manufacturing \\u2022 Transport to regional distribution centre \\u2022 Use \\u2022 Waste management (packaging and product leftovers) \\u2022 Production of auxiliary materials and energy carriers Transports to retailer and to the consumer household were neglected, as well as treatment of wastewater from tea consumption. 2.3.2. Data sources For margarine a model from a previous LCA study on this product was used (Nilsson et al., 2010). For tea a model was built specifically for this study, using the same primary data sources used in the WF study. Table 2 shows a summary of the main assumptions and data used for both products in the inventory analysis. All background processes, such as energy carriers, transport services, fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals were modelled with the ecoinvent database (Dones et al., 2007; Spielmann et al., 2007; Nemecek et al., 2007; Althaus et al., 2007). For electricity production, although ecoinvent datasets were used to model different production technologies, the country profiles were obtained from International Energy Agency statistics (IEA, 2010). 2.3.3. Water accounting One of the key differences between LCA and the WF is that the former does not account for green water in the same way (Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2009), while impacts on water quality (grey water) are dealt with by means of other impact categories such as eutrophication or freshwater ecotoxicity, which are not included in this work. Another difference is that the need to use consumed (rather than abstracted) water has only recently been recognised by the LCA community, and LCA inventory data is still predominantly abstracted water. In the agricultural stage blue water consumption in irrigation was obtained from the corresponding WF calculations (Section 2.2.1). In the processing stage it was also possible to determine when water use is consumptive, since primary data sources were used. However in the background system (provision of fertilisers, energy carriers, packaging materials, etc.) this was not straightforward, as typically inventory data refer to abstracted water rather than consumed water. The assumption made was that all freshwater abstractions are consumptive, with the exception of water used for cooling, as already described in Section 2.2.1. Sea water abstraction as well as in-stream water use by hydropower plants described in inventory data were not considered as water consumption. Land use effects on the water balance (net green water) as described by Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al. (2009, 2010b) were neither considered. 2.3.4. Impact assessment In Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) characterisation factors are applied to water volumes consumed in different regions, with the aim of generating an aggregated metric similar to what is done for carbon footprints. Different methods to obtain such characterisation factors have been proposed (Berger and Finkbeiner, 2010). The characterisation model used in the tea and margarine case studies is the WSI, as described by Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al. (2009, 2010b) for the impact category Freshwater Ecosystem Impact (FEI). FEI is measured as volume of \\u2018ecosystem-equivalent\\u2019 water. This concept is basically the same as the scarcity-weighed water volumes used by Ridoutt and Pfister (2010), referring to water volumes which are equivalent in terms of local scarcity. FEI is calculated as shown in Eq. (1): (1) Where CWUi is consumptive water use taking place in a river basin or region (L), WSIi is the WSI value for the affected river basin or region, and i to n are the set of river basins, regions or countries in which water is consumed. For their application in the LCA studies, WSI values were determined using the WaterGAP model (Alcamo et al., 2003). This model includes annual average WSI values on basin scale, taking into account environmental water requirements, as defined by Smakhtin et al. (2004a, 2004b). Site-specific WSI values were used for crop locations, whereas country averages were used for the remaining activities in the life cycle (Table 3). Conversion of basin WSI values to country WSI values was carried out using the Geographic Information System (GIS) ArcGIS v.9.2 (ESRI, 2010). Country level WSI values were calculated as the average from the river basins lying within the country boundaries, using river basin area as the weighting factor. Table 3. Water Stress Index values used in WF and LCA studies. Country Water Stress Indexa UK average 0.30 Belgium average 0.83 Germany average 0.55 Germany: Salzgitter 0.55 The Netherlands average 0.63 Kenya average 0.06 Kenya: Kericho 0.08 Kenya: Nyeri 0.07 India average 0.70 India: Cotagiri and Coonoor 5.20 Indonesia average 0.03 Indonesia: Agrabinta 0.01 Indonesia: Medan 0.20 Poland average 0.39 Czech Republic average 0.62 Czech Republic: Karlovy Vary 0.70 Hungary average 0.45 Hungary: Szederkeny 0.45 France average 0.33 France: Alsace 0.59 Argentina average 0.25 Argentina: Tres Arroyos 0.13 Ukraine average 0.49 Ukraine: Zaporizhia 0.48 a See Section 2.3.4. The application of WSI values in the characterisation step of LCIA requires knowing the regions where water consumption takes place. These are known for the foreground systems of both tea and margarine (crop cultivation, industrial processing, etc.), but not for their background systems (production of energy carriers, chemicals, etc.). Since the background data used in this study lacks the information detail to trace back the location of all individual water flows, the following assumptions were made: \\u2022 All background processes take place in the same country where the corresponding foreground process takes place. For example, water consumed in the life cycle of fertilisers used in Kenya is assumed to be consumed in Kenya. \\u2022 Most transport processes, either maritime or terrestrial, are international, thus it is not possible to directly assign a WSI to their water consumption. For this reason, and taking into account that water consumption associated to transports in these case studies constitutes a very small contribution, we decided to neglect them in the impact assessment phase. 3. Results of the case studies 3.1. Water accounting Table 4 shows the results of the water accounting phase for the WF studies, measured in litres. The water footprints from various sources reflect the different proportions of the ingredients, while Table 1 allows a direct comparison of materials in m3/tonne. The WF of a carton of 25 tea bags is 294 L green water and 10 L blue water. In the case of margarine, the footprint is 553 L green water and 109 L blue water. In both margarine and tea the contribution of the operational and the overhead supply chain WFs is negligible as compared to the ingredients and packaging materials. The same was found by Ercin et al. (2010) in a pilot study on a soft drink. Table 4. Water footprint results for the water accounting stage.

The inventory results in the LCA studies are shown in Table 5 as 13 L for tea and 114 L for margarine. The water volumes are lower compared to the overall WF results, as in LCA only blue water is accounted for. In the case of tea almost 50% of the consumed water is related to the consumer stage, while in margarine the consumer stage is negligible and 73% of the consumed water is related to irrigation of sunflower.

The assumptions made, particularly that all freshwater abstractions are consumptive in the background system (except for water used for cooling) and concerning sourcing locations, mean that the estimates should be regarded as approximations. However, this does not affect the comparison of methods. 3.2. Impact assessment For the impact assessment we first overlaid the map showing the geographical spreading of the water footprint of product ingredients and the global water scarcity map (Figs. 2 and 3). As seen from Fig. 2, the blue water footprint of tea production only occurs around Coonoor in India. Around 40% of the total blue water footprint of the tea product stems from this region. In addition, the region experiences high water scarcity (WSI>1). Therefore we only identified this region of Southern India as the hotspot for the tea product. On the other hand, it must be stressed that the percentage of tea from Southern India in the blend is relatively small (10%). It can be seen that growing tea in both Kenya and Indonesia are not hotspots as the WSI is lower than 0.6 in those regions and 100% of the WF is green in these locations, i.e. they are fully rain-fed.

Fig. 3 illustrates the overlay map for margarine ingredients. Margarine constitutes a rather more complex case study than tea, due to the higher number of crops and locations involved. The highest water scarcity is found in Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic (WSI = 0.70). However, only 5% of the rapeseed oil is sourced from this location. In addition, the crop is entirely rain-fed, which means that the production from this region is not a hotspot. The sunflower cultivation in Ukraine can be considered as a potential hotspot although WSI is less than 0.6 (WSI is 0.48 in Zaporizhia) because most of the water used is blue water, and sunflower oil production in this country is responsible for 70% of the total blue water footprint of the product. The results of the impact assessment phase in LCA are shown in Table 5. These results allow us to identify the most important processes or life cycle stages in terms of water consumption, taking into account the relative scarcity where water is consumed. It is worth noting that after applying the characterisation factors, the units of the inventory (L) and the impact assessment (ecosystem-eq. L) are no longer the same, and can only be compared on a relative basis, such as percentages. In the tea case study the WSI around Coonoor gives greater emphasis to this part of the life cycle than considering the volumes alone. For margarine, the impact assessment results highlight the relative importance of sunflower oil production, while the contribution from palm oil and palm kernel oil shrinks, as Medan in Indonesia has a low water-scarcity. 4. Discussion 4.1. Discussion of the results Previous studies related to water consumption of similar products are scarce. In fact, we did not find any published study on water-related issues for margarine, whereas only two studies have been published on tea (Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2007; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010). A WF of 17\\u201334 L per cup of tea was estimated for the average Dutch consumption. Extrapolating these figures to 50 g tea leads to a WF of 283\\u2013567 L, which is in agreement with our estimate, lying in the lower part of this range. Nevertheless these studies have been applied with different system boundaries, since the present study includes packaging and also the consumer phase, whereas Chapagain and Hoekstra focused on water consumption in the agricultural stage. If packaging and consumer water are excluded in Table 4, the resulting WF of the studied tea is 269 L, below the range calculated by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2007). The differences are mainly due to origins of ingredients as WF values are very sensitive to the production locations of the agricultural inputs (different climatic conditions). Additionally the difference is due to higher yields considered in the present study, as wherever possible this information was obtained from suppliers rather than from FAO statistics, which provide average national yields. The results of the impact assessment have identified tea growing around Coonoor and sunflower growing in Ukraine as potential hotspots for further investigation. These results must be taken with care, due to the level of uncertainty involved in the data used. In the case of sunflower, for example, we did not have data from suppliers, which meant we had to make some important assumptions: the theoretical irrigation requirements were assumed to be met, since the irrigation practices were not known. In addition, the yield was taken as the FAO country average, which tends to be low when compared to data from suppliers. Finally, it must be taken into account that sourcing varies from year to year, thus the sourcing proportions used in these case studies could be different in coming years. Concerning application of the results in a business context, studies such as this may be used to identify potential risks (hotspots) which should be investigated further. Having identified with suppliers the crop\\u2013location combinations requiring attention, response strategies may then be developed to minimise impacts on water, within the broader context of overall sustainability. The numbers are not precise, and are not appropriate for communication with customers and consumers; in some cases it is now possible to get more precise data (e.g. improvements in water database values for background processes) but other sources of uncertainty remain, for example precise sourcing locations. In this sense, it is important to strive for greater transparency in supply-chains. The studies also showed that the operational and overhead water footprints were very small for these types of product, and provided evidence for simplification of the WF approach. 4.2. Comparison of approaches LCA and WF come from different backgrounds and are useful for different purposes. LCA produces a single number for each impact category which seeks to describe the potential impact (e.g. on water scarcity) across the life cycle. With ingredients coming from regions of the world with very different scarcity, it is appropriate to weight the volumes in the different locations by characterisation factors which allow for this. Weighting has been shown to give quite different results over using the aggregated volume from the inventory (e.g. Ridoutt and Pfister, 2010), and some difference is seen here in both case studies. A single number is useful for communication purposes in summarising the potential impact of a product. The WF approach has been developed from a water resource management perspective, and is strong in addressing the local and temporal nature of water-related impacts. The focus is not on the final number but on the components at the different locations. Quantifying and accounting for water use and related impacts in the appropriate time and spatial scales, could provide transparent information to improve water efficiency and develop robust corporate water strategies. Further analysis would investigate the particular water resources used, when the water is used, how else is water being used in the same area, and consider the sustainability of the water consumption at each location. A subsequent step would be to develop response strategies. The methods have additional strengths and weaknesses. The methodology for calculation of blue and green water used by crops is well-established, and it also works well for individual factories. The strength of LCA is its robust systems analysis foundation, spanning several decades during which many issues related to defining the systems' function and boundaries have been debated and resolved. Water is considered alongside other impacts, and tools such as LCA software and data are well-established, particularly for water abstraction in industrial processes. Both the LCA and WF communities agree on the move to consider consumed water, which is complementary to abstracted water (UNEP-SETAC, 2010), an approach originally developed by the WF community. Table 6 seeks to summarise the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. Table 6. A comparison of the LCA and water footprint approaches.

(2010). From a product level perspective, LCA and WF both seek to assess life cycle impacts on water resources. In fact, when using similar data sources, as is the case for the studies presented in this paper, they lead to similar results at the accounting/inventory stage, with the small differences due to slight differences in boundary conditions from applying the \\u2018standard\\u2019 methods. The fundamental difference is the inclusion of characterisation factors in LCA, rather than simply providing the volumes. In spite of conceptual similarities, typically LCA and WF studies have a different scope and use different data sources. For example: \\u2022 WF includes green water, whereas LCA does not include it, or accounts for it differently. \\u2022 WF includes a grey water component to account for water pollution, whereas in LCA several impact categories are used to deal with water quality. \\u2022 LCA usually allows for an assessment of large systems, taking advantage of specific software and databases developed through the last two decades, mainly focused on water abstraction in industrial processes. WF is a more recent field and databases applying spatial and temporal detail are under development, particularly on the agricultural side. The green water footprint measures the part of the evaporated rainwater that has been appropriated for the production of the products and is therefore not available for nature. Green water resources are limited and thus scarce, which gives an argument to account the green water footprint like blue water footprint. Besides, green water can be substituted by blue water and sometimes \\u2013 particularly in agriculture \\u2013 the other way around as well, so that a complete picture can be obtained only by accounting for both. In addition, having knowledge of a crop's total water consumption (blue and green footprints) allows managing potential future sourcing risks: a crop with a large green water footprint today may require a large blue footprint through irrigation tomorrow, if rainfall patterns change. However, green water consumption by the product system does not generally introduce significant changes in the local environment (i.e. as compared to green water evaporation if the system had not been established). Consequently green water is generally excluded from the impact assessment phase in LCA (Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2009). On the other hand, the difference caused by the product system on rainwater availability to ecosystems may be included as the \\u201cland use effects on the water cycle\\u201d (Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2009); Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al. (2010b) find a small contribution from these land use effects on the Freshwater Ecosystem Impact, and they have not been included in the present analysis. Further analyses are needed on this. With regard to data availability, the WF offers a systematic approach to calculate water requirements by crops, which could be used by LCA practitioners, as shown in this paper. Beyond the farm boundaries, however, there is a general lack of data on water consumed by products and services. In this context, the WF community can take advantage of LCA databases and software tools, although as shown in our case studies LCA databases currently focus on water abstraction and lack the level of detail required to assess impacts on water resources. The growing interest in water by the LCA community is driving the improvement of existing inventory databases. At the impact assessment level, WF and LCA address the same issues, but from different perspectives and with different purposes. In LCA single values are used to express impacts, whereas in WF single values are avoided (Hoekstra et al., 2009b). Despite this difference, we identified several common problems: \\u2022 The assessment requires knowing where all the processes involved in the life cycle take place, since water scarcity is local. This is in practice not possible with complex products, since many supply chains are global and dynamic, and tracing back all processes is not feasible. Assumptions like those made in our case studies will therefore be required, or otherwise the system boundaries narrowed. \\u2022 For impact assessment, both approaches rely on the use of a water scarcity indicator. We used the scarcity indicator of Smakhtin et al. (2004a, 2004b), following the approach of Mil\\u00e0 i Canals et al., 2009. Various improvements to this indicator have been suggested (Fingerman et al., 2011). The blue water scarcity index (Hoekstra et al., 2011; Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2011) considers consumptive use, takes better account of environmental flows and is also available on a monthly basis. The variation factor and the logistic curve-fitting techniques introduced by Pfister et al. (2009) to account for climate variability and non-linearity of stress effects may also be considered. These were not available at the time of the study. \\u2022 We found that small basins tend to show disproportionately high WSI values as most water statistics do not consider water re-use: in a river the water is used several times before discharged to the sea, e.g. by factories located up- and downstream, and this is counted twice in the river's statistics, leading to higher WSI values. 5. Conclusions and outlook Impacts on water resources across the life cycle of tea and margarine were assessed using the WF, following the Water Footprint Network guidelines (Hoekstra et al., 2009a, 2011), and LCA. The assessment included water accounting and impact assessment. The system boundaries were broader in the LCA studies, as LCA software and databases allow for inclusion of more background services. The WF (excluding grey water) of a carton of 25 tea bags (50 g of tea) is 294 L green water, 10 L blue water, and that of a 500 g tub of margarine is 553 L green water, 109 L blue water. The inventory results in the LCA studies, which correspond to blue water in the WF, are 13 L for tea and 114 L for margarine. The slight differences observed are due to differences in boundary conditions, although both methods have the potential for a full cradle-to-grave coverage of the products. The philosophical differences between the methods are in the impact assessment; weighting the contributions due to scarcity in the LCA approach gives greater emphasis to tea-growing in Coonoor in terms of its potential impact on water scarcity. The WF approach comes from a watershed resource management perspective and focuses on the components at the different locations. Further analysis would consider the particular water resources used and investigate the sustainability of using the water. The LCA approach is useful for communication purposes and for presenting alongside other environmental impacts. The WFN approach provides transparent information on water use and related impacts in the appropriate time and spatial scales that could be useful to improve water efficiency and management. From the experience of these case studies it seems that the LCA and the WF communities share the same challenges when it comes to the assessment of products. Therefore it is our opinion that potential synergies exist, since they rely on the same data for water accounting and impact assessment, and would benefit from further collaboration and joint development of methods.

Studies have shown that some of the dams built in the tributaries and the main stem of the upper Mekong have already caused basin-wide impacts by altering the magnitude and seasonality of flows, blocking sediment transport, affecting fisheries and livelihoods of downstream inhabitants, and changing the flood pulse to the Tonle Sap Lake. There are hundreds of additional dams planned for the near future that would result in further changes, potentially causing permanent damage to the highly productive agricultural systems and fisheries, as well as the riverine and floodplain ecosystems. Several studies have examined the potential impacts of existing and planned dams but the integrated effects of the dams when combined with the adverse hydrologic consequences of climate change remain largely unknown. Here, we provide a detailed review of the existing literature on the changes in climate, land use, and dam construction and the resulting impacts on hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems across the Mekong. The review provides a basis to better understand the effects of climate change and accelerating human water management activities on the coupled hydrological-agricultural-ecological systems, and identifies existing challenges to study the region\\u2019s Water, Energy, and Food (WEF) nexus with emphasis on the influence of future dams and projected climate change. In the last section, we synthesize the results and highlight the urgent need to develop integrated models to holistically study the coupled natural-human systems across the basin that account for the impacts of climate change and water infrastructure development. This review provides a framework for future research in the Mekong, including studies that integrate hydrological, agricultural, and ecological modeling systems. Keywords: Mekong river basin; dams; hydropower; hydrology; climate change 1. Background The Mekong River that is shared by six nations in Southeast Asia is one of the most complex river systems in the world (Figure 1). It originates in the Tibetan Plateau in China and flows through Myanmar, Lao People\\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, and Cambodia draining a ~795,000 km2 watershed to the ocean at the Mekong Delta in Vietnam with an annual mean flow of ~15,000 km3/year [1]. It is the 10th largest river in the world in terms of mean annual flow at its mouth, is home to the most productive inland fishery [2], and is the second richest in aquatic biodiversity and freshwater capture fishery after the Amazon [3,4]. The Mekong River Basin (MRB) is characterized by unique and complex hydrologic, climatic, and physiographic features. From its headwaters in the high mountains (~4500 m elevation), the Mekong runs through deep, narrow gorges and steep terrains over a ~2200 km course before it enters the lower basin (the Lower Mekong River Basin\\u2014LMRB) at the Golden Triangle where the borders of Thailand, Lao PDR, China, and Myanmar come together (Figure 1). Further downstream, it flows through ~2600 km of channels before entering the South China Sea in the Mekong Delta [1,3]. These steep mountains in the upper Mekong and flat-fertile lands in its lower portion stretch over vast distances under strong climatic gradients, where natural and managed ecosystems co-evolve under rapid human development, and where many global issues (e.g., river regulation, land cover change, habitat loss, saltwater intrusion, degradation of groundwater quality) are rapidly emerging. Figure 1. Dams in the Mekong river basin. The background shows land use types and irrigated croplands obtained from Salmon et al. [11]. The inset shows the number of dams under different categories with identical color coding as for the circles in the map. The location of river gauging stations for which river discharge is shown in Figure 2 are displayed as red stars. The dam database was provided by the Research Program on Water, Land, and Ecosystems (WLE), Greater Mekong. Figure 2. Observed daily river discharge (a) for five gauging stations in the main stem of the Mekong which are shown in Figure 1, and the monthly seasonal cycle (b) for 1982\\u20131992 (solid lines) and 1993\\u20132004 periods (dashed lines). Data source: the Mekong River Commission (MRC). Despite the vast potential for large-scale hydropower development and water diversion for agricultural use, the Mekong has remained relatively unaltered compared to other large river basins in the world [5,6]. While several dams have been built over the past few decades, most are in the tributaries or capture only a small portion of the annual river flow [4,5]. The hydrology of the Mekong is thus still largely governed by the natural flow variations with distinct wet and dry seasons (Figure 2) dictated by the seasonal variability of precipitation that supports the highly productive agricultural and riverine ecological systems. The unique combination of these climatic, hydrologic, and topographic features has been the basis for a healthy and resilient natural ecosystem that supports the livelihoods of millions across the region. Food production in the basin relies on timely rainfall and a seasonal flood pulse, and fisheries in rivers, lakes, and wetlands benefit from abundant freshwater and nutrients supplied by the seasonal flood surges, while crops are grown on soils naturally fertilized by nutrient-rich sediments and flows timed with plentiful seasonal rainfall [7]. However, this is changing due to widespread alterations in land use along with the construction of several large dams in the Mekong main stem and hundreds of others in the tributaries. There are also plans to build an additional 16 mainstream and ~110 tributary dams by 2030 [2,4,5,8,9,10]. Figure 1 shows these dams along with the main land use categories [11]. Climate change is expected to add further stress to the region\\u2019s ecosystems in the decades to come. The wet season flow in the Mekong relies on the Asian monsoon, the rhythm, and intensity of which have noticeably changed in recent years. This has resulted in more frequent floods and droughts, devastating crops, and dramatically altering aquatic ecosystems, which have deeply disrupted rural livelihoods [7,12,13]. Meanwhile, temperature rises in the headwaters of the Mekong River [8,14] are altering the seasonality of stream flows, which has affected agricultural productivity and aquatic ecosystems. There are additional downstream pressures on water quantity and quality across the Mekong Delta due to sea level rise, salt water intrusion, groundwater overexploitation, and aquifer contamination. The combined impacts of the proliferation in dam construction, climate change, and sea level rise will likely result in unprecedented changes in the hydrologic, agricultural, and aquatic systems, especially in the LMRB [3,8,15,16]. Studies suggest that maintaining regional food security due to new dam construction and associated fishery loss [17] would require 19 to 63% expansion of agricultural land [18]. Such agricultural expansion will substantially increase water needs, yet the amount and source of the additional water supplies (e.g., groundwater) and the potential consequences are unknown. Moreover, the MRB hosts some of the world\\u2019s most productive agricultural systems, especially for cultivation of rice\\u2014the world\\u2019s most consumed grain after wheat [19]. Changes in food productivity in this region will thus have important implications for regional, national, and even global food security [20]. These issues call for a comprehensive analysis of the combined effects of climate change, sea level rise, dam construction, land use change, agricultural expansion, and increased water use on the hydrological, agricultural, and aquatic systems, along with the interactions and feedbacks among these intricately intertwined natural-human systems that are rapidly co-evolving. In the Mekong basin, where water, energy, and food (WEF) systems are very closely linked [21], such an analysis should account for all drivers of changes in WEF systems rather than being water-centric as in most previous studies [22]. Here, we provide a detailed review of the existing literature on the hydrology, climate change, land-water management, and human water use in the MRB. The objectives of the review are to: (1) contribute to the ongoing debate on the changing hydrologic regime of the Mekong due to climate change and accelerating human water management activities; (2) highlight key findings from the existing literature; and (3) identify challenges to study the coupled natural-human systems of the Mekong in the face of projected global changes. We present the review in the broader perspective of the emerging issue of WEF nexus, emphasizing the changes in the hydrologic and agricultural systems due to the ongoing dam construction and projected climate change. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we provide an overview of the historical hydroclimatic variabilities and trend based on observational and modeling studies. Then, we discuss dam construction, changes in land use, and expansion of agricultural and irrigated areas along with their impacts on the water cycle. Next, we provide a brief discussion on the use of groundwater in the Mekong Delta and the potential future changes. Then, we review the existing hydrological models that have been applied over the MRB to examine the impacts of changing climate and dam construction. We also discuss floodplain inundation, flow dynamics, sediment transport, and the changing hydrology of Tonle Sap Lake system along with the effects of climate change and future dams. Finally, we provide a synthesis and future outlook. 2. Historical Hydroclimatic Variabilities and Trend Hydrologically, the Mekong River has faced two major issues. First, rapid economic development and growing food and energy needs in its riparian countries have led to plans for massive hydropower development and agricultural expansion, causing deforestation and massive expansion of road networks throughout the region (details in Section 4 and Section 6). Second, the highly complex hydrological systems of the Mekong have been affected by climate change. Projections based on climate model results suggest a significant increase in basin-wide temperatures and changes in monsoon patterns. Since the average precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) over the basin are both expected to increase, it is unclear of how climate change will alter river flows, especially with the overlapping effects of new dams [8]. Predicting how the Mekong will respond to these changes requires a clear understanding of how the system has evolved under the dual influence of climate change and growing human impacts on the water cycle. It is also crucial to understand the interactions and feedbacks among the tightly coupled natural-human systems across the basin. In particular, since the Mekong is only recently starting to stray from its natural flow regime [1,23], it is important to understand the potential changes of the system while management practices are still able to mitigate negative consequences. Streamflow in the main stem of the Mekong is characterized by a strong seasonal cycle (Figure 2). Therefore, the differences in seasonal dynamics between the dry and monsoon seasons in the basin play an important role in the system response to human impacts from hydropower and climate change. Comparison of the monthly seasonal cycle during 1982\\u20131992 and 1993\\u20132004 periods suggests that the amplitude of the flood pulse has generally increased (Figure 2) at all five stations (Figure 1) in the middle and lower reach of the basin. However, a recent study that used the more recent flow records from the Chiang Saen station in the Upper Mekong suggests a decrease in maximum flows accompanied by an increased rate of flow decrease following the completion of upstream dams [24]. Upstream dam completion likely increases dry season flows and water level fluctuations, and the dam-induced fluctuations in upstream flows increase the variability in downstream flows more in the dry season than in the wet season. Studies suggest that flood duration, amplitude, and maximum water level decreased throughout the basin due to dam construction [24], which has also caused a significant delay in the start, peak, and end of seasonal flood pulse [25]. In the Upper Mekong precipitation was found to have increased dramatically from 1950s to 2010s at both the seasonal and annual scales, and especially in spring [26]. However, this is contrary to other studies on the Lower Mekong, which suggest that precipitation has not significantly changed over the past 50 years [27,28]. There have been widespread and significant increases in Upper Mekong temperatures, with a recent acceleration in rate. The most significant temperature changes are felt in winter months. Water levels measured at upstream dams show similar patterns before and during dam construction, suggesting that climatic factors have a significant influence on Upper Mekong water-level variations [29]. Analyses of flooding trends over time have shown a decrease in the average magnitude of Lower Mekong floods but the variability in flood magnitude has increased. The likelihood of extreme floods or low flows has increased through time, even before the construction of the first dams [30], which suggests that the shift in flood variability is likely due to large-scale atmospheric mechanisms. Studies have shown that climate variability and change in the Mekong region is primarily governed by the El Ni\\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which modulates the variations in the Asian monsoon, including the Western North Pacific Monsoon (WNPM) and Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) [31,32]. It has been suggested that the long-term changes in river flows and floods in the southern part of the basin are closely linked with the variability in WNPM [33]. Additionally, the relationship between ENSO, the WNPM, and ISM are transient on a decadal scale and have been shown to vary in magnitude since the 1970s [32,33]. Since there is a close connection between Pacific sea surface temperatures and monsoon variability, an increase in sea surface temperatures due to climate change is expected to be accompanied by increased variance of monsoon patterns and associated floods [33]. Differences in flood variability exist between the upper and Lower Mekong because the hydrology of the two regions is controlled by different atmospheric processes; the upper basin flows are controlled more by snowmelt and precipitation, while the lower basin flows are mostly linked to intense rainfall during the monsoon season [30]. The strength of the ISM has a strong inverse relationship with precipitation in the Northern basin. Furthermore, the Pacific decadal oscillation influences the variability of the WNPM [33]. There are no mechanisms that clearly explain relationships between these climatic systems, but it has been suggested to be a consequence of natural climate oscillations, anthropogenic climate change, and changes in land or water use [30]. Further research that includes a more mechanistic approach to understanding atmospheric dynamics should help project how these systems will respond to changes in land use and climate. Following the construction of the first major Mekong dams, climate change has been linked to ~82% of the flow change from 1991 to 2009. However, for the 2010\\u20132014 period, ~62% of the observed changes in flow [24] were found to be related to hydropower development. This disparity highlights the accelerating influence of direct human activities on the hydrology of the Mekong. The relative hydrologic impact of hydropower is expected to increase as more hydropower projects are completed. 3. Dams in the Mekong and Their Hydro-Agro-Ecological Impacts The strong topographic gradient, rugged terrain, and high flow volumes provide ideal conditions for large-scale hydropower development in the Mekong. The hydropower potential of the mainstem Mekong has been estimated to be ~53,000 MW with another 35,000 MW from tributaries [9,34]. Of this enormous potential, only a small fraction has been utilized thus far. Therefore, the developed hydropower capacity of existing project in the Mekong is currently very small relative to the installed capacity in the other two large rivers on the western Pacific: the Yellow and the Yangtze [27]. In particular, a huge amount of hydropower generation potential in the LMRB remains largely untapped. Laos alone has the theoretical potential of ~26,000 MW (~18,000 MW is technically feasible) [35,36]; of this only a tiny fraction was developed by the early 2000s [37] but the installed capacity increased to ~4200 MW in 2015 [35]. In the Upper Mekong, which is called the Lancang River, China has been developing hydropower projects as a cascade of dozens of mega dams (Figure 1); more than six of those have been completed in recent years and more than twelve others are under construction or planned for the near-term future [38]. These existing upper Mekong dams have already caused large-scale and trans-boundary impacts throughout the basin and the Lower Mekong dams are expected to largely compound these impacts by causing abrupt changes in water levels, altering sediment transport, and blocking fish migration [17]. Since there is still great untapped potential in the Lower Mekong, downstream countries have also been accelerating dam construction. While some large dam projects have recently been completed, others are under construction, and hundreds of others are planned [17] (Figure 1). Among those planned are 16 dams in the main stem (11 in the LMRB) and over 100 in the tributaries, most of which are expected to be completed by 2030 [2,4,5,8,9,10]; of the 11 planned in the LMRB, the Xayaburi is the first that is expected to go into operation in 2020. While Xayaburi dam has been built to fulfill the growing regional energy needs (its installed capacity will be 1,285 MW), experts believe that the energy supply will come with unprecedented and devastating costs to the environment and livelihoods of tens of millions of people in the region [9,17,39]. The dam will likely cause irreversible and permanent ecological change to the Mekong by altering the natural flow regime and adversely affecting fisheries and other aquatic resources; it will also affect flood-recession ecosystems in the lowlands and impede sediment delivery to the Mekong delta region [39,40,41,42,43]. Growing transportation networks, especially the mountain roads in headwater catchments, some of which are linked with the construction of new dams are causing significant changes in sediment production and deposition in river channels [44]. The dam will likely cause basin-wide changes, but the impacts are expected to be felt the most in the regions surrounding and downstream of the dams where serious threats to food security through loss of fisheries and agriculture are likely [2]. The Don Sahong (260 MW) and Pak Beng (912 MW) are the second and third largest dams, respectively, among the 11 mainstream cascade dams planned in the LMRB. Construction of these two dams has been approved despite significant controversies due to the complaints about their environmental impacts and long-term implications for ecological well-being and regional food security [17]. Similar to the Xayaburi dam, these two dams could irreversibly alter fish migration throughout the LMRB, with potentially devastating consequences for the river\\u2019s richest ecosystems and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people [45]. Several other hydropower projects are being planned in the tributaries of the Lower Mekong, including many in the Sekong, Sesan, and Sre Pok River basins that constitute the largest sub-watershed of the Mekong and are collectively known as the 3S river system. The combined runoff from the 3S rivers contributes ~17% of Mekong\\u2019s annual discharge with an estimated hydropower capacity of 9500 MW [27]. One of the first dams constructed in the Sesan river was the Yali Falls dam (900 MW capacity), which caused significant downstream flooding during initial operation, with major effects to fisheries and the livelihoods of villagers in Cambodia and Vietnam that were dependent on these fisheries (www.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/sesan-dams; accessed on 21 December 2017). The dam has been criticized for its adverse effects with increasing concerns associated with downstream water quality, fisheries, irregular water level fluctuations, many of which remain poorly characterized [27]. A recent study examined the potential impacts of the planned dams in the Lower Mekong tributaries and suggested that the Lower Se San 2, Se Kong 3d, Se Kong 3u, and Se Kong 4 dams would cause a basin-wide fish biomass drop by 9.3%, 2.3%, 0.9%, and 0.75%, respectively [2]. A large number of additional dams are planned in the 3S basin in the next few decades (Figure 1) [27]. The flow alterations by future dams will affect a wide range of hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems across the basin, potentially threatening regional food security while fulfilling future energy needs. The growing regional and global concerns about these adverse impacts of large-scale dam construction and climate change have led to increasing interests in studying the WEF systems in the Mekong basin. Studies have modeled scenarios of future development to explore the likely hydrologic impacts of dam construction [2,4,8,25,46] and climate change [16,23,47,48], as well as the changes in downstream sediment delivery [40,41,43,49] and coastal groundwater [50,51]. While the consequences of some of the large dams have been thoroughly assessed [34], the cumulative and broader effects of all dams on the WEF systems across the basin, especially when combined with the effects of changing downstream hydrologic processes (e.g., flooding and recession, groundwater recharge from floodplains, coastal groundwater dynamics) remain largely unexamined [2,9]. Some studies suggest that the construction of the planned dams alone would result in catastrophic effects on agriculture, fisheries, and biodiversity [2,52]. For example, research shows that the completion of 78 dams on tributaries would greatly reduce fish productivity and biodiversity [2], but a thorough assessment of the transboundary cumulative impacts of the tributary dams have not yet been conducted. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive, basin-wide analysis of the integrated effects of dam construction and climate change on streamflow, sediment transport, fisheries, and downstream communities. Such assessments should consider additional factors including the changes in land use caused by dam construction, the potential expansion of mountain roads associated with new dams and their impacts on sediment production and transport [44,53,54,55], and the positive hydrological, agricultural, and ecological benefits that dams may bring. In general, large reservoirs hold water during wet season and release it during the dry season, essentially increasing the dry season flow [56], but the impacts are beyond the changes in flow seasonality and magnitude. Water impoundment behind dams can alter the dynamics of terrestrial water storage (TWS) [57], which can affect groundwater systems and offset sea level rise [58]. The Xiaowan and Nuozhadu dams in the Upper Mekong (the Lancang River), constructed in 2010 and 2014 respectively, significantly increased dry-season flows and decreased wet-season flows [24]. The increase in dry-season flow can benefit downstream agricultural irrigation, while the reduction in wet-season flows can be beneficial for downstream flood and drought management and navigation, and supports important instream ecosystems [24]. Higher dry-season flows can also help maintain groundwater levels, which can reduce the energy costs for irrigation. Flow regulation by dams in the Upper Mekong has also been found to potentially reduce the increase in magnitude and frequency of flood due to climate change consistently throughout the 21st century [59]. Findings from global studies also suggest that water scarcity areas tends to travel downstream in regions where flows are significantly regulated by dams [60]. A recent study has proposed ways to design reservoir management in the Mekong by carefully analyzing the characteristics of the flood pulses, which could help increase fishery yield and improve the food system efficiency in the Lower Mekong [61]. 4. Land Use Change and Agricultural and Irrigation Expansion Historically, the primary changes in land use in the MRB have been dominated by the conversion of forested areas into cultivated lands [62,63,64] (Figure 3). It is evident from Figure 3 that there has been an increase in conversion of large forests areas into agricultural and urban lands over the past few decades, which is primarily due to rapid population growth, urbanization, and socio-economic development in the countries within the MRB [65]. It should be noted that the land use categories in Figure 3 do not explicitly include the rapidly changing road networks in rural areas of the region [44]; roads are often categorized as bare soils, urban areas, or agricultural lands. Today, agriculture provides livelihoods for 75% of the residents of the LMRB. The regional population grew by nearly 45% between 1980 and 2000 and is projected to increase further over the next 20 years, placing additional pressure on the land and water for additional food production [16]. In the LMRB where the mosaic of natural vegetation, seasonally inundated areas, wetlands, and cultivated lands shape the landscape, changes in seasonal flow patterns and flood pulses due to climatic changes and dam construction have been suggested to strongly influence land use patterns [66]. Studies have found that water infrastructure development and associated agricultural and irrigation expansion could have profound influence on open water areas and rainfed habitat, especially in the seasonally inundated areas around the Tonle Sap Lake [47,67]. Figure 3. Major land use and land cover types for 1992, 2000, 2008, and 2015. The pie charts show the fraction of each land cover type with identical color coding as in the maps except for the black color that includes all other land cover types than those shown in the charts. Urban areas are not shown in pie charts as they represented only 0.06% of basin area in 1992 and increase slightly to 0.08, 0.15, and 0.27% in 2000, 2008, and 2015, respectively. Data source: European Space Agency-Climate Impact Initiative (ESA-CCI: https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/, accessed on 27 January 2018). Dam construction can also facilitate irrigation expansion with potential changes in cropping patterns, but global irrigation data [68] suggest that the Mekong has not yet seen such widespread irrigation expansion in the past three decades. Caution should however be made that there could be underreporting of irrigated areas in the global database. The irrigation sector of the region is complex and poorly understood. Irrigation development is largely ad hoc and uncoordinated, with very little information available on the details of existing irrigation schemes [69]. Documented reports suggest that irrigation in upland areas is mainly for wet season rice, which is generally gravity driven with reasonably low requirements for management [69]. Survey-based studies also report that most irrigation projects still use traditional weir-type structures, although mechanized irrigation is becoming more common. More than 19,000 irrigation schemes were in use by 2000, of which most were traditional weir-type structures in mountainous northern and central regions and only small number of pumping irrigation schemes were in use in the south [70]. Irrigated wet season rice is the primary crop, especially in the LMRB, and there are limited opportunities for dry season crops due to limited water availability. While rain-fed rice dominates farming in Lao PDR, the central highlands of Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, fully or partially irrigated rice is grown throughout the year in the Mekong Delta region. Other crops such as fruits, vegetables, and industrial crops are also rapidly expanding in recent years [70]. Supplemental irrigation is also used for other crops such as soybeans, mung beans, peanuts, and watermelon, which are primarily grown in Lao PDR, Thailand, and Cambodia. In the Mekong delta, there has been a substantial increase in irrigation for fully irrigated rice and fruit trees [69]. Because of the extensive waterlogging and inundation during the wet season, most areas in the rainfed lowlands of Laos, Northeast Thailand, and Cambodia, and in the irrigated Mekong Delta in Vietnam, are more suited to growing rice than other crops. After a rainy period, the water table rises, often above the soil surface causing inundation [16], which is amplified by the slow infiltration rates over the hard plough pan or seal surface formed by predominantly sandy loam soils, resulting in temporary waterlogging after initial rainfall or irrigation. Because upland crops do not grow well in these soils, cropping systems in the LMRB are mostly used to cultivate rice, which is the staple food for most of the population. Resource-poor farmers operate on low cash flows and carefully weigh the risks of adopting more expensive farming practices that generally have high returns but carry a greater risk of failure [16]. Cropland expansion adversely affects land surface properties (e.g., surface roughness and albedo) and hydrologic processes [71]. Thus, changes in land cover type and application of additional water through irrigation can substantially alter both the water and energy balance on the surface [56,72,73,74,75,76]. Global modeling studies have found that while the basin-scale changes in runoff, ET, and land surface temperature due to cropland expansion and irrigation are small, the changes over highly irrigated areas in the LMRB are significant [56,73]. Studies at the sub-basin levels have also found significant impacts of land use and land cover change on water balance. For example, Homdee et al. [77] applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the Chi River basin in Thailand and found that land use change largely affected annual and seasonal water yield and ET. Conversion of forested area and agriculture land affected basin water flows and ET and replacing sugarcane crops with paddy fields clearly reduced water flows and increased ET by almost 5% during the dry season, which was associated with increased irrigation for rice paddies. The expansion of rice paddy fields also had a significant effect on the seasonality of flows, a decrease in ET by 12.0%, and an increase in water yield by 5.1% during the dry season. It is highly likely that there will be a substantial expansion of croplands and irrigated areas to replace food loss due to declines in fisheries [2]. Construction of dams will also likely affect the seasonally inundated floodplains and wetlands around Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta region [23,78,79]. While there is a general and growing consensus that the future dams and associated changes in land use (direct and indirect) will result in basin-wide hydrological and ecological impacts, the scale and magnitude of such impacts have not yet been quantified. These changes in land use will also feedback to the hydrologic system and alter flows and ET. Studies have shown that the potential impacts of future water resource development in the Mekong could reduce wet season flows by 4\\u201314%, reverse flow to the Tonle Sap Lake by 7\\u201316%, increase flooded areas by 5\\u20138% and cause salinity intrusion areas in the Vietnam Delta by 15\\u201317% [80]. The potential impacts of changes in climate, land use and land cover, and population on future water availability and demand in the Srepok River basin (one of the 3S river systems in the Lower Mekong) was evaluated by Ty et al. [81,82]. They revealed that while surface runoff may increase due to increased precipitation, changes in land use will increase water demand, exacerbating water stress conditions both at the basin and sub-basin scales, especially during the dry season. Future studies should attempt to improve the understanding of the integrated effects of climate change and alteration of land uses due to dam construction and other related water management activities over the entire river basin. Such studies should employ the latest generation of models that bring together the hydrological, agricultural, social, and ecological aspects into a single-consistent framework [83,84,85,86]. 5. Availability and Use of Surface Water and Groundwater Resources The Mekong River\\u2019s mean annual discharge of ~475 km3 [1] provides relatively high per capita water resources compared to other international river basins. Therefore, the basin-wide and annual surface water withdrawal to availability ratio is small [3,87]. However, the high temporal variability in river flow and uneven distribution of agricultural areas within the basin (Figure 2 and Figure 3) creates water scarcity during the dry season (February-May; critical irrigation period for rice cultivation) when the flow becomes less than 10% of average annual flow and the demands are the highest, especially in the Lower Mekong [16]. Flows are high during the wet season (July\\u2012October) when rainfall provides most crop water needs. The strong seasonal variation in water availability is reflected in Figure 2. If low flows decrease further due to climate change, shortages will likely occur, especially in the Mekong Delta, during the dry season when the flows are lowest; however, it is likely that new upstream dams will increase the dry season flows [59]. In the Lower Mekong, more than 41% of the watershed areas are used for agricultural production (Figure 3), which is steadily increasing to produce more food for the burgeoning regional population [70]. It has been estimated that the annual water utilization for agriculture in the Lower Mekong is less than 4% of the total annual flow [16]. Basin-wide, agriculture consumes the largest fraction of the water abstractions from the Mekong River, accounting for 80\\u201390% of all abstractions. Groundwater is a critical resource in the MRB but studies on groundwater-based irrigation have received less attention than those focusing on surface water systems because there is far less groundwater use for irrigation compared to other agricultural regions in the world [85,88]. While some information exists on the size and extent of aquifer systems, thorough investigations have not been conducted, and as such the available information on the groundwater resource size, utilization, sustainability, and quality is rather limited [89]. Groundwater is used as a major source of drinking water supply in Cambodia and Thailand [70,90], and there is an increasing trend toward large-scale exploitation for industrial and agricultural purposes [90]. Groundwater is also used to irrigate coffee plantations in the highlands of eastern Cambodia and mountainous regions of Lao PDR, and rice and other crops in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam [70]. It is estimated that more than one million wells access groundwater for domestic, agricultural, and industrial needs in the Mekong Delta region in Cambodia and Vietnam, which is a major increase from a limited number before the 1960s [91,92]. For irrigation, there has been an increasing use of groundwater during the dry season when surface water becomes less available and accessible due to reduced water levels in rivers [89]. Global groundwater data [93], based on the inventory of the International Groundwater Resources Assessment Center (IGRAC) suggests that groundwater abstractions in the MRB in 2000 were ~550 Million m3/year; this is significantly less than the country-based groundwater use reported in other studies (e.g., [90]), likely because the groundwater used across the basin by individual households may not have been reflected in the global database. There are no time-varying groundwater use datasets to examine the historical changes. Under climate change, groundwater demand is expected to increase significantly as surface water will likely becomes less accessible [89]. However these results should be interpreted with caution because flow regulation by future dams will increase in dry season flows [24], which has not been accounted for in these studies. The region\\u2019s reliance on groundwater has especially increased in the Lower Mekong where groundwater provides critical services including supplying drinking water for millions, supporting the wetland habitat, and preventing saltwater intrusion in coastal areas [94]. Widespread aquifer storage depletion, water quality deterioration, and saltwater intrusion are already emerging in parts of the delta as a result of the compounded effects of the groundwater overexploitation and sea level rise due to climate change [20,50,51,91,95]. The Mekong Delta covers 50,000 km2 of fertile alluvial plain extending from Kratie in central Cambodia to Vietnam\\u2019s East Sea. The Vietnamese portion of the delta is crucial for rice production and contributes to almost 100% of its rice exports [94]. The intensified paddy rice agriculture in Vietnam has largely transformed the delta by draining large wetland areas and using increasingly sophisticated water management projects; these manipulations in hydrology and flooding patterns have significantly altered groundwater systems by changing recharge and withdrawals [96]. The use of agrochemicals has also caused deterioration of groundwater quality. The declining water tables, deteriorating water quality, and increasing saltwater intrusion are already posing enormous threats to farming systems, wetland ecology, and livelihoods of more than 4.5 million people that rely on groundwater for drinking [94,97]. Groundwater overuse has also been found to exacerbate arsenic contamination in groundwater in regions such as the southern Cambodia [98], and it is likely that climate change will further exacerbate these problems [89]. The lowered water table in the coastal regions from irrigation pumping is exacerbating saltwater intrusion problems [50,95,99]. Pervasive pumping of groundwater has also resulted in large-scale land subsidence, which studies have linked to the release of arsenic in deep groundwater of Pliocene-Miocene age [91] through vertical migration. Based on the analysis of such old groundwater aquifers that are widely pumped, they found that intensive groundwater extraction is causing land subsidence of up to 3 cm/year as shown by satellite-based radar images and 3D groundwater simulations. The groundwater levels are persistently declining in the Vietnamese portion of the Mekong Delta at a rate of ~0.3 m/year based on data from nested monitoring wells, with an average land subsidence rate of ~1.6 cm/year [50]. The occurrence of high salinity (salt water intrusion due to sea level rise and groundwater use) and Arsenic content in groundwater could limit agricultural production and pose serious human health risks in the future [51,100,101,102]. A recent study confirms that excessive groundwater abstraction is the primary driver of land subsidence [95], which has increased dramatically over the past 25 years. While the existing groundwater issues in the Mekong delta region, have been primarily caused by increasing abstractions and saltwater intrusion, other factors are likely to play increasing roles in the future. One such factor that has not yet resulted in discernable and widespread effects in the downstream groundwater systems is the construction of upstream dams and water diversion for irrigation. Climate change has resulted in basin-wide changes in precipitation and temperatures (details in Section 8); the resulting changes in groundwater recharge patterns as well as the downstream flood pulse are also expected to affect the groundwater systems in the delta region [20]. Upstream dams may also bring some positive effects on groundwater systems. For example, the increased dry-season flows from upstream hydropower dam release could limit salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta during the dry season, but reduced flows may limit salt flushing during the wet season. These effects when compounded by the changes in the hydrology of the delta due to climate change could be far more complex. A thorough and holistic analysis of the integrated effects of the multitude of factors that affect groundwater systems is thus necessary to provide a clear picture of effects under various scenarios of changing climate, water management, and socio-economic growth. 6. The Flood Pulse, Tonle Sap Lake System, and Sediment Transport Floodplain inundation dynamics and sediment transport are critical components of the hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems in the MRC [23,47]. The seasonal hydrological regime with a strong unimodal flood pulse pattern [103] is the primary driving force for the Lower Mekong ecosystems [66], providing a timely supply of water and nutrient-rich sediments to support flood-recession agriculture, inland fisheries, and extensive instream and wetland ecosystems. The duration, amplitude, timing, and rapidity of the flood pulse are critical characteristics that determine the stability and productivity of the supported ecosystems [23]. A unique hydrological feature of the Mekong flood pulse is the reversal of flow from Tonle Sap Lake (Figure 4), which receives water from the mainstream Mekong during the wet season then flows to the Mekong during the dry season. The flood pulse from the Mekong inundates the floodplains around the lake to a depth of up to 9 m over several months [66]. About 54% of this water originates from the Mekong, with the rest coming from tributaries (~34%), and precipitation over the lake (~12%) [23,46,104]. Tonle Sap Lake, which is home to one of the world\\u2019s most varied and productive ecosystems, is the largest lake and wetland ecosystem in the Mekong basin. Its floodplain extends over 15,000 km2 and stores 50\\u201380 km3 of water (during a typical flood season) from the Mekong that enters the ecosystem during the monsoon season [1,47]. Figure 4. Changes in open water boundaries in the Tonle Sap Lake region extracted from Landsat imagery of 2000, 2010, and 2016 overlaid with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation continuous field (modified after Lin and Qi [67]). This river-lake system supports the world\\u2019s largest freshwater fishery, which provides most of the protein consumed in the Cambodia [1,105,106]. Tonle Sap Lake also supports critical ecosystems and agriculture in the Mekong delta by providing higher dry season flows than those from the main stem [107]. The bottom of the lake is at an altitude of 0.6\\u20130.7 m a.s.l during low water, with the water depth of ~0.8 m. Kummu and Sarkkula [23] reported that the daily lake water levels vary from a minimum of ~1.32 m to the peak flood of ~9.14 m, and the flooded areas vary from 2215 km2 to 13,258 km2, with a corresponding storage volume of ~1.6 km3 and ~59.7 km3, respectively. Storage in the lake is expected to increase, which would cause the maximum and minimum lake areas and water levels to increase every year [89]. The timing of the flood pulse onset will also likely change with high water levels early in the year and longer inundation periods [89]; however, these future projections will likely change significantly if the effects of the proposed dams are considered. Historically, the timing of Mekong flood pulse peak has remained stable with some variations in the beginning and end of the flooding season depending on flood timing on the main stem and local rainfall in the Tonle Sap tributaries [23]. However, this historical pattern is changing due to climate change and rapid water infrastructure development and basin management for hydropower generation, irrigation, water supply, and flood control, which makes the future of the Tonle Sap uncertain [47]. Of particular interest is the construction of a series of large hydropower dams both in the main stem Mekong and its tributaries (see Section 2). Even though a comprehensive study of the impacts of dam construction, agricultural expansion, climate change, and sea level rise have not yet been conducted, large-scale modeling studies and observational data suggest that planned hydropower development would dramatically alter the Mekong flow and Tonle Sap lake system [5,8,27,66]. Open water areas in the Tonle Sap Lake have been suggested to have declined from year 2000 and 2016 [67] (Figure 4), but studies suggest that water infrastructure development could increase the open water areas and rainfed habitats, while reducing the area of seasonally flooded habitats [47]. If the current trends of economic growth continue, irrigated areas in the Mekong could increase by 43% and 65% by 2030 and 2060, respectively [13,47,69], which will come with changes in land use patterns and significantly alter the hydrology of the basin (see Section 4). Tonle Sap River discharges a maximum of 10,000 m3/s from the lake toward the Mekong Delta from June to October [47,108]. There could be a reduction in flood depth during the wet season by over 0.5 m and an increase in water level during the dry season by 0.2\\u20130.6 m, which could reduce the flooded areas by 400\\u2013900 km2. Consequently, flooded areas covered by forests could be reduced by 22\\u2013100 km2, grasslands by 50\\u2013150 km2, and rice fields by 300\\u2013630 km2 [47]. Small rises in the dry-season lake water level would permanently inundate large areas of floodplain, which would disrupt natural vegetation cycles and negatively affect ecosystem productivity. Reliable sediment data for the Mekong are not available, and the available data are poorly documented [43]. Some estimates have been made [109,110,111,112] that suggest an annual sediment flux in the range of 150 to 170 Mt but there is high uncertainty in the estimates due to a lack of referencing to the original data and methodology [43]. In the Mekong, most of the sediment upstream of Cambodia is stored inside the channel and, unlike in other rivers such as the Amazon, there is little sediment exchange between channels and floodplains except in the Cambodian lowlands and Mekong delta [43,113]. There are a number of sediment monitoring stations along the mainstem Mekong [42], but there is a lack of basin-wide sediment monitoring network, especially for small tributaries and headwater catchments where a multitude of factors affect sediment generation, deposition, and transport. Studies conducted over different regions in rural Southeast Asia suggest that road networks, especially the mountain trails, which are often associated with agricultural expansion and dam construction, are one of the major drivers of changing sediment dynamics in the region [44,53,54,55,114]. These studies suggest that the rapid increase in road density in mountainous areas has resulted in an increase in surface erosion and landslides causing loss of soil and sediments which can affect agricultural productivity due to topsoil erosion along with severe impacts on water quality, aquatic habitat, flood, and navigation in the downstream [44]. Along the upper catchments of the Mekong River in Yunnan, China, steep slopes below many of the newly created roads led to a mass delivery of landslide sediments directly into the rivers, severely impacting downstream ecosystems [44]. Sidle et al. [53] found that landslide and erosion induced by Weixi-Shangri-La road in Yunnan region delivered 19 times more sediment to the rivers than the remaining 99.6% of the contributing catchment. The aggressive construction of rural roads in the hilly terrains of Southeast Asia has also likely impacted traditional cultivation methods [115] which are expected to be further altered by the construction of new dams with associated changes in river flow and floodplain dynamics [18]. Such alterations in sediment dynamics have often been attributed to widespread deforestation and agricultural expansion [44]. Construction of the planned dams in the main stem and tributaries of the Mekong, which is expected to increase the storage capacity by 10 fold, would increase the sediment trapping efficiency from 15\\u201318% to 51\\u201369% [40]. In the Chinese part of the basin\\u2014the upper Mekong\\u2014existing reservoirs have the potential to trap about 32\\u201341 Mt of sediment annually, and if the planned cascade dams (Figure 1) are built, the sediment trap efficiency would increase to 78\\u201381% which would trap approximately half of the basin-wide annual sediment load (~140 Mt) [40,43]. Recent studies that used a combination of a quasi-2D hydrodynamic model and a cohesive sediment transport model, provide a dire picture suggesting that if all planned dams in the Mekong are built, ~96% of the historical sediment load of the pre-dam period would be trapped [116,117]. In some parts of the basin, the projected rise in temperature of up to 3 \\u00b0C and changes in precipitation ranging from \\u221227% to 41% would change sediment yield ranging from a decrease by 17% to an increase by 66% annually [49]. Shrestha et al. [49] also found a large inter-annual variability in the changes in sediment yield as well as a large spread among the projections from different climate models. The potential impacts of future dams add further complexities to the already large uncertainties in estimates of the magnitude and direction of changes in sediment yield. Nutrient-rich sediments from the Mekong provide the critical support for the biological productivity and floodplain agriculture in the Lower Mekong and the Tonle Sap area [41,117]. Sediment depositions in the Mekong Delta provide more than 50% of mineral fertilizers typically applied for rice crops in non-flooded ring dike floodplains in Vietnam [117]. Therefore, a reduction in sediment delivery may threaten the highly productive biological and agricultural systems but sedimentation in reservoirs may also bring positive effects by reducing the sedimentation in the Tonle Sap lake that is believed to be rapidly filling in recent years [118]. This offsetting effect could be especially important if the impacts of climate change cause a substantial increase in sediment yield over the basin [49]. The precise rate of the infilling of the Lake are unknown, but local reports suggest that the areas around the edge of the lake are becoming shallower; Kummu et al. [118] suggest that the lake receives ~5 Mt and 2 Mt sediment from the Mekong and the tributaries, respectively, but only ~1.4 Mt (20%) of it returns to the Mekong every year; the 80% of the sediment load that remains in the lake and its floodplain is equivalent to an average accumulation of ~1.42 mm/yr of sediment over the permanent lake area of ~2500 km2. In addition, the Mekong delta is sinking due to human activities [119,120]. The net positive contribution of sediment deposition in the Mekong delta at an average rate of 0.3\\u20131.8 mm/year is counterbalancing the sinking of the Delta and offsetting sea level rise [117]; further sinking, sea level rise, and reduction in sediment delivery thus pose a serious threat to the Mekong Delta and exacerbate existing problems. Manh et al. [41] found that hydropower development dominates the changes in floodplain sediment dynamics of the Mekong Delta, while sea level rise has a smaller effect. The floodplains of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta are much more sensitive to the changes compared to the other subsystems of the delta. They suggested that the combination of potential maximum changes due to all drivers can lead to nearly 90% reduction in delta sedimentation and a 95% reduction of the sediment reaching the sea. 7. Hydrological Modeling Understanding the hydrological processes in the Mekong basin involves distinguishing physiographic and environmental conditions that drive both dry and wet season flows. While observational precipitation and streamflow data can be used to understand the hydrological responses, models are generally needed to quantify the space-time varying nature of hydrological states and fluxes (e.g., soil moisture, streamflow, ET, TWS, and groundwater recharge). Several global-, regional-, and local-scale hydrological models have been used for both historical analysis and future projections in the Mekong. The primary application of most of these models has been on simulating river flows and assessing the effects of climate change, but some studies have also examined soil moisture and ET while others have assessed the effects of dams on streamflow and sea level rise on coastal groundwater. Early modeling efforts date back to the 1980s when the Hydro System Seasonal Regulation (HYSSR) model and Massachusetts Institute of Technology River Basin Model (MITSIM) were applied to evaluate reservoir operation at specific locations [15]. The Vietnam River Systems and Plains (VRSAP) model was also developed at a similar time to simulate water flow, tidal effects, and salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. The VRSAP model has been continuously updated and improved [121]. Various other water resource models including the MRC\\u2019s Decision Support Framework (DSF), DHI\\u2019s MIKE BASIN, and Water Utilization Program-Finnish Environment Institute (WUP-FIN) have been used to assess water resources at basin to sub-basin levels. A detailed review of these models can be found in Johnston and Kummu [15]. We note that most of these models employ water balance schemes that greatly simplify the surface and sub-surface hydrological processes when applied over large regions such as the MRB. Further, the paucity of observed data in the Mekong hinders an extensive calibration and evaluation of these models over the entire basin. The semi-distributed land-use runoff process (SLURP) model was used by Kite [122] to simulate the complete hydrological cycle of the Mekong and its tributaries. This study demonstrated that the SLURP model can successfully simulate river flows over the entire Mekong. However, a comparative analysis between SLURP and MIKE SHE models suggested that MIKE SHE performs better across different climate change scenarios in the Mekong. When compared to global hydrologic models such as Mac-PDM.09, the SLURP, MIKE SHE, and SWAT models all perform significantly better, especially in predicting peak flows [48,123]. Disparities in simulation capabilities are likely related strongly to difference in algorithms used to estimate potential evapotranspiration. SWAT has been found to simulate the region\\u2019s hydrology with high accuracy, and is capable of estimating high flow periods within 1% and low flow periods within 3% [123]. The VMOD distributed hydrological model has also been used to: examine the likely effects of climate change and reservoir operation on Mekong streamflow over the next 20\\u201330 years [8], estimate the sediment load at different gauging stations along the mainstem Mekong [42], and examine streamflow changes due to the construction of dams from 1960 to 2004 [124]. The Shuttleworth\\u2013Wallace (S\\u2013W) model was used by Zhou et al. [125] to estimate potential ET (PET) over the Mekong; using the meteorological data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) TS 2.0 and monthly composite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), they found that the PET averaged over the Mekong ranged from 300 to 2040 mm (average 1354 mm) from 1981 to 2000, with significant seasonal variations that can be linked to changes in leaf area index (LAI). Macroscale hydrological models with accurate precipitation data and streamflow routing can generally provide accurate simulations of flows through the narrow, deep gorges of Tibetan and Chinese portion of the Upper Mekong basin (~24% of the total basin area). However, models are less accurate for the important Lower Mekong basin from Yunnan, China to Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia since the flood-season flows substantially alter the surface area of the lake [23]. Several such large-scale models have been applied over the Mekong or some global analyses include the MRB. The effects of irrigation water abstraction on surface water and energy fluxes were evaluated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model [73], indicating that the volume-based total net irrigation water requirement was about 24 \\u00d7 109 m3/year for 1979\\u20132000 [74]. Other studies have used VIC to examine streamflow and the relative role of precipitation and soil moisture on streamflows (e.g., [65,126]). The VIC model has also been used to simulate the inflow to the existing reservoirs and examine the operating patterns of reservoirs using residence time and flow alteration information [127]. River-floodplain routing models have also been used in the Mekong. For example, Yamazaki et al. [128] applied the global CaMa-Flood hydrodynamic model and highlighted the role of channel bifurcation in realistically simulating the flow and flood patterns in the Mekong Delta. Zhao et al. [129] also used the CaMa-Flood model for global simulations and compared the results of flood peak in the Mekong with a number of other global hydrological models. Simulations from the YHyM model show that Laos contributes the most to the total basin discharge with a 35% contribution, while Thailand and Cambodia are the next largest contributors with ~18% each. Therefore, dam development in these countries is expected to have the largest relative impact on the Mekong\\u2019s hydrologic regime [130]. The Geomorphology-Based Hydrological Model (GBHM) was coupled with a simple reservoir operation model to assess the impacts of climate change and reservoir regulation on flood risk over the LMRB [59]. Hanington et al. [131] evaluated the development and calibration of a fine-scaled quasi-2D hydrodynamic model (IWRM-LXQ) for a portion of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. The model provided reasonable simulations of low flow and high flood events in both dry and wet seasons where good spatial and temporal data exists, but poor data quality created issues in other areas. Dutta et al. [132] used a model with a 1-D river flow and 2-D surface flow to simulate flood inundation, providing a reasonable agreement with the observed water levels and discharges. By using the SWAT model with inputs from general circulation models (GCMs) Shrestha et al. [49] simulated the effects of climate change on sediment yield in the Nam Ou basin in northern Laos and projected increases in discharge and sediment flux during the wet seasons. Numerous other studies have also used SWAT in combination with other models of water resource development (e.g., [46,123]) and 2-D and 3-D hydrodynamics models (e.g., [133]) to study the changing hydrology, sediment yield, reservoir operation, and flooding in the Lower Mekong. Thanapakpawin et al. [134] assessed the hydrologic effects of land use change in the Mae Chaem River; they developed three plausible forest-to-crop expansion scenarios and a crop-to-forest reversal scenario based on the land cover transition from 1989 to 2000 and simulated the hydrologic response using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). They found that the expansion of highland crop fields affected annual and wet-season water yields compared to a similar expansion in the lowland\\u2013midland zone and the downstream sections of the river were sensitive to irrigation diversion. We note that the surface erosion and landslides caused by expanding rural road networks, which could be substantial sources of sediment generation [53], are not taken into account in the aforementioned studies. 8. Hydrological Impacts of Climate Change Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle [135] by changing the rates and patterns of precipitation and ET, consequently affecting river flows [136,137]. The MRB is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variation in precipitation patterns (Figure 5a). As discussed in Section 2, studies have found an increase in precipitation in the Upper Mekong during the latter half of the 20th century but no significant increase in the Lower Mekong. Projections from climate models suggest a significant warming across the basin by the mid and late 21st century but changes in precipitation vary across the basin both in sign and magnitude [138]. When averaged over the entire basin, results from 10 GCMs used in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) indicate that both precipitation and temperature will likely increase by the end of the 21st century (Figure 5b,c). Figure 5. Long-term mean (1901\\u20132010) annual precipitation (in mm/year) at 0.5\\u00b0 grids (a) along with the seasonal cycle (bar chart; in mm/month) obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC), and time series of basin-averaged annual total precipitation (b) and temperature (c) shown as mean of 10 CMIP5 GCMs for two different representative concentration pathways: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Numerous studies have evaluated hydrologic effects of climate change over the Mekong using projections from GCMs [130,139,140]. One of the earliest studies by Nijssen et al. [141] evaluated climate change impacts on hydrologic sensitivity in nine large river basins in the world, including the Mekong, based on climate projections from four GCMs. The VIC model was used to estimate changes in streamflow, ET, and moisture storage across these basins, indicating that most mid-latitude and tropical basins showed warmer and somewhat wetter conditions, while increases in annual flow volume were predicted for high-latitude basins. V\\u00e4stil\\u00e4 et al. [139] reported a 4% increase in annual streamflow and an increase in annual average temperature between 1 \\u00b0C and 2 \\u00b0C by the 2040s in the Mekong using the dynamically downscaled data from the ECHAM4 climate model. Kingston et al. [142] quantified the uncertainty in climate change projections associated with GCM structure and climate sensitivity, as well as from hydrological model parameter specification using pattern scaled GCM scenarios fed into a semi-distributed hydrological model (SLURP). Their results showed a non-linear response of annual river discharge to increasing global mean temperature, ranging from a 5.4% decrease to 4.5% increase. Changes in mean monthly river discharge are greater (from \\u221216% to +55%, with greatest decreases in July and August, greatest increases in May and June) due to complex and contrasting intra-basin changes in precipitation, evaporation and snow storage and melt. A hydrologic analysis of seven GCMs concluded that multi-model assessments are important because of the existing differences in precipitation projections among multiple GCMs [142]. Thompson et al. [48,143] used the climate data from seven GCMs and concluded that inter-GCM precipitation differences are a prominent source of uncertainty compared with potential ET and the choice of hydrological models. Hasson et al. [144] revealed the higher efficacy of CMIP5 GCMs in the Asian monsoon region including the MRB. A frequency analysis of extreme high and low flows in the Mekong projects a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of extremely low flows because of increased flows during dry seasons from five downscaled CMIP5 projections [145]. Further, the multivariate drought risk assessment of Thilakarathe et al. [146] revealed an increase in drought risks in the LMRB. Notably, the Chi-Mun subbasin may experience less drought conditions in the future as this region is expected to experience an increase on average monthly precipitation in most months. However, the same study suggested that the variability in magnitude of precipitation in the LMRB requires adaptation strategies to address future drought risk. The effects of the Lancang-Jiang cascade of hydropower dams on downstream hydrology was assessed using a hydrological model with a reservoir optimization model [25]. They found that on average this cascade of dams increased the December\\u2013May discharge by 34 to 155% and decreased the July\\u2013September discharge by 29 to 36% at Chiang Saen. Analysis of the impacts of large-scale changes in hydrological response in the LMRB [147] indicate that the majority of catchments (64%) exhibited no apparent trends in hydrological response. Lauri et al. [8] evaluated the impact of massive hydropower construction and climate change on the hydrology in the Mekong for the next 20\\u201330 years and found that the associated changes in discharge have more effect on the hydrograph than climate change (25 to 160% higher dry season flows and 5 to 24% lower flood peaks in Kratie). Using the Japan Meteorological Agency Atmospheric GCM (JMA AGCM) Kiem et al. [130] indicated that most of the sub-basins of the Mekong will experience an increase in the number of wet days by the end of the 21st century (2080\\u20132099), which may result in increased flooding risk but a reduced likelihood of droughts and low-flow periods. Eastham et al. [89] described how the climate and hydrology of the MRB is likely to change by 2030, with projected increase in flood risk and food scarcity, with adverse impacts to the productivity of fisheries. 9. Summary and Outlook In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the existing body of literature on the hydrological, agricultural, and ecological changes in the Mekong River Basin due to large-scale dam construction for hydropower generation and climate change. The review highlights the importance of understanding the coupled human, hydrologic, climate and ecological systems in the Mekong to address the growing regional and global concerns about the adverse hydrological, agricultural, and ecological impacts of the proposed dam construction and projected climate change. Multiple studies have examined the historical changes and provided future projections under different scenarios of climate change, socio-economic development, and dam construction. Further, hydrological models have been used to examine the changes in river flow, magnitude and timing of the flood pulse, groundwater, sediment transport, fisheries, and agriculture. However, the emerging scenarios of land use-driven impacts are yet to be fully understood. Importantly, the impacts of many emerging issues including changes in land use due to the expansion of road networks associated with agricultural development and dam construction are ignored in most previous studies. Various international development agencies and organizations, including the Mekong River Commission (MRC) have made enormous contributions to build the knowledge base by recognizing the water, energy and food nexus and their relationship to water quality, sediment transport, fisheries, agriculture, and in-stream ecosystems. The existing literature provides substantial impetus to study the effects of newly built dams and climate change; however, there has not yet been a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the compounded effects of the hydrologic changes in the upper portion of the basin due to climate change, changes in sediment generation especially in rural sub-basins, operation and management of dams in the middle reaches of the river, along with sea level rise, sediment deposition and flooding in the delta region. We synthesize our key findings from the review into a series of questions that should be addressed by future studies: (1) While existing and newly built dams can augment basin storage, how do they affect freshwater biodiversity across the basin? What are the compounded effects of expanding basin development and climate change on a broad range of hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems? (2) How would the construction of all planned dams affect the high and low flows along the main stem of the Mekong and how will that affect irrigation, downstream agriculture, and in-stream processes? Will the altered wet- and dry-season flows due to dam regulation bring positive benefits to the downstream reach? (3) How will the reduction in floodplain inundation and associated changes in recharge due to regulated flows affect groundwater systems in the Tonle Sap Lake and Mekong Delta regions? How will coastal groundwater systems with widespread salinity intrusion fare in the future under the dual pressure of rising sea levels due to climate change and lowering water tables due to hydrologic changes in the upstream portions of the basin? (4) Are there ways to develop and manage hydropower in the Mekong to minimize the adverse impacts on the fisheries, sediment transport, and agriculture while considering the potential effects of climate change? Addressing these questions requires a holistic study that brings together various climatic and human drivers of change into a consistent framework to examine the potential changes in the water cycle, land use and land cover, water and other infrastructure, agricultural systems, food productivity, and ecosystem services, as well as the dynamic interactions and feedback among these intricately intertwined natural-human systems. Since the goal is to provide realistic future projections, such a framework should employ integrated hydrological, agricultural, and ecological models driven by climate projections from general circulation models (GCMs) and various scenarios of socio-economic growth and water infrastructure development. It is also crucial that these integrated frameworks be developed and applied over the entire river basin to examine the effects of distant but connected systems. In conclusion, studies investigating the impacts of large hydropower dam projects and climate change on the hydro-agro-ecological systems in the Mekong will be essential to effectively manage this important river basin.

Choosing an optimal irrigation management plan depends on having available data in the monitoring field. A smart agriculture system gathers data from several sources; however, the data are not guaranteed to be free of discrepant values (i.e., outliers), which can damage the precision of irrigation management. Furthermore, data from different sources must fit into the same temporal window required for irrigation management and the data preprocessing must be dynamic and automatic to benefit users of the irrigation management plan. In this paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart irrigation, such as data monitoring, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage, and irrigation management enriched by the prediction of soil moisture. Outlier removal techniques allow for more precise irrigation management. For fields without soil moisture sensors, the prediction model estimates the matric potential using weather, crop, and irrigation information. We apply the predicted matric potential approach to the Van Genutchen model to determine the moisture used in an irrigation management scheme. We can save, on average, between 56.4% and 90% of the irrigation water needed by applying the Zscore, MZscore and Chauvenet outlier removal techniques to the predicted data. Keywords: IoT; smart agriculture; soil moisture prediction 1. Introduction Agricultural activities presently use 70% of the withdrawn freshwater in the world [1]. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance that we apply irrigation management, especially in semiarid regions with a scarcity of rainfall. Irrigation management is a part of precision agriculture, in which the correct amount of water artificially delivered to a field to satisfy the crop needs and the real production of the users is analyzed [2]. The irrigation must supply the crop water needs at different developmental stages in a given local. Irrigation management is used to detect when to irrigate, the amount of water needed, and the irrigation frequency, based on the monitoring of crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions. Crop evapotranspiration measures the water consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage of the crop and the weather conditions [3]. The soil moisture impacts the amount of irrigation water given to the crop, as irrigation management takes into account the level of water retention in the soil. Therefore, precision agriculture can reduce water consumption in irrigation by considering the groundwater available to the crop [2]. The choice of the best irrigation management plan depends on the data available from the monitoring field. A smart agriculture system gathers and processes data for irrigation management from several sources using computer science and information technology [4]. Users can provide the features of different types of crop, soil, and irrigation system, as well as the readings of analog tensiometers. Tensiometers are soil sensors that detect the matric potential, which are used to estimate the moisture at different depths and monitoring points in a field. Automatic weather stations [5] can provide public data through the Internet. Moreover, the field may have sensors and actuators which can interact with each other as objects of the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to provide services transparently to the users [6]. Such services are related to irrigation management for monitoring (i.e., water, soil, and air) and prediction (weather and soil conditions). However, data are not free of discrepant values (i.e., outliers), which can negatively affect the precision of irrigation management. Furthermore, data from different sources must fit into the same temporal window required for the irrigation management and the data preprocessing must be dynamic and automatic for researchers, engineers, and owners or farmers to benefit from the irrigation management plan. Data fusion is required to improve the quality of soil data in the case where several sources provide the same type of data (e.g., moisture) from the field [7]. Data fusion also informs the decision whether to start irrigation or not in irrigation management that makes use of other types of data (such as weather or crop data). In this paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart irrigation, such as data monitoring and control, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage, and irrigation management enriched by the prediction of soil moisture. The Smart&Green services are modular components which facilitate the reuse and customization of code, which are challenges/limitations to applying IoT in the smart agriculture context [8]. Our framework allows users to set the data sources: The nearest weather station, the moisture sensors (analog or digital), the type of crop, and the features of the irrigation system in the monitored field. Therefore, Smart&Green also contributes to the solution of another challenge in applying IoT for the purpose of smart agriculture: The integration of the actual infrastructure of the users (i.e., devices, machines, and software) [9]. Smart&Green recommends the best irrigation management plan, according to the configuration of the monitored field. The framework also synchronizes weather and soil data, as well as the crop stage for the chosen irrigation management plan. The Fusion service allows for the definition of outlier removal criteria for the weather and soil data. The fusion service also applies the outlier removal techniques Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modified Z-Score, and Generalized ESD before data aggregation, in order to obtain general information about the soil conditions of a field. Our results show that it makes irrigation management more precise, therefore saving water. For fields without soil moisture sensors, the prediction module estimates the soil moisture to make the amount of water irrigated more precise. In this work, we propose a computational model to predict the matric potential based on weather data available at public stations [5], crop information, and the amount of irrigation water used. As another contribution, we provide to the scientific community a public data set containing the matric potential and irrigation data for cashew cultivation in an experimental field. The matric potential is the critical variable in measuring the soil moisture. The computational model reduces the cost of equipment and energy, as the model allows farms to estimate the moisture without soil sensors for the same soil type. We evaluate the performance of a set of popular machine learning techniques which have been widely applied to solve regression problems. We measure the quality of the models without feature selection using the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as metrics. Our results show that the combination of predicted data and the outlier removal techniques can save an average between 56.4% and 90% of irrigation water, estimated by water balance management. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, a literary review of IoT platforms for Smart Agriculture is presented. Section 3 describes the structure and services of the Smart&Green framework. Section 4 relates the materials and method of the implementation of Smart&Green, especially for the soil moisture prediction evaluation. The results are given in Section 5, and we discuss our contributions in Section 6. Appendix A gives details about irrigation management using Smart&Green, and we formalize the problem of soil moisture prediction in Appendix B. 2. Related Work We carried out a systematic literature review to find the works which have answered the following research questions: What software exists for agricultural management that automates the process of gathering, preprocessing, fusing, and synchronizing the data used in irrigation management? Does the software implement the well-known irrigation management approaches of matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3))? Does the software forecast the soil moisture? Can users configure the software using information about their crops, irrigation system, soil sensors, and weather stations close to the monitored field? Most of the discovered papers have partially answered the research questions above. To our best knowledge, there have been almost no Internet of Things (IoT) platforms introduced that provide the services required for smart irrigation, such as the gathering, preprocessing, synchronization, and fusion of data; the planning and execution of irrigation management; or soil moisture prediction. Several studies have only addressed the gathering and visualization of weather and soil data (Section 2.1). Some works focused on data preprocessing by applying outlier detection algorithms (Section 2.2). Some approaches used specific methods to decide when to irrigate, whereas others have implemented water balance and matric potential (Section 2.3). Soil moisture prediction using machine learning techniques applied to crop data, satellite images, and irrigation management information has been investigated (Section 2.4). In addition, IoT platforms have been studied, which should be flexible enough to allow users to configure them for different monitoring cases in smart agriculture (Section 2.5). 2.1. Data Gathering In general, most of the sensor nodes used to monitor soil data (such as temperature, humidity, and matric potential) and weather data (such as temperature and relative humidity) are operated using open, low-cost hardware platforms such as the Arduino [10,11,12,13,14] or Raspberry Pi [15,16,17]. Zigbee [11,17,18,19], LoRa [16], Wifi [20], Bluetooth [14], GSM [12], and GPRS [21] are the predominant wireless technologies used. Our proposal allows users choose between the CoAP [22] and MQTT [23] protocols for sending data to Smart&Green framework storage and later irrigation management. For devices that we can not turn into a sensor node, such as analog tensiometers, our framework has a mobile application with which users can gather data manually. The framework also allows users to choose, as a weather data source, the Brazilian automatic weather station nearest to the monitored field, from which data can be gathered via HTTP. 2.2. Data Preprocessing Other approaches have processed soil data to detect outliers [24,25] and treat data using noise filtering techniques [26]. One system applied an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to the soil moisture data before the execution of irrigation management, in order to avoid the actuators inappropriately starting the irrigation [27]. The pattern recognition of water consumption by a crop radicular system, presented in [28], is an outlier detection technique based on a time-series analysis of soil moisture gathered at several depths before, during, and after irrigation. This technique allows for the identification of sensors with poor operation, which indicates the need for calibration or change. Our proposed framework allows users to define criteria for outlier removal for each type of weather and soil data used in irrigation management. Our framework also gives the option to execute such algorithms as Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modified Z-Score, and Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized Deviation) to remove outliers and fuse soil moisture data, in the case when a field has several soil sensors monitoring at different depths. 2.3. Irrigation Management Other works have automatically started irrigation by implementing algorithms for analyzing the data gathered by a wireless sensor node. In one study, an algorithm based on decision trees used the soil temperature and moisture to determine the irrigation time and the needed amount of water [29]. Crisp rules (IF-THEN) were used to compare threshold values with the soil moisture gathered by sensors, in order to decide whether to turn on the sprinklers of an irrigation system, in [30,31]. Decision support platforms for the execution of traditional irrigation management, such as the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3)), have been introduced. These systems allow agronomists and farm owners to manage Internet of Things (IoT) components for field monitoring. The matric potential management uses soil data gathered by sensor nodes and images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles to correctly estimate the irrigation water need [32]. Web systems have been used for the planning and execution of irrigation management. Beyond the visualization of soil moisture and weather data gathered by wireless sensor nodes, these systems use crisp rules for data analysis and, when it is necessary, the systems send messages to their users in order to notify about irrigation times [33] or activate the irrigation system automatically [34,35]. In other approaches, the system takes the rainfall forecast (available on the Internet) into account when deciding whether to activate the irrigation system [36]. A wireless sensor network can also plan and execute irrigation management [37]. In this case, the sensor nodes gather and analyze soil moisture data and turn the irrigation system on until the moisture achieves the field capacity. A SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system can automatically carry out the data gathering, planning, and execution of the water balance management (see Equations (A3) and (A4)). The soil sensor nodes are also actuators, which control the irrigation and send data continually to a management system. The system receives data from a weather station on the farm to estimate the reference evapotranspiration E T o . The system also utilizes the curve of the crop coefficient k c , choosing its value according to the current developmental stage of the crop [38]. The water balance and matric potential approaches often must take data synchronization into account. Therefore, some applications have synchronized the data of previously registered crops, as well as soil and weather data, to precisely determine the irrigation water need for the current developmental stage of the crop [39,40,41,42]. The existing systems described in this section are not flexible enough to allow users to set the features of a monitored field, such as the type of crop, the type and number of soil sensors, and irrigation system parameters used. The systems usually work with a predefined configuration and infrastructure. Therefore, code reuse is impracticable for the irrigation management of agricultural fields which do not fit to the existing system configuration. Our proposal allows users to register relevant information for irrigation management: Different types of crops, soil features, irrigation systems, data sources (weather or soil), and outlier removal criteria. In this work, the framework plans the irrigation management using the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3)) approaches. Furthermore, none of the systems could forecast the moisture levels in fields without soil sensors. Our proposal implements computational models to predict soil moisture based on weather data, crop information, and irrigation water need (IWN) (see Appendix B). In this work, we include the predicted data in the water balance management, obtaining between 56.4% and 90% of IWN savings over six months (Section 5.3). 2.4. Soil Moisture Prediction In [43], the Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with Regression Tree (GBRT) machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to weather and soil sensor data (moisture and drought stress) to predict the best irrigation plan for a jojoba crop. The GBRT model outperformed the others and, so, the decision support service incorporated it as a module of the system. A model based on support vector regression (SVR) and k-means ML techniques which used weather data and forecasts, as well the soil data (temperature and moisture), to forecast the soil moisture has also been investigated [44]. In [45], an integrated system to monitor drought in northern China using satellite images (NOAA, MODIS, and FY3A), weather stations, and soil data has been discussed. The drought forecasting used the matric potential at the depth of the crop root, the water balance model, depletion indices, and measurements of crop stress to estimate the soil moisture and the water quantity needed for an extended period. In this work, we apply weather data, crop information, and the amount of irrigation water used in a computational model, in order to estimate the daily matric potential of the most superficial soil layer (Appendix B), which signals when the crop needs irrigation [2]. We apply the predicted value in the Van Genutchen model (Equation (A1)) to obtain the soil moisture used in irrigation management (Equations (A2) and (A3)) for fields without soil moisture sensors (i.e., Field 1 of Figure A1). We present two different approaches: Local and global prediction models. In the local method, we create a prediction model for each monitoring point in an experimental field (Section 4.2). In the global approach, we create a single model which can be generalized to any monitoring point. We have evaluated the performance of a set of popular ML techniques which have been widely applied to solve regression problems: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], RepTree, and GBRT [51,52]. Our results show that GBRT outperforms the other evaluated techniques in both approaches. 2.5. IoT Platforms for Smart Agriculture SWAMP (Smart Water Management Platform), introduced in [53], is one of the related methods which is most similar to our proposal. SWAMP has components to allow for the implementation of different IoT applications for irrigation management, based on the crop and soil moisture approaches. Users can customize the services for the gathering (MQTT or LoRa), processing, and synchronization of data with different types of crops, weather, and country. Therefore, different field configurations can reuse these services for data analysis and storage, highlighting the excellent flexibility of SWAMP. However, their techniques for the processing and the fusion of data have not been detailed, and no application or service for the prediction of soil moisture has been provided. The Agro-IoT framework, introduced in [54], is also related to our proposal, which provides users real-time data gathering, aggregation (fusion), and analysis in the context of smart farming. Agro-IoT reuses several components to implement IoT applications, according to the needs of the monitored field. Agro-IoT provides similar services to our proposed method; that is, it also provides the management of devices (i.e., registration of sensors and actuators) and event detection through data analysis. However, it does not contain modules for data synchronization and outlier removal or soil moisture prediction. 3. Proposal In this paper, we propose Smart&Green: An Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the smart agriculture domain. A framework consists of \\u201ca specific implementation of a skeleton of infrastructure used for the conception of a work\\u201d [55]. Work is any activity performed by users or software. In this proposal, the work consists of the planning of irrigation management (Appendix A). In fields where there are no soil moisture sensors, a computational model can estimate the soil moisture for the same soil type using weather, crop, and irrigation data. Agronomists, researchers, and farmers conduct irrigation management through software which uses Smart&Green. Figure 1 presents the conceptual architecture of Smart&Green, divided into four layers: Application, Services, Communication, and Physical. Figure 1. Conceptual architecture of the Smart&Green IoT Framework for Smart Agriculture. In software engineering, a framework can also be \\u201ca mini architecture that can be reused and that provides behavior and a generic structure for a family of software abstractions in a context that specifies the collaboration and use of them into a given domain\\u201d [56]. Therefore, given the smart agriculture domain and the context of smart irrigation, the Smart&Green framework specifies the structure of a set of concrete and abstract classes to implement modules for the gathering, storage, synchronization, and fusion of data, as well as mathematical models (Appendix A) which describe irrigation management. Irrigation management determines the behaviors of the classes and modules. As a mini architecture, the proposed framework can be reused with different smart agriculture software with the generic functionalities of irrigation management. 3.1. Application Layer The application layer provides facilities for the automatization of irrigation management (Appendix A) and soil moisture prediction. Through this layer, users of an agriculture management system can insert information about the farm infrastructure: The types of crops and irrigation system to each monitored field, the monitored soil layers, and the weather stations closest to the farm. 3.1.1. Irrigation Management Automatization The Matric Potential and Water Balance modules implement well-known irrigation management methods (Appendix A). These modules use information registered by users as well as that from weather and soil data sources. Smart&Green selects the best irrigation management based on the data available. The principal functions of the Register Module are as follows: User register: Smart&Green framework allows two types of users: Specialist and regular. Specialist users can provide agronomic information, such as different types of crops, soil, and irrigation system features. They can also register outlier removal criteria for weather and soil data and choose algorithms for the fusion service. Regular users can register farms and fields. Farm Register: Users provide information about the farm, such as address and geographical co-ordinates (i.e., latitude and altitude) for the Smart&Green framework, and select the weather station closest to the farm. Crop register: A specialist user can create types of crops using information such as a description, the curve of the crop coefficient, and the critical moisture condition. System Irrigation Register: A specialist user inserts the type of irrigation systems, such as \\u201cmicro-sprinkler\\u201d. Weather Station Register: Smart&Green automatically selects the weather station closest to the farm using the geographical co-ordinates. Users can confirm this or choose another one. Soil Sensor Register: The user can insert the types of soil sensors used. Smart&Green already has analog and digital tensiometers. Field Register: Users set the field configuration features (Figure A1), such as the type of crop, irrigation system, soil, and if there are soil monitoring points. The developmental stage of the crop represents the number of days since the initial cultivation. Effective precipitation (mm/h) and efficiency of the irrigation system are necessary for irrigation management, in order to compute the irrigation time. In the case of monitoring points, users can register the type of soil moisture sensor (analog or digital) and the depth z monitored for each monitoring point in the field. Field Communication register: In the case where the monitored fields have sensor nodes that automatically gather soil data, users can define the type of communication to send the data to the framework. Users set the IP address and specific configuration (CoAP or MQTT). Outlier Removal Criteria Register: Specialist users can create a threshold for minimum and maximum values of each type of weather and soil moisture data used in irrigation management. The Smart&Green framework suggests an irrigation management plan, according to the data of a registered field. For fields without soil moisture sensors (Field 1 of Figure A1), Smart&Green indicates the water balance without soil moisture data (i.e., without the term \\u0394 A in Equation (A3)) or the water balance with the soil moisture data created by the soil moisture prediction module (Section 3.1.2). For fields with soil moisture sensors (see Fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1), the framework calculates the matric potential (Equation (A2)) or water balance using the soil moisture data. 3.1.2. Soil Moisture Prediction In this work, we address a large field (over 7500 m 2 ) to produce one type of crop on a large scale, in which the soil is monitored by a hundred tensiometers (i.e., soil moisture sensors) at three different depths. To investigate this scenario, we present the local and global approaches, which can be used to learn a prediction function f ^ (Appendix B). The local approach creates a different prediction function f i ^ for each tensiometer at the superficial soil layer of the field. For this, it uses the observations recorded by a tensiometer b i and a weather station m s , as well the water amount w i given to the crop and the crop coefficient k c related to the current life stage of the crop. The local approach defines the prediction f ^ in terms of n different functions f i ^ for local predictions. However, if a field has a large number of tensiometers, a large number of distinctive prediction models must be trained. The global approach creates only one prediction function f i ^ using the information from all tensiometers. Therefore, the global prediction model might not fit some individual tensiometers. The Smart&Green framework implements the prediction model as a modular service (Figure 2) to complement the irrigation management of fields without soil moisture sensors (e.g., field 1 in Figure A1). The framework automatically retrieves and stores the meteorological data set M m s published on the Internet by weather stations. We defined M m s in Appendix B. Figure 2. Smart&Green Module for soil moisture prediction. The framework daily preprocesses the M m s data to remove possible outliers. The module of soil moisture prediction estimates the matric potential \\u03c8 p of a field, based on ( M m s \\u2032 , W , k c ) (Appendix B). The irrigation management module computes the current soil moisture \\u03b8 c by applying \\u03c8 p on the Van Genutchen [57] model, following Equation (A1). Then, the obtained \\u03b8 c is applied to Equation (A2) or (A3) to calculate the irrigation water need (IWN). In the Internet of Things (IoT) context, the framework sends the IWN value to an actuator to start the irrigation system. The irrigation system stops when the field receives the amount of water specified by the IWN. Although this present work does not handle an automatic irrigation system, this issue is a concern for the full implementation of an IoT system for smart farms. 3.2. Service Layer The Service layer supports the Application layer by storing data provided by Smart&Green users and synchronizing crop, weather station, and soil data when required by any irrigation management module. The Service layer also carries out fusion tasks for data of soil moisture sensors (e.g., fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1) or the soil moisture prediction. The Storage service provides centralized data persistence for the monitoring of weather, crop, and soil data in the fields. The Synchronization service selects the crop coefficient k c which is appropriate to the current development stage of the crop and retrieves the weather data M m s for the period needed for irrigation management. The service also requests the Communication layer for new data from the Internet, if needed. In the case of soil data, the Synchronization service selects data from all monitoring points B T c in the field, taking into account the period of irrigation management. If there are no data available, the service requests new data from the user (field 2 of Figure A1) or the Communication layer (Field 3 of Figure A1). Finally, the Synchronization service makes the data set composed of { k c , c u r r e n t , M m s , p e r i o d , B T c , p e r i o d } available. The Irrigation Management Modules use the Fusion service if there is a field with monitoring points, each with one or more soil moisture sensors (e.g., tensiometers) at different depths z (e.g., fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1). The Fusion service can also treat data created in soil moisture prediction when irrigation management is required for fields without soil moisture sensors. Data fusion consists of processing the data to detect and remove outliers (DRO) and submitting data to a co-operative function (CF), according to a multilevel data fusion architecture [58]. DRO tasks apply criteria and algorithms defined by specialist users to immediately detect and remove outliers. The Register module of the Application layer allows for the creation of threshold values for soil data. DRO algorithms are specific to the soil layer monitored. According to [58], the Z-score is more efficient for data series at the most superficial soil layer (e.g., z = 15 cm). In contrast, the Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized Deviate) algorithm works well with data at depth of z = 45 cm. The Smart&Green framework has implementations of the Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modified Z-Score, and Generalized ESD algorithms. A co-operative function (CF) [59] aggregates one type of data gathered at different monitoring points of a field. Smart&Green uses the mean function as the CF to aggregate soil moisture data at the same depth. For example, Field 2 of Figure A1 has six monitoring points at two depths. Therefore, the framework calculates the mean of each set of six samples gathered at a given depth z. After fusion, the data are ready for irrigation management at the Application layer, which decides whether irrigation should be started. 3.3. Communication Layer The Communication Layer has a set of software to gather weather and soil data through network protocols. This includes a weather client, four soil clients, three soil servers, and a gateway (see Figure 3). The weather client consists of an HTTP client which downloads weather station data from the Internet and stores them. Smart&Green offers an API to gather data from Brazilian automatic weather stations [5]. Figure 3. Interaction between the Communication Layer and the Physical and Services Layers. The soil client gathers the matric potential data \\u03c8 m if the field has tensiometers installed. If the tensiometers are analog, users have to manually collect the \\u03c8 m data, using a mobile application that sends it to the framework via HTTP. If the tensiometers are digital, they are integrated into sensor nodes that send the data to a gateway near the field. The gateway hosts CoAP and MQTT clients, which forward the \\u03c8 m data to the servers of the framework. 4. Materials and Method In this section, we list the principal software components used in the implementation of our proposed framework (Section 4.1). We describe what we use for soil moisture prediction, in terms of (1) the weather, crop, and soil moisture information; (2) the criteria for outlier detection and removal; and (3) the tested machine learning techniques (see Section 4.2). 4.1. Smart & Green Framework Implementation We implemented the Smart&Green framework using the Python 3 Language. In the Application layer (Section 3.1), irrigation management by the water balance module uses PyETo [60] to calculate the reference evapotranspiration for a crop, with reference to the Penman-Monteith Model [61]. The crop evapotranspiration measures the water consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage of the crop and weather conditions [3]. The Service Layer uses the MySQL database [62] to support the Storage service. The PyAstronomy library [63] provides the implementation of the Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized Deviate) algorithm for the Fusion Service. The aiocoap package [64] supports the implementation of the CoAP client and server of the Communication layer (Section 3.3). The MQTT client uses the Eclipse Paho MQTT client library [65], and we used Mosquito as the MQTT server [66]. Our API for the acquisition of weather data operates by scraping the web page of the automatic Brazilian weather stations [5] using the libraries requests [67] and beautifulsoup4 [68], as well the frameworks Django [69] and Django rest [70]. We implemented the mobile application for soil moisture gathering from fields with analog tensiometers (e.g., field 2 of Figure A1) in the Javascript language through the Firebase platform [71], React Native framework [72], Realm [73], and React Native Firebase [74] libraries. We also provide a web interface for the Smart&Green Framework developed using Django [69]. Smart&Green was run on a machine with 2 GB of RAM, 20 GB of hard disk storage, and the Ubuntu 18.04LTS OS. For farm fields with sensor nodes, such as field 3 of Figure A1, we used an Arduino Pro Mini and three Irrometer Watermark 200SS [75] digital tensiometers to implement a sensor node which gathers soil moisture data at 15, 45, and 75 cm. The watermark measures the soil water tension (i.e., matric potential), which ranges from 0 to 200 CBar/KPa. The sensor nodes use four AA alkaline batteries of 1.5 v as the power source. We modify the Arduino removing the voltage controller and LEDs to the node has a longer operating life. Sensor nodes send soil data through an nRF24L01 with an external anthem and power amplifier. The nRF24L01 is a single-chip radio transceiver for the 2.4\\u20132.5 GHz ISM band. After data transmission, the sensor node hibernates for an hour to save power [58]. We used a Raspberry Pi 3 with the Raspbian OS as the gateway to receive soil moisture data and send them by the CoAP or MQTT client to storage. 4.2. Soil Moisture Prediction 4.2.1. Raw Data Set We obtained a data set of soil moisture from an experimental cashew field with other tropical raw materials in the city of Paraibapa, Brazil [76]. The field had approximately 250 cashew trees with nine monitoring spots. Each spot had three tensiometers that allowed manual reading of the matric potential at depths of 15, 45, and 75 cm. Figure 4 shows the details of the analog tensiometers (soil moisture sensors), which provided the data set from 2016, 2017, and 2018, with 234, 245, and 138 daily samples, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, in 2016, the field had salvation irrigation in which we gave 5 liters of water for each bud whenever the installed tensiometer at a depth of 15 cm read a matric potential of 60 kPa. Salvation irrigation prevents plants from dying. Figure 4. Details of the Experimental Field. The meteorological data set was obtained from a Brazilian national weather station at Itapipoca city, Ceara (altitude 102 m; latitude 03 \\u2218 29 \\u2032 S; longitude 39 \\u2218 35 \\u2032 W). However, we decide to use the pluviometer sensor data of the field, as the rainfall sensor of the weather station had missing values over an extended period. Table 1 presents the acronyms, the description of the variables, and the measurement data units used in our prediction problem. We release the aggregated data set to the scientific community to ensure the reproducibility of our results and promote research developments in this field (see Supplementary Materials). Table 1. Raw dataset structure. We apply the matric potential \\u03c8 m (kPa), and the constants in Table 2 to Van Genutchen Model (Equation (A1)) give the soil moisture \\u03b8 in cm 3 of water/cm 3 of soil. We obtained in the laboratory the constants which describe the soil type of the experimental field. The irrigation managements use \\u03b8 to estimate the irrigation water need (Equations (A2) and (A3)). Table 2. Van Genutchen Constants for the Experimental Field. We also analyzed the soil particle composition of the experimental field. The soil has a medium sandy texture in the layer from 0 to 30 cm (805 g kg \\u2212 1 of sand, 76 g kg \\u2212 1 of clay and 119 g kg \\u2212 1 of silt) and the medium texture in the other layers, presenting the characteristics of a red-yellow Argisol [77]. The maximum organic matter content was 6.4 g dm \\u2212 3 ; the pH varied from 5.6 to 6.3 between the layers; the capacity of cations exchange, from 31.3 to 64.8, and the sum of maximum bases was 62% in the most superficial layer. 4.2.2. Outlier Detection and Removal First, the instances that presented T m a x , T m i n < 20 , T m a x , T m i n > 39 , R H m a x , R H m i n < 20 , and R i > 250 were removed, as these feature ranges are uncommon in the city of Paraibapa. After that, the mean \\u03bc and the standard deviation \\u03c3 were computed for the variables P, R n , and U 2 for each month. Afterward, we filtered out data instances with anomalies; that is, the instances with distance to \\u03bc greater or equal than 3 \\u00d7 \\u03c3 were removed, as performed in [78]. 4.2.3. Machine Learning Methods We decided to build the prediction model using algorithms which have been widely applied to solve regression problems: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules (M5P) [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], and RepTree. Weka [79] provided all of these. Another widely used algorithm is the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) [51,52] method and its implementation XGBoost [80]. Linear regression is a linear model of the relationship between a scalar response (in this work, the matric potential \\u03c8 m ) and one or more explanatory variables (see Table 1). The linear model consists of linear predictor functions which use the data to estimate the unknown parameters [46]. Decision stump models a one-level decision tree. The tree has one root (an internal node) which connects the leaves (terminal nodes). The model uses the value of one single feature to make predictions [47]. M5P produces a tree with a multilinear regression model for each node. A greedy algorithm removes the insignificant features in the model fitted to each node. Then, the terminal node computes new predicted values, considering the predicted values of other intermediate nodes between the terminal node and the root node [48,49]. Random Tree (RT) uses if-then conditions for answering questions in a sequential order to achieve a specific result. The depth of the tree consists of the number of questions needed to reach a prediction value. Random Forest (RF) is a collection of decision trees that can use a random subset of the features. Therefore, the number of trees impacts the number of features used and limits the number of errors due to bias or variance [50]. RepTree is a fast decision tree algorithm in Weka which uses information gain/variance to build a regression tree. Reduced-error pruning takes into account the method backfitting [79]. GBRT is a predictive model based on a weak learner, a loss function, and an additive model. The weak learner is a decision tree that can be modified to achieve better results. The additive model adds weak learners to correct for the residual errors of all previous trees. The loss function consists of the mean squared error for regression problems [51,52]. We set some hyperparameters required by RT, RF, RepTree, and GBRT with the default values of Weka [79] and XGboost [80]. We set the maximum tree depth (max_depth) to 3 for GBRT and to without restriction for the RT, RF, and RepTree methods. The number of trees (n_estimators) was 100 for all methods. Finally, GBRT required a third hyperparameter, the learning rate (learning_rate), which we set to 0.1. The training and test sets included, respectively, 80% and 20% of the data from each soil moisture sensor at a depth of 15 cm. Overall, for each possible combination, we generated a model and picked the model which gave the lowest MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\\u2014metrics which have been widely used to measure the quality of a prediction model (see Equations (A6) and (A7) in Appendix B). 5. Results First, we employed the outlier removal techniques of Fusion Service (Section 3.2) on the real soil moisture data in order to analyze the influence of these techniques on irrigation management (Section 3.1.1) in the Smart&Green framework (Section 5.1). Then, we analyzed the MAE and RMSE of the machine learning techniques tested with the local and global approaches (Section 3.1.2) proposed for the Smart&Green soil moisture prediction module (Section 5.2). Finally, we applied the soil moisture data created by the best prediction models for irrigation management to analyze the water savings (Section 5.3). 5.1. Impact of Outlier Removal Techniques on Real Moisture Data by Irrigation Management From the raw data set (Section 4.2), we selected data from from April to October/2017, since there was no salvation irrigation in the experimental field, which could affect the irrigation water need (IWN) estimated by water balance and matric potential management. Then, we set Fusion Service (Section 3.2) to use an outlier removal technique to process the matric potential \\u03c8 c provided by the nine tensiometers (soil moisture sensors) at 15 cm of depth in the experimental field (Section 4.2). Second, the Fusion Service aggregated \\u03c8 c data using the co-operative function mean. After this, the modules of water balance and potential matric (Section 3.1) applied the aggregated \\u03c8 c to Van Genutchen Model (Equation (A1)) to estimate the current soil moisture \\u03b8 c at the crop root zone ( z = 30 cm) and compute IWN. Water balance management (Equation (A3)) can depend only on the crop evapotranspiration E T c (Equation (A4)) and rainfall R to estimate the IWN of a crop. Therefore, we can only use weather data and the crop coefficient (Table 1) to plan water balance for n days. However, the IWN estimation is more precise when we can incorporate the current soil moisture data \\u03b8 c z since the water storage in the crop root zone can contribute to the crop water supply. We set water balance to estimates IWN every three days ( n = 3 ) over six months (26 samples of n intervals), and the results in Table 3 indicate that the use of \\u03b8 c z saved an average of 90.4% of the IWN estimated, as compared to that using only weather and crop data. Table 3. Percentage of water saved over six months by irrigation management using real soil moisture data. The preprocessing of real data with Zscore and MZscore techniques optimized the tradeoff reasonably between IWN saving and healthy crop development, since these outlier removal techniques decreased this result to 89.3%. Zscore and MZscore data treatment led to an increment of the moisture \\u03b8 c values (Figure 5a), and, consequently, a reduction of the term \\u0394 A of water balance (Equation (A3)). GESD and Chauvenet did not affect the moisture \\u03b8 c data enough (Figure 5b), as well as IWN saving (Table 3). Figure 5. Real Moisture Data used in Water Balance\\u2014the points outside of the dashed lines are the current moisture data. \\u03b8 c z modified by an outlier removal technique. The matric potential approach depends exclusively on the soil moisture data (Equation (A2)), and we planned this irrigation management to estimate the daily IWN over six months (121 samples of days) using the current moisture \\u03b8 c data at the shallowest crop root zone (e.g., z = 30 cm). In the matric potential approach, irrigation occurs only when \\u03b8 c is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition \\u03b8 c r , which is the ideal moisture for irrigation and signals when the crop productivity is starting to decline. Table 3 presents the IWN saving of matric potential management that used an outlier removal technique when compared to the one that did not use them. Figure 6 shows that there were several days where \\u03b8 c was equal to \\u03b8 c r (day 1 to 13). However, all outlier remotion techniques treated various outliers that reduced the current moisture (e.g., 14th and 15th; 18th and 19th; 26th days), improving the water savings, on average, by 4.3% to 20.7% (Table 3). Zscore and MZscore (Figure 6a) contributed more to the tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy crop development because they increased the current moisture \\u03b8 c above the critical condition \\u03b8 c r in more days(e.g., the 40th to 43th; 64th; 104th days) than GESD and Chauvenet (Figure 6b). Figure 6. Real Moisture Data used in Matric Potential\\u2014the points outside of the dashed lines are soil moisture \\u03b8 c modified by an outlier removal technique. Irrigation occurs when \\u03b8 c reaches the critical condition \\u03b8 c r (red line). 5.2. Performance of Models for Soil Moisture Prediction The main goal of this analysis is to evaluate and establish the best machine learning (ML) technique among those tested for each approach (local and global prediction models). In this context, we considered analog soil sensors (tensiometers) distributed throughout a large field (Figure 4). We compared the following ML techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Stump, M5P, Random Tree, Random Forest, RepTree, and Gradient Boosting. Through the metrics MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), we evaluated the local and global approaches for the estimation of the matric potential \\u03c8 m \\u2014the primary variable for soil moisture prediction (Appendix B). Finally, we used the 99% confidence intervals to determine the best-performing model. Table 4 presents the MAE and RMSE retrieved by the local approach for each prediction algorithm. The results of the local approach are the mean of the MAE and RMSE achieved by the nine models built for each monitoring point of the experimental field. Considering all the analyzed errors, Gradient Boosting outperformed all the other techniques, followed by Random Forest. Both approaches presented acceptable errors, according to a specialist agronomic engineer. Table 4. Evaluation of ML techniques using the Local Approach: Mean of MAE and RMSE, 99% confidence interval. The best performers are highlighted in bold. Table 5 presents the MAE and RMSE retrieved by the global approach for each algorithm. Again, the Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved the best results, compared to all other evaluated models. It can be noticed that the MAE and RSME of the Gradient Boosting model did not vary as much as the other evaluated models; this means the global model generalizes well for any data from any sensor in the field. The Local Gradient Boosting approach outperformed the global one. However, even though the global model error had an average MAE error increase of 58.9% and average RMSE error increase of 45.7%, the errors were still acceptable, according to the specialist agronomic engineer. Table 5. Evaluation of ML techniques using the Global Approach: Mean of MAE and RMSE, 99% confidence interval. The best performers are highlighted in bold. We also analyzed the relevance of the features of Table 1, in the context of the local and global approaches. We employed Gradient Boosting as, according to the results of this section, it has proved to be the best ML technique for our purposes. XGboost [80] estimates the relevance of each feature by counting the number of times it is used in a split node of any decision tree in the Gradient Boosting forest. Figure 7 presents the results. The more an attribute is used in a decision tree, the higher its relative importance is. The most-used variables in both approaches were U 2 , P, T m a x , R H m i n , R n , and k c . Figure 7. Analysis of the relevance of features by gradient boosting prediction approach. 5.3. Analysis of Water Savings through the Use of Predicted Data of Soil Moisture We used the local and global models based on Gradient Boosting to predict the matric potential \\u03c8 m for a field without soil moisture sensors over six months. The local approach estimated daily \\u03c8 p at a depth of 15 cm, as the field had nine monitoring points. Therefore, we could apply the outlier removal techniques to treat this data set of nine daily values. The global approach estimated one daily value for the \\u03c8 p at a depth of 15 cm in the field. In this case, there was no need for preprocessing the data using the outlier removal techniques. We use \\u03c8 p to compute predicted soil moisture data for the crop root zone ( z = 30 cm) through the Van Genutchen Model (Equation (A1)). For water balance (Equation (A3)), executed every three days ( n = 3 ) for six months (26 samples of n), we compared the benefits of our computational models by analyzing how much they saved, in terms of the irrigation water need (IWN) estimated using only weather and crop data. Table 6 shows that the use of global approach data saved an average of 56.4% and that the local approach without data preprocessing saved 100% of the IWN on average. Table 6. Percentage of water saved in six months by irrigation management using predicted soil moisture data. The Zscore and MZscore methods tended to treat outliers by removing values that decreased the current moisture \\u03b8 c (Figure 8a). Therefore, they reduced the result of the local predicted data by 90% and 75.6%, respectively, for water balance. The employment of Chauvenet for the local approach data also saved 90% of IWN on average since it almost achieved the performance of Zscore (Figure 8b). The use of GESD did not affect the local approach predicted data (Figure 8b), such that it had almost the same water savings as when no outlier removal technique was employed (Table 6). We consider the global approach and local approach using Zscore, MZscore and Chauvenet techniques optimized the tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy crop development, and they did not outweigh the IWN savings of water balance that used real soil moisture \\u03b8 c (Table 3). Figure 8. Predicted Moisture Data used inWater Balance\\u2014the points outside of the dashed lines are soil moisture data \\u03b8 c modified by an outlier removal technique. For the matric potential (Equation (A2)) executed daily, irrigation occurs when the current moisture \\u03b8 c is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition \\u03b8 c r , which is the ideal moisture for irrigation, signaling when the crop productivity is starting to decline. To compare the results of using the predicted data we used, as a baseline, the IWN estimated by the matric potential using real moisture data without an outlier removal technique. The use of the global approach data saved an average of 53.1% when compared to the IWN baseline, and the use of local approach data without preprocessing saved 100% (Table 6). The Zscore, MZscore, and Chauvenet techniques tended to remove the outliers that decreased the moisture values, setting the current moisture higher than the critical condition (Figure 9). GESD kept the performance of matric potential management that used the local approach data. However, we do not recommend the use of predicted data with the matric potential management, as the rise of IWN saving outweighed the results related to the use of real moisture data in this same irrigation management example (Table 3). Figure 9. Predicted Moisture Data used in Matric Potential\\u2014the points outside of the dashed lines are current soil moisture \\u03b8 c data modified by an outlier removal technique. Irrigation occurs when \\u03b8 c is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition \\u03b8 c r (red line). 6. Conclusions Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the gathering, preprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management, which also allows for the reuse of code to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have proposed the Smart&Green IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the water balance and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation system information provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data available close to the monitored fields. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess soil moisture data with outlier removal criteria and techniques of Zscore, MZscore, GESD, and Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need (IWN) in irrigation management. For large fields without soil moisture sensors, we have considered the problem of predicting the soil moisture by analyzing the weather data, crop coefficients, and amount of irrigation water. We have formally introduced the problem of soil prediction and designed a methodology which uses training models according to two different approaches: Local and global. These approaches determine the implementation of prediction models based on supervised machine learning techniques. The local approach trains a model for each soil sensor in the field, achieving high performance. However, this approach can lead to a high cost of data management if there are a large number of sensors, as it requires the training and maintainence of a large number of distinctive prediction models. On the other hand, the global approach trains a single prediction model over the observations of all the sensors. Our results show that gradient boosting with regression trees (GBRT) outperformed the other evaluated techniques in both approaches. The local approach had the best results with gradient boost, although the results using the global prediction model were also acceptable. Furthermore, we have designed a module to support irrigation management with our prediction models, based on GBRT. We evaluated irrigation management using the water balance and matric potential approaches with real and predicted data of soil moisture, as well as the impact of preprocessing data with outlier removal techniques. The real data was part of a data set collected from an experimental field for research in the city of Paraipaba, Brazil, in which cashews and other raw materials were grown. We also report that the dataset will be made publicly available to ensure the reproducibility of our results and promote research developments in this field (see Supplementary Materials). The use of real soil moisture data from the data set in the water balance approach saved as much as 90.4% of the IWN obtained for the water balance when using only weather and crop data. Zscore and MZscore applied to the real moisture data saved 89.3% of IWN, optimizing the tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy crop development. For the matric potential approach, Zscore and MZscore obtained (on average) 20.7% and 14.1% of the IWN savings obtained by matric potential without the use of any outlier removal technique. Considerating a field without soil moisture sensors, we obtained a reduction between 56.4% and 90% of the water balance IWN based on only weather and crop data, when we use our global and local approaches to predict the soil moisture data. Zscore, MZscore, and Chauvenet preprocess the predicted data to optimize the tradeoff without outweighing the performance of water balance using real moisture data. We do not recommend the use of predicted data in the matric potential approach, as the computational models (with errors) outperform mostly the same approach using real data in terms of water savings, according to our results.

Irrigation Management Figure A1 represents some examples of configurations composed of a crop, soil, weather, and an irrigation system. The house is next to the entrance of the farm and has a connection to the Internet. The house also hosts devices that connect sensor nodes in the field to the Internet. Automatic weather stations make weather data available on the Internet. In this work, we address fields with one type of crop whose soil has analog (Field 2) or digital tensiometers (Field 3) monitoring the moisture at more than one depth z. Tensiometers installed at different points b of the field gather readings of the matric potential \\u03c8 m . Mathematical models use \\u03c8 m to measure the soil moisture \\u03b8 as the level of water retention in the type of soil. We use the Van Genuchten Model [57] to express \\u03b8 as the volume of water by the volume of soil (cm 3 /cm 3 ), as Equation (A1) shows: \\u03b8 ( \\u03c8 m ) = \\u03b8 r + \\u03b8 s \\u2212 \\u03b8 r [ 1 + ( \\u03b1 \\u00d7 | \\u03c8 m | ) n ] 1 \\u2212 1 n , (A1) where \\u03b8 r is the residual water content, \\u03b8 s is the saturated water content, \\u03b1 is related to the inverse of the air entry suction, and n is a measure of the pore-size distribution in the soil (e.g., Table 2 has these Van Genutchen constants for the experimental field soil). The management of matric potential estimates the irrigation water need (IWN) for a field with soil sensors (e.g., Field 3 of Figure A1) taking into account the soil moisture at the monitored depths z i , as Equation (A2) shows: I W N = ( \\u03b8 f c , z 1 \\u2212 \\u03b8 c r , z 1 ) \\u00d7 z 1 + ( \\u03b8 f c , z 2 \\u2212 \\u03b8 c , z 2 ) \\u00d7 z 2 + ( \\u03b8 f c , z 3 \\u2212 \\u03b8 c , z 3 ) \\u00d7 z 3 E f , (A2) where: z i represent the thickness of soil along the profile (monitored depth); \\u03b8 f c represents the field capacity at a depth z after the drainage of water excess, which is a constant obtained by a laboratory soil analysis; \\u03b8 c r is the ideal moisture for irrigation, signaling when the crop productivity starts to decline; \\u03b8 c is the current soil moisture. In matric potential management, we initialize the irrigation by \\u03b8 c , z 1 \\u2264 \\u03b8 c r ; and E f is the efficiency of the irrigation system used in the field. Water balance management computes the IWN for an interval of n days, comparing the inputs and outputs of water in the soil by using the daily crop evapotranspiration E T c , the rainfall R, and \\u0394 A = ( \\u03b8 f c \\u2212 \\u03b8 c ) z which represents the soil moisture at the crop root zone z through Equation (A3). I W N = \\u2211 i = 1 n ( E T c , i \\u2212 R i ) \\u2212 \\u0394 A E f . (A3) The value E f is the efficiency of the irrigation system placed in the field. The crop evapotranspiration E T c represents the water consumption by a type of crop at its current life development stage, which is given by: E T c = E T o \\u00d7 k c . (A4) The Penman-Monteith model [61] estimates the reference evapotranspiration E T o using weather data. Each type of crop, without hydrological restriction, has a specific coefficient curve in which the crop coefficient k c varies from 0 to 1.5 with the number days since the planting of the crop. Figure A1. Different field configurations. Appendix B. The Problem of Soil Moisture Prediction Let B = { b 1 , \\u22ef , b n } be the set of tensiometers monitoring the soil moisture of a field at n different points. A tensiometer b j gathers the sample ( \\u03c8 j , 15 , \\u03c8 j , 45 , \\u03c8 j , 75 ) , which consists of the matric potential \\u03c8 readings at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths, respectively, at a point j. Let W = { w 1 , \\u22ef , w n } be the set of water amount given to the crop at n different points by an irrigation system. Irrigation management calculates W using the Equations (A2) and (A3), for example. The weather data are required, as the climatic conditions affect a crop\\u2019s need for soil water and rainfall can increase the soil moisture. Therefore, we assume that there is a weather station m s close to the field which provides the meteorological data set M m s = { T m i n , T m a x , R H m i n , R H m a x , R n , U 2 , P , R i } , where: T m i n and T m a x are the minimum and maximum air temperature, respectively; R H m i n and R H m a x are the minimum and maximum relative humidity, respectively; R n is the net radiation; U 2 is the wind speed; P is the atmospheric pressure; and R i is the rainfall. Within a daily time interval, there are several observations about the weather and field. We denote by O the collection of observations, which consists of (t, B, M m s , W , k c ), recorded within a time t over a day. The irrigation scheduling methods presented in Appendix A decide to start precise irrigation when the current moisture \\u03b8 c , z 1 is low at the superficial layer of soil ( z 1 = 15 cm). Therefore, the matric potential \\u03c8 i , 15 is analyzed daily to achieve \\u03b8 c , z 1 using the Van Genutchen model (Equation (A1)). In this work, we wish to monitor the level of soil moisture without soil sensors (i.e., tensiometers). Let y ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) be a function that, given the monitoring point i, the meteorological variables M m s , the irrigation water amount w i at the point i, and the crop coefficient k c returns \\u03c8 i , 15 (the matric potential at a depth of 15 cm). Then, y ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) = \\u03c8 i , 15 . We define the problem of soil moisture prediction as the problem of finding an accurate function f for predicting y ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) , given all the observations recorded in O. Definition A1. The problem of soil moisture prediction requires finding a predictive function f ^ over the class of all possible predictive functions H, such that f ^ = a r g m i n \\u0394 ( f ) , (A5) where f \\u2208 H and \\u0394 is a loss function assessing the quality of a candidate predictive function f over the observations in O. In this work, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss functions, defined as: \\u0394 R M S E ( f ) = 1 | O \\u2032 | \\u2211 ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) \\u2208 O \\u2032 ( f ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) \\u2212 y ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) ) 2 , a n d (A6) \\u0394 M A E ( f ) = 1 | O \\u2032 | \\u2211 ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) \\u2208 O \\u2032 | f ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) \\u2212 y ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) | , (A7) where O\\u2019 is the set of observations used to assess the quality of the prediction and f ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) is the estimate returned by function f for y ( i , M m s , w i , k c ) . The smaller the value yielded by the above loss functions, the better the predictive performance of f. We employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to address the problem of soil moisture prediction. More specifically, we aim at learning, from the observations in O, some function f ^ that minimizes the error measured by \\u0394 . We train the prediction models on a data set containing examples built from past sensor observations (see Section 4.2). The ML techniques for regression tasks used in this work are: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], RepTree, and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree [51,52].

Here we used a coupled biogeochemical model in combination with satellite-derived contemporary inundation area to quantify the magnitude and spatiotemporal variation of CH4 emissions from global rice fields and attribute the environmental controls of CH4 emissions during 1901\\u20132010. Our study estimated that CH4 emissions from global rice fields varied from 18.3\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.1\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr (Avg. \\u00b11 SD) under intermittent irrigation to 38.8\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.0\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr under continuous flooding in the 2000s, indicating that the magnitude of CH4 emissions from global rice fields is largely dependent on different water schemes. Over the past 110\\u2009years, our simulated results showed that global CH4 emissions from rice cultivation increased by 85%. The expansion of rice fields was the dominant factor for the increasing trends of CH4 emissions, followed by elevated CO2 concentration, and nitrogen fertilizer use. On the contrary, climate variability had reduced the cumulative CH4 emissions for most of the years over the study period. Our results imply that CH4 emissions from global rice fields could be reduced through optimizing irrigation practices. Therefore, the future magnitude of CH4 emissions from rice fields will be determined by the human demand for rice production as well as the implementation of optimized water management practices. Key Points Methane emissions from global rice fields in the 2000s varied from 18.3 to 38.8\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr depending on different water schemes Expansion of rice cultivation was the key factor causing CH4 emission increase in the past century Intermittent irrigation could reduce half CH4 emission comparing with continuous flooding 1 Introduction Methane (CH4) emissions from rice cultivation have long been recognized as one of the dominant contributors to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [Ciais et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2016b]. Rice field, a unique human-dominated ecosystem, shares the fundamental set of controls as natural wetlands and meanwhile incorporates different agronomic practices, such as irrigation and fertilizer use [Bridgham et al., 2013]. The net CH4 flux is determined by both the production from methanogens and the consumption from methanotrophs [Lee et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2010]. Previous studies have shown that the CH4 emissions from rice fields were influenced by the farming types (irrigated, rainfed, and/or deep water) [Yan et al., 2009], nitrogen fertilizer use [Banger et al., 2012], organic input [Chen et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2009], and rice varieties [Zhang et al., 2014]. In the last 50\\u2009years, global rice harvest area increased by 40% due to rice expansion and intensification [Burney et al., 2010; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Statistics Division (FAOSTAT), 2014], which has greatly increased CH4 emissions. The rapid increase in CH4 emissions is expected to continue in the near future due to the increasing demand for food [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2012]. Therefore, it is vital to better understand the current magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of global CH4 emissions from rice fields. Over the last three decades, substantial progress has been made in estimating the CH4 emissions from rice fields globally; however, large discrepancies exist among various studies in both magnitude, ranging from 25.6\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr to 115\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr [Aselmann and Crutzen, 1989; Chen and Prinn, 2006; Frankenberg et al., 2005; Yan et al., 2009], and spatial distribution [Monfreda et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2005] due to multiple environmental factors and complicated agricultural activities involved [Zhang et al., 2011a; Zhang et al., 2011b]. Clearly, it is essential to quantify effects of those influencing factors on CH4 emissions from rice fields and explore the underlying mechanisms. Previous studies have illustrated the complicated environmental controls on CH4 emissions. For example, global warming could increase the rate of root decay, which provides quantitatively important substrates for CH4 production [Tokida et al., 2011]. On the other hand, rice is very vulnerable to high temperature and a few hours of exposure to overheating could cause complete sterility and poor milling quality [Laborte et al., 2012], which may reduce carbon substrates for CH4 emissions. Precipitation could influence the water availability of rice fields, especially for the rainfed rice. The shortage of water could greatly reduce the CH4 emissions. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration may stimulate the CH4 emissions through providing more methanogen-favored carbon substrate [Dijkstra et al., 2012; van Groenigen et al., 2011]. The effects of nitrogen fertilizer use are complex and can either stimulate or inhibit the CH4 emissions by influencing the microbial activities [Banger et al., 2012]. Irrigation could change the water status of the soil, which further determines the oxygen availability of the soil and greatly affects the CH4 producing and oxidizing capability. Elevated ozone concentration could reduce the rice productivity, inhibit the microbial activities, and suppress the belowground carbon processes, which together decrease the CH4 emissions [Ren et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2011]. These environmental factors could individually and interactively affect the CH4 processes. However, how multiple environmental factors together influenced CH4 emissions from rice fields has not yet been well investigated at the global scale. Various approaches have been applied to estimate CH4 emissions from rice fields. Inventory method provides regional-scale estimations of CH4 emissions from rice fields based on country-specific (or county-specific if applied) statistical data of harvest area, emission factor, and scaling factor [Chen et al., 2013; Chen and Prinn, 2006; Yan et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014]. In the top-down approach, atmospheric CH4 measurements with prior information and transport model are used to estimate the CH4 emissions. However, both approaches have large limitations when estimating the CH4 emissions from rice fields. For example, universal emission factors used in inventory methods over large areas without considering the environment heterogeneities limit our ability to predict the feedback between climate change and rice CH4 emissions. On the other hand, top-down approach is hard to differentiate multiple sources. It has been suggested that transport model itself could lead to 5% to 48% errors [Locatelli et al., 2013]. Meanwhile, reliable estimation of top-down approach may also be constrained by the prior information used, which is usually derived from either inventory estimation or bottom-up estimation [Bergamaschi et al., 2007; Bloom et al., 2010; Frankenberg et al., 2005]. Bottom-up approach, i.e., process-based models which consider multiple environmental factors, land surface heterogeneities, and major pathways of CH4 processes (e.g., CH4 production, CH4 oxidation, and CH4 transportation), provides spatially explicit estimates of annual CH4 emissions [Tian et al., 2010]. Meanwhile, it has the capability to quantify the relative contribution of driving factors, such as atmospheric CO2 concentration, climatic variability, nitrogen enrichment, and cropland management practices, which is vital for policy decisions on climate change mitigation [Bridgham et al., 2013]. Globally, Southeast Asia dominates the CH4 emissions from rice fields, due to the large rice area occupancy in this region [Yan et al., 2009]. China and India, as the most populous countries in the world, account for 20.0% and 28.5% of the global rice area, respectively [FAOSTAT, 2014]. Approximately 90% of the rice fields are sufficiently irrigated in China, with high spatial-temporal variations in water regimes due to various irrigation strategies in recent decades [Chen et al., 2013]. Over 46% of rice cultivation area is irrigated in India [Banger et al., 2015a; Jain et al., 2000]. Thus, up-to-date information for rice area with accurate water management in those two countries could greatly improve our understanding of global estimation of rice emission. In this study, we used the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model version 2.0 (DLEM v2.0) [Tian et al., 2015a] to quantify the effects of multiple environmental factors on the magnitude and spatiotemporal variation of CH4 emissions from global rice fields during 1901\\u20132010. The specific objectives of this study are (1) to estimate the magnitude of CH4 emissions from global rice fields by applying different water schemes, (2) to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of CH4 emissions from rice fields, (3) to quantify the relative contributions of multiple environmental factors to CH4 emissions from rice fields, and (4) to discuss potential CH4 mitigation strategies through water regime practices in the rice fields. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 The Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) In this study, we used the DLEM v2.0, which has the capability to simulate the carbon, water, and nitrogen fluxes and storages within the terrestrial ecosystem, and also the exchanges of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) between the terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Five key components (biophysics, plant physiology, soil biogeochemistry, land use, disturbance and land management, and vegetation dynamics) are interconnected in the model. In brief, the biophysics component simulates the water and energy fluxes within the terrestrial ecosystems and their interactions with the environments. The plant physiology component simulates the key physiological processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, allocation, and evapotranspiration. The soil biogeochemistry component simulates the processes of decomposition, nitrogen mineralization/immobilization, nitrification/denitrification, fermentation, and some other major biogeochemical processes in the soil including CH4 production/oxidation and related processes. The land use, disturbance, and land management component simulates the impact of natural and human disturbances on the water and nutrient fluxes and storages in the land ecosystems. The DLEM is able to simulate the exchange of water, carbon, and nitrogen fluxes for both natural and human-dominated ecosystems (such as major crop types, i.e., rice, wheat, and soybean) at daily time step. In this study, we only focus on rice. The DLEM simulation results have been extensively validated against a large number of field observations and measurements at the site level [Lu and Tian, 2013; Ren et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2011]. The DLEM-estimated fluxes and storages of water, carbon, and nutrients are also compared with the estimates from other approaches, such as statistical-based empirical modeling, top-down inversion, or other process-based modeling approaches, at regional, continental, and global scale [Pan et al., 2014a, 2014b; Tian et al., 2015a, 2015b; Yang et al., 2014]. The previous results indicated that the DLEM-Ag is able to realistically simulate the exchange of trace gases, such as CH4, at different temporal and spatial scales. 2.2 Description of the Agricultural Module in the DLEM The agricultural module of the DLEM model (DLEM-Ag) incorporates the influences of agronomic practices on crop growth and phenology and other biogeochemical processes [Ren et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2012]. The DLEM-Ag has the capability to estimate the crop productivity (net primary production) and crop yield. The DLEM-Ag-estimated crop yield has been compared with census data at the provincial level and site-level observations in China [Ren et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2016a], India [Banger et al., 2015b], Africa [Pan et al., 2015], and other regions of the world [Pan et al., 2014b]. Previous studies suggested that the DLEM-Ag could capture both the trend and magnitude of regional responses of crop production to global environmental changes [Tian et al., 2016a]. The main crop categories in each grid were first identified according to the global crop geographic distribution map [Leff et al., 2004] and were then refined based on census data from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Statistics Division (FAOSTAT). The prescribed crop phenology was derived from large numbers of field observations and remote sensing data (i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer leaf area index (MODIS LAI) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR)), which encompassed the onset and development of foliage and also the dynamic of leaf loss [Ren et al., 2012]. Since global 1\\u2009km MODIS LAI is only available after the year 2000, we assumed the phenology unchanged before the year 2000. To improve the accuracy of rice distribution in China and India, we further refined the data of land use/land cover and cropping systems by incorporating the data extracted from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (http://www.caas.net.cn) and multitemporal remote sensing images in China [Liu and Tian, 2010] and high-resolution remote sensing data sets from Resourcesat-1 with historical archives at district and state levels in India [Tian et al., 2014]. In this study, the major agronomic management practices, including rotation, nitrogen fertilizer use, and irrigation, were identified. We considered three major cropping systems, i.e., the single cropping system, double cropping system, and triple cropping system. The rotation types were identified by incorporating the phenological characteristics from multitemporal remote sensing images [Yan et al., 2005]. Multitemporal data refer to a series of temporal data derived from AVHRR. We used the 10\\u2009day composited normalized difference vegetation index from AVHRR. Based on 36 time-phase data within a year, we could extract the information for crop growth. We assumed that the cropping systems remain unchanged over the study period. Nitrogen fertilizer use rates for China, India, and the United States were derived from county-level census data [Tian et al., 2012, 2015a; Banger et al., 2015b], while information in other regions were based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) country-level statistical data (http://faostat3.fao.org/download/E/EF/E). Different from previous studies, we designed three scenarios to depict the potential water management practices based on available data sets and a few assumptions and to determine the impact of water management practices on the rice CH4 emission. In the Scheme 1 (SC1), we used the dynamic inundation data derived from Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) observations to determine the water status in the rice fields [Prigent et al., 2012]. GIEMS provides the surface water extent and dynamics at monthly time step during 1993\\u20132007 with a spatial resolution of 0.5\\u00b0\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20090.5\\u00b0 longitude/latitude. Prior to 1993, we used the mean inundation extent derived from the seasonal variation of inundation dynamic for the 15\\u2009years (1993\\u20132007). During the model simulation, once the grid cell was identified as rice fields, the inundation status would be checked against Prigent's data. If it was inundated, that grid cell would be irrigated until the soils reach inundation or the CH4 fluxes would be estimated based on the DLEM-simulated soil moisture status in that grid cell. More details about the representation of soil moisture in the DLEM could be found in the supporting information. We considered SC1 as our best estimate because the dynamic inundation data were derived from multisatellite observation and reflected the irrigation status in the real world to a large extent. In the Scheme 2 (SC2), we used the global data set of monthly irrigated and rainfed rice areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000) to determine the irrigation status in the rice fields for the whole study period [Portmann et al., 2010]. In the SC2, the grid cell with rice field would be checked whether it was irrigated or rainfed rice field against Portmann's data. If it was irrigated, or rainfed and at the same time identified as inundation according to Prigent's data, we assumed that its soil water content would reach saturation. Otherwise, the soil moisture status will be calculated based on local climate and soil properties in that grid cell. The application of both Prigent and Portmann's data was to improve the estimation accuracy of irrigation and inundation status from multiple data sources. In the Scheme 3 (SC3), the rice fields were assumed to continuously flood. The differences in monthly inundated areas among the three scenarios of water scheme are presented in Figure S1 in the supporting information. Although the long-term (1901\\u20132010) irrigation data set is not available, the irrigation area could change along with the change in rice-growing area. For instant, the mean inundation extent derived from dynamic inundation data does not change over time, but the rice-growing area could vary year to year according to History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) data (http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/landusedata/index-2.html). Thus, the corresponding irrigation area, which needs to be identified as rice and meanwhile be inundated, could change over the time. 2.3 Description of the CH4 Module in the DLEM In the DLEM, the CH4-related processes are assumed to only happen in the top 50\\u2009cm of soil. DLEM only consider CH4 produced from dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is the by-product of the decomposition of litterfall and soil organic matter, and allocation of gross primary production [Tian et al., 2010]. Methane production, oxidation, and transportation from soil pore water to the atmosphere are involved in the calculation of CH4 exchanges between the rice fields and the atmosphere. The net CH4 flux between the atmosphere and soil is determined by the following equation: where is the net flux of CH4 between soil and the atmosphere (g\\u2009C\\u2009m\\u22122\\u2009d\\u22121), FP is the CH4 production (g\\u2009C\\u2009m\\u22122\\u2009d\\u22121), and FO is the CH4 oxidation (g\\u2009C\\u2009m\\u22122\\u2009d\\u22121). The DLEM considers CH4 production from DOC, which is a function of environmental factors including soil pH, temperature, and soil moisture content (Figure 1). where Vprod, max is the maximum rate of CH4 production (g\\u2009C\\u2009m\\u22123\\u2009d\\u22121), [DOC] is the concentration of DOC (g\\u2009C\\u2009m\\u22123), kmprod is the half-saturation coefficient of CH4 production (g\\u2009C\\u2009m\\u22123), f(Tsoil) is a multiplier that describes the effect of soil temperature on CH4 production and oxidation, f(pH) is a multiplier that describes the effect of soil pH on CH4 production and oxidation, and fprod(vwc) is a multiplier that describes the effect of soil moisture on CH4 production and oxidation. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Framework of key biological processes controlling CH4 fluxes in rice fields, including direct and indirect drivers. Three pathways are considered in the DLEM for CH4 oxidation: (1) atmospheric CH4 oxidation, (2) CH4 oxidation in the soil pore water, and (3) CH4 oxidation during plant-mediated transport. In this model, ebullition, diffusion, and plant-mediated transport are considered as three pathways by which CH4 can be transported from soil pore water to the atmosphere. More detailed information about the features of the CH4 module in the DLEM can be found in Tian et al. [2010]. CH4 module in the DLEM has already been validated at regional scales, such as West Siberian Lowland and Sanjiang Plain [Bohn et al., 2015; Song et al., 2013], at country level, such as China [Ren et al., 2011], and Canada [Miller et al., 2014], at continental level, such as North America [Tian et al., 2010], and at global level [Melton et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2015b; Wania et al., 2013]. 2.4 Other Input Data Several sets of georeferenced and time series input data are compiled to drive the DLEM model, including (1) daily climate data (maximum, minimum, and mean air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and downward shortwave radiation), (2) atmospheric chemical components (atmospheric CO2 concentration, AOT40 O3 index, and nitrogen deposition), (3) soil properties (soil texture, soil pH, and bulk density), (4) land use and land cover data, and (5) agricultural management practices (irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer use, and rotation etc.) and other ancillary data, such as river network and topographic data. More specifically, daily climate variables during 1901\\u20132010 were derived from Climate Research Unit-National Center for Environmental Prediction 6-hourly climate data sets (http://dods.extra.cea.fr/store/p529viov/cruncep/V4_1901_2012/readme.htm). Atmospheric CO2 concentration data were obtained from a spline fit of the Law Dome before 1959 (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/trends/co2/lawdome.smoothed.yr20) and from NOAA (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html) during 1959\\u20132010. Monthly atmospheric ozone concentration was represented by AOT40 [Felzer et al., 2005] and further interpolated to daily data [Ren et al., 2007]. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition data were obtained from North American Carbon Program Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project [Wei et al., 2014]. The basic soil physical and chemical properties, such as soil texture, bulk density, and soil pH, were obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database [Wieder et al., 2014]. Cropland distribution was derived from the 5\\u2009arc min resolution HYDE v3.1 data and aggregated to half-degree [Goldewijk et al., 2011]. Inundation data from multisatellite observations were obtained from global Wetland Extent and Wetland CH4 Intercomparison of Models Project [Prigent et al., 2012]. Further details of other input data can be found in the previous publications [Ren et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2015b; Xu et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2014]. 2.5 Experimental Design To determine the spatial and temporal patterns of CH4 emissions and quantify the relative contribution of multiple environmental factors, we conducted 10 simulations in total (Table 1). The model was first run to reach the equilibrium state and get the initial condition for the spin-up and transient simulations. In the equilibrium run, all the input data in 1900 were used to drive the model except climate data and inundation data. For climate data, we used long-term mean climate data during 1901\\u20131930. For inundation data, we derived the seasonal variation patterns from 15\\u2009year (1993\\u20132007) mean inundation extent. After the equilibrium run, the model was run another 900\\u2009years for the spin-up with detrend climate data from 1901 to 2010. The spin-up was to smooth the transition from the equilibrium state to the transient run. The transient runs for all-combined simulation were to get the estimation of CH4 fluxes by considering all the natural and anthropogenic changes during 1901\\u20132010 (Sall-combined). We conducted six simulations to quantify the effects of individual environmental factors (Ssingle), such as climate, atmospheric chemistry, land cover change, and land management practices on the CH4 fluxes. For example, for the experiment without climate considered, we let all other input data change with time except climatic data, which was kept at the level of 1901. Then the effect of climate on the CH4 fluxes was determined by Sall-combined versus Ssingle(climate). Table 1.

The time period indicates that driver data (e.g., climatic data and atmospheric chemistry data) were being used in those periods. In all-combined simulation, the averaged inundation data sets during 1993\\u20132007 were used to represent the inundation extent of rice field before 1993. 2.6 Model Evaluation Against Field Observations at Site Level The key parameters for the CH4-related processes are derived from field observations (Table 2). In this study, we further evaluated the DLEM performance of the CH4 emissions from rice fields at 31 observation sites (Figure 2 and Table S1 in the supporting information). The comparisons of the DLEM-estimated CH4 with site-level observations indicate that the DLEM can capture the daily and seasonal patterns of CH4 emissions (Figures 2-4). In general, the DLEM estimations showed a good agreement with the field observations (n\\u2009=\\u200931; slope\\u2009=\\u20090.9021; R2\\u2009=\\u20090.9545; p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) (Figure 4). The big differences of CH4 emissions between the observations and the DLEM-estimations at PhilRice Central Experimental Station in Maligaya during 1996 were probably caused by the commence use of organic amendments in that year at the experimental site. The addition of organic amendments could provide the rich substrate for the methanogens which greatly stimulate the CH4 emissions in that year. Thus, the observed CH4 emissions during the dry and wet seasons in 1996 were obviously higher than the other years (Figure 3a). Compared with the dry season, the amount of CH4 emissions during the wet season were much greater at PhilRice Central Experimental Station and the DLEM was able to capture the seasonal variation of CH4 emissions. For the double rice cropping system, the DLEM-estimated CH4 emissions were comparable with the observations during the 5\\u2009year experiment in southeast China [Lu et al., 2000]. Table 2.

Atmospheric CO2 concentration steadily increased from 296.4\\u2009ppm to 391.9\\u2009ppm. At the same time, both precipitation and temperature showed large interannual variations in overall significant increasing trends of 6.2\\u2009mm/decade and 0.075\\u00b0C/decade (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). AOT40 increased rapidly since the 1950s, with the largest increase occurred in Asia. Rice fields received more amount of nitrogen through fertilizer use than deposition. The amount of nitrogen through atmospheric deposition was around one fifth of the amount of fertilizer use in the 2000s. Both nitrogen fertilizer use and deposition increased slowly before the 1960s and then enhanced dramatically afterward, at an overall increasing trend of 1 and 0.12\\u2009kg\\u2009N/ha/yr, respectively.

For the SC1, we determined the inundation status in the rice fields based on multisatellite observations, the estimated CH4 emissions increased from 10.4\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.2\\u2009Tg CH4/yr (Avg. \\u00b11 SD, same hereafter) in the 1900s to 19.2\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.9\\u2009Tg CH4/yr in the 2000s with a significant increasing trend (0.1\\u2009Tg CH4/yr, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) (Figure 6). The dynamic inundation data only cover 1993 to 2007; hence, the estimate of CH4 emissions during this period was 20.5\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.4\\u2009Tg CH4/yr. For the SC2, the DLEM-estimated CH4 emissions were 18.3\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.1\\u2009Tg CH4/yr when soil moisture was determined by one-phase monthly irrigation/rainfed maps. For the SC3, we assumed that the rice fields were continuously flooded, and the DLEM-estimated CH4 emissions were 38.8\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.0\\u2009Tg CH4/yr during the 2000s. Compared with the SC1 and the SC2, continuously flooding could double the CH4 emissions from the global rice fields.

For the intra-annual variation, the DLEM estimation showed that CH4 emissions increased from early February and reached a peak emission during July to August, which was partly due to the larger area of rice planted and the high rates of CH4 emissions during this time period, and then leveled off from September (Figure 7). The seasonal contribution of the CH4 emissions varied at different continents. In Asia, the estimated CH4 emissions in spring, summer, autumn, and winter contributed 22%, 38%, 25%, and 15% of the annual emission, respectively. In North America, the CH4 emissions in spring, summer, autumn, and winter contributed 28%, 32%, 21%, and 19% of the annual emission, respectively. The DLEM-estimated CH4 emissions during the growing and nongrowing season accounted for 76% and 24% of the annual emission, respectively.

Further analysis suggested that tropical region (30\\u00b0N\\u201330\\u00b0S) contributed 85% of the estimated global rice emission, followed by northern midlatitude (30\\u00b0N\\u201360\\u00b0N) and southern midlatitude (30\\u00b0S\\u201360\\u00b0S). From the continental perspective, Asia was the primary emitter, which contributed around 94% of the total rice emissions. Country-level analysis showed that India and China were two biggest contributors to the global rice emissions. The DLEM-estimated rice CH4 emissions were around 4.99\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.36\\u2009Tg CH4/yr in India and 3.61\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.16\\u2009Tg CH4/yr in China, which accounted for 24% and 18% of the estimated CH4 emissions from global rice fields, respectively. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distribution of estimated mean annual CH4 emissions from global rice fields during 1993\\u20132007. 3.4 Relative Contributions of Multiple Environmental Factors Through factorial simulation experiments, we further quantified the relative contribution of environmental factors to the cumulative rice emission. Our simulations indicated that land conversion from natural vegetation to rice fields played the dominant role in the increase of the rice emissions, which was around 49.44% (4.36\\u2009Tg CH4/yr) of the total increase in global CH4 emissions from rice fields (Figure 6). Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration induced an increase of 2.25\\u2009Tg CH4/yr in estimated CH4 emissions from the 1900s to the 2010s, which roughly accounts for 25.52% of the total increase in global CH4 emissions from rice fields. Both nitrogen fertilizer use and nitrogen deposition had a positive influence on the CH4 emissions (Figures 5c and 5d). In the 2000s, nitrogen fertilizer use and deposition increased the CH4 emissions by 0.61 and 0.08\\u2009Tg CH4/yr, respectively (Figure 6). Elevated O3 concentration had a minor influence on the global rice emissions over time compared with other factors. On the contrary, climate decreased the CH4 emissions for most of the years over the study period. Particularly, in the 2000s, the warmest decade compared with all the previous decades in the instrumental record [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2013], which induced a reduction of 0.27\\u2009Tg CH4/yr in the CH4 emission (Figure 6). 4 Discussion 4.1 Comparison With Other Studies Over the last two decades, due to the increasing number of field measurements, the availability of remote sensing observations, and the improved understanding of mechanisms responsible for the CH4 emissions in rice fields, the accuracy of the estimated rice emissions has been improved and the magnitude of the estimated rice emissions turned out a downward trend in previous studies [Chen and Prinn, 2006]. In this study, the DLEM-estimated CH4 emissions from rice fields were 18.3\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.1\\u201338.8\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.0\\u2009Tg CH4/yr during the 2000s by applying different water schemes. The assumption of continuous flooding for the rice fields may overestimate the CH4 emissions. Here we compared our results with the studies from recent 10\\u2009years at both global and country levels. In general, the estimations from top-down approaches (44\\u2013115\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr) [Bergamaschi et al., 2007; Bloom et al., 2010; Chen and Prinn, 2006; Spahni et al., 2011] were much higher than those from both inventory (25.6\\u201341.7\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr) [Yan et al., 2009] and bottom-up (24.8\\u201344.9\\u2009Tg\\u2009CH4/yr) approaches [Ito and Inatomi, 2012; Spahni et al., 2011], which was probably due to the higher estimation of prior information of either rice field distribution or the estimated CH4 emissions being used in top-down studies [Bergamaschi et al., 2007; Bloom et al., 2010; Chen and Prinn, 2006] (Table. S2). To the best of our understanding, our study incorporated the \\u201cstate-of-the-art\\u201d information from multisatellite observations-derived inundation data and inventory-based, monthly irrigated rice area to determine the water status in the rice fields and narrow down the current estimation of CH4 emissions from rice field. Most of the previous ecosystem models treated rice as one type of wetland and applied the same schemes to calculate the CH4 fluxes. Due to the consideration of the noninundation status in the rice fields, the estimated annual CH4 emissions were largely reduced. For the contemporary period (1990\\u20132010), FAO (http://faostat3.fao.org/home/E), Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) (http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/part_CH4.php), and Environmental Protection Agency (http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html) provided time series estimation of CH4 emissions from rice fields. The magnitudes of DLEM-simulated CH4 emissions were comparable with other estimations; however, the interannual variation in CH4 emissions was diverging from each other. For FAO estimation, there is no significant interannual variation. For EDGAR, the estimated CH4 emissions decreased 33.6\\u2009Tg CH4/yr from 2000 to 2004 and then started to increase afterward until 2010 (37.6\\u2009Tg CH4/yr) (Figure 9), which may be attributed to the similar trend in harvest area during the 2000s [FAOSTAT, 2014]. It is worth noting that the increase of CH4 emission after 2007 may also contribute to the resumption of atmospheric CH4 concentration increase. For the DLEM-estimated CH4 fluxes, the annual variation is determined by both the spatial and temporal variations of inundation status and environmental heterogeneity in the rice fields. In the SC1, DLEM-estimated CH4 emissions showed a great reduction after 2004, which may be caused by climatic change (Figure 9). Further analysis indicated that South and Southeast Asia contributed over 85% of the reduced CH4 fluxes. At the country level, India and Indonesia played a major contribution. Previous studies suggested that severe drought happened in Northeast India during the summer monsoon in 2006 [Bergamaschi et al., 2007], which may reduce the CH4 emissions. In Indonesia, the monthly mean temperature in February and March during 2005\\u20132007 was 0.73\\u00b0C and 0.43\\u00b0C lower than that during 1993\\u20132004. And the mean temperature from October to March was 0.22\\u00b0C lower during 2005\\u20132007 compared with that during 1993\\u20132004. In most areas of Indonesia, the rice planting season starts from October to March, with the highest rainfall from December to March. The lower temperature could reduce the microbial activities, which further reduce the CH4 emissions. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of temporal variation in estimated CH4 emissions from global rice fields among three scenarios of water regime scheme (DLEM-SC1, DLEM-SC2, and DLEM-SC3) and three previous estimates (FAO, EDGAR, and EPA2012). DLEM-simulated intra-annual variations in CH4 fluxes showed consistent patterns with the column-averaged CH4 mixing ratio from atmospheric inversion estimation [Bergamaschi et al., 2007]. The estimated CH4 emissions during winter also contributed a small portion of the total amount emitted annually. At the global scale, the estimated CH4 emissions during the non-growing season accounted for almost one fifth of the annual emission, which was within the range estimated by Weller et al. [2016]. In the United States and China, some of the rice fields during the nongrowing season are still being flooded in order to provide the habitat for waterfowl and migratory birds [Wood et al., 2010], which may lead to CH4 emissions. Most country-level analyses of CH4 emissions from rice cultivation were inventory-based (Table S2). Previous estimation of rice emission in China ranged from 5.2 to 11.4\\u2009Tg CH4/yr as estimated by inventory studies [Chen et al., 2013; Second National Communication on Climate Change of The People's Republic of China, 2012; Yan et al., 2009; Zhang and Chen, 2014; Zhang et al., 2014] and ranged from 4.1 to 7.5\\u2009Tg CH4/yr in bottom-up estimations [Kai et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011a]. The DLEM-estimated rice emissions were around 3.2\\u20135.6\\u2009Tg CH4/yr. The differences among studies were probably caused by various water regimes being used. During the last two decades, China has already improved water management and fertilizer use in the rice fields. Intermittent drainage together with other water management practices has been applied to a large portion of rice fields over China, and field observations also confirmed that water-saving management could largely reduce or even cease the CH4 emissions [Chen et al., 2013]. In India, 55% of the rice field was irrigated and the rest were either rainfed upland or lowland rice field [Bhatia et al., 2013]. By applying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006 guidelines, estimated CH4 emissions from rice cultivation in India were around 3.4 to 6.1\\u2009Tg CH4/yr [Bhatia et al., 2013; Garg et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2009], which is similar to the DLEM estimation (4.99\\u2009Tg CH4/yr). 4.2 Climate Effects on CH4 Emissions Our simulated results showed that over the study period, climate variability/change had reduced CH4 emissions from rice field. Both China and India experienced global warming [Jain and Kumar, 2012; Li et al., 2010], which changed the availability of soil moisture content and carbon substrate, and further affected the CH4 emissions from rice fields [Laborte et al., 2012; Tokida et al., 2011]. Precipitation is another key climatic factor which governed the CH4 emissions, especially in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand, where 40%, 79%, and 35% of the rice area were under rainfed, respectively [Redfern et al., 2012]. The reduction in precipitation or shifting in timing and magnitude of rainfall event may cause crop failure, which could further reduce CH4 emissions from the rice fields. 4.3 Effects of Land Use and Water Use on CH4 Emissions Land cover and land use change, including land conversion, irrigation, and nitrogen fertilizer use, had significant impacts on the CH4 emissions. Our input data indicate that the rice cultivation area between the 1900s and the 2000s increased by around 38%, which was partially supported by the global rice harvest area derived from census data (1964-2010) from FAO and U.S. Department of Agriculture. The expansion of rice cultivation is the primary factor that led to an increase in rice CH4 emission. Water management regimes, like different irrigation practices, could effectively mitigate CH4 emissions, which are well documented in Asian countries [Corton et al., 2000]. Intermittent irrigation could reduce CH4 emissions by 22\\u201380% as compared with continuous flooding [Jain et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2000b; Wassmann et al., 2000]. Previous study suggested that the improved water use efficiency and the rapid rise in chemical fertilizer use were the dominant contributor of the reduced CH4 emission between 1980 and 2005 [Kai et al., 2011], which was partially contradictory to our results. In Kai et al. [2011], they attributed the change of CH4 growth rate since 1980 to the reduction of CH4 emission from the rice field by assuming that there was no significant change in both wetland area in the northern hemisphere and CH4 emission from global wetlands. However, Prigent's data revealed that the global inundation extent decreased dramatically, at the rate of 67,700\\u2009km2/yr during January 1993 to mid-2000 [Prigent et al., 2012]. In addition, the DLEM-estimated CH4 emission from wetland showed an overall decreasing trend from 1993 to 2007 (unpublished data), which was supported by the inversion model of atmospheric transport and chemistry [Bousquet et al., 2006; Pison et al., 2013]. Meanwhile, Kai et al. [2011] suggested that the use of inorganic fertilizer could reduce the CH4 emission in rice fields partly due to the displacement of organic amendments. However, in their empirical-based model, they just simply incorporated the mechanisms that the use of inorganic fertilizer decreased the CH4 emission in rice fields without considering the organic amendments, ignoring complex effects of nitrogen fertilizer use on both CH4 production and oxidation processes [Banger et al., 2012]. Liu and Greaver [2009] demonstrated that in the anaerobic agricultural system, CH4 emissions increase by 0.008\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.004\\u2009kg/ha/yr per l\\u2009kg\\u2009N/ha/yr fertilizer use. Banger et al. [2012] analyzed 155 data pairs in rice fields and 64% of them showed CH4 emissions increase in response to nitrogen fertilizer application. In our study, nitrogen fertilizer use could promote the crop production, which provided higher litter input, root biomass, and root exudation for the carbon substrate of methanogens and stimulated the CH4 production. At the same time, it could accelerate water transpiration in N-limited area, lowered soil water content given a certain amount of rainfall, and thus increased CH4 oxidation while depressing its production [Lu and Tian, 2013]. Our study agreed with Kai et al. [2011] that the improved water management could reduce the CH4 emissions in rice field. 4.4 Effects of Other Atmospheric Chemistry Components In our study, atmospheric CO2 concentration enrichment has induced an increase of 2.25\\u2009Tg CH4/yr in CH4 emissions from global rice fields from the 1900s to the 2010s (Figure 6). Elevated CO2 could stimulate belowground carbon production, which may provide more substrate for methanogens activity [Allen et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2009; Pregitzer et al., 2008; Zak et al., 2000]. Field observation confirmed that under free-air CO2 enrichment experiment, CH4 production from the rice fields was significantly greater than that under ambient conditions [Dijkstra et al., 2012; Inubushi et al., 2003]. Chen et al. [2013] found the increasing trend of CH4 emissions from the rice fields in China as a result of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. Meta-data analysis for the effect of elevated CO2 on CH4 emissions revealed that CO2 enrichment could stimulate CH4 by 43.4% in the rice fields [van Groenigen et al., 2011]. Under the future climate scenarios, atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to continue increase, which may further stimulate the CH4 emission in the rice fields [IPCC, 2013]. During 1901\\u20132010, global nitrogen deposition enhanced at an increasing rate of 0.12\\u2009kg\\u2009N/ha/yr. Nitrogen addition could promote crop growth and provide more carbon substrate for the microbial activity and hence stimulates CH4 emission. In the 2000s, nitrogen deposition increased the CH4 emissions by 0.08\\u2009Tg CH4/yr (Figure 6). The level of tropospheric ozone as indicated by AOT40 has significantly increased especially after the 1990s in China and India [Ren et al., 2007], which reduced the CH4 emissions [Bhatia et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2011]. At a global level, however, this study showed that tropospheric ozone pollution had a minor influence on rice CH4 emission compared with other factors. 4.5 Uncertainties and Future Research Need Our estimation of CH4 emissions from rice cultivation must be used with caution because of much uncertainty resulting from input data, model structure, and parameters. Estimate uncertainties may be resulted from the inaccurate spatial distribution of rice cultivation and agronomic practices being applied. In this study, we have incorporated the map of global crop geographic distribution with regional agricultural census data derived from FAOSTAT along with the multiple rotation types to generate the distribution of rice fields; however, there are still discrepancies among various rice distribution maps due to the differences in georeferenced resolution as well as the lack of information on rice cultivation over some regions of the world. In addition, we applied different irrigation schemes to determine the impact of irrigation on the CH4 emission from global rice fields. In the SC1, we identified the inundation status of rice cultivation by using the observation from multisatellites, which only covers from 1993 to 2007. This may bring large uncertainties to the estimated CH4 emission from other years. Besides, the satellite data sets may underestimate some small paddy field (few hectares) [Prigent et al., 2007], which could result in the underestimation of CH4 emission. The DLEM inexplicitly addressed CH4 emission associated with the crop residues through model parameterization. However, DLEM used time-invariant parameter to estimate the amount of crop residue returning to the field, which could introduce some uncertainties. More explicit, representation of such processes is needed to reduce the uncertainties. Several additional issues have been identified for advancing our research in the future, including (1) improving spatial resolution of input data and subgrid heterogeneity for driving the model and (2) improving model representation of additional processes that regulate the CH4 emission in rice field. Finer-resolution data are needed for future model application at multiple spatial scales, which will serve to make more realistic assumptions based on conditions that are truly happening in the real world [Pan et al., 2014a]. In this study, all the data sets have a spatial resolution of 0.5\\u00b0\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20090.5\\u00b0 longitude/latitude. However, in reality, the water regimes might be highly variable at the local scale, such as field to field variation or variation within field. The current assumption of homogeneous water regimes applied in each individual grid needs to be improved by considering the subgrid variability in water regimes. In addition, the model representations of rice varieties and iron reduction/oxidation are needed to better estimate CH4 emission in rice field. Rice variety is a key factor to regulate the CH4 fluxes [Zhang et al., 2014]. Different types of rice could provide various amounts of root-derived carbon and also differ in structures which regulate the pathway to diffuse the oxygen flux to the soil and transport CH4 to the atmosphere. At the same time, the improvement in rice varieties over time could contribute to the variation of CH4 emission. For example, modern rice varieties often shorten vegetation periods and meanwhile may adapt to multiple environmental changes, such as extreme climate, which directly and indirectly regulate the total CH4 emissions. Other critical factors, such as iron reduction/oxidation processes [Van Bodegom et al., 2002], were missing in the current version of the DLEM. These factors or local practices are very important in regulating the CH4 emission but have a large spatial and temporal variabilities, which are very difficult to collect at the large scale [Van Bodegom et al., 2002]. This limitation of data over a large scale makes it impossible to incorporate such information and processes into the model for a global level estimation at the current stage of study. 5 Conclusion Given the importance of the CH4 emissions from the global rice fields, it is vital to provide robust estimation before developing climate mitigation strategies. Rice fields serve about half of the world population. The production and management practices for the rice fields affect food security, water scarcity, and the feedback to climate change. It can be anticipated that to meet the demand of boost population, rice cultivation area is expected to increase, which could result in more CH4 emissions. Despite some remaining uncertainties, our process-based modeling study provides the state-of-the-art estimate on the magnitude and spatial-temporal variability of CH4 emissions from global rice field. Our results suggest that CH4 emissions from global rice field varied from 18.3\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.1 to 38.8\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091.0\\u2009Tg CH4/yr during the 2000s depending on different water management practices. The estimated CH4 emission from the global rice field under continuous flooding could be reduced by more than 50% if intermittent irrigation would be applied. The optimized irrigation strategies could have potentials to attenuate the water scarcity, and meanwhile reduce the CH4 emissions. Thus, more works need to be done to determine the optimum level of water content to simultaneously reduce CH4 emissions as well as achieve sustainable rice production.

Han, H.-J. H. Franssen, R. Rosolem, R. Jin, X. Li, and H. Vereecken Abstract. The recent development of the non-invasive cosmic-ray soil moisture sensing technique fills the gap between point-scale soil moisture measurements and regional-scale soil moisture measurements by remote sensing. A cosmic-ray probe measures soil moisture for a footprint with a diameter of ~ 600 m (at sea level) and with an effective measurement depth between 12 and 76 cm, depending on the soil humidity. In this study, it was tested whether neutron counts also allow correcting for a systematic error in the model forcings. A lack of water management data often causes systematic input errors to land surface models. Here, the assimilation procedure was tested for an irrigated corn field (Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research \\u2013 HiWATER, 2012) where no irrigation data were available as model input although for the area a significant amount of water was irrigated. In the study, the measured cosmic-ray neutron counts and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) products were jointly assimilated into the Community Land Model (CLM) with the local ensemble transform Kalman filter. Different data assimilation scenarios were evaluated, with assimilation of LST and/or cosmic-ray neutron counts, and possibly parameter estimation of leaf area index (LAI). The results show that the direct assimilation of cosmic-ray neutron counts can improve the soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) estimation significantly, correcting for lack of information on irrigation amounts. The joint assimilation of neutron counts and LST could improve further the ET estimation, but the information content of neutron counts exceeded the one of LST. Additional improvement was achieved by calibrating LAI, which after calibration was also closer to independent field measurements. It was concluded that assimilation of neutron counts was useful for ET and soil moisture estimation even if the model has a systematic bias like neglecting irrigation. However, also the assimilation of LST helped to correct the systematic model bias introduced by neglecting irrigation and LST could be used to update soil moisture with state augmentation.

In the USA, significant impacts of recent droughts on agricultural production indicate the continuing vulnerability of the country to drought. This paper presents a methodology for spatial representation of the agroclimatic component of agricultural drought vulnerability. This methodology was developed as a part of an integrated assessment of drought vulnerability. For the spatial analysis, the state of Nebraska was selected as a study area because of the considerable variation in climatology, soil characteristics, land use, and cropping patterns. The underlying approach assumes that the best spatial characterization of the state's agroclimatology from the agricultural drought vulnerability perspective is the probability of seasonal crop moisture deficiency. Seasonal crop water-use thresholds for well-watered crops (e.g. corn, soybean, and sorghum) were estimated using the evapotranspiration (ET) mathematical model. For wheat and grass, ET values were estimated based on the relationship between ET, water-use efficiency, and crop yield. Historical grain yield data were analysed to define an economically viable threshold for wheat. Seasonal ET thresholds determined for the crops were used to calculate area-weighted mean ET for the combination of crops in every county. The threshold values and long-term precipitation data were used for calculating statistical probabilities of seasonal crop moisture deficiency. Probability values were analysed at 112 weather stations across Nebraska, spatially interpolated and classified using geographic information systems. The spatial pattern of probabilities of seasonal crop moisture deficiency reflected both seasonal precipitation across Nebraska and the distribution of crops and grasses.

Arheimer Abstract. The scientific initiative Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) (2003\\u20132012 by the IAHS) put considerable effort into improving the reliability of hydrological models to predict flow response in ungauged rivers. PUB's collective experience advanced hydrologic science and defined guidelines to make predictions in catchments without observed runoff data. At present, there is a raised interest in applying catchment models to large domains and large data samples in a multi-basin manner, to explore emerging spatial patterns or learn from comparative hydrology. However, such modelling involves additional sources of uncertainties caused by the inconsistency between input data sets, i.e. particularly regional and global databases. This may lead to inaccurate model parameterisation and erroneous process understanding. In order to bridge the gap between the best practices for flow predictions in single catchments and multi-basins at the large scale, we present a further developed and slightly modified version of the recommended best practices for PUB by Takeuchi et al. (2013). By using examples from a recent HYPE (Hydrological Predictions for the Environment) hydrological model set-up across 6000 subbasins for the Indian subcontinent, named India-HYPE v1.0, we explore the PUB recommendations, identify challenges and recommend ways to overcome them. We describe the work process related to (a) errors and inconsistencies in global databases, unknown human impacts, and poor data quality; (b) robust approaches to identify model parameters using a stepwise calibration approach, remote sensing data, expert knowledge, and catchment similarities; and (c) evaluation based on flow signatures and performance metrics, using both multiple criteria and multiple variables, and independent gauges for \\\\\\\"blind tests\\\\\\\". The results show that despite the strong physiographical gradient over the subcontinent, a single model can describe the spatial variability in dominant hydrological processes at the catchment scale. In addition, spatial model deficiencies are used to identify potential improvements of the model concept. Eventually, through simultaneous calibration using numerous gauges, the median Kling\\u2013Gupta efficiency for river flow increased from 0.14 to 0.64. We finally demonstrate the potential of multi-basin modelling for comparative hydrology using PUB, by grouping the 6000 subbasins based on similarities in flow signatures to gain insights into the spatial patterns of flow generating processes at the large scale.

Studies of the vegetative response to drought are paramount to providing scientific information for drought risk mitigation. In this paper, the spatial-temporal pattern of drought and the response lag of vegetation in Nebraska were analyzed from 2000 to 2015. Based on the long-term Daymet data set, the standard precipitation index (SPI) was computed to identify precipitation anomalies, and the Gaussian function was applied to obtain temperature anomalies. Vegetation anomaly was identified by dynamic time warping technique using a remote sensing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Finally, multilayer correlation analysis was applied to obtain the response lag of different vegetation types. The results show that Nebraska suffered severe drought events in 2002 and 2012. The response lag of vegetation to drought typically ranged from 30 to 45 days varying for different vegetation types and human activities (water use and management). Grasslands had the shortest response lag (~35 days), while forests had the longest lag period (~48 days). For specific crop types, the response lag of winter wheat varied among different regions of Nebraska (35\\u201345 days), while soybeans, corn and alfalfa had similar response lag times of approximately 40 days. Keywords: drought monitoring; drought response lag; DTW; lag correlation coefficient Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction Drought is one of the world\\u2019s most costly and widespread natural hazards, impacting water resources, agricultural production, ecosystems, human health, and the global economy [1,2,3,4]. Drought events are projected to be more intense and frequent for many regions of the world under global warming, placing further pressure on agricultural systems and natural resources, due to increasing demands from an ever-increasing global population [5]. Semiarid regions such as Australia\\u2019s Murray-Darling River Basin, South Africa, and the America\\u2019s Middle West with vegetation cover face a greater threat from drought, especially agricultural regions because of insufficient rainfall, water management, and vulnerable vegetation [6,7,8]. Throughout global history, extreme droughts have wreaked havoc on the agricultural systems in these semi-arid regions. Hence, understanding the vegetative response to drought in drought-prone, semiarid regions has drawn attention from meteorologists, ecologists, and agricultural scientists [9,10]. Droughts are often considered to have four major types: Meteorological, agricultural, hydrological and socioeconomic drought [11]. The key that differentiates these different types of drought is time scale of dryness: Meteorological drought comes first with water deficits caused by high temperatures and low precipitation. After continuous meteorological drought, crops suffer from water deficits, and agricultural drought occurs. Among the four types of drought, agriculture is affected most directly and seriously by meteorological drought, and it is more difficult to understand than the others, because of the complication of interaction between vegetation and climate. To better understand drought effects, the construction of a drought monitoring index is the first step. Over the past decades, much effort has been devoted to drought monitoring, and a series of drought indices have been developed, such as water balance-based indices (Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)) [12,13,14], blended indices (U.S. Drought Monitor Index (USDM), Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI)) [15], indices constructed by joint distribution models (Joint Drought Index (JDI), Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI) [16,17] and other vegetation drought indices (Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI)) [18,19]. However, there is no single drought index that can reflect the situation across different regions and time scales, because the mechanism of drought and its effects vary considerably [20]. To date, as a simple calculation using commonly available precipitation data, the traditional Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is widely used as a drought indicator, since it can be calculated at multiple time scales and adapted to different climates and drought types [21,22,23]. To analyze the impact of drought on vegetation ecosystems, capturing the anomaly state of vegetation is of great significance. Many vegetation indices (VIs) have been developed to monitor vegetation conditions over large spatial ranges, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [24], enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [25], and ratio vegetation index (RVI) [26]. NDVI has been proven useful for meaningful comparisons of seasonal and interannual changes in vegetation growth and activity, and it has been widely used in related studies to reflect the vegetation response to drought [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. However, anomalies of growing seasons highlighted by the NDVI profile over the years can be attributed to several reasons, not only to extreme weather events like droughts, but also to agricultural practice; i.e., crop rotations or different planting times (winter crops versus summer crops). Therefore, more accurate methods are needed to characterize the abnormal state of vegetation influenced by drought. Dynamic time warping (DTW) [31] is a match algorithm according to the warping similarity of temporal profiles, and it is proven to be an efficient solution to handle these issues in crop classification, effectively reducing the intra-class variations related to different vegetation types and agricultural and land management practices [35,36,37]. But to date, the effect of this method on vegetation anomaly calculations has not been well evaluated in related studies. The main challenge for monitoring the response of vegetation to drought with satellite imaging is the analysis of the relationship between vegetation and drought, as well as the calculation of the vegetation response\\u2019s time lag. The effect of drought on vegetation is cumulative and nonlinear, and it is not manifested by vegetation at a certain degree or time during the year [38,39,40]. Several factors determine vegetation response, including various drought characteristics (duration, severity and intensity), vegetation characteristics and phenology, and the general environment conditions of the location (e.g., soil type and elevation) [41,42,43]. This complexity and nonlinearity make it more difficult to extract lag time relationship between climatic conditions and vegetation response. The correlation coefficients and regression method were widely used in most previous studies to analyze the relationship of NDVI and SPI, and over an approximately 1\\u20133 month scale, a strong correlation between NDVI and SPI have been proven [44,45,46,47,48]. However, more detailed time lag information observed by satellite images is still not clear. At present, research on the large-area response lag of remote sensing-derived variables, such as VIs have mainly been conducted on a monthly scale and have not explored in finer time scales. In addition, few previous studies have concentrated on the relation between vegetation anomaly and drought, since the vegetation index, rather than \\u2018vegetation anomaly\\u2019 index was used to analyze the relationship between vegetation and drought, it is difficult to remove the influence of non-drought factors (seasonal change and vegetation growth) on the changes of a vegetation index [44,49]. Some studies have used standard scores to characterize the anomalies of vegetation and rainfall, and other methods have been tried to calculate the time lag of vegetation\\u2019s response to drought in more sophisticated way [50,51,52]. More detailed study of vegetation response to drought is needed to give a more accurate response relationship and response time lag. The overall objective of this study is to develop a refined methodology to map and characterize spatial-temporal dynamics of detailed vegetation response lag to drought in semiarid regions, focusing on Nebraska. Daily time series of MODIS NDVI data and the Daymet dataset over a 15-year study period (2000 to 2015) were used to create annual maps of vegetation response lag, and assess the variations of lag among different vegetation types. In addition, we analyzed the potential contributors to vegetation stress using random forest. 2. Materials and Methods The MOD09GQ time-series, Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and Daymet dataset from 2000 to 2015 were used to extract the vegetation anomaly, and climate anomaly, respectively. The irrigation data and DEM were also applied to the driving force analysis of vegetation response diversity. The methodological workflow consisted of the following steps (Figure 1): (1) Data preprocessing and NDVI time-series smoothing; (2) calculation of SPI (precipitation anomaly); (3) calculation of the temperature anomaly; (4) calculation of the vegetation anomaly, which involves the extraction of average phenology NDVI profile, DTW match of NDVI observed time-series and phenology profile, and the anomaly calculation of NDVI at daily scale; and (5) extraction of vegetation response lag based on lag correlation coefficient. Figure 1. The methodological workflow of the study 2.1. Study Area. Nebraska is located approximately between 40\\u00b0 and 43\\u00b0 N latitude and 95\\u00b0 and 104\\u00b0 W longitude, with a total area of 200,365 km2. The state is located in the U.S. Central Great Plains region, and is an agriculturally dominated state supporting both irrigated and rainfed crops. The western and central parts of Nebraska are covered by expansive grasslands, which is a natural vegetation ecosystem that is less affected by human activities, both irrigated (e.g., alfalfa, corn, and soybeans) and rainfed, dryland crops (e.g., winter wheat). The eastern part of Nebraska is extensively cropped in a primarily corn-soybean cropping system under rainfed production. Nebraska ranks among the leading producers among states in the U.S. for the state\\u2019s main crop types of corn, soybean, winter wheat, and alfalfa (Figure 2). Figure 2. Crop distribution and geographical location of study area. Nebraska has two major climate zones: Continental in the east and semiarid in the west. The state has a steep precipitation gradient ranging from about 380 mm in the west to >800 mm in the east (Figure 3b). The temperature in the south is higher than that in the north (Figure 3a) (https://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/GDGHome.aspx). These precipitation and temperature gradients reflected in the spatial distribution of cropping types, agricultural management practices, and vegetation types across the state. A combination of dryland, irrigated crops, and short grass prairie is predominate in the west, transitioning to predominately rainfed corn-soybean systems and tall grass prairie vegetation types in the east. Rainfall fluctuates greatly throughout the year and across the spatial extent of the state, and also has a high level of inter-annual variability in precipitation, resulting in periodic drought events [53]. Figure 3. Climate Condition of Nebraska; (a) demonstrates the annual averaged daily mean temperature from 1981 to 2010; (b) demonstrates the annual averaged total precipitation from 1981 to 2010. The statistical data download from Geospatial Data Gateway [54]. Nebraska has been profoundly affected by long and extreme droughts for centuries. In recent years, global climate change has significantly increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in Nebraska [55]. For example, the severe flooding in 2011, and extreme drought in 2012, which was the driest and warmest year on Nebraska\\u2019s record [56]. 2.1. Data and Preprocessing The MODIS time-series, Cropland Data Layer, and Daymet dataset from 2000 to 2015 were used to extract the vegetation anomalies and climate anomalies respectively. The irrigation data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were applied for the driving force analysis of vegetation response diversity. All the spatial data were resampled to 250 m spatial resolution for further data processing. 2.1.1. Time-series MODIS Data The NASA MODIS sensor offers timely and large-area surface monitoring observations with high temporal (near daily) and moderate spatial (250 meter) resolutions. MODIS data sets products were acquired from NASA [57] (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) with the image data products calibrated and atmospherically corrected for gases, aerosols, and cirrus-cloud effects using the MODIS atmospheric correction algorithm [58,59]. In this study, MOD09GQ daily products from 2000 to 2015 were used to calculate the NDVI time series data [60]. MOD09 red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance imagery, centered at 645-nanometer and 858.5-nanometer wavelengths, respectively, are available at 250-m resolution from the MOD09GQ product on a daily time step. This MODIS image data product has scientific quality assurance (QA) flags describing the overall image data quality, band-specific quality, atmospheric correction state and adjacency correction state that was used to reduce the noise of NDVI time series data during time-series NDVI reconstruction in this study. Three MODIS images (h10v04, h10v05, h11v04) were joined with the MODIS Reprojection Tool (MRT) [61,62] to cover Nebraska, and the Land Data Operational Products Evaluation (LDOPE) tool [63] (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/ldope/) was applied to parse and interpret the QA Science Dataset (SDS) layers. The \\u2018unpach_sds_bits\\u2019 tool and the \\u2018cp_proj_param tool\\u2019 of LDOPE were used to decode the MOD09GQ quality control band. The decoded QA band represents that the quality of every pixel in every daily image would be used in a data smoothing procedure to help remove the influence of anomaly data. The reflectance data of the red and NIR bands were used to calculate the NDVI as an indicator of the photosynthetic capacity of the vegetation at the pixel level. The NDVI was calculated using Equation (1): \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc49\\ud835\\udc3c=( \\ud835\\udf0c \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc45 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udf0c \\ud835\\udc45\\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc37 )/( \\ud835\\udf0c \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc45 + \\ud835\\udf0c \\ud835\\udc45\\ud835\\udc38\\ud835\\udc37 ), (1) where \\u03c1NIR (846-876 nm) and \\u03c1RED (620\\u2013670 nm) are the bidirectional surface reflectance for the MODIS bands. 2.1.2. Time Series Smoothing The study area can experience periodic cloud cover throughout the growing season, which seriously affects the quality of the NDVI time series. Considering our purpose is to find vegetation response to climate change in remote sensing time series, which represents anomaly fluctuation in temporal profile, the quality of NDVI time series is a critical issue, since cloud cover could cause a similar anomaly. To reduce the noise of NDVI time-series, the Savitzky-Golay filter [64] was applied for its simplicity and reliability. The Savitzky-Golay filter is a simplified least squares-fit convolution for smoothing and computing derivatives of a set of consecutive values (a spectrum) [64]. It was proven to be the most efficient algorithm for separating distinct multi-temporal profiles, compared with other common smoothing algorithms [65]. Furthermore, it effectively preserve key temporal features, such as the relative maximum, minimum, and width of the time-series dataset [66,67]. To achieve better filtering, data quality control flags, assigning corresponding weights were used to identify spurious observations for the SG filter. Quality control flags were calculated using LDOPE and ArcGIS. The CMD batch program of the LDOPE tool was used to decode the quality information of the red and NIR bands in batches (Table 1), and ArcGIS was used for batch grading synthesis (Table 2) to obtain the quality grade file corresponding to NDVI. Subsequently, the SG filter was applied by setting a window width of four, one envelope iteration, and an adaptation strength of two. Fitting iterations of the SG filter were set to two. The weight of quality level one was one; the weight of quality level two was 0.5, and the weight of quality levels three and four was set as zero to remove the image noise. After the S-G filtering, the noises of quality level three images were completely removed, and the noises of quality level two images were obviously improved. Table 1. Band quality control flag. Table 2. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quality control flag. 2.1.3. Daymet Dataset The meteorological data were downloaded from the ORNL DAAC (https://daymet.ornl.gov/). The Daymet data set provides gridded estimations of weather variable for North America with daily time resolution and 1-km2 spatial resolution [68]. The daily mean temperature dataset (2000\\u20132015) and daily total precipitation dataset (1981\\u20132015) were used in this study, and were first resampled to 250 m by the bilinear interpolation resample method. The daily mean temperature data were processed by temperature anomaly calculation, and the daily total precipitation data were used to acquire the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in Nebraska since 1981. 2.1.4. Cropland Data Layer The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) [69], hosted on CropScape (https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/), provides a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover map at 30-m spatial resolution for the continental United States. The crop distribution map from 2000 to 2015 were resampled to 250 m by the majority resample method, and used to calculate accurate vegetation anomaly. In addition, the crop distribution in 2012 was applied to assess crop-related vegetation response to drought. 2.1.5. Irrigation Data The MODIS Irrigated Agricultural Dataset (MIrAD) [70] provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/USirrigation) was used as the irrigation data source. This data set was derived using a land cover data set, USDA agricultural irrigation area statistics and the annual maximum VI information calculated from MODIS VI data. The MirAD has a nominal spatial resolution of 250 m and irrigation distribution in 2012 was available to analyze the human effect on extreme drought in Nebraska. 2.1.6. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTGTM) provided by NASA (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/) was used as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in this study. The spatial resolution of this product is 30-m and was resampled as identical resolution (250-m) of MODIS by bilinear interpolation resample method. The DEM influences the natural environment of vegetation (local temperature and rainfall event), thus it was applied to analyze the driving force of various vegetation response to drought. 2.2. Methodology The methodological workflow consisted of the following steps (Figure 2): (1) Data preprocessing and NDVI time-series smoothing (see Section 2.1.2); (2) calculation of SPI (precipitation anomaly); (3) calculation of the temperature anomaly; (4) calculation of the vegetation anomaly, which involves the extraction of average phenology NDVI profile, DTW match of NDVI observed time-series and phenology profile, and the anomaly calculation of NDVI on a daily scale; and (5) extraction of vegetation response lag based on lag\\u2019s correlation coefficient. 2.2.1. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) To better capture the spatial patterns and temporal variations of dryness, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) [14] was adopted in this study as the drought index. Compared to other drought indices, the SPI has several advantages, including unambiguous theoretical development, robustness, versatility, including temporal flexibility, and the simplicity of requiring only a precipitation data input [71,72]. SPI has different scales for different application. One-month SPI could reflect the soil condition, which directly influences the vegetation growth. In our study, one-month SPI was applied both for reflecting annual drought events and calculating accurate response lag. To be specific, we first calculate the annual average of one-month SPI in 2000\\u20132015 to select normal climate year and relatively severe drought year for further study. Then, for the severe drought year, in order to better find the accurate temporal scale of vegetation response, we calculates the one-month SPI, but represented it on daily scale with a one day time step, in accordance with daily scale of NDVI time-series. For each day, we calculated the cumulative rainfall for the previous 30 days to calculate a one-month scale SPI (Equation (2)). Finally we computed 30 times the one-month SPI, since there are approximately 30 days in a month. \\ud835\\udc43 \\ud835\\udc60\\ud835\\udc62\\ud835\\udc5a = \\u2211 \\ud835\\udc51=1 30 \\ud835\\udc43 \\ud835\\udc56 (2) where Pi denotes the daily precipitation at day i, d represents the previous d day, and Psum represents a 1-month scale cumulative precipitation at day i. According to the World Meteorological Organization, at least 20\\u201330 year precipitation record should be used to calculate the accurate SPI [73,74]. In this study, a 35-year historical record of precipitation data (1980\\u20132015) were used to assure the SPI accuracy. For a more detailed explanation of the theory and calculation of SPI, one may refer to these related studies [14,75,76]. 2.2.2. Temperature Anomaly The difference between the observed value and the multiyear Gaussian fitting value is used as the index of the temperature anomaly (Equation (3)). The distribution of daily mean temperature in a year is similar to Gaussian distribution; therefore, the normal daily mean temperature could be obtained by Gaussian fitting numerical values (Figure 4a). Gaussian fitting values for characterization of normal daily mean temperature compared to the traditional average characterization method have higher reliability and can effectively eliminate the interference of abnormal climate. Considering that the temperature across two climatic zones in Nebraska has obvious spatial heterogeneity, the Gaussian fitting and the calculation of temperature observation are processed at pixel level. We conducted many tests, and found out that lots of pixels have a small temperature peak in spring, and the double Gaussian model outperformed the single Gaussian model. Thus, a double Gaussian model was used to fit the normal daily mean temperature, because of its better accuracy (Figure 4b). \\ud835\\udc47\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b \\ud835\\udc5c \\ud835\\udc61 = \\ud835\\udc47 \\ud835\\udc61 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc47 \\ud835\\udc61 \\ue0f5 \\ue0f7 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 (3) where t is the day of year (DOY), Tanot is the temperature anomaly at date t, Tt denotes the observed daily mean temperature and \\ud835\\udc47 \\ud835\\udc61 \\ue0f5 \\ue0f7 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 denotes the multi-year gaussian fitting value (normal temperature) at date t.

The points in (a) represent the observed daily mean temperature of current pixel in 2000\\u20132015; (b) represents the fitting error of fitting process in subfigure (a). 2.2.3. Vegetation Anomaly Vegetation anomaly calculations include three steps: (1) Derivation of the phenological NDVI profile of vegetation, (2) dynamic time warping (DTW) of the NDVI time-series and phenological NDVI profile, and (3) vegetation anomaly calculation. The first step in calculating the vegetation anomaly is to calculate the NDVI phenology curve of each vegetation type. Based on temperature anomaly and multi-year SPI in Nebraska, the period from 2008 to 2011 were selected as \\u2018normal\\u2019 climate years without extreme climatic events. Using crop information from the CDL, the phenological NDVI profile of each vegetation type was then obtained by averaging the daily NDVI values for all pixels by vegetation categories. These phenological NDVI curves represent the growth of each vegetation type under mean climate conditions. The second step is the calculation of vegetation anomaly using DTW match algorithm. It is important for reducing the false anomalies caused by the different planting and harvesting periods. DTW is an algorithm that uses dynamic programming to modify time-series data sequences to find the minimum bending distance between two time sequences to achieve sequence matching [77]. DTW has three constraint rules: Monotonicity constraint, endpoint constraint, and continuity constraint. Under these constraint conditions, the bending path is obtained by minimizing the sum of path distance. Note that the direct use of DTW makes any real anomaly disappear, because the small fluctuation of the anomaly on the daily scale would also be weakened by DTW. Therefore, the Gaussian filter was first applied to reconstruct the time-series NDVI data sequence before the DTW was applied to remove small fluctuations. The DTW was then applied to the Gaussian-filtered NDVI curve to obtain the matching date (Figure 5). The original curve is then matched according to the matching date. Finally, vegetation outliers were calculated according to Equation (4): \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc49\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b \\ud835\\udc5c \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 =\\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc49 \\ud835\\udc3c \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc58 \\u2212 \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc49 \\ud835\\udc3c \\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc58 \\ue0f5 \\ue0f7 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 (4) where \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc49\\ud835\\udc3c\\ud835\\udc4e\\ud835\\udc5b \\ud835\\udc5c \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61 is the vegetation anomaly value of pixel i in day t, \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc49 \\ud835\\udc3c \\ud835\\udc56\\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc58 denotes the NDVI of pixel i in day t, k is the crop type of current pixel i, and \\ud835\\udc41\\ud835\\udc37\\ud835\\udc49 \\ud835\\udc3c \\ud835\\udc61\\ud835\\udc58 \\ue0f5 \\ue0f7 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 \\ue0f6 is the normal NDVI value of crop type k in matched day \\ud835\\udc61 . Figure 5. Illustration of DTW matching between Gaussian smoothing observed sequences and phenological profile; the planting days of observed time-series is later than that of the phenological profiles. During the non-growing season period, the fluctuation of the NDVI profile is not a manifestation of crop growth anomalies, but is more likely to be caused by soil, wild grass, and noise of the remote sensing image. Therefore, when the NDVI anomalies were calculated using DTW matching, the planting date and harvesting date were obtained according to the match date of the start and end of the growing season. The NDVI anomalies before and after planting were filled with \\u2018NaN\\u2019 to obtain the final vegetation anomaly data. 2.2.4. Response Lag The lag period is the key to investigating the response of vegetation to climate anomalies. It is also the most challenging and key point in obtaining accurate correlation and function relations in climate-vegetation response comparisons. Due to its simple principles and wide application, the lag correlation coefficient was applied to analyze the data time series and determine the lag period according to the highest correlation coefficient. Considering that the temporal anomaly and precipitation anomaly have different response mechanisms, the vegetation response lag to temperature anomalies and rainfall anomalies were extracted respectively. The response of plants to climate anomalies is characterized by accumulation and hysteresis. In this study, we defined the \\u2018response\\u2019 period and \\u2018lag\\u2019 period. The \\u2018response\\u2019 period refers to the accumulation of climate anomalies that influence vegetation, and the \\u2018lag\\u2019 period represents the lag time of the vegetation response. In this study, response lag was calculated as the sum of the response and lag periods. Temperature anomaly was calculated in daily scale, so we first calculated the sum of temperature anomaly on a different scale (one week\\u2013two months) which represents the \\u2018response\\u2019 period. Then the lag correlation coefficients were computed to get the optimal \\u2018lag\\u2019 period on each \\u2018response\\u2019 scale. Finally, based on the different optimal lag correlation coefficient on different \\u2018response\\u2019 scales, the optimal \\u2018response\\u2019 scale was decided by the maximum correlation coefficients, and response lag was obtained by the sum of \\u2018response\\u2019 period and \\u2018lag\\u2019 period. As for precipitation response, since we calculated SPI on a one-month scale, it was hard to define the \\u2018response\\u2019 period and \\u2018lag\\u2019 period, so the response lag was totally decided by the results of maximum lag correlation coefficient. In order to catch the drought response in climate anomaly year, we shrank the input time-series of lag correlation calculation by setting the climate threshold value (SPI < 1, temperature anomaly > 1) and maintained a certain duration (duration > 50 days). 2.2.5. Random Forest Random forest (RF) [78] is an ensemble learning method of cart trees to analyze nonlinearity and interactions between predictors [79]. The main advantages of RF include significantly reducing possible overfitting [80], and minimizing influence by collinearity among analysis variables [81], but up to now this method is not common in climate and hydrological science. In this paper, RF was used to understand what or how factors contributed to vegetation anomalies. More specifically, it was applied to analyze the relationship between vegetation anomalies and a series of factors (climate anomalies, irrigation, crop type, growth period, DEM and image quality). The RF model was run using the TreeBagger class on matlab2014b at the pixel-level. Two parameters need to be tuned for RF, namely the \\u2019NumTrees\\u2019, which is be created by randomly selecting samples from the training samples, and \\u2019MinLeafLeaf\\u2019, which is the minimum number of observations of per tree leaf. The \\u2018MinLeafLeaf\\u2019 is set up as five according to multiple experiments, and the \\u2018NumTrees\\u2019 parameter was set up as 500 according to the \\u2018out-of-bag squared error,\\u2019 and the out-of-bag error of our model eventually reached below 0.0015, which means a high accuracy and good generalization. The importance for each predictor variable (feature) was also analyzed in our study. The factor importance index is the increase in prediction error if the values of that variable are permuted across the out-of-bag observations. This measure is computed for every tree, then averaged over the entire ensemble and divided by the standard deviation over the entire ensemble. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Spatial-temporal Pattern of Drought Spatial and temporal patterns of drought are useful for revealing the occurrence patterns of climatic and vegetation anomalies in the study area. The consistency of spatial and temporal patterns of climatic and vegetation anomalies is very important in investigating the correlation between climatic-vegetation interactions over the study area. Figure 6 shows the spatial pattern of temperature anomalies from 2000 to 2015 in Nebraska. In 2012, Nebraska had extremely high temperature across the whole state, and in 2005, 2006 and 2015, heat waves also swept through Nebraska. Abnormally high temperatures generally occurred uniformly in spatial pattern. During the periods of 2008 to 2011 and 2013 to 2014, the temperature was relatively cool for the state. Figure 6. Spatial distribution of temperature anomalies from 2000 to 2015. Annual averaged one-month SPI is more conducive to the demonstration of precipitation anomalies that influence vegetation. Based on the spatial-temporal pattern of annual averaged SPI, as shown in Figure 7, it can be clearly seen that severe drought events impacted the entire state of Nebraska in 2002 and 2012, which was consistent with the findings of the U.S. Drought Service\\u2019s seven-day drought observation with the USDM Index (Figure 8). USDM is based on six key indicators (Palmer Drought Index, SPI, Keetch-Byram Drought Index, modeled soil moisture, seven-day average streamflow, and precipitation anomalies), numerous supplementary indicators, and local reports from many expert observers (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) [82]. However, the duration and severity of drought detected by SPI1 and USDM showed a different pattern. The 2002\\u20132003 and 2012\\u20132013 were detected by USDM as severe drought events, but as for one-month SPI, only 2002 and 2012 were severe years, at which times droughts were detected earlier than USDM. Considering vegetation is first influenced by meteorological drought, SPIs were more suitable than USDMs for vegetation drought monitoring. In our results, Nebraska experienced widespread mild droughts in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2014. Compared with temperature anomalies, the spatial pattern of rainfall anomalies has a higher degree of fragmentation and spatial heterogeneity due to several factors (e.g., the atmospheric circulation, and the morphology of the territory). The occurrence of rainfall anomalies does not show an obvious drought-prone spatial sub-region: In 2000, a separate humid region appeared in the northwest corner of Nebraska, but in 2007, this region was drier than other area in Nebraska. Similarly, the drought in 2003 occurred in the central part of Nebraska, but the drought in 2010 mainly occurred in northwestern Nebraska, and in 2014, drought hit southeastern Nebraska. The occurrence of scarce rainfall has extremely complex spatial rules, and it is dependent on local spatial effects, which is difficult to include in the module. Therefore, precipitation anomalies are difficult to spatially predict. Figure 7. Spatial distribution of precipitation anomalies from 2000 to 2015. Extreme droughts were defined as SPI < 2; severe droughts were defined as SPI < 1.5; moderate drought was defined as SPI < 1; mild droughts were defined as SPI < 0; and SPI > 0 means no drought. Figure 8. Seven-day drought observation from U.S. Drought Service. The drought conditions in the USDM are classified into four major drought categories, including moderate drought (D1), severe drought (D2), extreme drought (D3), and exceptional drought (D4), from the least intense to the most intense. The fifth category, D0, depicts \\u2018\\u2018abnormally dry\\u2019\\u2019 conditions. Discernible significant positive coherence can be observed when comparing temperature (Figure 6) and precipitation (Figure 7) anomalies. Higher temperatures occurred frequently with scarce precipitation. Notably, this correlation is more pronounced under extreme weather conditions than for normal climate anomalies. For example, in 2002 and 2012, both severe temperature anomalies and scarce precipitation occurred throughout Nebraska. However, in 2003 and 2014, dryness was not associated with high temperature, and in 2005 and 2015, higher temperature was not associated with dryness. 3.2. Driving Force Analysis The random forest method helped us to understand the contributors of vegetation anomalies among many factors (climate, irrigation, crop type, growth period, DEM, and image quality). Figure 9 presents the factor ranking results. One-month SPI were most important factor to vegetation response, and crop type also decided the response lag. The daily temperature anomaly shows a relatively low influence on vegetation stress. Some studies have found the benefit of daily higher temperatures; however, heat waves (temperature above normal lasting from a few days to a few weeks) could damage vegetation [28,83]. Irrigation in many cropping systems of central and western Nebraska mitigates the effects of precipitation deficits by maintaining adequate soil moisture conditions through water application, unless under the most extreme of drought conditions, when irrigated crops are affected. The growth period also affects the extent of climatic influence on vegetation. DEM, image quality, and daily climate conditions are not important for vegetation condition responses in this study. Figure 9. Factor Importance Index on vegetation anomalies. 3.3. Spatial-temporal Pattern of Response Lag In the analysis of the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of climatic and vegetation anomalies, it was found that the spatial-temporal scale of vegetation response was not consistent with that of temperature anomalies and rainfall anomalies, and the lag response relationship was not consistent. Therefore, the vegetation response lag to temperature anomalies and rainfall anomalies should be extracted separately. Spatial-temporal patterns of response lag are useful for revealing the cumulative effect of climate anomalies on vegetation conditions. In this study, the cumulative temperature anomaly was found to have a low correlation with vegetation anomalies using the lag correlation coefficient, and no stable, specific lag period was found to have a high correlation with vegetation anomalies. The influence of high temperatures on vegetation is often a bi-directional, complex non-linear relationship. On one hand, an appropriately timed, high temperature can lead to increased photosynthesis and better conditions for vegetation, particularly during parts of the growing season where the energy environment is key to vegetation growth (e.g., spring green-up of the vegetated phase of plant growth). However, heat waves can cause stress, and damage vegetation (e.g., during reproductive phase of crops). This nonlinear relationship is difficult to characterize with a function, especially for the correlation of high temporal resolution time series like the NDVI profiles used in this study. In addition, there is a possibility that daily maximum temperature could have a better correlation with vegetation anomaly. Also, the single-Gaussian fitting of normal temperature using a more than 30-year time-series may improve the lag correlation results. The response lag of vegetation to the one-month SPI is shown in Figure 10. The lag period of drought ranged from two weeks to one and a half months; most lag periods were approximately 30\\u201345 days. Under normal or wet climate conditions, vegetation did not perform an obvious response behavior, but its response along an accumulated rainfall deficit that follows a normal period was slower due to the water availability in the soil. During the two extreme drought anomaly years (2002 and 2012), vegetation responded rapidly to the deficit of accumulated rainfall. In 2013, the influence of the precipitation anomaly only covered the northwestern part of Nebraska; however, the SPI12 index (Figure 5) is normal in this region, which means that the response lag and the vegetation\\u2019s condition were not only decided by the water shortage, high temperatures, and plant diseases may have accelerated vegetation response. Grassland is the predominant cover type in northwestern Nebraska, which indicates a stronger response of grassland compared to that of cropland, even when cropland is facing more severe drought conditions. A possible explanation is that crops of eastern part are irrigated (corn, in particular, is a crop with high water requirement) compared with wild grass. For this reason, yearly irrigation scheduling should be considered in order to compare different behaviors, especially during drier seasons. Figure 10. Spatial distribution of response lag to precipitation anomalies from 2000 to 2015. In 2006, apart from grassland, there was a unique severe response region in the southwestern part of Nebraska. This area was largely planted with winter wheat, and the 2006 drought conditions occurred only in winter and spring of that year. Given that the primary growing season for winter wheat is spring and early summer with a mid-summer harvest period, the early-year drought conditions during the late winter and early spring of 2016 greatly reduced soil moisture conditions to support winter wheat production, resulting in widespread drought stress in wheat over this region. Therefore, vegetation damage and response lag were also determined by the time (season). However, under the extreme climate conditions (2002 and 2012), the response lag pattern was consistent with the SPI12 distribution; other reasons for this influence seem to be implied. As seen from the spatial pattern in the Figure 7, the vegetation with a relatively fast response to precipitation deficit in the dry period is mainly concentrated in western Nebraska, which is less affected by human activities (irrigation, water conservation projects) and where the vegetation type is mainly grassland. This shows that human activities can mitigate some effects of climate stress, especially drought-induced water stress, on crops. The results in this section show that the length of the lag period is related to the severity of climate anomalies to some extent. When severe precipitation deficits occur, vegetation in general has a shorter lag period for climate response, but the lag period of response is usually no less than two weeks, which may be due to the accumulated soil moisture and the protective stress mechanisms of vegetation. Besides, the results also implied the possibility to use an SPI1 with a moving window of one week instead of one day. 3.4. Crop Response Lag Frequency distribution of response lag by vegetation categories can further characterize the diversity of vegetation response to climate. To better reveal the response lag of different vegetation types to climatic anomalies, we chose the most severe drought year (2012) for further analysis. A total of 1000 random pixels were selected for six main vegetation cover types according to the coverage area size that included: Grass, soybeans, winter wheat, corn, deciduous forest, and alfalfa. In order to reflect the real situation, random pixels were limited and adjusted according to the geographical location and satellite quality; the low quality of pixels in the remote sensing image is removed based on QA band. As Figure 11 demonstrates, among all vegetation types, the response lag of grassland is the shortest, distributed mostly around 30 days and rarely exceeding 35 days. Considering its location in the western region of Nebraska where human activity is limited, grassland may suffer more serious effects from water deficit stress than the other crop-related vegetation types. Deciduous forest had the longest response lag of all vegetation types of up to 48 days, which means that when the deciduous forest faces an extreme climate, its own stress responses and adaptability make it less influenced by climate anomalies. Trees have a longer response lag to prolonged drought because of their deep root system. Figure 11. Response lag frequency histogram of major vegetation types. For crops, the lag period of winter wheat had a large lag response range, spanning from 20 to 55 days. The growth period of winter wheat is different than the other summer crops, with the late winter and spring conditions being critical to winter wheat growth and production. In 2012, drought conditions in winter were gradually mitigated, with the greatest moisture deficits occurring mainly in the central region of Nebraska, and parts of south also suffered drought. However, winter wheat is widely distributed, covering the northwest, southwest and south. The special growing period and wide planting range of winter wheat make it face various degrees of drought in different periods, so its response time is also longer and more dispersed. Soybeans, corn, and alfalfa are mainly distributed in the eastern part of the state under rainfed conditions, with irrigation being required for their production in central and western Nebraska. They faced similar degrees of drought and had a similar response lag distribution. The lag period (38-day peak) of soybeans was slightly shorter than that of corn and alfalfa (42-day peak). This may indicate that the soybean is more sensitive to climatic anomalies, reflecting them more quickly, so it can be used as an indicator crop of earlier stage drought stress in major crops. 4. Conclusions Understanding the spatial-temporal response of vegetation to climate change is very important for water resource management, crop drought warning, and disaster relief. Based on the long-term Daymet data set and MODIS NDVI time-series images, this study investigated the spatial-temporal patterns of vegetation anomalies and climatic anomalies, as well as the response lag during the 2000 to 2015 study period over the state of Nebraska. The SPI was used to obtain the precipitation anomaly, and a Gaussian function was applied to obtain the temperature anomaly. DTW was the main technique used to acquire vegetation anomaly information from the time-series NDVI data. A multi-layer correlation analysis was then applied to obtain the response lag of vegetation to climatic conditions. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: Based on annual averaged SPI12 and temperature anomalies, 2002 and 2012 were found to have the most severe drought events throughout Nebraska. In 2005, 2006 and 2015, high temperature anomalies hit most of Nebraska; and reduced precipitation occurred in different regions of Nebraska in 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2014 causing more localized, regional drought events. Based on SPI1 and vegetation anomalies calculated by DTW, no significant hysteresis correlation was found between temperature anomalies and vegetation anomalies in this study, but precipitation anomalies and vegetation anomalies have a temporal lag correlation relationship. The response lag of vegetation to the SPI ranged from two weeks to one and a half months, with most response lags being between 30 and 45 days. When faced with severe drought events, grasslands had the shortest time response (35 days). In contrast, forests were slower to respond to severe drought (48 days). The response lag of winter wheat varies across Nebraska, ranging from 35 to 45 days. Soybeans, corn and alfalfa had similar response lag patterns of approximately 40 days. The random forest revealed the reasons for the different vegetation response resulted from a combination of precipitation anomalies, vegetation types, high temperatures, and irrigation. The results of this study serve as a scientific basis for better understanding climate-vegetation response interactions for supporting policy designation of water resources management and agricultural planning to reduce the impact of drought on agricultural production and ecosystems in semiarid regions. Based on the climate and vegetation-related anomaly information, localized regional trends in drying and heat, as well as the characteristics of drought conditions, can provide policymakers with early warning of potential extreme climatic events. The lag response of different crops can provide guidance for actual agricultural management actions and for drought mitigation and rational allocation of water resources. A real-time drought prediction can be made in the lag period to predict the degree of impact of drought on crop, so that an early warning about emerging drought conditions and their potential impact on agricultural production can be issued. Further studies are desired, to investigate the vegetation response to drought under different conditions (human activities, geospatial environment).

Spectral data and derived indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been used for hydrological monitoring of large wetlands. However, comparable studies for small wetlands (<25 km2) are lacking. Our aims are to examine whether MODIS-derived indices at 500-m spatial resolution can perform this task for small wetlands, and to compare the performance of various indices. First we evaluated if water levels are a good indicator for wetland inundation extent. A high correlation between water level and Landsat-derived inundation extent was found (R 2\\u2009=\\u20090.957). Secondly, we compared 10 years of water level fluctuations with seven spectral indices at a 16-day interval. The Tasseled Cap brightness index (TCBI) had the highest correlation with water level for the complete time series including dry and wet years. Thirdly, we analyzed how these indices behave for areas with different inundation characteristics. Again TCBI showed a consistently accurate performance, which was independent of inundation frequency. We therefore conclude that TCBI is the best-suited index for monitoring of hydrological variability in small seasonally-flooded wetlands such as the Fuente de Piedra lake in southern Spain. We recommend testing this index further for other seasonally-flooded wetlands in semi-arid areas.

Forty-five percent of the Ramsar-listed seasonally-flooded inland wetlands are found in these climate zones. They undergo periodic cycles of inundation and drought, primarily in response to variability in precipitation and evapotranspiration (Ruiz 2008). In arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean environments, about 30 % of Ramsar-listed seasonal wetlands are small-sized, measuring between 10 and 2500 ha. Despite their small size, they often act as critical refuge and breeding areas, offer food sources for wildlife, and harbor many plant and animal species that would otherwise not survive in the surrounding landscape (Gibbs 1993; Semlitsch and Bodie 1998; Roshier et al. 2002; Zacharias et al. 2007; Sim et al. 2013). There is concern that seasonal wetlands are often neglected due to their ephemeral character and small size. The abundance and quality of seasonal wetlands around the world is declining rapidly due to global climate change, expansion of agricultural land and irrigation schemes (Roshier et al. 2001; Casta\\u00f1eda and Herrero 2008; Zacharias and Zamparas 2010). Although the European Union (Habitats Directive 1992) and the Ramsar Convention (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands 2002) include seasonal wetlands in their conservation plans, only a subset of them are considered. The lack of knowledge about the changes in wetland extent of these aquatic systems makes conservation a difficult task for resource managers. Hence, an urgent need exists at national and international levels to report and monitor changes in wetland extent and conditions for large areas, using cost-effective tools, and including the important small-sized wetlands. Hydrological dynamic processes, mainly expressed by spatial and temporal variation in inundation status, are important determinants of the formation and maintenance of a seasonally flooded wetland. Hydrological modifications may strongly affect ecosystem functioning and normally result in shifting species distributions and composition (Koning 2005; Robledano et al. 2010), especially for species that are sensitive to hydroperiod variability (Roshier et al. 2002; Baldwin et al. 2006). It may also affect other ecosystem functions including ground water recharge and nutrient cycling (Leibowitz 2003). Therefore, it is important to monitor the wetland inundation dynamics for water management, ecosystem assessment and biodiversity conservation. In situ water level gauges are a main data source for understanding hydrological dynamics and essential for quantifying temporal patterns of water fluctuation with good temporal resolution (Alsdorf et al. 2007). Gauge stations are typically located on large rivers, lakes and canals, but less frequently in seasonally flooded areas. Due to the inaccessibility of certain regions or financial and operational constraints, globally many wetlands lack gauge stations resulting in a limited knowledge and understanding of their hydrological conditions (Alsdorf et al. 2003). While gauge measurements provide key data on the wetland hydrology, they may offer little information about spatial patterns of hydrologically-relevant variables like inundation status (Alsdorf et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2014). Remote sensing provides temporally and spatially continuous synoptic observation of ecosystem processes, and these observations may allow for monitoring of spatio-temporal hydrological variability for large areas in a repeatable and cost effective manner (Smith 1997). Two types of remote sensing instruments are suitable for monitoring wetland hydrology at local and regional scales, i.e. microwave and optical sensors. The microwave technique of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide imagery under all weather conditions and thus has been used for monitoring spatial and temporal patterns of flood inundation (e.g. Richards et al. 1987; Townsend 2001; Bourgeau-Chavez et al. 2005; Wdowinski et al. 2008; Marti-Cardona et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2014). A main disadvantage of SAR is that the resulting backscattered signal is a complex combination of effects that depend on incidence angle, vegetation density and orientation, relative water height and wind effects. This could cause opposite backscatter responses for similar conditions, and the effective disentangling of such effects requires additional information (Smith 1997; O\\u2019Grady and Leblanc 2014). Radar (or laser) altimeters can monitor water heights in reservoirs and lakes with a higher temporal resolution, but may miss many water bodies due to the spacing between the satellite orbits (Alsdorf et al. 2007). Optical remote sensors, such as those onboard Landsat and SPOT, have been used frequently for small wetlands monitoring. For example, Herrero and Castaneda (2009) used a series of 52 Landsat images to monitor the flooding surface of small saline wetlands in northeast Spain over the past 20 years. While providing accurate spatial information about flood extent, these sensors do not yet allow frequent and continuous monitoring over large regions that suffer from persistent cloud cover. In comparison, the relatively coarse spatial resolution (>100 m) imagery derived from satellite sensors such as AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) provides more consistent and frequent observations over long time-spans, making such imagery potentially well-suited for spatio-temporal analysis of wetland hydrology. An often-used approach to study temporal changes from coarse-resolution optical sensors is to summarize their spectral information in multispectral indices and consequently study the spatio-temporal variation of these indices. The best-known multi-spectral index is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Tucker 1979) that combines spectral reflectance measurements from red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The NDVI provides a measure of the photosynthetic activity of the green vegetation and NDVI time series have been used extensively for monitoring vegetation dynamics (Pettorelli et al. 2005; Beck et al. 2006; Vrieling et al. 2011, 2013; Petus et al. 2013). It has also been used for water/land delineation (Chipman and Lillesand 2007; Borro et al. 2014) as water strongly absorbs light in the NIR spectral region (causing low reflectance) while much less absorption occurs over land surfaces. Other indices have been specifically developed for detecting and monitoring surface wetness (e.g. Gao 1996; McFeeters 1996; Xiao et al. 2002a; Xu 2006). These mostly combine shortwave infrared (SWIR) or near infrared (NIR) bands, i.e. the spectral domain containing specific physical water absorption features, and visible (VIS) spectral regions. In general, NIR-SWIR indices are mainly proposed for vegetation water content detection while VIS-NIR (SWIR) combinations are almost all proposed for the detection of open water. Several studies have explored coarse spatial resolution data for monitoring flood duration, timing and frequency of ephemeral wetlands (Xiao et al. 2005; Guerschman et al. 2011; Feng et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2014; Tornos et al. 2015). Most of these studies used MODIS data to monitor flood extent by differentiating inundated/non-inundated or mixed pixels. Until present, there have been few attempts to link water level changes to temporal patterns of spectral indices. One exception is Ordoyne and Friedl (2008) who demonstrated the utility of multi-temporal MODIS data for characterizing the hydrologic regime of the Everglades in South Florida, USA. However, all MODIS studies focused on relative large wetlands covering at least 50 km2. Whether MODIS and its derived spectral indices are suitable to describe and monitor variations in water level for small (<25 km2) seasonal wetlands has not yet been tested. This paper aims to explore the potential of MODIS-derived spectral indices for characterizing the temporal variability in the hydrology of small shallow wetlands. Specifically, the objectives are (1) to investigate if water level is a good proxy of wetland hydrological variability by establishing a relationship between water level variation and inundated area for a small (~14 km2) wetland in southern Spain; (2) to evaluate if time series of MODIS-derived spectral indices can effectively capture the hydrological variability of this wetland in relation to the water-level data; and (3) to explain how varying inundation characteristics within the wetland affect the temporal behavior of these indices. Study Area The study was carried out in Fuente de Piedra lake (36\\u00b006\\u2032 N, 4\\u00b045\\u2032 W), a shallow and saline (athalassohaline) lake and associated marshland with an area of 1364 ha. It occupies the center of a topographically endorheic basin with a catchment area of about 150 km2 in southern Spain, situated between the Guadalquivir watershed and the Guadalhorce watershed (Heredia et al. 2010) (see Fig. 1). The study site is one of the most important breeding sites for the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) in the Mediterranean region, second only to the Camargue, France (Geraci et al. 2012). Its natural values were recognized and listed as a Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar) and Special Protection Area for Birds (SPA). It is designated by the environmental council of the Andalusian regional government as a Nature Reserve, and therefore it is a protected site. Fig. 1 Location of the study area. a Color composite image displaying bands 7, 4, 2 as RGB (Landsat 7 ETM+ on May 2, 2000); b map of Spain showing the location of Fuente de Piedra; c, d and e photos (June 2014) showing exposed soil, salt-resistant vegetation and marshland surrounding the lake. The approximate location of the photos is shown in Full size image The wetland is fed by five small rivers, rainfall, and highly mineralized ground water (Kohfahl et al. 2008). Evaporation from the lake surface constitutes the main water output. It has a maximum depth of approximately 70 cm during the 10-year study period and experiences both seasonal and interannual variations of water level and inundation extent that are predominantly linked to variability in precipitation and evaporation. The mean annual rainfall is 460 mm and mean annual evaporation is approximately 1600 mm. Usually the lake is flooded in autumn (September\\u2013October), has its highest water levels during spring (February\\u2013March), and dries up partially or completely around June and July (Garc\\u00eda and Niell 1993; Kohfahl et al. 2008). During these summer months the excess evaporation causes salt to deposit on the soil (see Fig. 1c). Different vegetation communities are found within and outside the wetland system. Dense vegetation containing reeds, saltmarshes and tamarisks (see Fig. 1e) are present in channels feeding into the lake, and form a natural purification buffer of runoff water entering the lake. On small elevated dikes and islets inside the lake, drought- and saline-tolerant vegetation (e.g. Sarcocornia, Suaeda and Arthrocnemun) is present (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Enviroment 2013) (see Fig. 1d). In drier years with low water levels, surface water does not reach this vegetation, but during wet years it may be partially inundated (Wang 2008). Planktonic and submerged macrophytes are generally negligible except for extremely wet years such as 1990 and 1998 (Garc\\u00eda et al. 1997; Conde-\\u00c1lvarez et al. 2012). During the period considered in this study (2000\\u20132009) when annual precipitation levels were low, no significant development of aquatic vegetation was observed, which can partly be attributed to the efforts to purify the wastewater from nearby towns (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment 2013). Surrounding the wetland area, olive trees and wheat are cultivated. While this is predominantly rainfed agriculture, groundwater extraction from wells is sometimes used as supplementary irrigation. Data Water Level Data The Fuente de Piedra lake water level data have been collected since 1983 using a limnograph. This mechanical recorder draws the curve of water level fluctuations on a paper by registering the movements of a flute floating in a well which connects with the lakebed. The daily mean values of the water level are subsequently calculated and stored in a database. The instrument measures the water surface height from the bottom of the lake (i.e. the 0-cm water level indicates that the lake is dry, even though values below 0 representing groundwater levels are recorded as the well is deeper than the lake). In this study, a 10-year daily mean water level dataset between 2000 and 2009 was obtained from Consejer\\u00eda de Medio Ambiente, Natural Reserve of Fuente de Piedra (Junta de Andaluc\\u00eda). Remote Sensing Imagery and Pre-Processing We used 78 Landsat TM/ETM+ images of Path/Row 201/34, acquired through the Global Visualization Viewer (GLOVIS; http://glovis.usgs.gov/) of the United States Geological Survey. The TM sensor has a spatial resolution of 30 m for the six reflective bands and 120 m for the thermal band. Landsat ETM+ images consist of eight spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m for bands 1 to 5 and band 7. Resolution for band 6 (thermal infrared) is 60 m and resolution for band 8 (panchromatic) is 15 m. In our study, we used the 30-m visible and near-infrared bands of TM and ETM+. All images are radiometrically- and terrain-corrected products (L1T) and have a scene quality score of 9, which means perfect scenes with no errors detected. Table 1 summarizes all the Landsat TM/ETM+ dataset used in this study and corresponds to all cloud free images available for the study area from 2000 to 2009 (10 years). In the case of Landsat 7 ETM +, images acquired after May 2003 have wedge-shaped gaps of missing data on both sides of each scene as Scan Line Corrector (SLC) was damaged. However, as our study area is in the scene center, no gaps occurred over the area. We transformed the raw digital numbers (DN) contained in the images to top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance according to the Landsat 7 Science Data Users Handbook (Irish 2000). Table 1 Number of Landsat images available per year (2000\\u20132009) and month that are cloud-free over the study area, and consequently used in this study Full size table The MODIS sensor has 36 spectral bands of which seven are specifically designed for studying the land surface, i.e.: blue (459\\u2013479 nm), green (545\\u2013565 nm), red (620\\u2013670 nm), near infrared (841\\u2013876 nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR1: 1230\\u20131250 nm, SWIR2: 1628\\u20131652 nm, SWIR3: 2105\\u20132155 nm). The MODIS Land Science Team provides a suite of standard MODIS data products to the users, including the Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) 16-day composite product (MCD43A4). This product provides 500-m resolution reflectance data for each of the MODIS bands (1\\u20137) adjusted using a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to model the values as if they were taken from nadir view (Schaaf et al. 2002). The product thus removes view angle effects, and in addition masks cloud cover and reduces atmospheric contamination. For this study MCD43A4 composites were used to evaluate if coarse-resolution index time series can capture the hydrological variability of the Fuente de Piedra lake. We used all 16-day composites between 2000 and 2009, resulting in 227 images. Methods Evaluating Water Level as a Proxy for Inundated Area To evaluate if water level gauge measurements provide a good proxy for inundated area and thus allow to effectively describe the wetland\\u2019s hydrological conditions, we used the Landsat scenes to set a high-resolution baseline. To discriminate water from non-water we used the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) developed by McFeeters (1996). It has been widely used as an index for surface water detection (Bai et al. 2011; Rokni et al. 2014). We acknowledge that NDWI may not be the most effective for inundation detection in case of dominant floating vegetation or submerged vegetation (Rodriguez et al. 2014), but this was not the case for the wetland considered here (Study Area section). The NDWI ranges from \\u22121 to 1, with values above 0 generally representing water bodies. However the threshold values applied to separate water from land may vary significantly from one scene to the next due to aerosol interference and variable solar/viewing geometry (Ji et al. 2009; Feng et al. 2012). Therefore we established threshold values for each individual NDWI image using the Otsu thresholding algorithm. The algorithm assumes that the image contains two classes of pixels following a bi-modal histogram (foreground pixels and background pixels). It then calculates the optimum threshold separating the two classes that minimizes the weighted within-class variance (Otsu 1979). The inundated area derived from each of the 78 Landsat scenes was linked to the corresponding water levels. We fitted a second-order polynomial regression through the data to describe the inundation status in relation to water level variation. When the recorded water level is 0 cm, the lake is dry, i.e. the inundated area is 0 km2. Therefore, the regression analysis is only performed for those dates when the recorded water level was above 0 cm. In addition, we calculated the per-pixel water occurrence frequency (WOF) by evaluating for each pixel the ratio between the number of images for which the pixel was inundated and the total number of images (i.e., 78). Based on this, we classified the wetland areas into five classes: never inundated (WOF\\u2009=\\u20090), seldom inundated (0\\u2009<\\u2009WOF\\u2009\\u2264\\u20090.15), occasionally inundated (0.15\\u2009<\\u2009WOF\\u2009\\u2264\\u20090.3), sometimes inundated (0.3\\u2009<\\u2009WOF\\u2009\\u2264\\u20090.45) and often inundated (0.45\\u2009<\\u2009WOF\\u2009\\u2264\\u20090.6). MODIS-Derived Spectral Indices A range of spectral indices have been proposed to perform surface wetness detection from multi-spectral imagery in different contexts. These all follow the same logic as the NDVI (Tucker 1979), i.e. a difference between two spectral bands divided by the sum of the two. McFeeters (1996) introduced the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to delineate open water features using the green and near-infrared (NIR) band. Xu (2006) found that NDWI often does not distinguish between water areas and built-up land, and proposed the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) by substituting the SWIR band for the NIR band. Several spectral indices combining the NIR and SWIR bands have been proposed using different portions of the SWIR region (Ji et al. 2011). These include the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI, Gao 1996) (referred as LSWIB5 in this paper) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI, Xiao et al. 2002b) (referred as LSWIB6 in this paper) which use the SWIR-band centered at 1.24 and 1.64 \\u03bcm, respectively. The combined NIR/SWIR indices are sensitive to leaf water and soil moisture and for this reason widely adopted for studying vegetation phenology, vegetation change and seasonal inundation (Xiao et al. 2005, 2006; Ordoyne and Friedl 2008; Yan et al. 2010; Campos et al. 2012; Davranche et al. 2013). Table 2 summarizes the five most common band-ratio indices adopted for water detection (including open water, vegetation water content, and soil moisture). Table 2 List of spectral indices tested in this study Full size table Except for spectral band-ratio indices using two multispectral bands, there are also approaches synthesizing information contained in multiple bands. The tasseled cap transformation, first suggested by Kauth and Thomas (1976) for Landsat MSS, is a useful tool for compressing spectral data into a few bands that can be directly associated with the physical parameters of the land surface (Crist and Cicone 1984; Crist 1985). The first three components of the Tasseled Cap transformation are brightness, greenness and wetness. Brightness, hereinafter referred to as \\u201cTasseled Cap Brightness Index (TCBI)\\u201d, is a weighted sum of all six bands and correlated to texture and moisture content of soils (Crist et al. 1986). Greenness is a contrast between near-infrared and visible reflectance, and is thus a measure of the presence and density of green vegetation. Wetness, hereinafter referred to as \\u201cTasseled Cap Wetness Index (TCWI)\\u201d, contrasts the sum of the visible/ near infrared with the shortwave infrared bands, providing a measure of soil moisture tension (Crist et al. 1986; Jian et al. 2012) and plant moisture (Cohen 1991; Jin and Sader 2005; Toomey and Vierling 2005). The coefficients of TCBI and TCWI proposed by Zhang et al. (2002) were used for MODIS data (Table 3). Table 3 Tasseled Cap coefficients for MODIS NBAR (source: (Zhang et al. 2002)) Full size table For each 16-day MCD43A4 composite, we calculated all the spectral indices that are designed to be correlated to surface wetness. Because the resulting MODIS-derived time-series of LSWIB5 and LSWIB6 showed a strong similarity, we only present LSWIB6 results in this paper. Evaluation of MODIS-Derived Spectral Indices for Monitoring Hydrological Variability For each 16-day time step and spectral index we calculated the mean value of the MODIS pixels contained within the lake. Only pixels whose centers were inside the lake boundary were included. The temporal patterns of average MODIS indices for the entire lake were then analyzed. This resulted in a single average 10-year time series from 2000 to 2009 for the lake for each spectral index with a 16-day temporal resolution. To analyze which index most accurately describes the temporal hydrological variability, we averaged the water level data to 16-day periods corresponding to the MODIS composite period. Pearson\\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated between each water index series and the corresponding water level data. Besides the lake-average indices, we also performed correlation analysis between water level and index time series for single MODIS pixels. For this analysis we included pixels within 1 km outside the lake as the surrounding vegetation may also reflect the hydrology condition in the lake. In an attempt to group areas of similar behavior, we converted the Landsat-derived inundation frequency map to vector layers. From these layers we calculated the spatial mean index values of the MODIS pixels contained within each inundation occurrence zone and within the 1 km buffer area, and then related these to water level data. In addition, we calculated the dynamic range for each index time series (defined here as the absolute difference between the 5th and 95th percentile of all index values) to examine which spectral index responds most strongly to the hydrological fluctuations. To better understand how the behavior of each spectral index within an inundation zone relates to the spectral properties, we also calculated the spatial mean reflectance for each MODIS band and each inundation class for several different water levels ranging from \\u221230 to 62 cm. Results and Discussion Relationship Between Water Level and Inundated Area Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the changes in inundated area as a function of water level. The data are most accurately fitted with a second order polynomial that indicates a strong positive relationship (R 2\\u2009=\\u20090.957) between water level and inundated area. Similar high correlations using a second order polynomial were also achieved by Sippel et al. (1998) and Jung et al. (2011), but other mathematical relationships are also found between the two parameters, including a linear function (Liu et al. 1983), a power function (Hayashi and van der Kamp 2000), and an exponential function (Mahe et al. 2011, 2013). The type of relationship is largely dependent on the lake bathymetry (Alsdorf et al. 2007; Medina et al. 2010) or river morphology (Smith 1997). Other effects also play a role. For example wind effects (Wang 2008) may explain the range of inundated area between 4.0 and 6.5 km2 around the water level of 22 cm (Fig. 3). Despite the scattering around the regression line, Fig. 3 shows a strong relationship between water level and inundation area. Consequently water level data can be used in this study as a proxy for the important hydrological fluctuations occurring in the wetland. Fig. 2 Inundation maps derived from multi-temporal Landsat imagery corresponding to different water levels and corresponding date Full size image Fig. 3 Relationship between measured water level and Landsat-derived inundation areas. A second order polynomial was fitted to the data Full size image Figure 4 presents the inundation frequency map obtained from the number of times each pixel was inundated in the 78 Landsat images. Central regions (shown in blue) experience variable water depths during the wet season. Never inundated regions (shown in white) occur in the southwest and north. The southwest areas are known as \\u201cCanchones del Suroeste\\u201d, which are unique natural islets in the lake providing good nesting areas for flamingos only in years with very high water levels when foxes and other predators cannot reach these islets (Rend\\u00f3n-Martos 1996). These areas are mudflats and partly covered by drought- and salt-resistant vegetation (e.g. Sarcocornia, Suaeda and Arthrocnemun) (Fig. 1d). The northern fringe of the lake is covered by dense vegetation which is a combination of marsh vegetation mixed with reeds, rushes and tamarisks (Fig. 1e). Fig. 4 Inundation frequency classes map obtained from the number of Landsat images between 2000 and 2009 that showed inundation. WOF stands for water occurrence frequency Full size image MODIS-Derived Indices vs. Water Level Figure 5 presents a visual comparison of the multi-temporal profiles of six spectral indices throughout a 10 year period (2000\\u20132009) in conjunction with water level. During the 10 years of study, the water level of the lake has varied substantially, both within and between years. All hydrological cycles have a filling phase of strong water level increase during September to November. Water levels remain relatively high until spring (February\\u2013March). This is followed by a drying period with dropping water levels, resulting in a complete dry up of the lake around June\\u2013July. Based on the inter-annual variations in lake water levels, two categories of hydrological years can be identified: relatively wet years (2000 to 2004 and 2009) and relatively dry years (2005 to 2008). During wet years, the lake water levels start rising from late September to mid-October. Throughout the wet years, water depths are higher than the multi-annual average and water persists on the surface for longer periods (Mid-October to late June). Dry years are characterized by longer dry seasons which can start as early as May and end in October. Fig. 5 Comparison between spectral index time series from MODIS and water level data. The solid red line represents in-situ water level measurements; the blue points represent spatial mean MODIS index values of the Fuente de Piedra lake for each MODIS composite; the purple dashed line represents the multi-annual average water level fluctuation; the black dashed line indicates the 0 cm water depth (no open water in the lake) Full size image Visual inspection of the temporal graph (Fig. 5) indicates a relatively stronger correspondence between water level and MNDWI, TCBI and TCWI. All the indices except TCBI were positively related to the water level data. The TCBI values exhibited a smooth, regular seasonal annual pattern with a higher variability in index values. The TCWI and MNDWI curves also showed clear seasonal patterns but with more noise. During the 10-year study period, the TCWI and MNDWI values were mostly below 0, with a smaller dynamic range of TCWI than that of MNDWI. The other indices showed a more random pattern. One exception is that LSWIB6 closely follows the water level fluctuation during dry years (2005\\u20132008). Table 4 shows the Pearson\\u2019s correlation coefficients between each water index and the corresponding water level data. There was a strong negative correlation between TCBI and water level time series, which is consistent with the findings by Ordoyne and Friedl (2008) for the Florida Everglades. TCBI is a linear combination of all spectral bands with positive coefficients (Table 3); the higher the overall reflection of the ground surface across the spectrum, the higher the TCBI. Because water is a strong absorber of radiation across the visible and infrared portion of the spectrum, a decrease of water in the system (including open water and soil moisture), will cause an increase in TCBI. When water retreats completely from the ground surface (i.e. no open water), measured water level variation is associated with the relative water content in the soil. A high water content makes soils darker (hence low TCBI) than if these were dry, particularly for soils with low organic matter content (Jensen 2009). Strong correlations were consistent between TCBI and water level for both dry and wet years, suggesting that TCBI is a reliable index for hydrological monitoring in the Fuente de Piedra lake under a wide range of conditions. Table 4 Pearson\\u2019s correlation coefficients between in-situ water level data and MODIS-derived indices for the whole time series (2000\\u20132009), for the wet years only (2000\\u20132004 and 2009), and for the dry years only (2005\\u20132008) Full size table In contrast to TCBI, TCWI had the highest positive correlation coefficient with water level (r\\u2009=\\u20090.67) for the 10-year period, with a much higher correlation coefficient (r\\u2009=\\u20090.92) for the dry years (2005\\u20132008). This result confirms findings by other studies (Ordoyne and Friedl 2008; Van Trung et al. 2013) and can be explained by the fact that water strongly absorbs radiation in the SWIR part of the electro-magnetic spectrum (Campbell 2002). The correlation coefficient for wet years (2000\\u20132004 and 2009) was much lower (r\\u2009=\\u20090.53) and can be attributed to higher TCWI values in the dry season (May\\u2013July) of these wet years as compared to dry years, even if the water level is the same. These high values may be explained by salt deposition on the soil surface during the dry season, which occurs particularly in wet years when more water evaporates. The presence of salt causes the TCWI to increase considerably due to the high spectral reflectance of crusted saline soil surfaces in the visible and near-infrared regions of the spectrum (Howari et al. 2002; Koshal 2012). The different findings for the dry and wet years suggest that TCWI can be a proper index for monitoring wetland hydrological variability in non-saline wetlands, but not for saline wetlands with seasonal salt deposits. While TCBI and TCWI clearly exhibited the highest correlation with water level fluctuations, we found that band-ratio indices also gave reasonable correlation coefficients, but this was largely season-dependent. For dry years, LSWIB6 and MNDWI had a stronger relation with water level than NDVI and NDWI. This could be partly attributed to the smaller sensitivity of NIR reflection to variations in soil moisture, vegetation water content (Eitel et al. 2006; Olsen et al. 2013) and open water (Campbell 2002; Li et al. 2003) as compared to SWIR reflection. Low correlation between LSWIB6/MNDWI and water level for wet years may again be explained by the accumulation of salt at the soil surface (as for TCWI). NDWI showed a higher correlation coefficient with water level for wet years, which is likely to due to the higher variation in open water extent for which NDWI is designed. For all years, the NDVI-water level correlation coefficients were very low (r\\u2009<\\u20090.4). Temporal Behaviour of MODIS-Derived Indices in Response to Inundation Characteristics Figure 6 shows the correlation coefficient between MODIS-derived indices and water level for individual MODIS pixels. Important spatial variations can be observed. Generally, for NDWI, LSWIB6 and NDVI the sign of the correlation coefficient was opposite when comparing areas inside and outside the lake, while for TCBI, TCWI and MNDWI, the sign was the same. Fig. 6 Pearson\\u2019s correlation coefficient between spectral indices derived from MODIS and measured water level for the 2000\\u20132009 period for each MODIS pixel Full size image Comparison of Pearson\\u2019s correlation coefficients for different inundation frequency zones indicated that the sign and strength of correlations between water level and the MODIS-derived indices were highly dependent on inundation frequency (Table 5). TCBI was an exception as it showed high correlations with water level in all six inundation frequency classes. This result demonstrated that TCBI was sensitive to hydrological variability as expressed by fluctuations in both open water extent and soil moisture. Because the TCBI is a linear combination of all MODIS bands with positive coefficients (Table 3), TCBI\\u2019s sensitivity to hydrological variability across classes should be explained by an overall increase of reflectance with decreasing water levels. In fact, Fig. 7 shows that this is the case for all inundation classes. This suggests that TCBI is well suited for monitoring relative wetness under a wide range of hydrological conditions. Table 5 Pearson\\u2019s correlation coefficients between spectral indices derived from MODIS for different inundation frequency zones and in-situ water level data over 2000\\u20132009 Full size table Fig. 7 Average MODIS spectral signatures for the different inundation classes. The X-axis represents the central wavelength of each of the seven MODIS bands. Each line provides a spatial mean for an inundation class for a single image that corresponds to the water levels shown in the legend Full size image TCWI was positively related to water level in all inundation classes. The highest correlation (r\\u2009=\\u20090.94) existed in never inundated areas followed by upland (r\\u2009=\\u20090.80). This finding can be explained by the fact that TCWI is closely associated with both soil moisture (Crist and Cicone 1984; Crist et al. 1986; Jian et al. 2012) and plant water content (Cohen 1991; Jin and Sader 2005; Toomey and Vierling 2005). TCWI takes the difference between a weighted sum of the visible/NIR reflectance and the SWIR reflectance (Table 3). TCWI would be most sensitive if the reflectance of both wavelength domains would change in the opposite direction. Figure 7 shows that this is not the case for any inundation class, but for the never inundated areas, the visible/NIR domain (469\\u2013858 nm) changes least while SWIR (1240\\u20132130 nm) shows strong increases with decreasing water levels, resulting in a high sensitivity for TCWI. The likely explanation for this behavior in the never inundated class, is that TCWI responds here predominantly to changes in water content of soil and vegetation. These results are supported by the study of Ordoyne and Friedl (2008) who concluded that TCWI can quantify hydrological variation when the water table is below the soil surface. With an increase in the frequency of inundation, the TCWI-water level correlation decreased, indicating that TCWI might not appropriate for detecting variability in the presence of open water. It is rather an indicator of the water content of soil and vegetation. LSWIB6 exhibited a similar behavior to TCWI. The high LSWIB6-water level correlations for never inundated and upland areas confirm that LSWIB6 is also a good indicator of vegetation and soil water content (Chen et al. 2005; Xiao et al. 2005, 2006; Wang et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2011). NDWI had the highest correlation coefficient (r\\u2009=\\u20090.84) with water level for often inundated areas where the fluctuation in open-water presence is larger but low correlation coefficients in occasionally, seldom, and never inundated areas. This confirms that the index is able to monitor open water fluctuations, but not changes in soil water content. The upland class showed a high negative NDWI-water level correlation coefficient (r\\u2009=\\u2009\\u22120.69), which can be explained by Fig. 7 that shows a decrease in green reflectance (555 nm) and a simultaneous increase in NIR reflectance (858 nm) for upland as water level increases above 0 cm. This likely relates to reduced presence of green vegetation and/or the drying of vegetation around the lake at moments when the lake water level is low. Dry vegetation reflects less NIR radiation than green plants resulting in a higher NDWI. NDVI showed high and positive correlations with water level for upland and never inundated areas but low and negative correlations inside the lake. For a wetland in Australia, Petus et al. (2013) also found differential NDVI temporal behavior inside the wetland as compared to the surrounding regions. This can be attributed to the fact that different wetland plant species have different phenological responses in relation to water availability (Baird and Wilby 1999; Van Trung et al. 2013). In large areas inside the lake, plants that are able to stand extreme drought and salinity may appear at low densities when water retreats. Instead, in the upland and never inundated areas of the lake, the vegetation is relatively dense and dominated by crops, marsh and scrub that strongly depend on water availability, which is higher with higher water tables. These opposite correlation signs for NDVI may also partially explain the low correction coefficient for NDVI and water level for the whole lake (Table 4). While a good index for monitoring green vegetation abundance in response to water level in vegetated wetlands such as marshes (Jiang et al. 2015), NDVI proved not be appropriate for monitoring wetland hydrology in this saline lake with sparse vegetation. The dynamic range of TCBI, expressed by the 5th to 95th percentile range, varied greatly in relation to different inundation characteristics with a higher value of 0.72 for usually inundated areas and a low value of 0.38 for upland areas (Table 6). This difference in dynamic range suggests that the TCBI variability could be used to spatially separate seasonally-flooded wetlands from other areas, even if the temporal behavior is similar. Also MNDWI and NDWI showed higher variability for inundated areas as compared to uplands suggesting MNDWI and NDWI would also allow to separate wetlands clearly from its surroundings. An additional factor for NDWI to achieve this separation is the opposite temporal behavior (Table 5 and Fig. 6). This implies that MODIS-derived indicates can, besides monitoring wetland hydrology, also play a role in identification and mapping of small wetlands, and monitoring of their extent. Table 6 The 5th to 95th percentile variability as derived from the area-average time series of each spectral index per inundation class Full size table Future Outlook for Wetland Monitoring with Coarse Spatial Resolution Multi-Spectral Data Although our study was conducted for a single small wetland, it clearly showed the good potential of particularly the TCBI for wetland hydrological monitoring. We expect that this potential can be used for monitoring the hydrology of other wetlands with sparse vegetation cover in arid and semi-arid environments. The soils in and around the Fuente de Piedra lake are mostly mineral, which could have affected the results, because dry soils are bright (high TCBI) and wetter soils and inundated areas are dark (low TCBI) across the part of the electro-magnetic spectrum considered here. Mineral soils, low in organic matter content, are the dominant soils in arid and semi-arid environments. Soils with a higher organic matter content will also experience a decline in reflection when wetted or inundated, but given that such soils are already dark when in dry conditions, TCBI may possibly be less sensitive to this decline. Further studies in other wetlands should confirm the applicability and limitations of TCBI for monitoring wetland hydrology. Besides examining indices for wetlands with different soil types, we also recommend further testing for seasonally-flooded wetlands with other diverging characteristics, e.g. marshes with dense emergent vegetation, and for even smaller wetlands that comprise only a few MODIS pixels. Closely monitoring hydrological variability is important for understanding how climate change and human actions affect the dynamics of seasonally-flooded wetlands, or may affect these in the future. Given that seasonally-flooded wetlands host a high diversity of fauna and flora that depend on these dynamics, we need tools to study them. This study demonstrated a promising option to monitor wetlands remotely using freely-available coarse spatial resolution but high temporal resolution data, which could benefit the hydrological monitoring of many seasonally-flooded wetlands globally. This in turn has potential to greatly contribute to the management and conservation of these habitats and species living in them. Taking into account the importance of the Fuente de Piedra lake for conservation (e.g. for waterbirds), the results of this study may be directly applied for explaining animal species abundance by hydrological variability. Given that many of the waterbird species (e.g. the Greater Flamingo), are not confined to only this wetland, but make breeding and feeding decisions based on wetland conditions in a wider area, the MODIS indices may also be applied for assessing spatio-temporal variation of wetlands across Spain and the Mediterranean Basin (Amat et al. 2007). For example, the colony size of greater flamingos at Fuente de Piedra is also affected by water levels in the Guadalquivir marshes, which are located 140 km away. The Fuente de Piedra lake usually dries up during the late breeding season, and flamingos breeding in this locality must move to Guadalquivir marshes to obtain their food during the chick-rearing period (Rend\\u00f3n-Martos 1996). Hence, simultaneous monitoring hydrological dynamics of various wetlands with MODIS may prove an important tool to better explain and predict animal populations. Conclusion Seasonally-flooded wetlands are among the world\\u2019s most unique and valuable ecosystems, but are under threat worldwide. Methods that allow monitoring these small wetlands from remote sensing are urgently needed by resource managers and ecologists, especially in areas where conflicts arise between the water demand for agriculture and conservation of wetlands in semi-arid environments. Results from this work suggest that the MODIS-derived spectral indices have good potential for characterizing and monitoring temporal variability in the hydrology of small seasonally-flooded wetlands. Particularly TCBI proved useful and gave consistent good results for wet and dry years, and for areas characterized by different inundation frequencies. This is relevant as it could provide opportunity to improve hydrological monitoring particularly for data-poor and ungauged wetlands. We recommend further testing of MODIS indices for hydrological monitoring of seasonally-flooded wetlands with different soil and vegetation characteristics. Besides wetland hydrological monitoring, the differential temporal behavior of MODIS indices within and outside the lake make these indices a promising tool for mapping and monitoring wetland extent over large areas.

Irrigation, which constitutes \\u223c\\u200970\\u202f% of the total amount of freshwater consumed by the human population, is significantly impacting land\\u2013atmosphere fluxes. In this study, using the improved Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) with an active crop model, two high-resolution (\\u223c\\u20091\\u202fkm) simulations investigating the effects of irrigation on latent heat (LH), sensible heat (SH), and carbon fluxes (or net ecosystem exchange, NEE) from land to atmosphere in the Heihe River basin in northwestern China were conducted using a high-quality irrigation dataset compiled from 1981 to 2013. The model output and measurements from remote sensing demonstrated the capacity of the developed models to reproduce ecological and hydrological processes. The results revealed that the effects of irrigation on LH and SH are strongest during summer, with a LH increase of \\u223c\\u2009100\\u202fW\\u202fm\\u22122 and a SH decrease of \\u2009\\u223c\\u202f60\\u202fW\\u202fm\\u22122 over intensely irrigated areas. However, the reactions are much weaker during spring and autumn when there is much less irrigation. When the irrigation rate is below 5\\u202fmm\\u202fday\\u22121, the LH generally increases, whereas the SH decreases with growing irrigation rates. However, when the irrigation threshold is in excess of 5\\u202fmm\\u202fday\\u22121, there is no accrued effect of irrigation on the LH and SH. Irrigation produces opposite effects to the NEE during spring and summer. During the spring, irrigation yields more discharged carbon from the land to the atmosphere, increasing the NEE value by 0.4\\u20130.8\\u202fgC\\u202fm\\u22122\\u202fday\\u22121, while the summer irrigation favors crop fixing of carbon from atmospheric CO2, decreasing the NEE value by \\u223c\\u20090.8\\u202fgC\\u202fm\\u22122 day\\u22121. The repercussions of irrigation on land\\u2013atmosphere fluxes are not solely linked to the irrigation amount, and other parameters (especially the temperature) also control the effects of irrigation on LH, SH, and NEE.

However, human-induced modification to the natural environment is not well represented in land surface models (LSMs). In this study, we utilize microwave-based soil moisture products to aid the detection of under-represented irrigation processes throughout China. The satellite retrievals used in this study include passive microwave observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and its successor AMSR2, active microwave observations from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and the blended multi-sensor soil moisture product from the European Space Agency (i.e., ESA CCI product). We first conducted validations of the three soil moisture retrievals against in-situ observations (collected from the nationwide agro-meteorological network) in irrigated areas in China. It is found that compared to the conventional Spearman\\u2019s rank correlation and Pearson correlation coefficients, entropy-based mutual information is more suitable for evaluating soil moisture anomalies induced by irrigation. In general, around 60% of uncertainties in the anomaly of \\u201cground truth\\u201d time series can be resolved by soil moisture retrievals, with ASCAT outperforming the others. Following this, the potential utility of soil moisture retrievals in mapping irrigation patterns in China is investigated by examining the difference in probability distribution functions (detected by two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) between soil moisture retrievals and benchmarks of the numerical model ERA-Interim without considering the irrigation process. Results show that microwave remote sensing provides a promising alternative to detect the under-represented irrigation process against the reference LSM ERA-Interim. Specifically, the highest performance in detecting irrigation intensity is found when using ASCAT in Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, followed by advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR) and ESA CCI. Compared to ASCAT, the irrigation detection capabilities of AMSR exhibit higher discrepancies between descending and ascending orbits, since the soil moisture retrieval algorithm of AMSR is based on surface temperature and, thus, more affected by irrigation practices. This study provides insights into detecting the irrigation extent using microwave-based soil moisture with aid of LSM simulations, which has great implications for numerical model development and agricultural managements across the country. Keywords: microwave remote sensing; in-situ soil moisture; irrigation area; mutual information; Huang-Huai-Hai Plain 1. Introduction Soil moisture plays a crucial role in regulating water and energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere, and is thus recognized as an essential climate variable in earth science [1]. It is of importance for understanding the hydrological cycle in the context of climate change and increasingly intensified human interference. In particular, accurate information on soil moisture is valuable for, among others, facilitating vegetation growth/restoration evaluation in semiarid environments [2], crop yield estimation [3,4], and soil erosion rate prediction [5]. To date, information on long-term soil moisture variations largely relies on simulations from land surface models [6,7,8,9]. Quantification of the uncertainties in simulated and observed (both ground-based and satellite-based) soil moisture has drawn increased attention [10,11,12]. For instance, Tian et al. [13] demonstrated the limitations of the conventional performance metrics and advocated the use of error modeling for uncertainty quantification, which can be correctly characterized during real-time application based on Bayes\\u2019 theorem. Moreover, under the cases when a suitable parametric error model cannot be found, nonparametric approaches which are fundamentally based on information theoretic concepts could be employed [14,15]. Generally, the accuracy of model-based soil moisture is constrained by the quality of model forcing and the large horizontal/vertical heterogeneity of soil properties that are not readily available [16]. In addition, it is found that the unmodeled process especially the anthropogenic activities, such as excessive groundwater-fed irrigation and cross-regional water diversion, could significantly affect local and regional water and energy budgets, as well as the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes [17,18,19]. Among them, irrigation is an important land management practice which leads to significant alteration of the global and regional hydrological cycle [20]. Specifically, the effects of irrigation include: (1) Altering land surface flux partitions [21,22]; (2) inducing land surface cooling [21]; (3) resulting in taller cloud masses and early peak cloud formation over croplands [23]. As found by [24], the overall impact of irrigation on regional climate could exceed those of greenhouse gases at seasonal timescales. Despite recent developments in numerical representations of irrigation in land surface models [18,25,26], the majority of land surface models lack the consideration of the irrigation effect on water redistribution in the terrestrial system, with simulated surface soil moisture being biased in irrigated areas [27]. Accurately capturing and representing the nature of irrigation practices remains a challenge. Remote sensing measurements offer a potential alternative for capturing the effects of such unmodeled processes. Near-surface soil moisture observations from a number of passive microwave and scatterometer-based platforms have been accumulated in the past decades. They include the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) aboard the Aqua satellite and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) aboard the Meteorological Operational (METOP) satellites. Recently, as initiated within the Water Cycle Multi-Mission Observation Strategy (WACMOS) project, the latest version of soil moisture product (ESA CCI) merging active and passive microwave observations has been released to the public. After minimizing the effects caused by sensor specifications and the inconsistencies in microwave frequency and spatial resolution, the ESA CCI product provides relatively consistent and reliable information on soil moisture worldwide. At the global scale, this ESA CCI data set has been extensively validated against in-situ network observations and various land surface model simulations [28,29,30,31]. Recently, the utility of the microwave-based soil moisture over irrigated areas has been evaluated in the United States [32] and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula [33]. Lawston et al. [34] investigated the potential of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced 9 km soil moisture product to identify irrigation signals in three semi-arid regions in the western United States. Results showed that SMAP soil moisture carries a clear irrigation signal from rice irrigation in the Sacramento Valley (California), while the signals were less obvious in the Columbia River Basin, Washington, and Colorado. Through inversion of the soil water balance equation, Brocca et al. [35] incorporated different microwave soil moisture products into the proposed SM2RAIN algorithm and quantified the amount of water used for irrigation. Through integrating the differences between the temporal variations of satellite and model soil moisture over the growing season, Zaussinger et al. [36] also estimated the monthly irrigation using microwave soil moisture products. Nevertheless, detailed inter-comparison and evaluation of these soil moisture products in irrigated areas in China has received relatively little attention in the existing literature. In addition, current remote sensing methodology to map irrigated areas relies heavily on vegetation cycle information, which is typically more dependent on optical remote sensing and affected by cloud conditions [37]. In this study, we focus on the potential utility of the microwave-based soil moisture products in identifying irrigation patterns that are typically not well represented in land surface models. We first conduct general validations of the selected soil moisture products against the in-situ observations collected from the nationwide agro-meteorological network using various metrics including entropy-based mutual information, Spearman correlation, and Pearson correlation. The validation itself can contribute to our understanding of the performance of global-scale soil moisture retrievals in irrigated areas in China, which has great implications for guiding the applications in these specific regions. Then, we quantify the effectiveness of each soil moisture product in detecting irrigation intensities. Such quantification is performed by comparing the probability density functions of remote sensing data sets against those of benchmark land surface model simulations (i.e., ERA-Interim) which do not account for irrigation. Finally, the sensitivity of the discussed detection capabilities to two half-orbits is conducted. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Soil Moisture Data Sets 2.1.1. Passive Microwave Satellite-Based Retrievals of AMSR-E and AMSR2 The AMSR-E is onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aqua platform and has provided soil moisture estimates since 2002. There are several versions of AMSR-E products which use different algorithms to solve the radiative transfer equations. Overall, the AMSR-E soil moisture data set based on the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) [38] has shown relatively stable performance around the world compared to both in-situ observations [39,40,41], and simulated soil moisture [42,43,44]. Therefore, in this study, we choose the LPRM AMSR-E product to conduct the analysis. LPRM uses dual-polarized C- and X-band (6.925 and 10.65 GHz) brightness temperature for simultaneous retrieval of surface soil moisture and vegetation water content. The default retrieval band for LPRM data set is C-band, and is substituted by X-band when the signal at C-band frequency is contaminated by radio frequency interference (RFI). In this study, we use version 5 of the product. As the successor of AMSR-E, AMSR2 is a multi-frequency radiometer launched on board the GCOM-W1 satellite on May 2012. In order to extend the temporal coverage of passive microwave satellite-based retrievals to that of active remote sensing, we concatenate the datasets of AMSR-E and AMSR2, both of which are generated from the same LPRM algorithm and obtained from ftp://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/. In the LPRM soil moisture data set, retrievals are screened under dense canopy (vegetation optical depth greater than 0.8). 2.1.2. Active Microwave Satellite-Based Retrievals of ASCAT ASCAT is real aperture backscatter radar operating at C-band (5.255 GHz), and it orbits on EUMETSAT\\u2019s Meteorological Operational (METOP) satellite. The active microwave-based soil moisture product used in this study is derived using the empirical change-detection approach developed at the Vienna University of Technology (TU-Wien) by Wagner, Lemoine, and Rott [45]. Time series of soil moisture based on the change-detection method permit the discrimination of scattering processes at various time scales, and thus can differentiate the highly variable soil moisture process and seasonal vegetation patterns. The ASCAT data set used in this study is released by EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF), with a spatial resolution of 12.5 km. The product represents the relative measure of surface soil moisture ranging from 0 (dry condition) to 100 (wet condition) obtained by scaling normalized backscatter between the historically lowest and highest values. The ASCAT soil moisture product is introduced in more detail by [46,47]. 2.1.3. ESA CCI Product The ESA CCI product was supported under the framework of European Space Agency\\u2019s Water Cycle Multi-Mission Observation Strategy (WACMOS) project and Climate Change Initiative (http://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org). The ESA CCI data set was derived from passive products including observations from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager (TMI), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2), and WindSat; and active products including the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) observations and scatterometer observations on board the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite [31,48]. The ESA CCI data set provides surface soil moisture information in volumetric units (m3 m\\u22123) on a daily basis at a spatial resolution of 0.25\\u00b0. Besides the difference in the quality of the individual data source, uncertainties of ESA CCI product could result from the selected merging procedures in combining retrievals from different observation systems, different mission designs as well as different retrieval algorithms. Despite certain limitations, the ESA CCI product has demonstrated great potential for evaluating model performance [28,29,30,49], and for studying the global-scale land-atmosphere interactions [50]. In this study, the latest version (v04.2) of ESA CCI was used for analysis. Compared with the previous version, this version not only extends the temporal coverage by three years through including WindSat and AMSR2 data, but also improves the gap filling and other processing algorithms (http://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org/node/185). 2.1.4. ERA-Interim Product as Benchmark The ERA-Interim has served as a benchmark for comparison against the microwave-based soil moisture products, as it does not account for any human-induced irrigation practice. It is a global land surface reanalysis data set covering the period 1979\\u20132016. Although there are several improvements of the land surface parameterizations in ERA-Interim/Land compared to ERA-Interim [51], the latter has greater temporal overlap with above-mentioned satellite products which facilitates the intercomparison of analysis results. Therefore, soil moisture data from the ERA-Interim dataset are used in this study. Four layers of soil (0\\u20137, 7\\u201328, 28\\u2013100, and 100\\u2013289 cm) are represented in ERA-Interim reanalysis, and soil moisture is provided at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC with the unit of m3 m\\u22123 [52]. In order to be comparable with the sensing depth of the satellite sensors, only the first layer (0\\u20137 cm) of reanalysis data were used in the study. 2.1.5. In-situ Network Observations In-situ soil moisture measurements were collected from the nationwide agro-meteorological network (http://data.cma.gov.cn/data/detail/dataCode/AGME_AB2_CHN_TEN.html), with quality control performed by the National Meteorological Center of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The locations of the stations are shown in Figure 1 (with high monitoring density across the irrigation hotspots in the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) Plain outlined by grey shading). To monitor the soil water status, measurements were taken on the 8th, 18th, and 28th day of each month since 1991 at each agro-meteorological site. Soil moisture was measured at the depth of 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 100 cm, and no measurements were recorded under frozen soil conditions. This data set of in-situ soil moisture measurements from the nationwide agro-meteorological network has been widely used for investigating soil moisture spatial and temporal characteristics and validation of microwave soil moisture in China [42,53]. Similar to ERA-Interim reanalysis, only the in-situ soil moisture observations of the first layer (10 cm) were used in the study. As soil moisture was measured by the gravimetric method and recorded as the relative ratio to field capacity, the 0.25-degree global porosity map provided along with ESA CCI v04.2 product was used to convert raw measurements to a volumetric unit. Figure 1. Spatial distribution of agro-meteorological sites in China. 2.2. Precipitation Data In this study, the difference between the rainfall product obtained from satellite soil moisture through the SM2RAIN algorithm [54] and from model simulations was used to verify the occurrences of irrigation. The SM2RAIN product was applied to the ASCAT data [55] for the period from January 2007 to June 2015. The ASCAT-derived rainfall dataset (in mm/day) is gridded over a 0.5-degree grid on a global scale, and represents the cumulated rainfall between the 00:00 UTC until the 23:59 UTC of the indicated day. The other rainfall product was derived from ERA-Interim model without the irrigation module representing the same cumulative period of the indicated day. 2.3. Irrigation Data 2.3.1. Areas Equipped for Irrigation (AEI) from FAOSTAT We used a gridded data set on the areas equipped for irrigation (AEI) from Statistics Division of the FAO (FAOSTAT) around the year 2005 [56]. The data set is available at 5 arc minute \\u00d7 5 arc minute grid cells, and is further aggregated to 0.25 degree to be consistent with microwave soil moisture products. The quality of the irrigation data set is considered reliable compared to sub-national irrigation statistics [57]. In addition, its quality is also positively assessed by comparing records on irrigation equipment and real practices at the agro-meteorological sites in Hebei Province collected and processed by the National Meteorological Center [58]. The spatial distribution of irrigation areas is shown in Figure 2, it is obvious that the HHH Plain (including Tianjin, Beijing, and five provinces: Anhui, Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong), which is regarded as the \\u2018Granary of China\\u2019, is one of the most important irrigation hotspots in China. There are also important irrigation districts in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia with irrigation water withdrawn from Yellow River, and irrigation oases distributed between the two inland arid basins in Xinjiang. It should be noted that the map refers to the areas equipped with irrigation rather than area actually irrigated. Typically, the spatial extent with actual irrigation was smaller than area equipped with irrigation [57]. Figure 2. Gridded irrigation data based on the areas equipped for irrigation from FAOSTAT circa 2005. 2.3.2. Areas with Actual Irrigation by GRIPC The areas with actual irrigation are represented using Irrigated Area Map Asia and Africa by International Water Management Institute (IWMI-IAMAA). This product utilizes the hierarchical classification procedure to map phenological changes in agriculture areas using 16-day MODIS 250 m NDVI composites images (MOD13Q1). The agricultural areas were categorized into irrigated and rain-fed by analyzing the seasonal vegetation trends. Furthermore, agricultural areas with multiple cropping cycles were identified by analyzing the cyclic nature of vegetation change in agricultural systems. Based on the cropping intensity, agriculture areas were further categorized into single, double and continuous crops. In comparison with other irrigated cropland inventories, IWMI-IAMAA showed general agreement with other available global irrigation data sets, such as FAOSTAT and the database of Global Rain-fed, Irrigated and Paddy Croplands (GRIPC) [59]. In this study, IWMI-IAMAA is also served as a benchmark for identifying the actual irrigation (Figure 3). Figure 3. Actual irrigation area from the Irrigated Area Map Asia and Africa by International Water Management Institute (IWMI-IAMAA) circa 2010. 2.4. Discerning Difference in Probability Distributions of Two Time Series The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test [60] is used in this study to quantitatively compare the probability distributions of two data sets, and to test if the two samples come from the same continuous distribution (Ho), against the alternative that they do not come from the same distribution (Ha). The K-S test statistic quantifies the distance Dm,n between empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of two samples (F(x) and G(x) where x is the sampled variable) and is computed as follows: \\ud835\\udc37 \\ud835\\udc5a,\\ud835\\udc5b = max \\ud835\\udc65 |\\ud835\\udc39(\\ud835\\udc65)\\u2212\\ud835\\udc3a(\\ud835\\udc65)| (1) where m and n are the sample sizes of F and G. The null distribution of the K-S statistic is calculated under the null hypothesis that samples are drawn from the same distribution. The null hypothesis is rejected at the confidence level \\u03b1 if \\ud835\\udc37 \\ud835\\udc5a,\\ud835\\udc5b >\\ud835\\udc50(\\ud835\\udefc) \\ud835\\udc5a+\\ud835\\udc5b \\ud835\\udc5a\\ud835\\udc5b \\u2212 \\u2212 \\u2212 \\u2212 \\u2212 \\u2212 \\u221a (2) where c(\\u03b1) is the inverse of the Kolmogorov distribution at \\u03b1. The K-S test is applied to the probability distributions of the surface soil moisture retrievals from different microwave sensors and the ERA-Interim. Values of D closer to zero indicate that the soil moisture distributions from the comparison pair are similar. Conversely, higher D values indicate larger differences between the soil moisture distributions from the two integrations. In this study, we focus on the probability distributions of soil moisture during the irrigation period. This method has been successfully applied in similar investigations [32,61]. 2.5. Metrics Evaluating the Accuracy of Soil Moisture Products Besides the conventional Pearson\\u2019s and Spearman\\u2019s correlation, we also employed the entropy-based mutual information (MI) [62] to measure the correlation between two random variables. The MI between two variables represents the amount of entropy (uncertainty) in either of the two variables that can be reduced by knowing the other. It is more rigorous compared to the commonly-used metrics such as Spearman\\u2019s rank correlation coefficient and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, the latter being an approximation of MI under certain conditions [14]. MI and the related Shannon-type entropy [63] are calculated as follows. Entropy about a random variable \\u03b6 can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty according to its distribution p\\u03b6, and is estimated as the expected amount of information from p\\u03b6 sample: H( \\ud835\\udc5d \\u03b6 )= E \\u03b6 [\\u2212ln( \\ud835\\udc5d \\u03b6 (\\u03b6))] (3) MI between \\u03b6 and another variable \\u03c8 can be thought of as the expected amount of information about variable \\u03b6 contained in a realization of \\u03c8, and is measured by the expected Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence [64] between the conditional and marginal distributions over \\u03b6: MI(\\u03b6;\\u03c8)= E \\u03c8 [\\ud835\\udc37( \\ud835\\udc5d \\u03b6|\\u03c8 || \\ud835\\udc5d \\u03b6 )] (4) In this study, we calculated the MI content between various soil moisture products and in-situ measurements in each grid. All the estimated MI is normalized by the entropy of the corresponding in-situ measurements to remove the effect of inter-site variation on the magnitude of difference, and the normalized MI (NMI) represents the fraction of uncertainty in ground observations that is resolvable given knowledge of the soil moisture retrievals or simulations. The details on the MI estimation can be referred to Qiu et al. [65] and Qiu, Crow, and Nearing [53]. 3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Validation of Satellite Soil Moisture Products In this section, both satellite-based and model-based soil moisture data sets during 2007\\u20132012 (limited by the temporal coverage of in-situ measurements) were validated against ground observations from agro-meteorological sites. Three statistical metrics, i.e., the normalized mutual information (NMI), and two conventional correlation coefficients (Spearman\\u2019s rank correlation and Pearson\\u2019s correlation), are adopted in the validations. The evaluation is conducted using all agro-meteorological sites with complete soil moisture record, and grouped based on different AEI levels of the grid cell, i.e., 0\\u201310%, 10\\u201330%, 30\\u201350%, and 50\\u201380% (see Figure 4). In order to capture the short-term variability of surface soil moisture, anomalies were calculated relative to seasonal varying soil moisture climatology by using the 31-day moving window to normalize the time series [66]. Figure 4. Validation of the remote sensing data sets against observations from agro-meteorological sites that located in grids with four different AEI levels of 0\\u201310%, 10\\u201330%, 30\\u201350% and 50\\u201380%, using metrics of (a) normalized mutual information, (b) Pearson correlation, (c) Spearman correlation. Numbers of agro-meteorological sites used for each irrigation levels are shown in the first row. High consistency between satellite-based soil moisture and in-situ measurements is found using the NMI statistics with median NMI up to 0.6, indicating 60% of uncertainties in soil moisture anomaly (based on ground observations) can be resolved by knowing the satellite-based soil moisture retrievals. The high consistency is robust across different irrigation intensity levels, and demonstrates stable performance across various irrigation levels. However, the linear relationship between satellite-based and ground-based soil moisture using Pearson correlation or Spearman correlation indicates that all microwave soil moisture products have median R around 0.3, while ERA Interim has the highest linear relationship with in-situ measurements. In addition, with increasing AEI levels, there is a notable decrease in the lower quantile and minimum value (negative correlations) of Pearson and Spearman correlations for all three microwave soil moisture products. The results based on conventional correlation coefficients are in marked contrast to NMI statistics. This implies that, under anomalously wetter conditions (i.e., increasing AEI levels), neither Spearman nor Pearson correlation is appropriate for identifying the full coupling strength between satellite/simulation data sets and ground observations. Instead, the NMI statistic has comparative advantage over the other two metrics in validating soil moisture time series, especially when the soil moisture significantly exceeds the norm. Overall, our results suggest that satellite-based retrievals can well reproduce the variations of observed soil moisture content over irrigated regions in China. 3.2. Utility of Satellite Soil Moisture Retrievals in Mapping Irrigation Pattern After validating the satellite-based and model-based soil moisture estimates against ground observations, we investigate the potential utility of satellite retrievals in identifying: (1) Spatial distribution of irrigation extent; (2) temporal impulse response from irrigation. 3.2.1. Identification of Spatial Distribution and Irrigation Intensity of Major Irrigation Regions Prior to conducting the K-S analysis, ASCAT product was resampled to 0.25\\u00b0 to be consistent with other microwave-based soil moisture data sets. In order to ensure maximum temporal overlap of three microwave products, the analysis period is selected as 2007\\u20132014. For a better illustration of the distinctively different features in K-S statistics between irrigation and non-irrigation situations, we contrast our spatial identification results for months with and without prevailing irrigation across the nation. As precipitation in the HHH Plain is concentrated during July to August, regional-scale agricultural irrigation is commonly conducted at critical growing stages for winter wheat outside the rainy season, i.e., early April (during the green-up stage), early May (during the milking stage), and October (before the planting of winter wheat) [67]. Therefore, we selected irrigation month of April and non-irrigation month of September for spatial pattern contrast. Figure 5 shows the quantitative comparison of the differences in soil moisture distributions between three remote sensing soil moisture retrievals and that from ERA-Interim over cropland areas. We removed the differences in mean and variance (for the entire time series) of each pair of soil moisture products prior to calculating the K-S metrics. Figure 5. K-S metrics calculated from three remote sensing soil moisture retrievals and ERA-Interim: the first and second rows are for irrigation month of April and non-irrigation month of September, respectively, while the first to third columns show results for pairs of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) vs. ERA, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) vs. ERA, and ESA CCI vs. ERA respectively. It is found that the K-S metrics calculated from all microwave-based soil moisture have successfully discerned the irrigation areas. The hotspots with sufficient samples include the irrigated oases to the north and west rims of Tarim Basin in Xinjiang (Region 2 in red rectangle in Figure 5a). This is consistent with the results from trend analysis in [53], who compared ESA CCI with soil moisture estimates from ERA-Interim/Land and ground sites, and found that the deviations between the land surface model (without irrigation modules) and satellite retrievals may result from the effects of heavy irrigation in the area. The most prominent irrigation hotspot identified by the three microwave-based soil moisture products is located in the HHH Plain (Region 1 in red rectangle shown in Figure 5a). In particular, the K-S map from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) retrievals is featured with high value in the north of the HHH Plain, especially in the Hebei Irrigation District (AEI level 50\\u201380%). The K-S test also suggests that the distribution of advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR) is significantly different from that of ERA Interim over Region 1 (p < 0.05). Comparatively, the ASCAT highlighted the intensively irrigated areas in the mid-south of the HHH Plain, which is the paddy area in eastern Henan and northern Jiangsu Provinces. This is due to the fact that ASCAT seems to be more sensitive to specular reflection of the active radar signal from the flooded rice fields [36], leading to very low backscatter and, hence, deviating CDF of soil moisture from ERA Interim. In addition, ESA CCI successfully detected the irrigation hotspot in Hebei Province that conforms to AMSR detection. This resemblance can also be explained by the similar accuracies of these two products as shown in Figure 4. It is noted that the ESA CCI K-S map in irrigated April (Figure 5c) is more homogenous compared to AMSR and ASCAT (Figure 5a,b). This is likely due to the generation procedures of ESA CCI in that both passive and active data sets are CDF matched against the GLDAS-1-Noah simulation before merging, which consequently reduces the maximum CDF distance between ESA CCI and the selected benchmark. For the non-irrigated September, three products all showed mainly homogenous patterns, with seldom highlights in K-S maps. To further demonstrate the abilities of satellite products in detecting irrigation intensities, we use the K-S statistics generated by each product to discern the irrigated areas from the rain-fed cropland. Considering the wide variation in irrigation practice across the nation (different onset time and amount), we incorporate all information of 12-month K-S statistics into an ISODATA clustering analysis, a classic and reliable method of pattern classification [68], and illustrate the clustering results in Figure 6, the discerned cluster with higher K-S statistics is classified as irrigation cropland. Comparing to IWMI-IAMAA irrigation map (Figure 3, considered as ground truth), all three products demonstrated various degrees of success in identifying irrigation areas. Specifically, AMSR is more reliable in the northwest of the HHH Plain (i.e., northern Shanxi and southern Inner Mongolia), while ASCAT better captures the heavy irrigation features in the southwest of the HHH Plain (Henan Province). The more isolated and scattered irrigation pattern produced by ESA CCI is also likely due to the pixel-wise CDF matching in its generation process. In order to verify this assumption, we simply combined all 12-month K-S samples of both AMSR and ASCAT in the clustering analysis, and show the results in Figure 6d. It is evident that detection success of simple combination closely resembles that of ASCAT, with only a slight discrepancy in southern Henan, which is also confirmed by the indices in the confusion matrix (Figure 7). Figure 6. The spatial patterns of discerned irrigated cropland from rain-fed areas by (a) AMSR; (b) ASCAT; (c) ESA CCI; and (d) combination of both AMSR and ASCAT. Figure 7. Confusion matrices of clustering from three microwave-based soil moisture products and the simple combination of both AMSR and ASCAT. In order to further quantify the clustering accuracies of three products, we calculated the confusion matrices of classification using IWMI-IAMAA irrigation map as a benchmark (Figure 7). It is seen that all three data sets demonstrate excellent irrigation detection accuracy. Generally, above 70% of actual irrigation areas can be detected using microwave soil moisture, with highest detection performance exhibited in ASCAT (88%), which is consistent with the investigation of Kumar [32]. Meanwhile, the producer\\u2019s accuracy in rain-fed areas classification is highest in AMSR (48%). It should be pointed out that numerous factors including vegetation density, RFI, along with irrigation can attribute to the deviation of empirical CDF between microwave-based and reanalysis soil moisture, whereas this clustering process identifies irrigation areas only based on the maximum CDF distance, i.e., K-S statistics. This will inevitably introduce uncertainties, which can be quantified in the user\\u2019s accuracy. Overall, the miss-classification of rain-fed areas into irrigation is within the range of (27\\u201336%). In addition, the statistics of ASCAT and simple combination are in high consistency (Figure 7b,d). Through increasing the K-S samples, the producer\\u2019s accuracy in rain-fed areas classification has slightly increased from 35% to 38%. 3.2.2. Reproducing the Temporal Evolutions of Soil Moisture in Irrigated Regions Following the analysis of spatial distribution on irrigation pattern, this sub-section focuses on identifying the temporal dynamics of the irrigation process. Firstly, we used the difference between ASCAT-based (SM2RAIN) rainfall and model-simulated rainfall (ERA-Interim, without irrigation module) to demonstrate the feasibility of using microwave soil moisture data for detecting irrigation processes. The underlying assumption in this sub-section is that rainfall estimated from microwave soil moisture has incorporated signals of both precipitation and irrigation, and thus can be used to calculate irrigation along with precipitation product. Figure 8a shows the results (use 2014 for illustration) in typical Weishan irrigation district in the center of the HHH Plain (fifth largest irrigation district in China, 115.4\\u2013116.5\\u00b0 E, 36.2\\u201337.0\\u00b0 N, [69]). The daily values of two data sets were aggregated to 5-day accumulations, and the start and end time of possible irrigation period (April\\u2013October) in this region were shown with grey shading. It is seen from Figure 8a that there is an obvious discrepancy between the 5-day accumulation time series of two rainfall data sets, with most of the SM2RAIN rainfall higher than ERA simulation for the irrigation periods during 2007\\u20132015 (Figure 8b). In addition, the annual irrigation amount deduced from the accumulated difference between both data sets (during irrigation periods and excluding rainy seasons of 2007\\u20132015) was 201.9 mm, very close to the recorded irrigation amount of 196 mm in Weishan irrigation district [69] (scatter plot not shown). This indicates that the footprint and corresponding accumulative effect of unmodeled irrigation could be identified by microwave remote sensing. However, this is also affected by the complexity of crop situations and the rainfall variations, e.g., it is clear that ASCAT signal is better for detecting irrigation in October than in April (Figure 8a). During April to May, the winter wheat grows at vigorous stage (from jointing stage to heading stage), and consumes about 50 m3/hm2 water each day, while it only consumes about 10 m3/hm2 water each day during seeding stage in October [70]. Moreover, this will reduce irrigation effect during April to May. Nevertheless, the microwave remote sensing has the ability to detect or quantify the irrigation, but needs further studies. Figure 8. The difference between SM2RAIN-ASCAT and ERA simulation in typical Weishan irrigation district in the center of the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) Plain. (a) the 5-day accumulation time series in 2014; (b) the scatter plot of SM2RAIN-ASCAT vs. ERA-Interim rainfall during 2007\\u20132015. 3.3. Sensitivity to Ascending and Descending Retrievals To date, applications of microwave-based soil moisture in detecting irrigation patterns is commonly considered to be a relatively innovative topic. As stated in the introduction section, different approaches have been employed to achieve this goal [32,33,34,35,36]. In this study, we investigate the potential utility of soil moisture retrievals in detecting irrigation intensity in China by examining the difference in probability distribution functions (detected by two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) between satellite-based soil moisture retrievals (with irrigation signals) and those from benchmarking numerical model (without irrigation signals). The rationale of this study lies in that the difference between two soil moisture information sources: time series with irrigation signals and the other without irrigation signals can be attributed to the effects of irrigation. There is a critical assumption underlying this logic, i.e., the background factors are the same except that from irrigation. However, this may not be valid given the fact that noises (i.e., factors not considered in this study) exist and could dampen the irrigation signal. Therefore, preprocessing procedures are required to maximize the irrigation signal. Specifically, we focus the analysis on cropland as soil moisture retrievals are more affected by irrigation than other localized human activities. In addition, we select the irrigation month rather than the whole year for examinations in order to maximize the irrigation signal. In the following sub-section, we will further consider the effect of the different satellite overpass time on their corresponding capabilities in irrigation detection. For satellites with sun-synchronous orbits, their products are typically derived separately for ascending and descending overpasses with different local acquisition times. In addition, diurnal variations in land surface conditions, and the extent to which they are accurately characterized in retrieval algorithms, may lead to distinct systematic and random error characteristics in ascending versus descending soil moisture products. Here, we apply the identical evaluation techniques (K-S metric) to quantify the sensitivity of the analysis to different local acquisition times. As the ESA CCI is a merged microwave product from both descending and ascending orbits, it is removed in this comparison. The spatial patterns of metrics derived from both orbits during April and May are shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. K-S metrics comparison of the differences in soil moisture distributions from microwave soil moisture retrievals and ERA-Interim: the left column is for ascending orbits of AMSR vs. ERA pair and ASCAT vs. ERA pair; the right column is for descending orbits of the same pairs. Results from April are shown in the first two rows, while results from May are shown in the last two rows. Comparing Figure 9e and Figure 9f, a slight difference between the ascending and descending orbits of AMSR-E is found, especially in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, the natural oasis to the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountain in Xinjiang, and Northeast China (red rectangle in Figure 9e,f) where the diurnal range of retrieved land surface temperature is significant and the evaporation demand is relatively high during daytime. As expected, the D values estimated from AMSR-E ascending orbits (1:30 pm) is relatively higher than those from the corresponding descending orbits (1:30 am). This is associated with the different retrieval accuracies between half orbits, as reported in [40,42,44,48,71]. Specifically, during night-time, the difference between canopy temperature and surface soil temperature as well as the temperature gradient of soil profile is reduced. Irrigation during daytime also decreases the impact on the vertical soil temperature gradient. In addition, diurnal transpiration affects vegetation optical depth, which is also a factor influencing the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals at daytime versus nighttime. As for the ASCAT, there is a less noticeable discrepancy between the ascending and descending orbits, with difference mainly observed in the mid-south HHH Plain. The magnitude of the difference between the different orbits of ASCAT is relatively lower mainly because neither of the overpass times for ASCAT (9:30 pm for ascending orbits and 9:30 am for descending orbits) is close to the irrigation application time. Overall, the analysis suggests that our conclusions are robust to the ascending and descending orbits. 4. Conclusions Anthropogenic activities, including massive groundwater-fed irrigation, could significantly alter the coupling strength between precipitation and soil moisture [18,50]. Previous studies showed that irrigation, as an additional water supply source, has the impact of reducing soil albedo, increasing soil heat capacity, increasing local soil moisture content, and affecting the water/energy budget by transforming the evapotranspiration regime from water-limited to energy-limited [26,72]. China is one of the most intensively irrigated regions in the world [54,55], and yet this human-induced modification to regional hydrological cycle is largely under-represented in most land surface models. Thus, mapping irrigation patterns across China based on satellite retrievals has substantial implications for agricultural management. In this study, we intended to evaluate the potential utility of microwave-based soil moisture in capturing the unmodeled irrigation practice. The soil moisture products used in this study are AMSR-E (passive microwave), ASCAT (active microwave), and ESA CCI (combined data set from both passive and active microwave). The microwave-based soil moisture product and land surface models (ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis) are first validated against in-situ measurements in irrigated areas across China, using the entropy-based normalized mutual information (NMI), and conventional correlation coefficients, i.e., Spearman\\u2019s rank correlation and Pearson\\u2019s correlation. The NMI metrics suggested that approximately 60% of uncertainties in the anomaly of \\u201cground truth\\u201d time series can be resolved by the satellite-based soil moisture retrievals, while the fraction of uncertainties resolved by ERA are relatively lower. However, such features cannot be measured by the conventional correlation coefficients, i.e., Spearman\\u2019s rank and Pearson\\u2019s correlation. Therefore, metrics based on mutual information should be employed under anomalous wet soil conditions. Using ERA-Interim reanalysis which does not account for irrigation practice as the benchmark, we analyzed the difference in probability distributions of ERA-Interim and each microwave product based on two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. The difference during irrigation months of April and May are examined to investigate the potential utility of satellite-based soil moisture products to map irrigation patterns. Results showed that all three satellite-based soil moisture products have the potential to detect the intensity of the major irrigation areas in semi-arid to arid regions of north China, including the major Yellow River irrigation district in Ningxia Province, Hetao irrigation district in Inner Mongolia, and the oasis in the west and north rim of Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. However, discrepancies exist in the spatial distribution of the detected irrigation hotspots by the three products. For example, the AMSR-E detected the north HHH Plain as an intensive irrigation area, while the ASCAT identified the mid-south HHH Plain as the irrigation hotspot based on the K-S D values. Compared to other two products, the ESA CCI product was less sensitive in detecting irrigation hotspots, while ASCAT better captured the heavy irrigation features. In addition to the spatial pattern, AMSR-E and ASCAT showed disagreement in the irrigation timing over areas such as Hetao irrigation district. light differences in K-S D values were also found when using different ascending or descending orbit retrievals. As previously discussed, agricultural irrigation is one of the possible contributing factors for the observed differences in K-S metrics. Constraining analysis over major irrigated areas during the irrigation period can largely remove other background factors and thus amplify the irrigation signal. The fact that the irrigation hotspots identified by both AMSR-E and ASCAT are only obvious during irrigation months rather than the rest of year does indicate that irrigation practice is the most likely reason underlying the observed differences. Results indicate that for regions with significant human interference, it is crucial to parameterize irrigation in numerical models or assimilate satellite retrievals that capture such unmodeled process. Furthermore, this study highlights that microwave soil moisture products have the potential for detecting irrigation patterns throughout China, although more efforts are required towards reducing the involved uncertainties and developing algorithms for quantifying the amount of water used for irrigation. Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind the uncertainty and limitation, which help better understand the implication of these results.

A simulation study for Northern Germany Jan Riediger, Broder Breckling, Robert S Nuske & Winfried Schr\\u00f6der  Environmental Sciences Europe  26, Article number: 18 (2014) Cite this article 8074 Accesses 40 Citations Metrics Abstract Background By example of a region in Northern Germany (County of Uelzen), this study investigates whether climate change is likely to require adaption of agricultural practices such as irrigation in Central Europe. Due to sandy soils with low water retention capacity and occasional insufficient rainfall, irrigation is a basic condition for agricultural production in the county of Uelzen. Thus, in the framework of the comprehensive research cluster Nachhaltiges Landmanagement im Norddeutschen Tiefland (NaLaMa-nT), we investigated whether irrigation might need to be adapted to changing climatic conditions. To this end, results from regionalised climate change modelling were coupled with soil- and crop-specific evapotranspiration models to calculate potential amounts of irrigation to prevent crop failures. Three different runs of the climate change scenario RCP 8.5 were used for the time period until 2070. Results The results show that the extent of probable necessary irrigation will likely increase in the future. For the scenario run with the highest temperature rise, the results suggest that the amount of ground water presently allowed to be extracted for irrigation might not be sufficient in the future to retain common agricultural pattern. Conclusions The investigation at hand exemplifies data requirements and methods to estimate irrigation needs under climate change conditions. Restriction of ground water withdrawal by German environmental regulation may require an adaptation of crop selection and alterations in agricultural practice also in regions with comparable conditions. Background Current projections of global climatic change strongly support the expectation that during the next few decades, global temperatures will continue to increase as well as spatial and temporal patterns of temperature and precipitation will be shifting [[1],[2]]. This may have implications for many environmental processes which are influenced by thermal and soil moisture conditions. The increase in temperature for instance could lead to soil moisture deficits and a growing risk of vegetation desiccation due to increasing evapotranspiration and decreasing soil moisture [[3],[4]]. Ecological and economic consequences for European agricultural ecosystems are expected to vary widely according to the spatial patterns of land cover, land use practise and regional climate change [[5]\\u2013[7]]. Anyway, referring for instance to Europe, according to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/EC) [[8]], a good ecological status of surface and ground water has to be achieved. To safeguard sustainable water management, vulnerability assessments [[9]] and adaptation strategies based on estimates of irrigation demands are needed [[10]\\u2013[14]]. Such appraisals should be, as far as possible, spatially explicit across scales - form the local to the global [[15]\\u2013[19]] - and should regard spatial variability in terms of agricultural regions [[20]] and natural landscapes. As holds true for the estimation of the meteorological aspects of climate change, modelling techniques of its ecological (and economical) impacts should be used [[21]]. Global agriculture used about 2,600 km3 of water each year since the year 2000, i.e. 2% of annual precipitation over land and 17 mm of water spread evenly over the global land surface. This is a +75% increase from 1960 levels and a +400% increase from 1900 levels of irrigation. Out of the world\\u2019s croplands, 18%, i.e. about 2% of the total land surface, are irrigated and produced 40% of the world\\u2019s food. On average, the irrigated areas receive an addition of 800 mm of water each year [[22]]. About 70% of all water withdrawn worldwide from rivers and aquifers are used for agriculture [[19]]. To estimate the pressure of irrigation on the available water resources, irrigation water requirement and irrigation water withdrawal have to be assessed [[23]], including strategies for enhancing the water use efficiency [[24]]. Irrigation water requirement depends on the crop water requirement and the water naturally available to the crops (effective precipitation, soil moisture, etc.). About 2% of the global land area and 17% of the cultivated area, respectively, are irrigated. In Europe, 44% of the total water withdrawal is used for agriculture [[25]]. The total area equipped for irrigation, i.e. the total irrigable area in EU-27 accounts for roughly 16 million ha in 2003 and 15 million ha in 2007 on a total of 172 million ha of agricultural land; however, about 10 million ha was actually irrigated in 2007 [[26]]. In Germany, the area equipped for irrigation totals about 516,000 ha, and ca. 235,000 ha of them were irrigated [[23]]. In the federal state of Lower Saxony, comprising the county of Uelzen, about 3,000,000 ha, i.e. about 50% of the irrigated area of Germany is located. This irrigated area covers 11.5% of the agricultural land of Lower Saxony. In the county of Uelzen, roughly 58,000 ha are reported to be equipped for irrigation and 90% of the crop land is currently irrigated [[27]\\u2013[31]]. It is a current research task to assess whether for specific processes, regions and crops adaptation requirements will emerge under climate change conditions [[32]\\u2013[34]] to consolidate decisions on adaptation strategies to be developed and set in action. For the Northern German Lowlands, the research project \\u2018Sustainable Land Management in the North German Lowland\\u2019 (acronym, NaLaMa-nT, see http://www.nalama-nt.de/, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research) currently evaluates agricultural implications. The county of Uelzen belongs to the landscape unit of the L\\u00fcneburg Heath which is located in the federal state of Lower Saxony in Northern Germany (Figure 1) [[35]]. Due to sub-continental climate, the county of Uelzen is characterised by comparatively low precipitation amounts (in autumn and winter 7.5 mm per month lower than the average in Lower Saxony) and relatively high daily average temperatures and slightly higher evapotranspiration amounts (in summer 3 mm per month higher compared to the whole area of Lower Saxony) [[36]]. Because of a low annual rainfall of approximately 600 mm per year, Uelzen is one of the counties in Germany where irrigation agriculture plays a significant role [[33]]. Figure 1 Uelzen soil map [[40]]. 6\\u2009=\\u2009low moor; 7\\u2009=\\u2009raised moor; 10\\u2009=\\u2009gleys and alluvial soils out of sand and/or loamy sand; 11\\u2009=\\u2009gleys and alluvial soils out of sand, often mixed with loam and/or clay; 19\\u2009=\\u2009luvisols out of loamy sand and/or loamy silt, partly stony; 25\\u2009=\\u2009luvisols and pale leached soils out of slightly loamy sand; 28\\u2009=\\u2009pseudogley-luvisols and pseudogley-pale leached soils out of slightly loamy sand; 31\\u2009=\\u2009brown podzolic soils out of sand; 33\\u2009=\\u2009podzols out of sand; 46\\u2009=\\u2009lessiv\\u00e9s, pale leached and brown soils out of fine sandy silt. Full size image On average, 73 mm/m2 and year of ground water are used for irrigation in the county of Uelzen [[27]]. The guarantee of adequate water availability became a fundamental condition for the local economy [[33]]. The amount of ground water allowed to be taken for irrigation differs within the county. The local authorities have currently set ground water use for irrigation to a maximum of 79 mm/m2 and year with a moving average over 7 years in order to avoid depletion [[27]]. On average, 59.2% of the permitted amount of extracted ground water was used per year in the time period 1997 to 2004. In the low-rainfall year 2003, 125% was used. Increasing abstraction of ground water could cause negative ecological consequences, e.g. the endangerment of wetlands in the region [[33]]. The county of Uelzen belongs to the Elbe river basin which is the driest amongst the five largest river basins in Germany. There, the vulnerability against water stress in dry periods is currently a problem for agriculture. This scarcity is expected to increase with subsequent adverse impacts [[37]]. Climate change not only affects water availability but also the demand for water. If the climate in a given region gets drier and warmer, water availability will decrease and be exacerbated by increasing water demand [[16]]. Soil water content and therewith irrigation in agriculture is likely to be affected by higher temperature. Evapotranspiration sensitively depends on temperature regimes [[38]]. For temperate regions with a highly variable rainfall pattern, it is difficult to predict to which extent temperature changes will require a modification of agricultural practices. We use regional climate model data generated by STARS II [[39]] based on the RCP 8.5 scenario together with information on regional soil conditions [[40]], crop types and pattern of the current agricultural practice (by courtesy of J. Hufnagel and N. Svoboda, Leibnitz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), M\\u00fcncheberg, Germany) to assess whether it would be possible to continue the current cultivation pattern in Uelzen or whether adaptations and changes of the current irrigation pattern and crop management would be necessary to avoid critical conditions and crop losses - based on the assumption of a validity of the climate change scenario. Therefore, we developed the evaporation calculation model BewUe (Bew\\u00e4sserung (irrigation) Uelzen) to estimate the irrigation requirement using soil water content as an indicator. The presented work is part of a larger crop rotation simulation endeavour covering further Northern German regions. The computed irrigation data are essential for preparing the study of current and future water, carbon and nitrogen balances within the NaLaMa-nT project. For this purpose, the Water and Substance Simulation Model (WASMOD, [[41]]) was used. Results Irrigation requirements were calculated for all years in the reference period 1991 to 2010 and in the scenario time span 2011 to 2070. Irrigation will be applied as soon as the soil water content is lower than 20% of the available water capacity. The amount of water applied in a single irrigation event was set to 20 mm/m2. Typical examples illustrating the variability of soil water content and required irrigation are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 Soil water content and computed irrigation requirements for the cultivation of sugar beet. Soil water content as simulated by model BewUe and computed irrigation requirements for the cultivation of sugar beet. Results are shown for (a) the high-rainfall year 2054, (b) the average-rainfall year 2047 and (c) the low-rainfall year 2044 of the Tmax scenario run. The years were selected by the 10, 50 and 90% quantile for the annual rainfall in the time period 1951 to 2070 for scenario run Tmax of the RCP 8.5 scenario. Full size image As climate conditions in terms of daily average temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration show a high variance between different years (Figure 3) in all scenario runs; irrigation requirements also differ between the considered years (Figure 2). There was no irrigation necessary in the high-rainfall year 2054 of scenario run Tmax. The precipitation water was sufficient to grow sugar beet in this year. Two irrigation arrangements were necessary in the average-rainfall year 2047 of scenario run Tmax. With every irrigation arrangement, the soil water content increases by +2%. In the dry year 2044 of scenario run Tmax, nine irrigation arrangements were necessary to keep the soil water content sufficiently above 20% of the available field capacity. Irrigation would be still required late in the year on day 262. Figure 3 Development of the daily average temperature, annual rainfall and evapotranspiration in Uelzen. Development of the daily average temperature (a), annual rainfall (b) and evapotranspiration (c) in the selected grid cell in the County of Uelzen (Northern Germany) during the reference period 1991 to 2010 and the different scenario runs Tmin, Tmed and Tmax (time period 2011 to 2070). Full size image The irrigation requirement is also related to the crop-specific evapotranspiration during the cultivation phase: crop species with a high irrigation requirement like sugar beet and potato show the highest total evapotranspiration amount (330 and 287 mm) during the irrigation phase compared to winter barley and winter rye (182 and 225 mm) with a lower irrigation requirement (Figure 4). Figure 4 Development of cumulated evapotranspiration rate for different grassland types and crop species during irrigation phase. Evapotranspiration was simulated for a soil depth of 0 to 60 cm of soil type 31 (Figure 1) using WASMOD [[41]] in the average-rainfall year 2047 of the scenario run Tmax with two irrigation arrangements on days 228 and 240. Crop management specifications were set according to regional standards (N. Svoboda, personal communication, based on crop surveys executed at the Leibnitz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) and provided to the NaLaMa-nT project data base). Curves are drawn for the irrigation relevant time span (until 3 weeks before harvest, see Methods section and Table 1). Full size image Figure 5 summarises the irrigation requirements during the considered time period. Accordingly, the irrigation requirement will increase for sugar beet, potato, winter wheat, winter rye and summer barley in the scenario runs Tmed (Kendall\\u2019s tau b\\u2009=\\u2009+0.306, +0.266 and +0.262) and Tmax (b\\u2009=\\u2009+0.374, +0.385 and 0. + 311) as average temperatures increase. The longer the crop remains on the field, the higher the irrigation requirement is and will be, respectively. For field crops, which are harvested early (e.g. winter barley), the irrigation requirement remains on a comparatively low level (b\\u2009=\\u2009\\u22120.13 in scenario run Tmin, +0.87 in scenario run Tmed and +0.103 in scenario run Tmax). The irrigation requirement is decreasing in the scenario run Tmin for all field crops because of a decreasing evapotranspiration and a slight increase in precipitation (b\\u2009=\\u2009+0.006 for sugar beet, \\u22120.022 for potato and \\u22120.139 for winter wheat, winter rye and summer barley). Because of a high variance, the Kendall\\u2019s tau b as correlation coefficient and the coefficients of determination (R2) show low or, at most, medium values for all different field crops and scenario runs. The irrigation requirement is directly linked to the climate conditions (temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration), which also show a high variance between the different years in all scenario runs (Figure 3). Figure 5 Irrigation requirements as simulated by the model BewUe. Results are shown for the following field crops in the different scenario runs: (a) sugar beet, (b) potato, (c) winter wheat, winter rye, summer barley and (d) winter barley. The linear regression functions and the coefficients of determination (R2) obtained for the different crop species in the different scenario runs are also shown. Full size image To compute the moving average for the year 1991, the values for the six previous years 1985 to 1990 have been considered. For the year 2011, the values for the years 2005 to 2010 of the reference period 1991 to 2010 were considered. The simulated crop rotation starts with the cultivation of sugar beet in the year 1991. The crop rotation sugar beet-potato-winter rye-winter barley is most common in the county of Uelzen and in particular on areas labelled as soil type 31 (brown podzolic soil out of slightly loamy, slightly silty sand and sand) (Figure 1; J. Hufnagel and N. Svoboda, ZALF, M\\u00fcncheberg, Germany, personal communication). In particular, the cultivation of sugar beet and potato required large amounts of irrigation water. Figure 6 demonstrates that the irrigation requirement is likely to increase in the years after 2030 in the scenario run Tmax for this crop rotation compared to the reference period 1991 to 2010. The allowed amount of irrigation water of 79 mm/m2 and year in a moving average over 7 years is likely to be exhausted in several years after the year 2064. In the reference period 1991 to 2010 and in the scenario runs Tmin and Tmed, the required amount of irrigation water was always lower than 60 mm/m2 and year in a moving average over 7 years. In scenario run Tmed, the irrigation requirement was similar to the reference period, but in some years (2052, 2063, 2065), the moving average was slightly higher than during the reference period 1991 to 2010. In scenario run Tmin, the irrigation requirement is decreasing compared to the reference period 1991 to 2010 because of a slight increase in precipitation and a decreasing evapotranspiration. Figure 6 Comparison of the moving average for a 7-year period and the required amount of irrigation water. The comparison was simulated by the model BewUe for the crop rotation sugar beet-potato-winter rye-winter barley. Results are shown for (a) the reference period (1991 to 2010) and scenario runs Tmin (b), Tmed (c) and Tmax (d) (time period 2011 to 2070). Full size image Discussion The amount of water extracted for irrigation depends on climate and soil characteristics, on the political and economic boundary conditions, and on farmers\\u2019 management decisions such as crops cultivated and techniques applied, as for instance, irrigation [[42]]. The results of this simulation study conducted in Northern Germany (County of Uelzen) show that together with increasing temperature and evapotranspiration, the irrigation requirements are likely to increase also (Figures 3, 5, and 6). On the basis of the scenario calculations, higher irrigation levels will most likely be required in the future (except scenario run Tmin). This could exceed local availability of ground water. Implications could be, on the one hand, the endangerment of regional wetlands [[33]] when the ground water level should substantially decrease due to irrigation water extraction. On the other hand, crop damage or crop failure could become more common - if the land use management would not be adapted. Both, changes in average climate conditions during the main growing season and climate variability, particularly heat waves and droughts, affect crop growth. The fitting capacity to cope with climate change depends on the crop type and ecological boundary conditions [[43]]. Thus, additional irrigation requirements can be avoided or reduced by a reasonably adapted choice of the cultivated field crops [[33]]. With an accompanying climate change, dates for sowing could be shifted - to a limited extent - to earlier times in the year to use the natural water supply during the wet months in spring more efficiently [[34]]. At present, irrigation is mainly applied using long-throw sprinkler [[33]]. If irrigation efficiency would be improved by the application of techniques with lower evaporation losses (e.g. drip irrigation), the potential problems might be reduced. In some places the use of surface water for irrigation could also be adequately adjusted and contribute to the irrigation requirements [[33]]. In general, scenario data - like the results shown in this paper - go along with uncertainties and are just adequate to point out possible future trends. The uncertainties in the presented calculation approach originate amongst others from climate projection data, which are linked to uncertainties themselves. For example, the used scenario data seems to predict too low evapotranspiration amounts (Figure 3). This implies that the future irrigation requirement could be even higher than the calculated values indicate (Figures 5 and 6). The presented results in particular show how irrigation requirement in the county of Uelzen could develop in the future based on the employed scenario specifications. The presented calculation approach can be understood as being based on conservative assumptions. In reality, irrigation arrangements are likely to be done at even higher soil water contents (e.g. at 30% to 50% of the available field capacity) and with higher amounts of irrigation water than 20 mm/m2 and irrigation event. This leads to the assumption that the computed irrigation levels are even lower than they actually could be in the future. In a few exceptional years, the soil water content might be lower at starting day 107 than the default start value due to a noticeably dry winter. In these cases the irrigation requirement could be higher than the calculated values indicate. Nevertheless, it could be shown that as by 2010, assuming the worst case scenario from down-scaled global climate change models, 62% to 80% of agricultural land within a Central European region could shift towards a new agroclimatic class and 98% by 2050, respectively [[44]]. It is important to emphasise that irrigation requirements cannot be directly derived from climate modelling. In fact, outcomes of climate modelling need to be linked with data on soil conditions, cultivation patterns and eventually also economic considerations in order to assess future sustainability of particular crops to be grown and the resulting requirements of external water input. Calculations were done with evapotranspiration data for grassland [[45]] based on simulated climate data [[39]]. This leads to uncertainties because the evapotranspiration for grassland can differ from agricultural sites depending on plant development stage and crop species. We checked this by computing evapotranspiration with a standalone model approach (Figure 4). The WASMOD results show that the evapotranspiration for sugar beet and potato differs only to a relatively low extent compared to grassland (approximately +9% and \\u221210% on average during the irrigation phase). The variance for winter barley and winter rye is higher compared to grassland (approximately +34% and +39% on average during the irrigation phase). As winter barley and winter rye are harvested early in the year (days 177 and 198), this affects a time period when irrigation requirement is relatively low as the soil retains water from the winter period. The calculation of crop-specific transpiration in combination with plant phenology is appropriate [[46]]; however, it would only gradually reduce remaining uncertainties. The current approach was based on Penman-Monteith calculations [[45]] for site-specific conditions. In future research activities, it will be intended to expand the calculations to additional regions, soil types and crop rotations. This would be of high relevance since the European agriculture is characterised by high productivity [[47]] and accounts for 50% of the global trade food products [[7]]. Furthermore, the presented results for irrigation amounts obtained using the BewUe programme should be cross-checked with observation data for single field crops and different years. But such observation data are not available yet. Additionally, further climate change scenarios are of interest and should be used to improve understanding of the possible future irrigation requirement. Conclusions The results show that it is reasonable to expect that regional implications of global climate change will affect evapotranspiration as an important aspect in crop cultivation. Ground water availability for irrigation allows, under the given conditions, a short-term buffering towards extremes. Based on the scenario calculations, it can be expected that the current agricultural practice in the county of Uelzen will not be directly limited by regional climatic alterations. However, in the more distant future, where climate change is on the one side to become more pronounced and more uncertain to be predicted on the other side, additional measures might be necessary to prevent higher frequencies of crop failures in some years. Changes in irrigation techniques or adaptation of crop rotation types are amongst these measures. The presented work shows how irrigation requirement can be calculated combining regional projections of climate conditions specified as long-term \\u2018scenario-weather\\u2019, combined with crop requirements and management, and soil conditions. The results show that it is likely that agriculture in the county of Uelzen has to be adapted to increasing irrigation requirement in the future, if conditions develop as assumed in the employed scenarios. However, further research will give evidence whether changes either in institutional and market conditions or in climatic conditions will dominantly influence the development of agriculture illustrated by a comparable example of adaptation for maize production in Switzerland [[42]]. Since soil climate is expected to change significantly even in Central Europe, \\u2018more attention should be paid to studying the impacts of climate change on soil climate\\u2019 [[48]], i.e. soil temperature and hydric soil regimes. Methods Data basis Homogenised daily climate observation and scenario data for the climate change scenario Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 were provided by the Potsdam Institut f\\u00fcr Klimafolgenforschung (PIK) to the NaLaMa-nT project consortium for a 10\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910 km grid and the time periods 1951 to 2010 [[36]] and 2011 to 2070 [[39]], respectively (see Figure 3). Observation data of the German weather service [[36]] were checked, homogenised and interpolated to the 10-km grid [[49]]. The scenario data are generated by STARS II [[39]] and interpolated to the same grid. Our calculations were done for one grid cell located in the County of Uelzen (Figure 1), which was selected because it has the highest representativity for the county of Uelzen. Data for this grid cell show the lowest sum of deviations for the parameters of daily mean temperature, precipitation, and global radiation compared to the county average. To assess the RCP 8.5 scenario of the STARS II model scenario, backward-extrapolated scenario data for the time period 1951 to 2010 were provided and were compared to the observation data. The RCP 8.5 scenario is the most fierce emission scenario in the recent IPCC assessment [[1],[50],[51]]. Nevertheless, the RCP 8.5 scenario is surpassed by actually observed emissions [[52]]. It is up to the year 2060 the most similar emission scenario to the so far widely used SRES A1B scenario [[1]]. The used STARS II projections (Tmin, Tmed, Tmax) were driven by different temperature gradients. For each projection, the median run - based on the change of climate water balance - of 100 model runs was selected. The three projections Tmin, Tmed and Tmax are based on results from the GCM models INM-CM4 (Institute of Numerical Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia, 2009), ECHAM6 (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany, 2012) and ACCESS1.0 (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Melbourne, Australia, 2013). They represent a low, median and high temperature increase for the RCP 8.5 scenario. To calculate changes in soil humidity, we used additional data for evapotranspiration, which were available for grassland correspondent to the guidelines of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) computed by the Penman-Monteith equation [[45]] but not for single field crops (homogenised data source for the time period 1951 to 2010 [[36]] and scenario data for the time period 2011 to 2070 [[39]]). The scenario input data are shown in Figure 3. We used WASMOD [[41]] to compare the evapotranspiration amounts of different grassland types and crop species. They are in the expected order of magnitude, considering the condition that actual plant transpiration is a highly variable process leading to large standard deviations when measured in repeated experiments [[53]] (Figure 4). The daily average temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration show a high variance within the different years for the reference period 1991 to 2010 and in all scenario runs (Figure 3). This means that e.g. the general increase in temperature in scenario run Tmax is also interrupted by several years with low daily mean temperatures. The daily mean temperature is increasing in the time period 2011 to 2070 in the scenario runs Tmed and Tmax with +1.3 and +1.7\\u00b0C in the time period 2011 to 2070, respectively. In the scenario run Tmin, there is a minor increase of +0.9\\u00b0C on average. The annual evapotranspiration is +5.6 and +28.4 mm per year on average higher in the scenario runs Tmed and Tmax compared to the reference period 1991 to 2010. In the scenario run Tmin, the annual evapotranspiration is decreasing with \\u22128.7 mm per year on average compared to the reference period 1991 to 2010. Concerning the annual rainfall, there is no clear trend indicating changes compared to the current situation. The annual rainfall is 654.4 mm per year during the reference period 1991 to 2010. On average, the annual rainfall is increasing in all scenario runs with +44.7 in Tmin, +45.0 in Tmed and +14.1 mm per year in Tmax compared to the reference period 1991 to 2010. Several climate scenarios also show that the main amount of the yearly precipitation will shift from the growing season (spring and summer) towards the time outside the vegetation period (i.e. winter) [[33]] or that the annual precipitation will even decrease [[1]]. This could also influence irrigation requirement. Figure 3 also show that the modelled scenario data seem to be lower than in reality by comparing the measured climate data and the backward-extrapolated scenario data for the reference period 1991 to 2010. Temperature (Figure 3a) and especially evapotranspiration (Figure 3c) are decreasing after 2010 compared to the measured data in the reference period. Thus, irrigation requirement - calculated with observation data for the reference period and scenario data for the time period 2011 to 2070 - could be even higher in years after 2010 than the calculated values indicate. Soil data of the land use-specific soil map of Germany [[40]] were used. The county of Uelzen is dominated by sandy soil types with low amounts of silt and/or clay (Figure 1). Because of the coarse-grained texture, these soils have a low available field capacity (approximately 17% to 22% in a soil depth of 0 to 30 cm) [[40]]. Soils in eastern Lower Saxony show a soil water deficit in some places during the growing season [[54]]. The information on the current agricultural practice was provided by the Leibnitz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (N. Svoboda, personal communication, based on crop surveys executed at the ZALF and provided to the NaLaMa-nT project data base). The dominant crops are listed in Table 1. The most common crop rotation is sugar beet-potato-winter rye-winter barley, covering 11.9% of the agricultural area. Table 1 Crop plants grown in Uelzen with dates for harvesting and starting time of maturity Full size table Methodological approach For the calculations we used data for soil type 31 (brown podzolic soil out of slightly loamy, slightly silty sand and sand), which is the soil type most common in the county\\u2019s agricultural area (47%) (Figure 1). Soil type 31 has a field capacity of 24% (which is equivalent to a soil water content of 240 l/m3), an available water capacity of 17% and a wilting point of 7% (which is equivalent to 70 l/m3 of stagnant water) in a soil depth of 0 to 60 cm [[40]]. The soil depth of 0 to 60 cm was assumed to be the rooting zone of the soil and therefore the relevant part of the soil considered in our calculations. Soil and climate data were used in the model BewUe written by B. Breckling using the programming language SIMULA [[55]]. The model functionality encompasses reading input data for a number of successive years and writing results into according annual output files conditionally adding irrigation when soil water content falls beneath the given threshold, i.e. it computes irrigation requirements including the day(s) of the year on which irrigation is required for single field crops and different scenario runs (Tmin, Tmed and Tmax) of the RCP 8.5 climate scenario. Irrigation requirements depend on the soil water content. We assumed that irrigation will be applied as soon as the soil water content becomes lower than 20% of the available water capacity, equivalent to a soil water content of 10.4% (which is equivalent to a soil water content of 104 l/m3 including 70 l/m3 of stagnant water and 34 l/m3\\u2009=\\u200920% of available field capacity). The amount of water applied in a single irrigation event was set to 20 mm/m2. The main model functional is outlined in the pseudocode given in Equation 1. (1) The maximum soil water content is defined as\\u2009\\u2264\\u2009240 l/m3 (soil water content at field capacity) and the minimum soil water content as\\u2009\\u2265\\u200970 l/m3 (amount of stagnant water). In the first step, we determined the time period, in which irrigation is necessary (irrigation phase) and in which the soil water content should be computed by the use of the SIMULA model. Therefore, the soil water content was calculated for average conditions with the climate observation data for the time period 1951 to 2010 and the Tmed scenario run for the time period 2011 to 2070. For this calculation, the soil water content was set to 240 l/m3 on the first day (1 January 1951) assuming that the soil is fully water saturated at this time. To compute the average development of the soil water content, the daily values were averaged over the time period 1951 to 2070 (Figure 7). Figure 7 Average soil water content for the soil type 31 of the B\\u00dcK 1000. Average soil water content for the soil type 31 (brown podzolic soil out of slightly loamy, slightly silty sand and sand) of the B\\u00dcK 1000 [[40]] in a soil depth of 0 to 60 cm in the time period 1951 to 2070 (for observation data and scenario run Tmed). Full size image The soil water content decreases noticeably after day 107 in an average year (Figure 7). In average years, irrigation should not be required before day 107. The climatic water balance gets negative from day 107 onwards because of an increasing evapotranspiration that is not compensated by precipitation. Thus, the calculation of the soil water content within the BewUe model was set to start at day 107 with an actual value of 224.9 l/m3. Starting time and start value are considered representative for average climate conditions in the county of Uelzen and were used to compute the irrigation requirement for all different scenario runs, years and crop species. Irrigation was considered unnecessary during the maturation phase of the field crops. In general, maturation takes between 2 and 4 weeks depending on the yearly course of the weather (J. Hufnagel and N. Svoboda, ZALF, M\\u00fcncheberg, Germany, personal communication). In our calculations, we assumed that maturation starts 3 weeks before harvesting in all years and different scenario runs. Harvest dates differ between the relevant crops (Table 1). Thus, the soil water content and irrigation requirement for e.g. sugar beet were computed from day 107 with a start value of 224.9 l/m3 until day 269 (i.e. start of maturation). The crop plants listed in Table 1 grow on 90% of the currently cultivated agricultural area in the county of Uelzen. In particular, the cultivation of sugar beet and potato, which are grown on 46% of the whole agricultural crop land, is linked to a high irrigation requirement [[27]]. Temporal trends for irrigation requirements are secured statistically by computing the Kendall\\u2019s tau b as correlation coefficient (Figure 5). The Mann-Kendall test is the adequate method for non-parametric tests and it is not influenced by seasonal effects.

In the context of climate change, drought has been recognised as one of the most severe threats for agricultural production since absence of water is one of the most limiting factors for the growth of plants. In this study, a regional system for soil moisture prediction based on ERA5 climate reanalysis dataset, an open-source meteorological dataset issued by Copernicus Climate Change Service, was developed. It consisted of the relevant meteorological parameters for Serbia, during the period 2011\\u20132020. Daily values of maximum and minimum air temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit were used as features, and they were fed to recurrent neural network in order to predict volumetric soil moisture for three days ahead. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was designed and trained at a regional scale using the data from the 2011\\u20132016 period, at 28 locations that cover four major soil types. Validation was done on 2017\\u20132018 data and LSTM was compared with a statistical forecasting technique and a classical machine learning approach. Evaluation was done with error measures commonly used in literature. The resulting network yielded the lowest errors and proved to have good generalisation properties. The system was tested from September 2019 to April 2020 using short-range weather forecasts of Yr service. It will present the cornerstone of the irrigation scheduling service in AgroSense.rs, the Serbian national platform for digital agriculture.

Introduction As a consequence of global warming, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have increased across many land systems in the world. This is particularly the case with heatwaves and droughts, especially in the drought-prone regions of the Mediterranean (Shukla et al., 2019). Weather patterns in Serbia are changing, thus affecting the air temperature and precipitation regimes on the annual basis (Mimi\\u0107, Mihailovi\\u0107, & Kapor, 2017). In the 21st century, warmer and drier conditions can be expected for all reference soil groups in Serbia, with an increase in mean annual soil temperature (up to 3.8 \\u00b0C) and a decrease in mean annual soil moisture (up to 11.3%) (Mihailovi\\u0107 et al., 2016). Additionally, a shift in climate zones is expected, which will influence the conditions during the growing season and the total agricultural production in Serbia (Mihailovi\\u0107 et al., 2015). The only way to overcome this challenging issue is through the use of irrigation, as a mitigation measure, or through revenue-protection insurance schemes. Soil moisture is one of the essential climate variables according to World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It is very important in agriculture since it indicates the level of water available for crops, especially in dry conditions during the growing season (Mannocchi, Todisco, & Vergni, 2004). Insufficient amount of water in soil causes stress in crops and adversely affects plant growth and development (Ahmad, Malagoli, Wirtz, & Hell, 2016). Water uptake and evaporation occur predominately in topsoil, where the cumulative root length per unit of soil volume is the highest, and hence the path to water extraction and the hydraulic resistance are the lowest (Lobet, Couvreur, Meunier, Javaux, & Draye, 2014). Topsoil is the upper soil layer, usually reaching the depth of 13\\u201325 cm, composed of organic matter, water, air and mineral particles (Marsh, 2010). Low water uptake by the plants happens when soil moisture content is close to permanent wilting point, and it depends on the soil texture as well (Fern\\u00e1ndez & Clothier, 2009). Thus, it is necessary to have reliable information on soil moisture content for timely and optimal irrigation scheduling. Soil moisture sensors can provide this information, but unfortunately due to the high price of equipment, this technology is not available to a wider population of farmers. Various applications of deep learning in agriculture and food production, including soil moisture prediction, have already been thoroughly examined (Kamilaris & Prenafeta-Bold\\u00fa, 2018). Different neural network models, able to predict soil moisture dynamics with various input requirements, were presented and discussed in literature (Zheng et al., 2019). Comparison of machine learning techniques such as Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for prediction of soil moisture was performed on datasets collected from different online repositories (Prakash, Sharma, & Sahu, 2018). Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems, a technique that combines advantages from fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks, was used for making a decision-support system (DSS) for irrigation management in agriculture, based on weather variables and soil parameters from the sensors (Navarro-Hell\\u00edn, Mart\\u00ednez-del Rincon, Domingo-Miguel, Soto-Valles, & Torres-S\\u00e1nchez, 2016). Deep Belief Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron were combined with macroscopic cellular automata in order to predict spatiotemporal probability of soil moisture content at the depth of 4 cm using irrigation data with many dynamic weather and soil variables (Song et al., 2016), where former showed better results, compared to the observations. Cai, Zheng, Zhang, Zhangzhong, and Xue (2019) discussed that selecting appropriate meteorological parameters as the input features of the model can significantly improve the accuracy of soil moisture prediction. In training a Deep Neural Network Regression model, the initial soil moisture was used as an input feature as well, and the obtained results were comparable to other models applied in Beijing, China (Cai et al., 2019). Feed-forward Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were tested for one-day-ahead predictions of soil moisture content, which was used for predictive irrigation scheduling (Adeyemi, Grove, Peets, Domun, & Norton, 2018). Daily values of air temperature, relative humidity, net radiation, wind speed, precipitation and volumetric soil moisture content were used to build the model which requires past and present meteorological inputs and past and present soil moisture content values. The downside of this methodology is the lag in predictions, as the changes in soil moisture are in line with the observations but shifted for one day. The authors commented as well that the predictive system should be extended to include rainfall forecasts. LSTM has been used for optimal irrigation prescription on an hourly basis, with training data collected from a precision irrigation study, and this system showed very good prediction capabilities (Jimenez, Ortiz, Bondesan, Morata, & Damianidis, 2019). However, the factor that hinders the scalability of this approach is the necessity of detailed hourly data from the sensors. The objective of this study was to develop a deep learning system for prediction of soil moisture for three days ahead using open-source data, the most essential input variables and the weather forecast from Yr service including rainfall. This methodology does not require the data from soil sensors. LSTM network was trained to be robust for different soil types, thus applicable on a regional scale and not only for a particular field. Since it is using globally available open-source data from ERA5, the system is scalable for other regions as well. Such system would help farmers make informed decisions about the time of irrigation, thus increasing their yields, reducing the risk of the production and saving the resources, specifically for the drought conditions. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Datasets In order to achieve operability of the system throughout the region of interest, as well as to facilitate its potential scale-up, we relied on free, globally available data sources. In this way, a model trained on a number of points could be applied over a larger area with similar climate and soil characteristics. Although local calibration data may be required for scale-up over a region with different characteristics, the same methodology and system architecture that were developed for the initial region can be used in a novel environment. The two open data sources used in this study are Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), for historical weather data, and Yr, for weather forecasts. C3S provides information about the climate from ERA5, the fifth generation reanalysis of the global climate produced by European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Reanalysis combines observations from across the world with modelled data to produce a complete and globally consistent dataset using the laws of physics and complex simulations. Data assimilation is done with horizontal resolution of 0.25\\u00b0 \\u00d7 0.25\\u00b0 (approximately 25 km at mid-latitudes) and hourly data are produced (C3S, 2017). There are four soil layers in ERA5, segregated by the depth: the first (0\\u20137 cm), second (7\\u201328 cm), third (28\\u2013100 cm) and fourth (100\\u2013289 cm). Based on the ERA5 literature, for the vegetation type that represents crops from mixed farming, 21% of the root system is in the first layer, 41% is in the second layer (the largest part), 31% is in the third layer, while only 4% is in the fourth layer (ECMWF, 2016), and thus the second layer is of the highest interest in agriculture. Soil types are classified based on soil texture as follows: 1 \\u2013 coarse, 2 \\u2013 medium, 3 \\u2013 medium fine, 4 \\u2013 fine. Characteristic values of volumetric soil moisture for different textures are given in Table 1. Table 1. Values of soil moisture at saturation (\\u03b8sat), field capacity (\\u03b8fc), permanent wilting point (\\u03b8pwp) and plant available water (\\u03b8paw), for different soil texture (van Genuchten, 1980).

In this study, the daily values of meteorological variables, i.e., maximum and minimum 2 m temperature (\\u00b0C), total precipitation (mm), vapour pressure deficit (hPa) and average volumetric soil moisture content in the second layer (m3 m\\u22123) were used. Vapour pressure deficit was calculated as D = E(T) \\u2212 E(Td) where E stands for the saturation vapour pressure following Magnus's formula (Junzeng, Qi, Shizhang, & Yanmei, 2012), T is the average temperature and Td average dewpoint temperature. This variable reflects the rate of evapotranspiration, and the higher values force the plant to draw more water from the soil. Table 2.

These include forecasts of precipitation, temperature at 2 m and dewpoint temperature at 2 m, at a spatial resolution of 2 km, and an hourly temporal resolution. For the purpose of testing the developed network, forecast data were collected from September 2019 until April 2020, at the locations of 28 meteorological stations described above. 2.2. Recurrent neural networks RNNs are widely used for time series prediction, handwriting recognition, natural language processing and speech recognition, since they show excellent performance in \\u201csequence-to-sequence\\u201d modelling (Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courville, 2016). RNNs are also known as neural networks with memory because they are capable of learning dependencies along sequences and produce output taking into consideration the previous output, or what they learned from the input in the previous time step (Burkov, 2019). In other words, RNNs model dynamical systems where xt represents the input at time t and ht, ht\\u22121 represent hidden states at time t, t\\u22121, respectively (Chen, 2016). Function F is used for nonlinear mapping between consecutive time steps, as described in Eq. (1) (1) h t = F ( h t \\u2212 1 , x t ) RNNs typically have vanishing gradient problem, i.e., weights are becoming irreversibly smaller in every iteration, which slows down or completely stops the training. For this reason, LSTM networks have been developed. With a memory cell and the gates that control which information passes in and passes out, LSTM prevents backpropagation from drastically decreasing the weight changes during training and keeps the constant error flow. This architecture lets LSTM to learn longer-term dependencies, the network can deal with unlimited number of states, and it generalises well (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). In this study, the hyperopt technique (Bergstra, Yamins, & Cox, 2013) was used on validation dataset to determine the optimal hyper-parameters in the experiments. The following parameter grid was searched: number of neurons ranged from 10 to 60, number of epochs ranged from 40 to 100, batch size ranged from 128 to 512, dropout rate ranged from 0.1 to 0.5, recurrent dropout rate ranged from 0.1 to 0.5, while the choice for the activation function was between hyperbolic tangent, rectified linear unit (ReLU) and exponential linear unit (ELU). After 30 iterations the optimal parameters were found. A stacked LSTM with 4 layers and 40 neurons in each layer followed by a dense layer with 3 neurons (Fig. 1) was built. For the activation function the hyperbolic tangent was used while for weight initialisation the Xavier normal initialiser was used (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). During the training period, the optimal hyper-parameters were used, i.e., batch size was 128, dropout regularisation with the rate of 0.12, while the recurrent dropout rate was 0.25. This means that in each iteration some fraction of neurons were randomly deactivated, which helped to avoid overfitting and maintain a similar convergence rate of both training and validation errors over time. Training and validation procedure was done through 60 epochs with dropout and Adam optimiser, while mean absolute error (MAE) was selected as the loss function. The LSTM network was trained with meteorological data and prediction of soil moisture was done for three days ahead.

Computational setup The study was implemented using Python and open-source libraries, including Keras library, commonly used for neural networks on top of TensorFlow, an end-to-end open-source machine learning platform. The network was compared to ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), a traditional statistical forecasting technique (Hewamalage, Bergmeir, & Bandara, 2021) and Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001), a classical machine learning technique, which has been widely used in water science applications recently (Tyralis, Papacharalampous, & Langousis, 2019). All the models were trained for the period 2011\\u20132016 and applied with the time step of three days. To build the models,daily values of meteorological variables from ERA5 were used. ARIMA was trained on individual time series of soil moisture, for each meteorological station separately. For this reason, the results of ARIMA predictions were averaged across all time series and a single value was obtained for each error metric. RF and LSTM used maximum and minimum 2 m temperature, total precipitation and vapour pressure deficit as the input data. Initially 60 input days were selected, which is taken from the literature (van den Hurk et al., 2012), although the performance of the network was tested with shorter time period of 45, 30 and 15 days. RF and LSTM were trained across the time series from all 28 meteorological stations jointly, whereas RF used the input data as a single vector while LSTM used four different time series (Fig. 2). Validation was done for the period 2017\\u20132018 and, according to its mode of operation, the statistical model was retrained during the runtime, i.e., along the time series. The year 2017 in Serbia was warm and dry, with the summer drier than normal compared to the reference period 1981\\u20132010 (HIDMET, 2018), which resulted in agricultural drought. The year 2018 was marked by several climatological records in Serbia: the warmest year since the record-keeping began (1951), the warmest spring and the warmest April, while on the other hand, the summer was wetter than normal, with a lot of precipitation in June and July (HIDMET, 2019). In order to test the predictive model with Yr weather forecast, instead of only the ERA5 data, a separate dataset that comprised of the ERA5 historical records and the Yr's three-day forecasts from September 2019 to April 2020 (Fig. 2) was formed. The results of the models were evaluated using MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error), SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and MAE, metrics commonly used in the forecasting literature (Armstrong, 2001; Hewamalage et al., 2021; Hyndman & Koehler, 2006). Error metrics are given with the following equations: (2) MASE = 1 n \\u2211 i = 1 n | M i \\u2212 O i | 1 n \\u2212 1 \\u2211 i = 2 n | O i \\u2212 O i \\u2212 1 | (3) SMAPE = 100 % n \\u2211 i = 1 n | M i \\u2212 O i | ( | M i | + | O i | ) / 2 (4) MAE = 1 n \\u2211 i = 1 n | M i \\u2212 O i | where M stands for modelled and O for observed values (here referring to ERA5 data), n represents the number of samples, i refers to a specific sample, while the denominator in Eq. (2) is the MAE of the one-step \\u201cna\\u00efve forecast method\\u201d, which uses the actual value from the prior period as the forecast. MASE and SMAPE are dimensionless metrics while MAE has the same unit as considered variable, which is soil moisture in this case, given in m3 m\\u22123.

Schematic diagram of the input data structure for all the models, where ma is the number of days in soil moisture time series used in ARIMA, while m is the number of input days and n represents four input variables used in RF and LSTM. 3. Results An experiment was performed to train the LSTM model with different number of input days ranging from 15 to 60, with a 15-day step, in order to predict soil moisture three days ahead. The aim of the experiment was to examine if it is possible to decrease the time window of input data without compromising the quality of the prediction. However, validation showed that as the time window decreased, the error measures increased (Table 3). Thus, the initially selected value of 60 input days was opted. The same number of input days was used for training RF model as well. Table 3. Error measures averaged for all the stations (with standard deviation in round brackets) obtained for different number of input days used for training LSTM. Input days MASE SMAPE MAE 60 3.99 (1.28) 19.76 (9.10) 0.021 (0.006) 45 4.19 (1.35) 20.39 (8.10) 0.024 (0.006) 30 4.78 (1.35) 22.19 (8.80) 0.024 (0.006) 15 5.70 (1.49) 24.85 (9.02) 0.029 (0.006) The performance of the LSTM model was compared to RF and ARIMA, which were used as a benchmark and LSTM expressed the lowest error values (Table 4), with SMAPE less than 20%. Being a univariate method in which one model is built for each time series ARIMA has limited scaling potential and requires frequent retraining (Hewamalage et al., 2021). Theoretically, this univariate approach could be used, but only for the regular grid points of ERA5, although the fact that ERA5 data are available only with a delay of two months is making the traditional approach incapable for practical applications. On the other hand, the LSTM and RF models were trained across all time series and one general model was built in both cases, that could cover the whole region of interest. This model can thus be used at any location in Serbia with reliable weather data. However, RF as a method does not consider time sequence of the features, whereby the dynamics of atmospheric conditions is of great importance for soil moisture regimes, making LSTM a physically more realistic model. Table 4. Error measures averaged for all the stations (with standard deviation in round brackets) obtained for different prediction methods on the validation dataset. Method MASE SMAPE MAE ARIMA 10.72 (2.85) 123.49 (16.64) 0.055 (0.009) RF 5.93 (1.42) 25.88 (8.76) 0.031 (0.005) LSTM 3.99 (1.28) 19.76 (9.10) 0.021 (0.006) To discuss the significance of the error measures obtained for the different models, the range of soil moisture values given in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 3 has to be considered. For all the soil types, the range between minimum and maximum soil moisture is around 0.3 m3 m\\u22123, although soils with coarse and medium texture have lower minimum values reaching 0.05 m3 m\\u22123 while soils with fine texture have higher minimum values. Since MAE has the unit of m3 m\\u22123, the same as soil moisture, it is the most suitable for comparison between the models. Average MAE for ARIMA is 0.055 (almost 20% of the range), for RF it is 0.031 (above 10% of the range) while for LSTM it is 0.021 (7% of the range), showing much better performance of LSTM when compared to ARIMA and slightly better performance when compared to RF, however this difference can be essential in the case of dry conditions, when soil moisture values are reaching the wilting point.

In this study, the predominant soil type had medium soil texture and 20 stations out of 28 belonged to the group 2 (Table 2). Nevertheless, for this soil type median of soil moisture varied a lot in the training dataset and the outliers with low values were present at five stations, which was particularly evident at station S9 (Fig. 3). Error measures for all the stations in Serbia are presented in Table 5. The highest MASE error was obtained for station S9 where the learning process of LSTM was clearly affected by the outliers. Another high error was obtained for station S11, whereby both stations belong to soil type with medium texture. For all other stations, the values of MASE were less than six and for some stations MASE was almost one. The range of MAE values was between 0.010 and 0.031, showing that LSTM was able to learn soil moisture dynamics for all the soil types at various altitudes, thus verifying the generalisation capability of the network.

Soil moisture predictions using Yr's three-day forecasts (LSTM + Yr) and predictions with ERA5 data (LSTM) were compared to original reanalysis data of soil moisture (ERA5). Error measures were quite similar in both cases, having reasonably low values. The selected results are depicting soil moisture at four stations which belong to different soil types (Fig. 4), where S3 is 1, S7 is 2, S5 is 3 and S14 is 4 (Table 2). Visual inspection shows that the alignment between the values is notable, even though there are some \\u201cfalse\\u201d spikes in soil moisture when using Yr forecast due to the uncertainty coming from the weather forecast itself, especially at the end of the prognostic period.

Discussion The experts suggested that a national drought policy should be directed toward reducing the risk by raising the awareness with reliable information (Wilhite, 2011). Timely monitoring of the agricultural drought is extremely important for developing an early warning system which can minimise the losses due to drought (Boken, 2005). Satellite observations of surface soil moisture along with the calculated vegetation and water indices can be used in an effective way for monitoring dry conditions in the fields with proper spatial resolution (Chandrasekar, Sesha Sai, Roy, & Dwevedi, 2010), although the temporal resolution of five or more days and the presence of cloud cover can be a limiting factor. In this study, a data-driven system for calculation of soil moisture on a regional scale using open-source weather data was developed, which is able to provide timely information regardless of the atmospheric conditions. Shukla, McNally, Husak, and Funk (2014) developed a forecast system that simulates soil moisture scenarios using hydrological model which was run with seasonal climate scenarios for the upcoming growing season. The purpose of that system was to create an agricultural outlook of the drought in food-insecure regions of the developing world, although it was clearly affected by the uncertainty of seasonal forecasts (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2009). For that reason, the focus was on short-range weather forecasts, which have the lowest level of uncertainty, when considering different prognostic periods. Matei, Rusu, Petrovan, and Mihu\\u0163 (2017) developed a data mining system used for predicting soil moisture in some agricultural spots in Romania. It was built by using the data from 10 weather stations that measured air temperature, precipitation, soil temperatures at three depths and soil moisture at 10 cm depth. They tested several machine learning models and the best one had accuracy 74.36%. The current work obtained average MAE of 0.019 m3 m\\u22123 while predicting soil moisture with LSTM using Yr weather forecasts (Table 6), which is around 6% of the range between minimum and maximum values of soil moisture, being approximately 0.3 m3 m\\u22123 (Fig. 3). The proposed methodology will become operational through installation of 500 automatic weather stations across the fields in Serbia and further integration into AgroSense, the national platform for digital agriculture (www.agrosense.rs). The data will be used with the LSTM model to calculate the current level of soil moisture and, along with the weather forecast, to predict the future states. This methodology will be the cornerstone of the AgroSense service for irrigation scheduling, as an alarm for warning farmers to react in the case of risk of soil moisture declining to the permanent wilting point. 5. Conclusions In this study a LSTM network was developed to predict daily values of soil moisture in the second soil layer, for three days ahead. The input parameters used were the daily values of maximum and minimum air temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit. For this purpose, an open-source data from ERA5 reanalysis for Serbia were used. Validation was performed for 2017 which had a dry summer and 2018 which had a wet summer. The overall performance of the network was characterised with much lower values of errors, when compared to ARIMA, a statistical forecasting technique, and Random Forest, a classical machine learning algorithm, thus verifying the prediction capabilities of the network for all soil types at various altitudes. The system was tested with Yr weather forecast and the predictions were in line with the ERA5 reanalysis data, proving the system's potential to be used by the farmers as an irrigation scheduling service, specifically for the drought conditions.

In this study, we examine the human-induced changes in land surface water and energy balances and the associated climate impacts using a coupled hydrological\\u2013climate model framework which also simulates the impacts of human activities on the water cycle. We present three sets of analyses using the results from two model versions\\u2014one with and the other without considering human activities; both versions are run in offline and coupled mode resulting in a series of four experiments in total. First, we examine climate and human-induced changes in regional water balance focusing on the widely debated issue of the desiccation of the Aral Sea in central Asia. Then, we discuss the changes in surface temperature as a result of changes in land surface energy balance due to irrigation over global and regional scales. Finally, we examine the global and regional climate impacts of increased atmospheric water vapor content due to irrigation. Results indicate that the direct anthropogenic alteration of river flow in the Aral Sea basin resulted in the loss of ~510 km3 of water during the latter half of the twentieth century which explains about half of the total loss of water from the sea. Results of irrigation-induced changes in surface energy balance suggest a significant surface cooling of up to 3.3 K over 1\\u00b0 grids in highly irrigated areas but a negligible change in land surface temperature when averaged over sufficiently large global regions. Results from the coupled model indicate a substantial change in 2 m air temperature and outgoing longwave radiation due to irrigation, highlighting the non-local (regional and global) implications of irrigation. These results provide important insights on the direct human alteration of land surface water and energy balances, highlighting the need to incorporate human activities such as irrigation into the framework of global climate models and Earth system models for better prediction of future changes under increasing human influence and continuing global climate change. Background Rapidly expanding human activities have profoundly affected various biophysical and biogeochemical processes of the Earth system over a broad range of scales, and freshwater systems are now amongst the most extensively altered ecosystems (Postel et al. 1996; Vitousek et al. 1997; Nilsson et al. 2005; Carpenter et al. 2011). Human management of land and water resources began with the advent of settled agriculture ~10,000 years ago (Marsh and Lowenthal 1965; Postel 1999), but the pervasive alteration of freshwater systems through flow regulation and large-scale water diversion began to accelerate rapidly during the twentieth century as a result of proliferation in dam construction and widespread agricultural expansion to fulfill the growing needs for water, food, and energy for the global population that quadrupled in the past 100 years. These large-scale water management practices have brought enormous benefits to our societies but also resulted in an unprecedented scale of negative environmental consequences (Vitousek et al. 1997; Postel et al. 1996; Nilsson et al. 2005; Micklin 2007; Rockstr\\u00f6m et al. 2009; Carpenter et al. 2011; Newbold et al. 2016). Today, it has become clear that mankind, through its actions, is conducting a planetary-scale experiment potentially pushing many Earth system processes to their tipping points (Newbold et al. 2016; Rockstr\\u00f6m et al. 2009). Mounting evidences from ground- and satellite-based observations indicate that the human footprint on freshwater and ecological systems is now widespread across the planet and is widening at an alarming rate. These evidences have already shown that (1) most of the large river systems around the world have been heavily fragmented (Dynesius and Nilsson 1994; V\\u00f6r\\u00f6smarty et al. 1997; Gleick 2003; Nilsson et al. 2005); (2) more than 40% of the global land surface has been modified by human-induced land cover change (Ramankutty et al. 2008; Pielke 2005; Foley et al. 2005); (3) groundwater storages in the world\\u2019s largest aquifer systems are depleting at an alarming rate due to excessive pumping (Rodell et al. 2009; Wada et al. 2010; Pokhrel et al. 2012a, 2015; Scanlon et al. 2012; Konikow 2013; Long et al. 2013; Voss et al. 2013; D\\u00f6ll et al. 2014; Famiglietti 2014; Joodaki et al. 2014); and (4) some of the world\\u2019s largest inland water bodies such as the Aral Sea are fast disappearing due to human alteration of water balance within their drainage areas (Micklin 1988, 2007; Lemoalle 2004; AghaKouchak et al. 2015). Today, as we enter into a new geological epoch termed as the \\u201cAnthropocene\\u201d (Crutzen 2002; Lewis and Maslin 2015), human forces have become so profound and pervasive that they rival other climatic factors in driving terrestrial water systems in many regions (Sanderson et al. 2002; Steffen et al. 2007; Rockstr\\u00f6m et al. 2009; V\\u00f6r\\u00f6smarty et al. 2010; Wagener et al. 2010; Carpenter et al. 2011). Because of such widespread human perturbations of natural systems, it is not meaningful anymore to study freshwater systems and their interactions with climate without considering human activities (Oki and Kanae 2006). Decades of ground-based observations have enabled us to better understand the changes in the Earth\\u2019s water cycle over varying spatial and temporal scales. In recent decades, satellite observations, such as those from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission (Tapley et al. 2004), have further enabled us to better monitor the changing surface and groundwater systems especially in relation to the changing climate and growing human interventions. However, the large observational data synthesis alone is not sufficient to attributing the observed changes to natural climatic and human factors and thereof to realistically predict future changes in the rapidly changing environment where stationarity is suggested to be non-existent (Milly et al. 2008). These issues call for the urgent need to develop new tools that can be used to accurately reproduce the past and realistically predict the future. Hydrological models are the predictive tools used to study the changes in different branches of the terrestrial water cycle. Some of these models, referred to as the land surface models (LSMs), are also used to represent land surface hydrology and simulate lower boundary conditions in general circulation models (GCMs) and Earth system models (ESMs). Both the hydrological models and LSMs have been used for a wide ranging studies of the water cycle over the past as well as for future projection of water resources availability (Arnell 1999; Oki and Kanae 2006; D\\u00f6ll 2009; Hanasaki et al. 2013; Wada et al. 2013; Haddeland et al. 2014; Schewe et al. 2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; Pokhrel et al. 2014). Over the past several decades, these models have been advanced through intensive improvements of schemes representing vegetation, soil moisture, and groundwater processes (Sellers et al. 1997; Lawrence et al. 2011), but most of these sophistications are focused on simulating the natural water cycle, and relatively little progress has been made in modeling human impacts. In particular, while noteworthy progress has been made in representing human factors in global hydrological models (GHMs) (Haddeland et al. 2011) designed for offline water resource assessment, most current-generation LSMs still lack the representation of human factors, meaning that most GCMs and ESMs currently lack the representation of human factors. Recent years have seen increased attention both from hydrologic and climate modeling communities in incorporating human activities into LSMs and GCMs but some challenges and opportunities still remain (Pokhrel et al. 2016; Nazemi and Wheater 2015a, b). In this study, we contribute to the discussion on how human land\\u2013water management activities (i.e., irrigation, flow regulation, and groundwater pumping) are affecting freshwater systems and climate over large scales. We subsequently highlight the importance of representing these human activities in global GCMs and ESMs to better simulate the coupled natural-human systems in the face of growing human influence on freshwater systems and ongoing climate change. The primary goal of the paper is to examine the large-scale alterations of land surface water and energy balances due to human activities and to investigate the resulting climate impacts and feedback. We present our analysis at both global and regional scales because while the human-induced changes in surface water balance affect the water cycle primarily at local to regional scales, the resulting changes in surface energy balance can affect the climate system over a varying range of spatial scales. For the water balance analysis, we present a regional case study of the Aral Sea in central Asia. A number of observation-based studies (e.g., Micklin 1988, 2007; Small et al. 2001) have reported that the large alteration of river flows in the Aral Sea basin was the primary reason for the rapid desiccation of the sea during the last several decades. However, to the authors\\u2019 knowledge, hydrological model simulations have been rarely used to mechanistically examine the natural and anthropogenic causes of changes in inflows to the sea. As such, the attribution of the observed changes in Aral Sea inflow to natural and anthropogenic factors remains relatively unexplored. For the analysis of surface energy balance, we present both regional and global results because the irrigation-induced changes in surface energy balance have been suggested to affect the climate system at local, regional, as well as global scales (Sacks et al. 2009). We use the results from a coupled hydrological\\u2013climate model framework developed by linking a global LSM\\u2014that accounts for human land\\u2013water management activities\\u2014with its parent GCM to examine the extent of direct human influence on freshwater systems and climate over large scales. To attribute the observed changes in water and energy balances to human and climate factors, we first use two offline LSM experiments: one with and the other without human activities. Then, the climate impacts are examined by using the coupled model (i.e., by coupling the LSM with its parent GCM). Again, we conduct two experiments: one with and the other without human activities, resulting in a total of four experiments (i.e., two offline and two online). Specifically, we investigate (1) how the increased use of water for irrigation in the Aral Sea basin contributed to the anthropogenic desiccation of the sea during the latter half of the twentieth century, which is sometimes referred to as \\u201cone of the very greatest ecological problems\\u201d of the twentieth century (Micklin 1988); (2) the impacts of irrigation on land surface energy balance over regional scales; and (3) the global and regional climate impacts of irrigation-induced increase in atmospheric water vapor content. In the rest of this paper, we first describe the model in \\u201cModel, data, and experimental settings,\\u201d present research findings in \\u201cResults and discussion,\\u201d and provide concluding remarks in \\u201cSummary and conclusions.\\u201d Model, data, and experimental settings The model used in the study is HiGW-MAT (Pokhrel et al. 2015), which was developed by incorporating human impact (Hi) modules (e.g., reservoir operation, crop growth, irrigation, and water withdrawal for domestic, industrial, and agricultural purposes) and groundwater (GW) dynamics and pumping schemes into a global LSM called the minimal advanced treatments of surface interaction and runoff (MATSIRO) (Takata et al. 2003). MATSIRO is an LSM developed to compute biophysical exchanges in the atmospheric GCM (AGCM) called MIROC (the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate) (Hasumi and Emori 2004). MATSIRO estimates the exchange of energy, water vapor, and momentum between the land surface and the atmosphere on a physical basis by taking into account the effects of vegetation on surface energy balance using a multilayer canopy model (Watanabe 1994) and a photosynthesis\\u2013stomatal conductance model (Collatz et al. 1991). The vertical movement of soil moisture is estimated by numerically solving the Richards equation (Richards 1931), and the land surface hydrological processes are represented by employing a simplified version of the TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby 1979; Stieglitz et al. 1997). Since river routing and human land\\u2013water management activities were not considered in the original MATSIRO, we incorporated a global river routing scheme (Oki and Sud 1998) and various schemes representing human land\\u2013water management practices (e.g., reservoir operation, crop growth, irrigation, water withdrawal, and environmental flow requirements) into the model in our previous studies (Pokhrel et al. 2012a, b). Further, the soil model of MATSIRO was improved by representing a prognostic water table dynamics scheme (Yeh and Eltahir 2005) to explicitly simulate the vertical flux exchange between saturated and unsaturated soil zones (Koirala et al. 2014). In our recent study (Pokhrel et al. 2015), we further enhanced the model by representing groundwater pumping scheme to explicitly simulate groundwater withdrawal and recharge, enabling us to estimate groundwater withdrawal and depletion within the model and without using any auxiliary information. The latest version of the model (i.e., HiGW-MAT) thus simulates the flow and storage of water globally, taking into account human water use for various purposes and its influence on surface water and energy balance over global and continental scales. In this study, we use HiGW-MAT for both offline (forced by observation-based meteorological data) and online (coupled with MIROC AGCM version 3.2) simulations. We carry out two sets of simulations\\u2014one by turning the human impact schemes off and the other by turning them on\\u2014in both offline and online modes, resulting in a set of four simulations in total. We refer to the former setting as natural setting (hereafter NAT-Offline and NAT-Online experiments) and the latter as human impact setting (hereafter HI-Offline and HI-Online experiments). Forcing data for offline simulations are taken from two different sources considering their temporal coverage for different analyses. For the historical (1951\\u20132000) simulations used to examine the Aral Sea inflow, we use the NCC forcing data (Ngo-Duc et al. 2005), and for the simulations used to examine irrigation-induced alteration of surface energy balance for the period 1998\\u20132010, we used the data from Kim et al. (2009) because this period is not covered by NCC data. We use these two particular forcing datasets because they have been used in our previous studies that validated various model components used here (Pokhrel et al. 2012a, b, 2015). The uncertainties arising from the use of different forcing datasets, especially precipitation, have also been discussed in our previous studies (Pokhrel et al. 2012a, b). All other model parameters and data for human activity modules are identical to those used by Pokhrel et al. (2015). Grid-based and time-varying (annual) irrigated areas for the entire simulation period are derived by using the Global Map of Irrigated Areas (GMIA) (Siebert et al. 2015) and the methodology described in Pokhrel et al. (2012b). For online simulations, we couple HiGW-MAT with MIROC AGCM version 3.2 (Hasumi and Emori 2004) and dynamically simulate the land\\u2013atmosphere interactions including the land disturbance due to human activities such as irrigation and groundwater use. The online simulations are initialized with the soil moisture states from the offline simulations. Online simulations are conducted for the period 1998\\u20132010, and all model parameters related to land surface hydrology and human activities are identical to those used in offline simulations. While the offline simulations are performed at the spatial resolution of 1\\u00b0 \\u00d7 1\\u00b0, the online experiments are conducted at T42 resolution (~2.81\\u00b0) with 20 vertical sigma levels. The spatial resolutions used for both the offline and online simulations are typical for global models and are fairly adequate to capture the large-scale spatial patterns and long-term trends discussed in the present study. The LSM is run at an hourly interval, and the output is saved on a daily basis. The offline model results from both the original MATSIRO and the integrated HiGW-MAT models have been extensively validated using ground- and satellite-based observations of various hydrologic fluxes and stores in our previous studies (Koirala et al. 2014; Pokhrel et al. 2012a, b, 2015). In particular, river discharge and terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations, irrigation water use, and groundwater withdrawals and depletion have been evaluated over varying spatial domains and temporal scales. In this study, we briefly revisit the evaluation over the Aral Sea basin. We use the observed river discharge from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) for the evaluation of river discharge, and the TWS data derived from the GRACE satellite mission (Tapley et al. 2004) are used to evaluate the simulated TWS variations over the Aral Sea basin. Results and discussion We present three sets of results. First, we analyze the human-induced changes in water balance for the Aral Sea region. We focus on this region because, to the authors\\u2019 knowledge, very few studies have used model results to mechanistically explain the natural and human-induced changes in river flows that caused the desiccation of the sea over the past several decades. Second, we present the results from offline simulations at both regional and global scales to examine the changes in surface energy balance due to irrigation. Finally, we use online model simulations to detect the irrigation-induced climate impacts, again at both regional and global scales. Human alteration of water balance: the case of Aral Sea We evaluate the simulated streamflow in the river basins draining to the Aral Sea and the changes in TWS over the entire Aral Sea basin with the observations from GRDC and GRACE satellite mission, respectively. The Aral Sea is a large terminal saline lake located among the deserts of Central Asia. It drains a total area of ~1.8 million km2 spread across seven nations: Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and Iran (Micklin 2007). The main source of water to the sea is the discharge of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river basins, and the sea has no surface outflow. After mid-twentieth century, agricultural diversions of river water increased substantially throughout the Aral Sea drainage area, resulting in a net loss of water from the sea owing to increased evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge (Micklin 1988; Small et al. 2001). As a result of reduced inflow, the net water balance of the sea became negative after 1960 (Small et al. 2001); it has been suggested that the lake water level has fallen by 23 m, resulting in surface area shrinkage by ~74% and reduction in volume by ~ 90% during the latter half of the twentieth century (Micklin 2007). Figure 1 shows the comparison of simulated (HI-Offline) and observed total annual discharge from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins, which are the major contributors of surface inflow to the Aral Sea. It is evident from the figure that the model captures the long-term trend of annual discharge fairly well with good agreement for most years with certain overestimations during the late 1970s and early 1980s; results for the subsequent years could not be evaluated owing to the lack of observations in GRDC database. The relatively smaller declining trend in the simulated flows compared to the trend in observations can be attributed primarily to two factors: the uncertainties in forcing data, especially precipitation, and uncertainties in human impact simulations, especially those arising from the uncertainties in irrigation practices and irrigated areas. Water withdrawals and irrigation have been found to significantly alter the river flow and trigger off a considerable decrease (more than %10 in some regions) in long-term average annual river discharge (D\\u00f6ll et al. 2009). Further, the irrigation system in the Aral Sea basin is dominated by furrows with relatively lower efficiency compared to modern practices (Micklin 2014). Therefore, the lack of detailed irrigation parameterization in the irrigation schemes used in global LSMs such as HiGW-MAT can cause such discrepancies between the observed and simulated river flows. Despite certain differences between model simulations and observations, we consider the use of simulated flows to be acceptable to assess irrigation-induced changes in surface water balance because any biases in the long-term trend will have similar magnitudes and hence the difference between two simulations (with and without human impacts) will not be significantly affected. It should also be noted that the results presented in Fig. 1 do not represent the exact volume of Aral Sea inflow because the gaging stations in both rivers are located substantially in the upstream of the Aral Sea shore; the flow in the downstream may increase due to addition of local runoff or may decrease due to evaporation from wetlands, infiltration into groundwater, and/or added human water use along its course to the sea (Small et al. 2001). Indeed, the long-term combined mean annual flow at the gaging stations in the two rivers both from observations (67 km3/year) and model (83 km3/year) differ significantly from the Aral Sea inflow reported by various previous studies (e.g., Raskin et al. 1992; Small et al. 1999; Micklin 2007, 2010). Fig. 1 Comparison of the combined annual river discharge from Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers at Kerki and Tyumen Aryk stations, respectively, from the model (blue) and observations (black). Observed data are shown only for the period available Full size image To add further confidence to our model simulations, we compare the variations of TWS from the HI-Offline experiment with the TWS variations derived from the GRACE satellite mission. Figure 2 presents the comparison of the seasonal cycle of simulated TWS anomaly averaged over the combined area of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins with GRACE data (Level-3, Release-5). Results indicate that the model well captures the seasonal dynamics of the GRACE-detected TWS variations over the 2003\\u20132010 period. In Fig. 2, the individual TWS components from model simulations, namely river water, soil moisture, and groundwater, are also shown. It is evident that the model tends to overestimate TWS amplitude compared with GRACE but it is also clear that the seasonal dynamics of TWS variations is simulated well by the model, which adds confidence to the results of our offline simulations.

The GRACE data are shown as the mean of the products from three processing centers, namely Center for Space Research at University of Texas, Austin (CSR), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and Geoforschungs Zentrum Potsdam (GFZ), with the error bars showing the range of variations between the three products Full size image Next, we examine the changes in long-term inflow to the Aral Sea due to human-induced alteration of water balance in the two river basins. An early study by Micklin (1988) suggested that, under natural conditions, ~111 km3/year of surface water would be generated over the Aral Sea basin of which about half reaches the sea because of losses such as through evapotranspiration and infiltration within the drainage area. The study also suggested that ~40 km3/year of flow reached the sea during 1960s. Other studies have reported a larger inflow. For example, Raskin et al. (1992) suggested that the average surface runoff from the Aral Sea basin is ~120 km3/year under natural conditions. Small et al. (1999) compared the model results of 162 km3/year with the observed inflow of ~110 km3/year for 1988\\u20131993 period. Similarly, Shibuo et al. (2007) compared their simulated inflow of 77 and 16 km3/year for 1901\\u20131950 and 1983\\u20132002 periods, respectively, with the reported values of 71 and 12 km3/year. More detailed studies based on water balance using observational synthesis over decades suggest a range of decadal inflows from 55 to 4 km3/year for different periods from 1910 to 2010 (Micklin 2007, 2010). Despite the varying estimates of the inflow to the sea, the net change in sea volume over the past several decades is relatively accurately known; it has been estimated that the sea amounted to ~1089 km3 during the 1960s but reduced to ~108 and ~84 km3 in 2006 and 2009, respectively, resulting in the net loss of ~1000 km3 over about four decades (Micklin 2007, 2010). The observed desiccation of the sea is believed to be a consequence of a combination of climatic and anthropogenic changes including the reduction in inflow from rivers, changes in regional climate and lake water balance (i.e., precipitation\\u2013evaporation), and alteration of groundwater flows to and from the sea. But it has been suggested that the primary cause is the reduction in river discharge to the sea due to increased human water consumption in the Aral Sea basin to support expanding agricultural activities, especially to increase the production of rice and cotton (Micklin 2007). Various aforementioned studies have often used the observed inflow over long terms to portray a picture of the desiccation of the sea, and some model-based studies have also studied the changes in regional climate and lake water balance over certain period of time (Small et al. 1999, 2001; Shibuo et al. 2007); however, what remains unaddressed is the attribution of the reported changes in inflow to natural and anthropogenic causes which can be done only through a comparative analysis of model results with and without considering human factors. Here, we directly address this issue by using the 50-year model experiment carried out by turning human factors on and off. Figure 3a depicts the anomaly of combined inflow from Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers into the Aral Sea (at the inlet to the sea) from offline simulations with (HI-Offline) and without (NAT-Offline) human activities. It is obvious from the figure that, even under natural conditions, the inflow to the sea was substantially lower than the long-term mean during late 1950s, early 1960s, 1970s, and late 1990s. These results imply that the changes in inflow were not entirely due to human water use, even though the meteorological forcing data used in both offline simulations could already include some effects of the anthropogenic alteration of regional water balance. It is evident that the inflow under both simulations was high during 1952\\u20131957, decreased substantially during 1960\\u20131962, attained its highest value in 1969 as a results of higher precipitation and lower temperatures as also suggested by Shibuo et al. (2007), and remained consistently low from 1973 onwards. Fig. 3 Anomaly of the inflow to the Aral Sea from two major river basins simulated by NAT-Offline and HI-Offline experiments (a), and the difference (NAT-Offline\\u2013HI-Offline) in annual flow volume between the results of two simulations (b). Results are shown as five year running mean. Note that the NAT-Offline and HI-Offline results in (a) have different climatological mean and that the results in (b) are the difference of the absolute flow values Full size image Figure 3b displays the difference between inflows from the two model runs. It is obvious that the human water use resulted in substantial inflow reduction with an increasing trend from 1950s to mid-1970s; the largest difference of ~15 km3/year can be observed during the mid-1970s. The temporal patterns in the difference shown in Fig. 3b reflect the changes in irrigation water demands over time, caused primarily by two factors: changes in irrigated areas and climate conditions. During the 1950s, low irrigated areas and wet climate conditions resulted in a relatively small difference between the two simulations. The difference increased substantially until the 1970s, caused by the monotonous rise in irrigated areas during this period and the relatively dry climate conditions in some years (negative flow anomalies in Fig. 3a). The difference peaked around mid-1970s and remained relatively stable with certain inter-annual fluctuations, mostly driven by climate variability. It is important to note that wetter soil conditions in some years can be carried over to the subsequent years resulting in less irrigative demands. The cumulative difference over the 50-year period is ~510 km3, which suggests that, based on the model simulations, almost half of the change in sea volume can be attributed to direct anthropogenic alteration of river flow. Certainly, as discussed earlier, climate change and variability, which could be both natural and human-induced, also contributed largely to the reduction in inflow to the Aral Sea. Changes in lake evaporation and groundwater inflow/outflow may also have partially contributed to the overall water balance which are not considered in our study. Moreover, our results are from an offline model which does not take into account the interactions and feedback among land and atmospheric drivers of water cycle change. A more comprehensive analysis using a coupled land\\u2013lake\\u2013atmosphere model that also considers human land\\u2013water management is needed to fully attribute the observed changes to various climatic and anthropogenic factors. Irrigation-induced changes in surface energy balance The anthropogenic alterations of river flows discussed in the previous section have important implications on land surface energy balance. In particular, water used for irrigation creates wetter soil conditions, fundamentally enhancing evapotranspiration which in turn transforms the surface energy balance causing surface cooling (Kueppers et al. 2007). In offline simulations, these alterations are manifested as changes in latent and sensible heat fluxes accompanied by reduced land surface or skin temperature. Such impacts are not highly pronounced over the entire Aral Sea basin (Fig. 4) because in most of the region only a relatively small fraction of the model grid cells is irrigated (Fig. 5). Therefore, we focus the discussion here on other global regions that are extensively irrigated, and can have potential impacts on global climate system. Fig. 4 Changes in grid-averaged annual mean land surface skin temperature due to irrigation (a); June\\u2013August (JJA) average over the continental US (b); and March\\u2013May (MAM) mean over the Indian sub-continent and central Asia including the Aral Sea region (c).

The black star in (c) locates the Aral Sea Full size image Fig. 5 Irrigated area fraction at 1\\u00b0 grids. White color represents either ocean or land not equipped for irrigation. Data source: Siebert et al. (2015). While color represents ocean or land without irrigated areas Full size image Figure 4 displays the grid-averaged changes in annual mean land surface skin temperature in response to increased latent heat flux due to irrigation. Decrease in mean annual surface temperature averaged over all irrigated grid cells is rather small (~0.04 K or ~1.2%), but the changes are particularly pronounced in the highly irrigated areas [Fig. 5; data source: Siebert et al. (2015)] and during the growing seasons. Surface cooling is not highly pronounced in the modestly irrigated areas in South America, Australia, Europe, and the southern part of Africa, where irrigation causes only a small change in surface energy balance. In Southeast Asia and the eastern part of China, where the model simulates large amounts of irrigation water use (Pokhrel et al. 2012a), surface energy balance is not affected by irrigation, because these regions are characterized by humid climate and energy-limited regime where increase in soil water content does not necessarily increase evapotranspiration due to energy limitation. In addition, the major crop grown in many of these regions is rice and irrigation is applied to maintain soil moisture at near full saturation during the growing season, which often results in immediate increase in surface runoff during heavy rainfall over flooded rice paddies. As such, only a small percentage of irrigation water is actually consumed by crops and the rest is discharged back to rivers as return flow. In highly irrigated grid cells in parts of northwest India and western US, surface cooling of up to 3.3 K is found during growing season (Fig. 4b, c). The actual change in surface temperature over the irrigated regions could be even larger because the results shown are the grid-average values. Such large surface cooling simulated by the model is accompanied by significant increase in latent heat flux of up to 50 W/m2 during the growing season as reported in our previous study (Pokhrel et al. 2012a). These results, which are in line with previous studies (e.g., Haddeland et al. 2006), suggest that the irrigation-induced changes in land surface energy balance when averaged over large domains (e.g., large global basins) could be very small but are highly pronounced within and around the highly irrigated regions. Such alteration of surface energy balance due to irrigation can potentially alter the climate system at varying scales by making the lower atmosphere cooler and supplying additional moisture into the atmosphere, which we discuss in the next section. Climate impacts of irrigation Finally, we examine the impacts of irrigation on regional and global climate using the results from two online simulations: one with and the other without human activities. A number of studies have examined the impacts of irrigation-induced changes in surface energy balance on regional and global climate (e.g., Boucher et al. 2004; Kueppers et al. 2007; Sacks et al. 2009; Puma and Cook 2010; Sorooshian et al. 2011; Lo and Famiglietti 2013). These studies have consistently shown that irrigation can exert significant regional as well as global climate impacts; however, there are large disagreements in the quantification of the magnitude of these impacts among different models (Sorooshian et al. 2012). The disagreements among models can partly be attributed to the use of different irrigation schemes, most of which are rather simplistic and suffer from large uncertainties in estimating the irrigation amount itself (Pokhrel et al. 2016). Here, we expand on these existing studies by presenting new results from a coupled climate model that dynamically simulates the irrigation impacts on climate system by explicitly simulating irrigation demands within the model, also taking into account crop growth dynamics as well as the source of irrigation water (Pokhrel et al. 2012a, 2015). Thus, the model fully accounts for both the natural and human-induced terrestrial water balance within the climate model framework, making it one of the first of its kind. Figure 6 shows the difference in 2 m air temperature from the NAT-Online and HI-Online experiments, averaged over the period 1998\\u20132010 and for June\\u2013August (JJA) during which the temperature changes were found most profound among all seasons. The figure provides the following insights. First, it is evident that the coupled model simulates a decrease in 2 m air temperature over the highly irrigated regions (shown in Fig. 5) such as the northwestern India and parts of Pakistan as well as the central US, which coincide with the regions of large irrigation-induced surface cooling in our offline simulations (Fig. 4). Large negative temperature differences of up to \\u22123 K can also be seen in eastern China, and parts of Europe which also include irrigated areas. The dotted areas in Fig. 6 represent the grid cells that satisfy 95% statistical significance in Student\\u2019s t test. Overall, these results are generally consistent with the findings of Sacks et al. (2009). Fig. 6 Irrigation-induced changes in simulated 2 m air temperature, i.e., the difference between NAT-Online and HI-Online experiments. The dotted areas represent the grid cells that satisfy 95% statistical significance in Student\\u2019s t test Full size image Second, substantial cooling can be observed even in areas with little or no irrigation, including the northern and northeastern Africa and northern Canada. And third, warming can be observed in regions including the mid-to-eastern areas in northern Eurasia, southern Africa, and central America. These results of varying degree of cooling and warming in regions within and beyond the irrigated regions suggest that the climate impacts of irrigation can be driven by non-local processes. The relatively weak signal (Fig. 6) in some of the highly irrigated grid cells around southern California (Figs. 4, 5) also suggests that the irrigation-induced cooling in the grid cell size of atmospheric models is highly non-local and is not always correlated directly with the surface cooling in offline simulations. Further, as suggested by Sacks et al. (2009), irrigation-induced evaporative cooling in one region should be offset by warming from the release of latent heat in other parts of the atmosphere, which implies that indirect effects such as changing cloud cover, and the accompanying changes in solar radiation, could be more important over larger scales and beyond irrigated areas. To assess such indirect effects, here we finally examine the changes in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The decrease in OLR is a result of lower surface temperatures and increased cloud content as a consequence of increased water vapor content in the atmosphere. Thus, the increased cloud cover adds a positive feedback on the reduction in OLR due to surface cooling by irrigation. As seen in Fig. 7, in the highly irrigated regions including the northwestern India, Pakistan, eastern China, and central US, thicker or frequent clouds and cooler 2 m air temperature (Fig. 6) due to increased water vapor from irrigated areas result in significant reduction in OLR. Similar to the changes in 2 m air temperature, regions away from irrigated areas such as the mid-to-eastern area on northern Eurasia experience increase in OLR as a result of increase in 2 m air temperature and reduction in cloud cover. Fig. 7 Same as in Fig. 6 but for OLR outgoing longwave radiation Full size image Summary and conclusions In this study, we contribute to the discussion on how human land\\u2013water management activities (e.g., irrigation, flow regulation, and groundwater pumping) are affecting the freshwater system and climate over large scales. We subsequently highlight the importance of representing these human activities in global climate models and Earth system models to better simulate the coupled natural-human systems in the face of growing human influence on freshwater system and ongoing climate change. Results from a coupled hydrological\\u2013climate model framework developed by linking a global LSM\\u2014that accounts for human land\\u2013water management activities\\u2014with its parent GCM are used to examine the changes in surface water and energy balances and their impacts on regional and global climate. First, the results from the offline model are used to examine the climate and human-induced changes in the hydrology of the Aral Sea basin in central Asia and the associated impacts on the reduction in the volume of the sea over the latter half of the twentieth century. Simulated results of river discharge and terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations are evaluated with the observations from the GRDC and the GRACE satellite mission, respectively. Simulated river discharge for the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins, which are the major contributors to the Aral Sea inflow, are then used to examine the climate and human-induced changes in inflow to the sea over long terms. Results indicate that the direct anthropogenic alteration of river flow in the Aral Sea basin resulted in the loss of ~510 km3 of water during the latter half of the twentieth century which explains about half of the recorded loss of water from the sea. Results also suggest that the inflow to the sea decreased over the analysis period even in the simulation without human activities, implying that the observed changes in the sea could partly be due to natural climate variability and trend. It is also found that the human-induced reduction in inflow to the sea changed over time, reflecting the changes in irrigation water demands caused by expanding irrigated areas and changing climate conditions (both inter-annual as well as inter-decadal variabilities). Second, we use the results from two offline simulations (with and without human impacts) to discuss the changes in surface temperature as a result of changes in land surface energy balance due to irrigation over global and regional scales. Results of irrigation-induced changes in surface energy balance suggest a significant surface cooling of up to 3.3 K over 1\\u00b0 grids in highly irrigated areas but a negligible change in surface temperature when averaged over sufficiently large global regions. Finally, we use the results from coupled land surface\\u2013climate model to examine the impacts of irrigation on climate over large scales. It is found that irrigation-induced evaporative cooling of the surface and associated increase in water vapor in the atmosphere substantially reduced 2 m air temperature in the vicinity of the highly irrigated areas. Results also suggest that the irrigation impacts are non-local causing substantial warming in regions far from irrigated regions. Further, we use the results of changes in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to examine the impacts of changing cloud cover resulting from irrigated areas. Changes in OLR are consistent with the changes in 2 m air temperature, suggesting substantial decrease in OLR within irrigated regions and substantial increase in regions beyond irrigated areas. There are a number of factors that could have introduced certain errors in our results. For example, the simulated irrigation water use and the resulting alteration of river flows are directly impacted by forcing data, especially precipitation and temperature, which could contain significant uncertainties in some regions. Moreover, the errors in the spatial extent as well as the temporal evolution of irrigated areas and the simplifications in modeling irrigation practices also add further uncertainties in the simulated irrigation water use. In addition, the simulation of irrigation water demands in our online experiments could have been affected by the potential biases in the climatology simulated by the AGCM. Addressing these issues will be important directions for future research. Despite some limitations, this study provides important insights on the direct human alteration of land surface water and energy balances over large regions. Our findings also call for the need to incorporate human land\\u2013water management activities in LSMs and integrate such LSMs into the framework of Earth system models for more accurate attribution of the observed changes to natural and human-induced causes and realistic prediction of future changes under increasing human influence and continuing global climate change.

Altchenko and K. G. Villholth Abstract. Groundwater provides an important buffer to climate variability in Africa. Yet, groundwater irrigation contributes only a relatively small share of cultivated land, approximately 1% (about 2 \\u00d7 106 hectares) as compared to 14% in Asia. While groundwater is over-exploited for irrigation in many parts in Asia, previous assessments indicate an underutilized potential in parts of Africa. As opposed to previous country-based estimates, this paper derives a continent-wide, distributed (0.5\\u00b0 spatial resolution) map of groundwater irrigation potential, indicated in terms of fractions of cropland potentially irrigable with renewable groundwater. The method builds on an annual groundwater balance approach using 41 years of hydrological data, allocating only that fraction of groundwater recharge that is in excess after satisfying other present human needs and environmental requirements, while disregarding socio-economic and physical constraints in access to the resource. Due to high uncertainty of groundwater environmental needs, three scenarios, leaving 30, 50 and 70% of recharge for the environment, were implemented. Current dominating crops and cropping rotations and associated irrigation requirements in a zonal approach were applied in order to convert recharge excess to potential irrigated cropland. Results show an inhomogeneously distributed groundwater irrigation potential across the continent, even within individual countries, mainly reflecting recharge patterns and presence or absence of cultivated cropland. Results further show that average annual renewable groundwater availability for irrigation ranges from 692 to 1644 km3 depending on scenario. The total area of cropland irrigable with renewable groundwater ranges from 44.6 to 105.3 \\u00d7 106 ha, corresponding to 20.5 to 48.6% of the cropland over the continent. In particular, significant potential exists in the semi-arid Sahel and eastern African regions which could support poverty alleviation if developed sustainably and equitably. The map is a first assessment that needs to be complimented with assessment of other factors, e.g. hydrogeological conditions, groundwater accessibility, soils, and socio-economic factors as well as more local assessments.

Accordingly, the projected change in climate is expected to impact on the composition of berries and of the resultant wines. However, the direction and extent of climate change impact on fruit composition of winegrape cultivars are not fully known. This study utilised a climate gradient along a 700 km transect, covering all wine regions of Western Australia, to explore and empirically describe influences of climate on anthocyanins, pH and titratable acidity (TA) levels in two or three cultivars of Vitis vinifera (Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Shiraz). The results showed that, at a common maturity of 22\\u00b0 Brix total soluble solids, berries from the warmer regions had low levels of anthocyanins and TA as well as high pH compared to berries from the cooler regions. Most of these regional variations in berry composition reflected the prevailing climatic conditions of the regions. Thus, depending on cultivar, 82\\u201387 % of TA, 83 % of anthocyanins and about half of the pH variations across the gradient were explained by climate-variable-based empirical models. Some of the variables that were relevant in describing the variations in berry attributes included: diurnal ranges and ripening period temperature (TA), vapour pressure deficit in October and growing degree days (pH), and ripening period temperatures (anthocyanins). Further, the rates of change in these berry attributes in response to climate variables were cultivar dependent. Based on the observed patterns along the climate gradient, it is concluded that: (1) in a warming climate, all other things being equal, berry anthocyanins and TA levels will decline whereas pH levels will rise; and (2) despite variations in non-climatic factors (e.g. soil type and management) along the sampling transect, variations in TA and anthocyanins were satisfactorily described using climate-variable-based empirical models, indicating the overriding impact of climate on berry composition. The models presented here are useful tools for assessing likely changes in berry TA and anthocyanins in response to changing climate for the wine regions and cultivars covered in this study.

Tempranillo phenology and grape quality within the Ribera del Duero DO (Spain) and relationships with climate Article 24 April 2015 Introduction The quality of berries and of the subsequent wine is influenced strongly by chemical constituents and their concentration at harvest (Coombe et al. 1980; Fontoin et al. 2008; Herderich and Smith 2005). Berry composition is influenced by factors such as climate, genotype, management, and soil type (Gladstones 1992; Jackson and Lombard 1993). When other factors are held comparatively constant, climate is the dominant factor that influences berry and wine quality (Ashenfelter 2008; Jones and Storchmann 2001; Makra et al. 2009; Storchmann 2005). Of the climate variables, temperature has been recognised as a primary driver of vine growth and berry/wine composition (Gladstones 1992; Soar et al. 2008; Winkler 1974). For example, Petrie and Sadras (2008) utilised between-season variation to demonstrate that higher growing season temperature resulted in increased rates of sugar accumulation and advanced fruit maturity dates. Furthermore, Sadras et al. (2007a) demonstrated a negative relationship between the rate of change in red wine quality (as assessed by vintage scores) during 1980 to 2005 for Australian wine regions and average temperatures during the month before harvest; however, no trend was evident for white wines. Viticulture is a sector vulnerable to climate change due to the sensitivity of grapevine phenology and fruit composition to temperature. However, impacts of climate warming on viticulture remain unclear as research results based on historical data generate conjecture. For example, Nemani et al. (2001) speculated that, while climate warming during the period from 1965 to 1996 had positive effects on yield and wine quality in the Sonoma and Napa Valleys, further warming may have unfavourable impacts on the Californian wine industry due to the increase in fungal disease under elevated temperature and humidity. Similarly, based on predictions that used empirical yield and a climate model, Lobell et al. (2006) indicated potential yield loss of perennial crops in California. In contrast, Jones et al. (2005) explored the relationships between optimum growing season temperature and vintage score (a surrogate for wine quality), and predicted uneven impacts of climate change on wine quality across the world\\u2019s wine regions depending on current growing season temperature and future warming. Australian studies generally suggest a negative impact of climate change. For example, a study that broadly examined six Australian wine regions predicted a shortened growing season (Webb et al. 2007). According to this study, all regions, except Margaret River, are predicted to have earlier budburst and harvest dates in the coming decades. Webb et al. (2008a, b) also argue that, although there is likely to be variation in the sensitivity to climate change among winegrape cultivars, without adaptive measures winegrape quality in Australia will generally decrease. A more recent study (Hall and Jones 2009) concluded that the number of current wine growing regions with unsuitable growing season temperatures for quality wine production will increase as a result of climate change. Plant growth and development are often influenced by interactions among different climate variables. Therefore, inferences derived from relationships between an individual climate variable and grape attribute may not necessarily be the same when the effects of other climate variables are taken together under real conditions. Plant physiological and mechanistic models, such as VineLogic (Godwin et al. 2002), would help to address such interactions provided the models have an adequate choice of inputs to simulate the whole system under consideration. However, to our knowledge, there are no readily available mechanistically parameterised models for simulating berry quality responses under climate change scenarios. Instead, empirical models have been used to investigate climate influences on berry growth and development and/or for evaluating the climate change impacts on viticulture (Ashenfelter 2008; Jones and Davis 2000; Lobell et al. 2006). For this study, we employed an empirical modelling approach to examine the combined effects of multiple climate variables on berry anthocyanins, pH and TA levels. To date all studies that have attempted to evaluate the effects of climate change on berry and/or wine composition have relied on proxy measures such as grape price (Webb et al. 2008b) or vintage scores (Jones et al. 2005; Sadras et al. 2007a). While these studies are valuable in providing a generalised picture, the observation that different winegrape cultivars exhibit differential sensitivity to climate (e.g. Webb et al. 2008a) means that generalised projections based on indirect measures have limited value in predicting the responses of specific cultivars. The underlying reason for using proxy variables as quality indicators is the absence of directly measured berry quality attribute data on responses of some of the major winegrape cultivars to climate change. The work reported here was designed to fill this gap. Such data will be important in adaptation strategie, e.g. in decision making with regard to matching cultivars with sites. The aims of this work were to: (1) determine the responses of some key berry attributes [anthocyanins, titratable acidity (TA) and pH] that are influential for wine quality to changing levels of climate variables; and (2) develop empirical models that adequately describe the responses. The study was carried out in commercial vineyards located along a well-defined climate gradient, and included the major winegrape cultivars (Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Chardonnay) currently grown in Australia. Materials and methods Monitoring sites and plant material Ten commercial vineyards covering all the major wine regions of Western Australia (Fig. 1) were used to monitor the dynamics of TA, pH and total anthocyanins in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz grapes; and of TA and pH in Chardonnay grapes. Monitoring was carried out from veraison until berry total soluble solids (TSS) reached 22\\u00b0 Brix during the 2008\\u20132009 (Season 1, hereafter) and 2009\\u20132010 (Season 2, hereafter) growing seasons. The ten study vineyards lie along a 700 km north\\u2013south transect with an average (1976\\u20132005) growing season temperature (October\\u2013April) that ranged from 17.8 \\u00b0C at the southernmost site to 22.9 \\u00b0C at the northernmost vineyard site. Fig. 1 Map of study areas in Western Australia. Numbered dots in enlarged picture represent study site locations. October\\u2013April average temperature, average annual rainfall, and dominant soil types for each site are indicated in parentheses. Climate data (average for the 1976\\u20132005 period) was obtained from SILO DataDrill database (Jeffrey et al. 2001) Full size image In this study, influences of climate variables on berry composition were examined at a TSS maturity of 22\\u00b0 Brix for pragmatic reasons. It is acknowledged, however, that in practice, while the level of TSS is used as an indicator of berry maturity, even when a crop is \\u2018sugar ripe\\u2019, the decision when to harvest may vary for several reasons including intended wine style, perceived flavour and/or aroma balance, and logistics. The variable length of time a crop stays on the vine can influence berry composition. This additional source of variation can be minimised when comparisons are made at a common maturity level. Our aim was to tease out the effects climate variables on berry quality attributes by removing confounding factors such as those of winemakers\\u2019 decisions of when to harvest by fixing maturity to when the crop first reaches 22\\u00b0 Brix TSS. It is also acknowledged that differences in vineyard management practices and properties of plant material across different sites can contribute to variations in fruit composition. However, it was not feasible to utilise monitoring sites with identical planting material and management practices along the entire transect. Most of the sites in this study had vertical shoot positioning (VSP) training and spur pruning, except at the Capel, Willyabrup (both had T-trellis) and Frankland (bilateral) sites. Similarly, the cultivars were planted mainly on their own-roots except Chardonnay at Gin Gin (which was grafted onto Chenin Blanc), Shiraz and Chardonnay (on Schwarzmann) at Swan Valley and Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay (on Schwarzmann) at Pemberton. The vines were between 5 and 25 years old (Table 1). The soil types also varied across sites (Fig. 1). Table 1 Vine ages, training systems and average yields for the study sites. Data were provided by vineyard owners. VSP Vertical shoot positioning Full size table Bunch sampling Ten bunches of grapes from ten vines, five from one side of a row and the others from the opposite side of the row, were sampled randomly for each cultivar at weekly intervals between the start of veraison and the berry TSS maturity of 22\\u00b0 Brix (common maturity, hereafter). The ten sample vines were also selected randomly from four rows in the middle of a block to avoid edge effects and in such a way that no vines were sampled twice during the sampling period. Sampled bunches were placed in a chilled box and taken to the laboratory for berry composition analysis. Berry composition analysis A quarter of the berries was gently stripped from all parts of the sampled bunches. Half of the berries were placed in a plastic container and kept frozen for anthocyanin analysis. The remaining berries were placed in a plastic bag and crushed by hand without cracking the seeds and the juice was used for TSS, pH and TA analysis. Juice from the hand-crushed berries was centrifuged at 1,349 g for 10 min. The supernatant was used to determine TSS with a temperature-compensated digital refractometer (Reichert AR200, Reichert, Depew, NY) and reported in \\u00b0Brix at 20 \\u00b0C. Juice pH and TA were measured with a pH meter. Titratable acidity was determined by titrating juice samples against 0.1 M NaOH solution to an endpoint of pH 8.2. Results are expressed as grams of tartaric acid equivalents per litre of juice (g/L). Anthocyanins were extracted and analysed as described in Iland et al. (2004). Briefly, after thawing frozen samples, 50 berries were selected randomly and weighed. These were homogenised (Ultra Turrax T25 Basic, IKA, Staufen, Germany) at 24,000 rpm until the sample became a smooth paste. Approximately 1 g homogenate was weighed into a centrifuge tube and 10 ml 50 % aqueous ethanol (pH 2) was added. The homogenate-ethanol mixture was agitated continuously for 10 min to facilitate extraction of anthocyanins. The samples were then centrifuged at 1,349 g for 5 min. A subsample of the supernatant was diluted 1:10 with 1 M HCl. After 3 h, absorbance values of the diluted samples were recorded at 520 nm with a spectrophotometer. Anthocyanins results are expressed as mg malvidin-3-glucoside equivalents per gram berry weight (mg/g). Meteorological and climate data Temperature was measured at 15-min intervals during the post-veraison to harvest period (shielded Tinytag TG-0050, Gemini Data Loggers, Chichester, UK) at each site. The sensors and loggers were installed on posts (about 1.6 m above ground level) in a clear area within 20 m of the study vineyards\\u2019 edges. In addition, daily data for each site for other variables such as rainfall, radiation, evaporation, and moisture were purchased from the SILO data drill database (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Values of these variables for the growing season and the veraison to maturity period were calculated separately for each cultivar and season since the growing season lengths were different for each cultivar and/or season. For this study, the growing season was defined as the period between October and the date when fruit reached common maturity. The ripening period and the veraison to maturity period were defined as the 30-day period preceding common maturity (see also Gladstones 2011) and the period between the beginning of veraison and the designated common maturity date, respectively. Data standardisation Due to the weekly sampling interval, some samples were not exactly at a TSS of 22\\u00b0Brix (common maturity) on the sampling dates. For this reason, a linear interpolation was carried out to estimate levels of TA, anthocyanins and pH for those samples whose TSS values varied by more than 0.2\\u00b0Brix from common maturity. Common maturity was interpolated from a linear regression between accumulated biologically effective degree days (difference between the daily average temperature capped at 19 \\u00b0C and a base of 10 \\u00b0C) (Gladstones 1992) and the TSS values of two consecutive samples that enveloped the targeted common maturity. Overall, the variation between the interpolated common maturity TSS and actual values across sites and cultivars differed by less than 0.6\\u00b0Brix units. Selection of climate variables While temperature, rainfall and radiation are the basic components of climate that affect plant growth and development, variables derived from these may also influence berry composition. Thus, an a priori list of the basic variables and derivatives thereof that can potentially affect berry composition was compiled (Table 2), and their values computed for the entire or specific periods of the growing season. This exercise generated more than 70 variables (Table 2). Durations (h) over 25 \\u00b0C and 30 \\u00b0C during fruit ripening were estimated from the logged temperature on vineyard sites. In the warmer sites, berries attained the common maturity level in February; hence, data beyond this time were not included in the analyses reported here. Thus, although the growing season for the southern hemisphere is nominally defined from October to April, in this work the growing season ranges from October to the time berries reached the defined common maturity. October to March average temperature differences between the warmest and coolest sites were over 5 \\u00b0C for both seasons (Table 3). There were also considerable differences between sites in rainfall (10-fold in Season 1 and 3-fold in Season 2). However, the berry ripening periods were virtually rain-free, and all sites used supplementary irrigation. Table 2 Climate variables used for investigating grape fruit quality attributes at maturity Full size table Table 3 October to March average temperature and rainfall across the study sites during Season 1 (2008\\u20132009), and Season 2 (2009\\u20132010). Data source: interpolated (Silo DataDrill) weather data (Jeffrey et al. 2001) Full size table Data analysis The relationships of TA, anthocyanins and pH to climate variables along the climate gradient were explored through correlation and simple (multiple) linear regression analyses. The number of basic and derived climate (independent) variables was 3 to 4 times the number of dependent variables. Considering these small sample sizes, the maximum number of independent variables in the multiple regression analyses was capped at three (using a start with one independent variable and stop with three variables selection and switching routine). Even with this restriction, however, several thousand candidate models were generated for each cultivar. Selection of the likely models for the given data among these candidate models was carried out using Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Of the candidates, the model with the minimum AICc and others within 5 units of the minimum AICc model were retained for further scrutiny of model results against some known biology of the attribute being modelled. For example, if a model relating anthocyanins levels to the duration of average temperature above 30 \\u00b0C during ripening had a positive sign (i.e. qualitatively different from what is experimentally determined) such a model would be excluded even if it had the minimum AICc. Model selection based on some of the more common criteria (e.g. adjusted r 2 and Mallows\\u2019 C p) was carried out in addition to the information theory approach. The climate variables used for model building generally had high degrees of correlation. This often causes high multicollinearity, which is manifest, among others, in the form of high variance inflation factors (VIF) of parameter estimates and high condition numbers. Thus, the selected models were screened further with rule-of-thumb guidelines of 10 for VIF and 1,000 for condition number (Myers 1992). When a combination of climate variables appeared to account for a very high proportion of the observed variance in berry trait (e.g. > 97 % for pH) while exhibiting severe multicollinearity, ridge regression was performed on such variables. However, it was often the case that, at the ridge step that stabilised parameter estimates (VIF\\u2009\\u223c\\u20091), the penalised ridge model no longer retained its high explanatory power. In such cases, the variables and/or models were excluded from the results presented here despite the apparently high descriptive power of the initial models. Finally, for the data under consideration, one to three most probable models were presented and discussed for each attribute per cultivar (cultivar-specific models) or each attribute across cultivars (generic models). The predictive performances of the selected models were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) procedure as in Efron and Gong (1983) and Williams et al. (2005). In this procedure, each observation is left out one at a time and its value predicted using a new model parameterised on the remaining n\\u22121 observations. Thus, for a sample of size n, n sets of models are generated (on n\\u22121 observations) to predict the corresponding left out observations. The average LOOCV prediction error estimate is (Efron and Gong 1983): $$ \\\\\\\\frac{1}{n}{\\\\\\\\displaystyle {\\\\\\\\sum}_{\\\\\\\\imath =1}^n{\\\\\\\\left({y}_{\\\\\\\\imath }-{\\\\\\\\widehat{y}}_{\\\\\\\\imath}\\\\\\\\right)}^2} $$ (1) where n is the sample size or the number of validations, y \\u0131 is the left out observation and \\\\\\\\( {\\\\\\\\widehat{y}}_{\\\\\\\\imath } \\\\\\\\) is its predicted value. All analyses were carried out with SAS v 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results Patterns of total anthocyanins, TA and pH at common maturity across sites At common maturity, there were significant differences in berry composition between the cooler and warmer sites. Generally, berries from the cooler sites, for instance Frankland and Pemberton, had higher levels of anthocyanins (48\\u201371 % for Cabernet Sauvignon and 22\\u201330 % for Shiraz, depending on the season) than those from the warmer sites, such as the Swan or the Chapman Valleys (Fig. 2). Likewise, the levels of TA were higher in the cooler than in the warmer sites: 31\\u201362 % for Cabernet Sauvignon, 32\\u201382 % for Shiraz, and 61\\u2013126 % for Chardonnay depending on season (Fig. 2). Unlike the anthocyanins and TA levels, berry juice pH at common maturity did not show a clear trend across sites when the sites were characterized by the long-term growing season average temperature alone (Fig. 2). Nonetheless, the highest juice pH levels were observed at the warmer sites in both seasons (Chapman Valley for Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, and at the Swan Valley for Chardonnay). Fig. 2 Levels of grape quality attributes [anthocyanins, titratable acidity (TA), and pH] at total soluble solids (TSS) of 22 \\u00b0Brix. Sites are listed (from left to right) according to their long-term growing season temperature in decreasing order Full size image Relationships of total anthocyanins, TA and pH with climate variables Exploratory bivariate correlation analyses of climate variables at different periods during the growing season and berry components at common maturity identified climate variables and critical periods that were influential on berry composition. Rainfall, either early in the growing season (September\\u2013November) or during the entire growing season, had positive impacts on TA levels at common maturity (Fig. 3a). Available soil water holding capacity (AWC) generally had little influence on TA at common maturity. By contrast, for all three ccultivars, TA levels at common maturity were negatively related to temperature (and temperature-derived variables), radiation and evaporation (Fig. 3a). In particular, consistently moderate to strong negative correlations (\\u22120.82 to \\u22120.47) were observed with variables involving maximum temperature and its derivatives such as diurnal temperature ranges and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) during December, January and February; frequency of days above 25 \\u00b0C during the growing season, and the number of hours over 30 \\u00b0C during the ripening period (Fig. 3a). Correlations of TA with minimum temperatures early in the growing season were both weak and varied among cultivars; however, the strength of correlations increased steadily and became qualitatively similar as the season progressed, becoming strongest during the ripening period (Fig. 3a). Such steady increases in the correlation strength from October to January/February months were also evident for the other monthly average climate variables (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3 Correlations between grape quality attributes (TA, pH and anthocyanin concentrations) at common maturity (22 \\u00b0Brix TSS) and climate variables for Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Chardonnay. Months are denoted by their initial three letters. Tmn Minimum temperature; Tav average temperature; Tmx maximum temperatures; RP ripening period; DR diurnal range; D25, D30 number of days with maximum temperature over 25 \\u00b0C or 30 \\u00b0C; H25, H30 number of hours over 25 \\u00b0C or 30 \\u00b0C; Evp Class A pan evaporation; VPD vapour pressure deficit; Rad net radiation; AWC available soil water holding capacity; Rn_SN, Rn_GS rainfall during September to November or during growing season, respectively Full size image The correlations of juice pH with all climate variables were: (1) opposite to the TA results, and (2) of generally lower strength than the TA correlaions with the same variables (cf. Fig. 3a and b). While the strongest pH correlations were observed with climate variables for the month of February and, unexpectedly, October (Fig. 3b), the correlations showed dynamic temporal patterns. Thus, in general, pH correlations with temperature, diurnal range and VPD variables started with a peak in October, attained a minimum in November and rose steadily back to peak level in February; correlations with evaporation and radiation variables also started with a peak in October, declined until December and returned to a peak level in February (Fig. 3b). For both Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, berry anthocyanins concentrations were associated negatively with almost all the climate variables examined in this study (Fig. 3c). Only rainfall variables had positive influences. Rainfall incident early in the growing season (September\\u2013November) appeared to have a stronger influence on berry anthocyanins than rainfall during the whole growing season. Similar to the results for pH, berry anthocyanins concentrations of both red cultivars were highly negatively correlated (\\u22120.83\\u2009<\\u2009r\\u2009<\\u2009\\u2212 0.77) with October temperatures, particularly the average and maximum temperatures (Fig. 3c). The strengths of correlations with November temperatures showed a slight drop, from there on however, the influences of temperatures on berry anthocyanins concentration increased steadily up to January/February (Fig. 3c). This temporal pattern was common across the minimum, average and maximum temperatures. Similarly, the degree of association between berry anthocyanins concentration at common maturity with diurnal range variables, while generally moderate during December (\\u22120.4\\u2009<\\u2009r<\\u2009\\u22120.2), became stronger (\\u22120.75\\u2009<\\u2009r\\u2009<\\u22120.50) towards the ripening period. Other variables that appeared to exert a relatively strong negative influence (r\\u2009<\\u2009\\u22120.7) on berry anthocyanins concentrations of both cultivars were the number of hours that the air temperature exceeded 25 \\u00b0C during the ripening period, VPD during January/February and radiation in February. For most of the growing season, berry anthocyanins concentration also had a strong negative association with evaporative demand (Fig. 3c). Temperature effects on rates of change of berry total anthocyanins, TA and pH For both red cultivars, berry anthocyanins concentrations were significantly and inversely related to the average temperature of the veraison to maturity period. However, the rate of decline, expressed as the slope of the linear regression, of anthocyanins concentrations per degree increase in the veraison to maturity period average temperature, was significantly greater for Cabernet Sauvignon (0.07) than for Shiraz (0.03) (Fig. 4). Similarly, for all three cultivars, the levels of TA declined significantly as a site\\u2019s growing season average daily maximum temperature increased (Fig. 5a). The rate of acid loss, however, varied with cultivar, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay being the least and most sensitive, respectively (Fig. 5a). In contrast to the responses of anthocyanins and TA, pH levels for all cultivars showed consistent positive trends with the growing season average daily maximum temperature, though these were not significant (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) (Fig. 5b).

However, the trend was significant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) for Chardonnay only, while the trends for Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz were marginal (P\\u2009=\\u20090.053 and P\\u2009=\\u20090.112, respectively).

Inset Estimation of the rates of change of quality attributes over the veraison to harvest period using the sequential sampling data for the Kudardup site in Season 2 Full size image Similarly to the TA responses, for both Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, the rates of change in anthocyanins concentration per unit TSS increase trended negatively as the veraison to maturity period average temperature increased (Fig. 6b). However, there were varietal differences in the strength of this relationship, with the trend being significant only for Cabernet Sauvignon. Empirical models for total anthocyanins, TA and pH responses to changing climate conditions Out of more than 70 basic and derived climate variables, only a few (mean January temperature, radiation and number of hours over 25 \\u00b0C during the berry ripening period, and rainfall both during the September\\u2013November period, and the whole growing season) were pertinent for describing the variations in berry anthocyanins concentration along the 700 km sampling transect covering all major viticultural regions of Western Australia (Table 4). Table 4 Generic and variety-specific model estimates for berry anthocyanin concentration (mg/g berry)VIF max Maximum variance inflation factor, Rn_SN, Rn_GS September to November months and GS rainfalls (mm), Hr25_RP number of hours over 25 \\u00b0C during ripening period, Tav_Jan, Tmn_Jan average and mean of minimum temperatures in January (\\u00b0C), Rad_RP radiation during ripening period (MJ/m2) Full size table A three-variable generic model consisting of rainfall during spring, the growing season and the number of hours that the air temperature exceeded 25 \\u00b0C during the berry ripening period explained >70 % of the variation in berry anthocyanins concentrations for both cultivars (Table 4). The effects of these three variables on berry anthocyanins were in the same direction as their individual effects (cf. Fig. 3c, Table 4). The effects of rainfall, however, were dependent on when it occurred during the growing season. Whilst rainfall early in the growing season (September\\u2013November) had a positive effect, rainfall over the entire growing season had an unfavourable effect on berry anthocyanins levels. Partitioning the total growing season rainfall into early and late season rainfall also produced qualitatively and quantitatively comparable effects (data not shown). Compared to the generic model result, high proportions of the variations in berry anthocyanins were accounted for by cultivar-specific models. For Cabernet Sauvignon, the same three variables used in the generic model explained 83 % of the variability in berry anthocyanins concentrations across the sampling transect (Table 4). For Shiraz, a two-variable model of January minimum temperature and ripening period radiation described 70 % of the variation across sites. However, when one highly influential outlier observation was excluded, the proportion of variance explained by the same two variables increased to 94 % (Table 4). It is noteworthy that, for both cultivars, when a model contained both temperature and ripening period radiation, the radiation effect on anthocyanins concentrations was positive (i.e., contrary to the bivariate effect). Also notable was that, for both cultivars, the minimum or average January temperature alone accounted for between 50 % and 83 % of the variablity in berry anthocyanins concentrations (Table 4). Although not tabulated, for Shiraz\\u2014a cultivar known for its propensity for berry shrivel\\u2014berry anthocyanins concentrations responded significantly and positively to VPD. (For example: anthocyanins (Shiraz)\\u2009=\\u20093.78\\u2009+\\u20090.0354 November VPD\\u2009+\\u20090.0233 ripening period VPD \\u2212 0.1406 January to February mean temperature, r 2_adj\\u2009=\\u20090.92; anthocyanins (Shiraz)\\u2009=\\u20093.44\\u2009+\\u20090.023 December VPD\\u2009+\\u20090.0162 ripening period VPD \\u2212 0.1187 mean January temperature, r 2_adj\\u2009=\\u20090.89; all terms significant at P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Juice pH Compared to anthocyanins and TA (see below), juice pH at common maturity was generally weakly associated with the climate variables examined in this study. Yet, several models appeared to describe high proportions (e.g. up to 97 % for Shiraz) of the variances in pH along the sampling transect. However, the parameter estimates for one or more of the variables in the models were unreliable and all such models were excluded. After this screening, the \\u201cbest\\u201d candidate was a generic model, containing growing season degree days and October VPD, which described only half of the pH variations along the climate gradient (Table 5). For both variables, the directions of influence on pH were same as their individual effects. Table 5 Generic model estimates for pH level. GDD_GS growing season degree days, VPD_Oct October mean daily vapour pressure (hPa). See Table 4 for definitions Full size table Titratable acidity For all cultivars, between 59 % and 63 % of the variations in berry TA levels were described using generic models consisting of two temperature derived-variables: (1) growing season diurnal range (DR_GS) and ripening period minimum temperature (Tmn_RP), (2) growing season degree days (GDD_GS) and January diurnal range or (3) GDD_GS and October to February diurnal range (Table 6). In all three generic models, the impacts of these temperature derivatives on TA were significant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and negative (Table 6). Table 6 Generic and variety-specific model estimates for berry juice titratable acidity level (g/L). DR_GS, DR_OF Growing season and October to February months diurnal ranges, respectively; DR_Jan, DR_Feb January and February diurnal ranges; Tmn_RP, Tmx_RP means of minimum and maximum temperatures during ripening period; D25_GS number of days with maximum temperature over 25 \\u00b0C during growing season; Rad_Oct, Rad_Nov mean daily radiations in October and November (MJ/m2). Other details as in Tables 4 and 5 Full size table As observed for the total anthocyanins, cultivar-specific TA models explained significantly higher proportions of the variation in TA than were possible with the generic models (Table 6). For Cabernet Sauvignon, a model containing DR_GS and Tmn_RP accounted for about 77 % of the variability in TA, while a three-variable model with GDD_GS, DR_GS and Rn_GS (growing season rainfall) explained 85 % of the TA variation at maturity along the climate gradient. Once more, the impacts of the temperature variables were negative whilst that of rainfall was positive. For Chardonnay, the conjoint influences of DR_GS and Tmn_RP alone explained 81 % of the TA variance at maturity. Two three-variable models: (1) DR_Feb (February diurnal range), Tmn_RP, Rad_Oct (October radiation) and (2) Tmn_RP, D25_GS (days with maximum temperature over 25 \\u00b0C during growing season) and Rad_Nov (November radiation) accounted for slightly more of the variances across the climate gradient (Table 6). As observed for Cabernet Sauvignon, the effects of all the temperature-derived variables on TA were negative. For Shiraz, the maximum temperature during the ripening period alone explained 70 % of the variation in TA at common maturity across the sampling transect. However, the best candidate model contained two variables (October to February diurnal range and Rn_GS), which jointly accounted for 82 % of the variation in Shiraz TA across the transect over two seasons. Similar to the results for Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, the effects on TA of the temperature-based factors in the Shiraz models were negative while the impact of rainfall was positive (Table 6). Model evaluation Cross-validation analysis results of the prediction errors for the selected models are shown in Tables 4\\u20136. Comparing between the berry attributes, the relative prediction errors were lower for anthocyanins than for TA. In terms of model types, the predictive abilities of the generic models were, on the whole, lower than those of the cultivar-specific models. Nonetheless, for the data ranges observed in the current study, the prediction errors (when expressed as root-mean-square of prediction errors relative to the observed mean of a berry attribute) were less than 17 % for anthocyanins and TA across all cultivars. Discussion This work aimed to investigate the influences of climate variables (using a climate gradient) on berry TA, anthocyanins and pH for three major winegrape cultivars, and to develop empirical climate-variable based empirical models that describe the observed responses. Weekly berry sampling along a 700-km transect covering all the Western Australian wine growing regions provided the relevant berry composition data and climate-gradient to address these aims. Such a long sampling transect is also likely to generate \\u201cgradients\\u201d in variables other than climate (e.g. soil type, management). Nonetheless, when the results were examined at a standardised berry maturity: (1) there were clear differences, particularly in berry anthocyanins concentration, TA and to a lesser extent in pH, along the transect; and (2) more significantly, most of the variations in these berry components along the transect were accounted for using variations in the prevailing climates of the sites. As such, this provides a clear indication that (1) macroclimate exerts a dominant influence in shaping the regional pattern of berry composition (Smart 1985; Winkler 1974), and (2) the information so gleaned may, with caution, be used for assessing impacts of climate change on berry composition. Details are discussed in the following sections. Acidity along the climate gradient For all three cultivars, bivariate correlation analyses of TA at maturity with climate variables have discerned at least three salient features: (1) TA is correlated negatively with almost all monthly climate variable indices throughout the growing season except rainfall, (2) by contrast, the TA correlations with rainfall variables are positive, and (3) the strength of the associations (regardless of its sign) between TA and climate variables increases steadily from early growing season towards the berry ripening period, indicating that the ripening period climate is more influential in determining berry composition at maturity (Buttrose et al. 1971; de Orduna 2010; Jackson and Lombard 1993). In particular, across cultivars, some of the strongest and most consistent negative associations of TA were with maximum temperatures. This may reflect the observation that, in berries, tartaric and malic acids constitute most (up to 92 %) of the total TA (Kliewer 1966) and that respiration of berry acids, particularly malic acid, increases with increasing temperatures (Coombe 1987; Sweetman et al. 2009). As indicated above, only rainfall variables were found to have positive influence on TA levels at maturity. The precise mechanism of how rainfall favours high TA levels is not clear, but possibilities include indirect influences via (1) lowering of air temperature with an increase in rainfall, and (2) increased vegetative growth with increased moisture availability\\u2014both of which would favour TA levels. pH trend along the climate gradient The associations between pH and monthly or ripening period temperature variables were generally positive. Dry (1983), using a broadly similar approach, also found a positive relationship between Shiraz berry pH and January average temperatures. Considerable increases in berry pH occur during berry ripening (Winkler 1974). However, influences of ripening period temperatures on pH were relatively modest for the red cultivars, particularly in Cabernet Sauvignon. Influences of moisture-related variables (rainfall and available soil water holding capacity) on berry pH levels, apart from being moderate, were also inconsistent among cultivars. All sites applied different levels of supplementary irrigation during the later periods of the growing season and therefore may have contributed to the lack of consistency of the moisture-related variables\\u2019 effects on pH levels at maturity. According to Smart (1985), of the three berry attributes examined here, berry pH is the most sensitive to climate conditions within a vine canopy (microclimate). The within-vine microclimate can vary considerably within a field as a function of canopy size. It is thus probable that microclimate variations may have masked the macroclimate influence on pH, and hence the \\u201clack\\u201d of a strong pH trend along the climate gradient. Trend of total anthocyanins along the climate gradient Accumulation of anthocyanins commences at veraison for red grape cultivars (Mullins et al. 1992) and the accumulation process is influenced by environmental and management conditions (Downey et al. 2006; Kliewer and Weaver 1971). It was, thus, anticipated that anthocyanins levels would show a strong association with ripening period climate variables. This was generally borne out in that some of the strongest (negative) correlations were with climate variables from January and February (months which make up part of the ripening period). More generally, for both red cultivars, higher berry anthocyanins concentrations were found in berries from cooler rather than from warmer sites, consistent with earlier reports (Kliewer and Torres 1972; Kliewer 1977; Mori et al. 2005). For Cabernet Sauvignon, strong negative associations between anthocyanins levels at maturity and January average or maximum temperature, or duration of hours > 25 \\u00b0C or > 30 \\u00b0C during the ripening period were observed. Surprisingly, these results from the 700-km long climate gradient study are remarkably consistent with the results of Mori et al. (2007) from a controlled environment study that demonstrated striking effects of high daytime temperature (35 \\u00b0C), which caused a more than 50 % reduction in Cabernet Sauvignon anthocyanins accumulation compared to the control treatment (25 \\u00b0C daytime temperature). Net anthocyanins accumulation is a balance between synthesis and degradation, and, according to Mori et al. (2007), low levels of anthocyanins, at least in Cabernet Sauvignon, under high temperature conditions result primarily from increased degradation and secondarily from reduced synthesis. For Shiraz anthocyanins, the average minimum temperature in January emerged as the most influential variable. As reviewed by Jackson and Lombard (1993), berry anthocyanins are reduced or enhanced above or below a night-time temperature of 15 \\u00b0C, respectively. For the majority of the sites in this study, the average night-time temperature was over 15 \\u00b0C in January, and therefore minimum temperature may have exerted more influence on Shiraz anthocyanins concentration than the other climate variables. In this regard, it is worth noting that climate projections indicate a relatively greater rise in the minimum temperature, during the ripening period. The degree of association between berry anthocyanins concentration at maturity and the maximum temperatures in October and January were similar. As such, this is contrary to the expectation that anthocyanins accumulation is more influenced by the ripening period climate than by climatic events prevailing at the start of the growing season. Indeed, other climate indices for the month of October also showed a consistently moderate to strong influence on (correlation with) the berry attributes examined in this study. One possible explanation is that warmer temperatures early in the growing season shorten the season (Coombe 1988) and thereby bring forward the ripening to the warmer period, which is detrimental for anthocyanins accumulation in berries as discussed above. The strong inverse relationships between the maximum temperature in October and the dates of maturity for all three cultivars (data not shown) support this contention. A further possibility is that warmer events early in the spring (while soil moisture is still high) favour increased vegetative growth which often tends to lessen anthocyanins concentrations (Smart et al. 1988). Of all the correlations between the anthocyanins levels and climate variables, only those with the water-related variables (available soil water holding capacity, rainfall) had positive signs. And of these, only the correlations with rainfall in the September\\u2013November period were significant. While increased moisture availability late in the growing season is often reported to reduce anthocyanins levels (Chalmers et al. 2010; Jackson and Lombard 1993), it appears that improved water availability early in the growing season is beneficial as it promotes the initial and subsequent adequate vegetative growth (Keller et al. 2010) and, hence, proper development of the berry and its composition at later stages. Temperature influence on rates of change of TA and total anthocyanins TA levels at common maturity declined as the growing season average maximum temperature increased; however, the rates differed between cultivars. Similar responses have been indicated in other cultivars as a function of growing degree days (GDD; Winkler 1974). The magnitude of rate is, by definition, a reflection of the degree of each cultivar\\u2019s TA variation. Thus Chardonnay, which showed the widest range of TA levels at common maturity, had the largest rate of drop (0.66 g/L per \\u00b0C warming in the growing season average maximum temperature), followed by Shiraz (0.51 g/L); while Cabernet Sauvignon, which had the narrowest range of variation, dropped at half the rate of Chardonnay. These rates are inversely proportional to the cultivars\\u2019 maturity grouping (Gladstones 1992). As such, at least for TA, these results are consistent with the view that the largest rate difference occurs between early- and late-maturing cultivars (Winkler 1974). These results also suggest that, other factors being the same, increased warming will have a relatively greater negative impact on Chardonnay TA than on Shiraz or Cabernet Sauvignon. Similarly with TA, anthocyanins concentrations for both red cultivars were negatively related to (veraison to maturity period) temperature. However, unlike TA, anthocyanins concentration of Cabernet Sauvignon showed a wider range of variation across the temperature gradient than those of Shiraz. Consequently, the decline in anthocyanins with increasing temperature was higher for Cabernet than for Shiraz. This outcome suggests that the degree of plasticity of a trait in a given cultivar rather than a cultivar\\u2019s maturity grouping determines the rate of change in a trait in response to temperature. Collectively, these contrasting results provide evidence for the differential influence of temperature not only among cultivars but also on different berry traits within a cultivar, and hence underscore a need for caution on extrapolating the impact of climate warming on other berry components and cultivars. Temperature influence on rates of change in total anthocyanins and TA relative to sugar accumulation rates The relative rates of change in berry components during ripening have crucial importance for viticulture since the ultimate composition of wine depends on the balance between sugar and the other elements of berry composition at harvest. In practice, TSS is used to assess berry ripeness with a tacit perception that accumulation rates of berry components are synchronous or closely coupled with soluble solids (but see Winkler 1974; Gladstones 1992). This study showed that for some combinations of cultivar and berry components (e.g. TA in Chardonnay and anthocyanins concentration in Cabernet Sauvignon) warmer ripening conditions significantly altered the rates of change of these attributes relative to soluble solids accumulation rates. Sadras et al. (2007b) also found a decoupling of anthocyanins and sugar accumulation rates in Cabernet Sauvignon with increasing water stress during the ripening period, although in this case anthocyanins were favoured. The relative accumulation rates shifted from nearly isometric in vines that received 50 % more water than \\u201cstandard\\u201d irrigation volume to increasingly allometric (in favour of anthocyanins) as irrigation volume declined to 40 % of the \\u201cstandard\\u201d level. These two lines of evidence show that heat and water stress elicit contrasting responses in anthocyanins accumulation rates relative to total soluble solids. In terms of the results observed from this study, the consequences of significant slowing of anthocyanins accumulation rates relative to the rates for soluble solids are manifested in reduced colouration of Cabernet Sauvignon berries under warmer ripening conditions (Fig. 3), although Shiraz appears relatively less sensitive. The decoupling of sugar and anthocyanins accumulation rates is understandably described in terms of the differential temperature optima of the respective processes (see Sadras et al. 2007b). The relative insensitivity of Shiraz suggests that, at least in this cultivar, the temperature optima ranges of processes responsible for sugar and anthocyanins accumulation are comparable. However, further evaluation whether this is the case is warranted. Models for assessing responses of total anthocyanins, TA and pH to changing climate For each of the three berry components examined here, it was possible to describe a significant proportion of their variation across the climate gradients using generic or cultivar-specific models (Tables 4\\u20136). That it is possible to describe, albeit it to varying degrees, each berry attribute using a generic model suggests that, regardless of cultivar, a given berry attribute is influenced by a common underlying process, or that if different processes are at play these respond similarly to the same set of climate variables. Nonetheless, the descriptive performances of the generic models, except that of pH, were generally lower than the cultivar-specific models, even when the climate variables were identical in both models. This, however, need not be unexpected considering that the three cultivars fall into three different maturity groups. That is, the critical berry development and/or ripening periods and the climate variables that prevail during the corresponding times are different for different cultivars. For this reason, the discussion that follows generally focusses on the cultivar-specific models. The anthocyanin models were generally dominated by climate indices derived from part or whole of the anthocyanins accumulation period. The significant variables identified for describing anthocyanins concentration were temperature indices from the month of January and/or the ripening period, rainfall and radiation. The impacts of temperature variables (when present in the models alone or in combination with other climate variables) were negative, which is in accord with the widely understood effect of temperature on anthocyanins (see previous section). With respect to radiation, variable effects were observed depending on whether it was considered alone (Fig. 4) or together with temperature (Table 4). Reported effects of radiation on berry anthocyanins span the full spectrum of possible responses ranging from an increase (Kliewer 1977; Smart et al. 1988; Spayd et al. 2002), no effect (Cortell and Kennedy 2006; Downey et al. 2004) to a reduction (Haselgrove et al. 2000) in anthocyanins concentrations as radiation levels increase. The diversity of reported responses is likely to reflect differences in experimental set up with variable control in temperature (Downey et al. 2004). However, even when temperature is carefully controlled, variable though qualitatively similar responses to radiation are reported, from an increase (Spayd et al. 2002) to no effect (Cortell and Kennedy 2006; Downey et al. 2004). However, from multiple regression analyses (Table 4) it emerged that when radiation and temperature from the ripening period occurred together in anthocyanins models, the radiation effect was positive while temperature was consistently negative. This approach appears to be useful in differentiating the effects of temperature and radiation on berry anthocyanins levels, and supports the suggestion that the apparent negative effect of radiation is a reflection of the attendant elevated temperature load effect (Bergqvist et al. 2001; Downey et al. 2004; Haselgrove et al. 2000). pH was the most recalcitrant of the berry attributes to describe adequately in terms of macroclimate variations along the climate gradient. Only about half the variations in pH could be described by a generic model containing GDD and October VPD. The influences of both variables on pH were positive (same as in the bivariate analyses). Boulton (1980) has shown that berry pH is primarily a function of the levels of organic acids and the monovalent cations, mainly potassium. It can thus be argued that to the extent climate influences pH, the effect is indirect via the levels of acids and cation uptake. In this respect, the positive influence of high GDD is likely to relate to its negative impact on acidity (Winkler 1974; this study) which, other things being equal, elevates berry pH. On the other hand, how VPD in October positively influences berry pH is less clear. However, high VPD early in the growing season (October), when soil moisture is relatively adequate, promotes water and potassium uptake (Rankine et al. 1971; Ruhl 1992) and sequestration in the vine system. Part of the potassium so sequestered is remobilised during ripening to augment the potassium levels in berries (Conradie 1981), which may then contribute positively to berry pH (Boulton 1980; Rankine et al. 1971). Across all three cultivars, a high proportion of the variation in TA along the climate gradient was accounted for. The most pertinent variables for describing TA variations along the climate gradient were primarily temperature and temperature-derived variables, and growing season rainfall. The joint influences of these temperature and rainfall variables on TA were directionally the same as the individual effects. While the negative effect of maximum temperature on TA is well acknowledged, an outstanding observation from this gradient study is the prevalence of the ripening period minimum temperature in the TA models of all three cultivars. Further, the impact of this variable on TA was without exception negative. Given that the minimum temperatures have increased faster than the maximum temperature (Easterling et al. 1997), increased acid loss may occur even without an increase in the maximum temperature. Prediction errors of the final models, although the validation was based on a relatively small dataset, were within 17 % of the means regardless of cultivar or berry attributes. While this level of prediction error may be considered acceptable, there were cultivar-, model- (generic vs cultivar-specific), and berry attribute-dependent differences in the magnitude of prediction errors. These differences appear to be linked to the degree of variation in a trait\\u2019s value at common maturity: the greater the spread in a given trait\\u2019s value at common maturity, the greater the error of prediction. This is more clearly seen with regard to TA (cf. Table 6, Fig. 2). Although the models presented here accounted for a high proportion of the variation in the berry attributes examined for all three cultivars, caution is advised when applying these models in other environments. As with any other regression models, these empirical models are not free of shortcomings since these were not based on mechanistic processes, although known effects on the (direction of) impact of specific climate variables on berry composition were taken into account in the model selection process. Further, non-climatic factors (such as crop load, canopy manipulation, soil management), which can influence berry composition (Kliewer and Weaver 1971; Smart 1985; Jackson and Lombard 1993), were not explicitly incorporated. Additionally, in this study, climate variables whose values are functions of time, such as GDD, were used. On the other hand, levels of the berry components are also time dependent. Hence, it is possible that regression between such time dependent variables yields fortuitous associations (sensu Jones and Davis 2000). However, the berry components examined for this study were not dependent on elapsed time since these were standardised to a common maturity TSS (22\\u00b0Brix) across sites. Therefore, it is argued that even though some time dependent variables are included in the models, the results are unlikely to be coincidental, and the inferences drawn from the models are valid. Conclusion This study has shown that, for all three major winegrape cultivars examined here, there were strong trends in berry anthocyanins concentrations and titratable acidity along the 700-km transect (climate gradient). This demonstrates that, despite variations in a range of factors that can potentially affect berry composition, climate is the dominant factor in shaping the regional pattern of berry composition. This provides support for the use of climate gradient as a surrogate for evaluating potential impacts of changing climate on some aspects of viticulture. These observations were used to develop parsimonious empirical models that, with consideration of the caveats discussed above, could be used for assessing climate change impacts on these berry attributes and cultivars across the wine regions of western Australia. While the key aspects of observations from the climate gradient are consistent with, and are underpinned by, results from controlled experiments, our results are nonetheless based on short-term (two seasons and ten regions) sampling. Thus, further observations (a longer time series) of climate and biochemistry data are warranted to both corroborate the conclusions of this short-term study and verify the robustness of model parameter estimates.

The construction of traditional drought models and indexes seldom considers multiple drought-causing factors. This study integrated the precipitation, soil water and heat balance, and crop growth during drought. From the beginning of the process of agricultural drought, the atmosphere, soil, and crops that characterize drought are considered, through the principal component analysis method to construct a comprehensive drought monitoring index (CDMI). This index was verified by using the areas covered by drought, areas affected by drought, relative soil moisture, and crop yield. The annual average CDMI had negative correlations with areas covered and affected by drought. The correlation coefficients were \\u20130.68 and \\u20130.73. Moreover, the CDMI value had positive correlations with relative soil moisture and crop yield. The maximum correlation coefficient between CDMI and relative soil moisture was 0.91, and the correlation coefficient with maize yield was 0.52. Subsequently, the CDMI was applied to long-term drought monitoring in agricultural areas during the summer maize growing season (June to September) in Henan Province. Results showed that the most severe years of agricultural drought in Henan Province were 2000, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2014. The most severe agricultural drought occurred in July and August 2014. Statistics found that Henan Province had high frequencies of severe drought. This study proved that CDMI calculated by multisource remote sensing data is a reliable and effective indicator for monitoring and assessing agricultural drought.

Jennings1* Ann-Kristin Koehler1 Kathryn J. Nicklin1 Chetan Deva1 Steven M. Sait2 Andrew J. Challinor1 1Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom 2Faculty of Biological Sciences, School of Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom The contribution of potatoes to the global food supply is increasing\\u2014consumption more than doubled in developing countries between 1960 and 2005. Understanding climate change impacts on global potato yields is therefore important for future food security. Analyses of climate change impacts on potato compared to other major crops are rare, especially at the global scale. Of two global gridded potato modeling studies published at the time of this analysis, one simulated the impacts of temperature increases on potential potato yields; the other did not simulate the impacts of farmer adaptation to climate change, which may offset negative climate change impacts on yield. These studies may therefore overestimate negative climate change impacts on yields as they do not simultaneously include CO2 fertilisation and adaptation to climate change. Here we simulate the abiotic impacts of climate change on potato to 2050 using the GLAM crop model and the ISI-MIP ensemble of global climate models. Simulations include adaptations to climate change through varying planting windows and varieties and CO2 fertilisation, unlike previous global potato modeling studies. Results show significant skill in reproducing observed national scale yields in Europe. Elsewhere, correlations are generally positive but low, primarily due to poor relationships between national scale observed yields and climate. Future climate simulations including adaptation to climate change through changing planting windows and crop varieties show that yields are expected to increase in most cases as a result of longer growing seasons and CO2 fertilisation. Average global yield increases range from 9 to 20% when including adaptation. The global average yield benefits of adaptation to climate change range from 10 to 17% across climate models. Potato agriculture is associated with lower green house gas emissions relative to other major crops and therefore can be seen as a climate smart option given projected yield increases with adaptation. 1. Introduction Potato is the most important non-grain crop and 4th most important crop in terms of global production (FAO, 2019). Global potato production has increased by about 20% since 1990, although production is still 50% below that of wheat, maize, and rice (FAO, 2019). Global production is skewed toward the northern hemisphere and especially Europe, which has around 50% of global growing area and relatively high yields (Birch et al., 2012; FAO, 2019). Asia is now catching Europe up as a major global producer, with India, Bangladesh, and China increasing potato yields and area grown (FAO, 2019). Africa has also seen an increase in potato growing areas since 1990 (FAO, 2019). These regions rely on potatoes for a growing proportion of calories, meaning that potatoes have increasing potential to combat food insecurity, especially given their relatively high nutrient content (Lutaladio and Castaldi, 2009; Devaux et al., 2014). Given the increased importance of potatoes globally there is an ever-growing need to understand the impacts of climate change on potato agriculture. Temperature can limit potatoes to being grown at higher elevations in hotter countries, with it being a common lowland crop only in temperate areas\\u2014tuber growth is inhibited above 33\\u00b0C (Ingram and McCloud, 1984; Wolf et al., 1990; Timlin et al., 2006). For respectable yields, over 500 mm of water is required over a typical growing season of 120\\u2013150 days (FAO, 2019). Therefore, without farmer management adaptations to climate change such as shifting planting dates or varieties potato yields may fall in areas already marginal for potato growth due to water limitations or rising temperatures (Raymundo et al., 2018). Most Potatoes have indeterminate growth\\u2014i.e., crop maturity is not driven solely by environmental and genetic factors. Management decisions are also key to when potatoes are harvested. Temperature is the most important climatic variable determining duration, but the relationship of climate variables to duration of developmental stages weakens after tuber initiation (Kooman et al., 1996). Typically, potatoes are harvested when senescence has taken place for some time, allowing canopy die back, and depending on management decisions the crop haulm is cut back using mechanical or chemical methods and left for several days. Skin hardening of tubers takes place during this time (Wilcockson et al., 1985). Management factors include the desired starch or dry matter content of tubers (Noda et al., 2004), time taken for skin hardening (Wilcockson et al., 1985), local pest and disease pressures, level of soil moisture (excessively dry or wet soils making harvest impractical) and market prices for different varieties (Burton, 1989; Harris, 1992). Crop management must not only adapt to climate change to maintain sufficient production but do so in a way that reduces green house gas emissions as much as possible\\u2014i.e., cropping systems must be climate smart (FAO, 2010). Transformative changes for climate smart agriculture can include changes to crops that cope with climate change impacts and emit relatively low emissions (Lipper et al., 2014). Potatoes have relatively low agricultural emissions compared to other crops (Flynn et al., 2005; Haile-Mariam et al., 2008; Nemecek et al., 2012; Clune et al., 2017). For example, CO2 emissions have been shown to be lower for potato than sweet corn (Haile-Mariam et al., 2008), nitrous oxide emissions are lower for potato than cereal crops (Flynn et al., 2005) and in general, root crops have lower global warming potential than cereals, other vegetables and fruit crops (Nemecek et al., 2012; Clune et al., 2017). Clune et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of life cycle assessment and associated global warming potential for 168 food crops and livestock products, with potato having the third lowest average global warming potential. Despite the importance of understanding the potential of potatoes to contribute to a climate smart future, there has been a lack of previous potato modeling studies compared to other crops, especially at the global scale. Hijmans (2003) is one of very few examples, but this study only examined the impacts of temperature changes on potential yields, not including changes to CO2 and precipitation. Being a C3 crop, potato yields are likely to increase with elevated CO2 due to CO2 fertilisation (Finnan et al., 2005; Fleisher et al., 2008). Including these impacts is especially important as some studies suggest rising CO2 to be more important than other mean climatic changes (Haverkort et al., 2013) and that CO2 fertilisation for potatoes could be higher than for other C3 crops (Magliulo et al., 2003). Raymundo et al. (2018) include a CO2 parameterisation in global potato simulations but do not consider adaptations of variety and planting date changes in the future. Raymundo et al. (2018) project global yield decreases by the mid twenty-first century of 2\\u20136% and Hijmans (2003) decreases of 9\\u201318% when considering adaptation to climate change but not CO2 fertilisation. Climate change impact studies may lose accuracy if they do not include at least some autonomous adaptation measures (Challinor et al., 2018). Of the 91 published analyses on climate change impacts on crop yields included in The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment report, 33 included adaptation measures (Porter et al., 2014). These measures were limited to changes in planting date, irrigation, crop variety, and fertiliser (Challinor et al., 2014b). In reality many adaptation measures exist that are not included in crop modeling studies due to current model limitations or a lack of knowledge of specific place-based processes (Beveridge et al., 2018), especially at the global scale. Crop-climate impacts studies increasingly examine yield changes when allowing planting dates and varieties to vary in the future climate, rather than using so-called \\u201cdumb farmer\\u201d planting dates and varieties that do not vary in the future climate (Deryng et al., 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Previous global gridded modeling studies have featured simulations that allow planting dates and crop phenologies to vary as well as simulations that keep these fixed to those used in the historical climate (Deryng et al., 2014; M\\u00fcller et al., 2017). Changing planting dates and varieties in the future may not be straightforward due to factors not typically taken into account in modeling studies, including market pressures, pests and diseases, other crops, and irrigation water availability (Hijmans, 2003). Many adaptation scenarios can be envisaged, ranging from the so-called \\u201cdumb farmer\\u201d who does not react at all to climate change, to the \\u201cclairvoyant farmer,\\u201d who reacts with no restrictions to resources for adaptation\\u2014for example complete access to alternative crop varieties (Schneider et al., 2000; F\\u00fcssel, 2007). The most realistic adaptation scenario will be context specific, depending on regional constraints such as variety availability or the growing seasons of alternative crops. For this reason, global studies necessarily make assumptions that will not apply to all regions\\u2014an example of global studies losing regional skill (Challinor et al., 2014a). Some studies preferentially avoid a dumb farmer scenario, assuming that farmers will adapt in some ways to climate change and if not including adaptation the impacts of climate change will be inaccurate (e.g., Mendelsohn et al., 2000; Hijmans, 2003). Here we simulate climate change impacts on potato yields globally, taking into account CO2 fertilisation alongside adaptation to climate change, unlike previous global potato climate change modeling studies (Hijmans, 2003; Raymundo et al., 2018). In accordance with the overarching objectives of this speciality section of Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems (Whitfield et al., 2018), we assess future climate impacts on potato yields and comment on the climate-smartness of these projections. 2. Materials and Methods We firstly evaluate the ability of the potato model to simulate potato yields globally in the historical period of 1980\\u20132009. After this assessment of model skill, simulations are used to assess the impacts of climate change on yields, simulating yields both in the baseline period (1990\\u20132010) and in the future (2040\\u20132060) with adaptations to climate change. \\u201cAdaptation\\u201d in model simulations refers to changes to planting windows and varieties. Technology trends on yields are not accounted for. Non-adaptation simulations are included as a point of reference to adaptation simulations, which are seen as more realistic as they avoid the \\u201cdumb farmer\\u201d bias (Schneider et al., 2000; F\\u00fcssel, 2007). We are assuming that farmers have complete access to the varieties simulated which is seen as more realistic than assuming constant planting dates and varieties between now and 2050 (Mendelsohn et al., 2000). Given the relatively low emissions associated with potato agriculture, if yields are projected to be maintained/increase then these potato adaptations are deemed climate smart, given that changes to planting windows and varietal durations will not by themselves lead to increased emissions. 2.1. The GLAM-Potato Crop Model The General Large Area Model for annual crops (GLAM; Challinor et al., 2004) is a process-based crop model, designed to operate at the spatial scale of global and regional climate models (Challinor et al., 2003). The modeling philosophy of GLAM can be summarised as \\u201cappropriate model complexity.\\u201d Less complex models may omit important processes, potentially leading to poor model skill. More complex models do not necessarily result in improved model performance, however. If the quality of the input data required by complex models is poor, results could also be poor (Jamieson et al., 1998; Jagtap and Jones, 2002). Some studies have suggested that on larger spatial scales some processes become less important (Hansen and Jones, 2000; Challinor et al., 2004), allowing a less complex model to perform equally well. The relatively low number of parameters in GLAM reduces model sensitivity to poor quality input data (Challinor et al., 2004) and means that less extensive calibration is necessary, reducing the risk of \\u201covertuning\\u201d the model to data at certain sites (Cox et al., 2006). GLAM was originally developed for groundnut simulation as described by Challinor et al. (2004). Being modular, it is relatively easy to modify for other crops and has since been used to simulate spring wheat (Koehler et al., 2013), winter wheat (Li, 2008), maize (Bergamaschi et al., 2013), soybean (Osborne et al., 2013), and sorghum (Nicklin, 2013). See Supplementary Section 1.1 for a complete description of modifications made to the model for the simulation of potatoes. A brief description of the model is given here. The crop is planted within a specified planting window when soil moisture and temperature are sufficient (see Supplementary Section 1.1.1), or at the end of the planting window if these conditions are not met (this is referred to as \\u201cemergency planting\\u201d). The length of the potato growing season is dependent on the accumulation of thermal time and photoperiod. Daily thermal time is calculated as the amount by which daily mean temperature exceeds a base temperature up to an optimum temperature, at which development is fastest. Temperatures above the optimum lead to a gradual decline in development rate up to a maximum temperature, above which development is halted. For potato, tuber initiation is also sensitive to photoperiod\\u2014this is parameterised using a photoperiod response function (Streck et al., 2007) which is multiplied by the thermal time calculated for each day during this developmental stage. The four growth stages for potato are: (i) planting to emergence, (ii) emergence to tuber initiation (sensitive to photoperiod), (iii) tuber initiation to senescence, and (iv) senescence to harvest. GLAM-potato parameterised crop growth using transpiration efficiency (TE) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) approaches (Osborne et al., 2013). Parameterisation of CO2 fertilisation is achieved through increases in these parameters as described in section 2.3. Each day the biomass assimilated is the minimum of that associated with TE or RUE. Potential evapotranspiration rates are defined as in Priestley and Taylor (1972). At harvest maturity crop biomass is partitioned to yield using a harvest index approach. A yield gap parameter CYG accounts for factors not explicitly simulated in the model such as pests, diseases, and non-optimal management (including the level of fertiliser use). Heat stress around tuber initiation is parameterised according to the methods of Osborne et al. (2013). 2.2. Input Data 2.2.1. Climate Data GLAM requires daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation data. The EWEMBI data set (Lange, 2019) is used as the climate input data for evaluation of GLAM in the historical period. The EWEMBI data set was compiled for bias correction of climate input data for the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP; Frieler et al., 2017). The EWEMBI data cover the globe at 0.5 degree spatial and daily temporal resolution. Data sources of EWEMBI are ERA-Interim reanalysis data (ERAI; Dee et al., 2011), WATCH forcing data methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis data (WFDEI; Weedon et al., 2014), eartH2Observe forcing data (E2OBS; Calton, 2016), and NASA/GEWEX Surface Radiation Budget data (SRB; Stackhouse, 2011). The SRB data were used to bias-correct E2OBS shortwave and longwave radiation (Lange, 2018). ISI-MIP 2b bias-corrected input data are used for the climate change analysis (Hempel et al., 2013; Frieler et al., 2017). EWEMBI data are used for the bias-correction, as described in Lange (2018). Four GCMs are used (HadGEM2-ES, GFDL-ESM2M, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC5). ISI-MIP data are selected for use as they represent a globally-coherent data set that is a reasonable subset of the CMIP5 ensemble, as demonstrated by McSweeney and Jones (2016). The period 2040\\u20132060 is chosen for the future climate simulations as by 2050 population growth is projected to stabilise and there is a need to understand how to feed this population without worsening climate change by emitting more green house gases (Foley, 2011). The RCP 8.5 scenario is used, representing current climate change trajectories (i.e., a pessimistic future), although there is relatively little difference in climate change across RCPs by 2050 (Moss et al., 2010). A baseline period of 1990\\u20132010 is used to compare to the future time period as this is centered on the historical growing area information and contains the same number of years as the future period. 2.2.2. Potato Growing Area, Irrigation, and Soil Data Global growing areas and irrigation are from the MIRCA data set (Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas\\u2014Portmann et al., 2010\\u2014Figure 1), representing growing areas in the year 2000 (the center of our historical period). Grid cells are selected for simulation if they contain potato growing area, as defined by MIRCA. Irrigation is determined by a majority grid cell approach. If a grid cell has >50% of its growing area irrigated, irrigated simulations are used for that grid cell. Otherwise simulations for the grid cell are rainfed. A supplementary irrigation routine is used for this study; if soil moisture on a given day falls below a threshold defined as 60% of available soil moisture, up to 1 cm of water is added to the uppermost soil layer until soil moisture is at field capacity (Lundstrom and Stegman, 1988; Critchley et al., 2013). figure 1 FIGURE 1. (A) Growing areas per grid cell in hectares. (B) Percentage of potato area that is irrigated per grid cell. Shapefiles from the Database of Global Administrative Areas are used to define national boundaries (http://www.gadm.org/). Soil, area, and irrigation data required for global GLAM simulations are gridded onto a 0.5\\u00b0 grid to match the climate data using the statistical package R (R Core Team, 2017) and the Geospatial Data Abstraction software Library (GDAL/OGR contributors, 2019). In any grid cell containing two or more countries, the grid cell is assigned to the country with the largest fraction of area in that grid cell. Soil data are from the Global Soil Dataset for Earth System Modeling (Shangguan et al., 2014). The soil input parameters required for GLAM (drained lower limit, drained upper limit, and saturation limit) are calculated using the method of Saxton et al. (1986). Saxton et al. (1986) use percentage values of sand and clay to calculate these hydrological parameters. These values are then averaged over the top seven soil layers (necessary to include the 1 m maximum soil depth used in GLAM-potato) and aggregated to the 0.5\\u00b0 grid. 2.2.3. Yield Data FAOSTAT country-level yield data (FAO, 2019) are used to calibrate and evaluate GLAM-potato. Data examined are from the years 1980 to 2009 to coincide with available climate data. 2010 yield data are excluded from evaluation simulations as some simulations go into a second calendar year. FAOSTAT define the year associated with the yield data as that when the majority of the harvest took place. The year associated with the yield data in GLAM is the year associated with planting. As such, countries with the bulk of harvest taking place in a different year to planting need to be identified so GLAM associates the correct year with the yield data. These countries (Angola, Argentina, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritania, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, Peru, Venezuela, Australia, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Fiji, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, UAE, and Vietnam) are predominately in the southern hemisphere. Information used to identify the main growing seasons in each country is from the World Potato Atlas provided by the International Potato Center, Colombia (CIP, 2009), and FAO crop calendars (FAO, 2019). When this information provides no clear single main growing season the median harvest dates from Sacks et al. (2010) are used to determine the main growing season for the country. Yield data trends could be due to factors not accounted for in the model (e.g., technology changes) or due to changes in climate during a time series. Both simulated and observed yields are detrended when evaluating the model\\u2014this ensures that any trends are removed from both observed and simulated yields to compare like-with-like. Before this process, each time series is examined to identify any sudden large changes in mean yield levels across the time series that show large changes to growing area or other fundamental significant shifts in yield observations that modeling would not account for. These are deemed to be such \\u201cmulti-state\\u201d time series if upon visual inspection they exhibit large changes in mean yields that are sustained for three or more years. Such time series are excluded from the analysis. Countries excluded for exhibiting such multi-state time series are in Supplementary Table 1. An exception is made for China\\u2014which shows some multi-state yield data\\u2014as it produces the most potatoes globally. The longest of the two distinct sections of yield data is selected to evaluate the model in China. Data are also dropped from each time series if there are consecutive years with identical yields, these being deemed unrealistic. The yield time series are detrended using the R function lowess in the gplots package. Lowess is described in Cleveland (1979). The parameter f is set to 0.8 as Cleveland (1979) state that values between 0.2 and 0.8 are suitable for most applications; higher f-values provide greater smoothing of data without distorting variability. Very little difference was found when testing values across this range so 0.8 was chosen to give greater smoothing. Lastly, any country with fewer than 5 years of data is excluded. A total of 102 countries are simulated. Details of which countries are simulated and years simulated for each country can be seen in Supplementary Table 1. 2.3. Model Parameter Configuration GLAM-potato is used to simulate the abiotic impacts of climate change. Future simulations assume the same growing area, irrigation, and CYG as the baseline, meaning that pest and disease and technology impacts are assumed to not change. The same methods to calculate planting windows and varieties are used in the baseline and future climates, enabling us to calculate the benefits of adaptation (Lobell, 2014). For non-adaptation simulations, the baseline planting dates and varieties are fixed in the future climate. If these combinations are no longer viable given the conditions used to select planting dates and varieties they are excluded from non-adaptation simulations. Table 2 lists all crop-specific parameter values used in GLAM-potato. Specific information on crop growth parameters is not available across different regions, therefore these are kept constant at mid-points from reported ranges rather than optimising parameters locally. Exceptions are the maximum rate of change of leaf area index, the maximum rate of change of harvest index and the maximum normalised transpiration efficiency, which are set to the maximum of the values reported in the literature in order to potentially simulate the highest yields. The combination of variety and planting window that returns the highest yield in initial simulations is used in each grid cell, similarly to the methods of Osborne et al. (2013), Dawson et al. (2016), Rose et al. (2016), and Hijmans (2003). As shown in Table 1, Varieties T1-T5 consist of progressively higher thermal time requirements for harvest maturity. Cardinal temperatures are fixed at a mid-point from across the reported range (see Table 2). Along with the five hypothetical varieties of potato, 12 possible planting windows are simulated at every grid cell. The combination of variety and planting window that results in the highest mean simulated yield along with realistic crop durations (<180 days) and a majority of years without emergency planting is chosen for each grid cell. These caps are imposed to simulate realistic crop phenology and as potato harvesting is a complex process involving climatic and non-climatic factors (Kooman et al., 1996), with the majority of potato seasons not being longer than 180 days. table 1 TABLE 1. Thermal times and critical photoperiods used for the different varieties (\\u00b0C). table 2 TABLE 2. Parameters used in GLAM-potato, with ranges and units where applicable. The parameter CYG is used to calibrate to mean observed yield levels to account for spatial differences in crop management that are not explicitly included in GLAM. One value of CYG is calibrated for each country as country-level observed yield data are available for this global analysis (as also used in Raymundo et al., 2018). A simulated national-level yield time series is calculated for each country for calibrating CYG by dividing total country production (calculated using the simulated yields in each grid cell and the potato growing area for that grid cell) by total area for each year. This provides a simulated yield time series for calibration of CYG. One half of each observed yield time series is used for calibration and the other half for model evaluation (the lengths of time series varying, depending on the data available in each country). The half of the time series with the most significant correlations between observed yields and temperature and rainfall was chosen for evaluation, as GLAM is specifically designed to simulate these relationships. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) is used to assess the accuracy of mean simulated yield levels and correlation coefficients are used to determine the skill of the model in simulating interannual observed yield variability. To take into account CO2 fertilisation, GLAM is parameterised to match yield responses as recorded by Free Air CO2 and Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) (Kimball, 2016), showing potato yield increases of 22\\u201333%. These FACE responses are representative of a 353 ppm concentration in the baseline (c. year 1990) and a 550 ppm concentration of CO2 in the future\\u2014the equivalent of year 2053 for RCP 8.5. Initial simulations are conducted where parameters are varied to choose a combination that gives sensible global yield increases and reductions in transpiration to match FACE data. These simulations were conducted on the first half of the time series to match baseline CO2 conditions. GLAM parameters concerned with biomass growth (radiation use efficiency RUE, transpiration efficiency TE, and the maximum normalised transpiration efficiency TENMAX) are increased incrementally, and the physiologically-limited potential transpiration PTM is decreased, ensuring that reductions in transpiration are driven by physiological (stomatal closure) and not energetic limitations (Challinor et al., 2005; Challinor and Wheeler, 2008). The combination of parameters that best matched FACE yield response ratios globally and achieve a decrease in transpiration was an increase in RUE, TE, and TENMAX by 20% and a decrease in PTM by 50%. This resulted in a mean global yield increase of 23% and the desired global mean decrease in transpiration. 3. Results Results sections are presented below firstly for the global GLAM evaluation in the baseline (section 3.1), and secondly for the impacts of climate change on potatoes (section 3.2). Variables used in maps represent averages over the years of simulation, with data taken from across the simulated growing seasons (i.e., simulated planting to harvest maturity). Climate variables are the mean daily values over the growing season. 3.1. Global Model Evaluation The mean country-level relative root mean square error (RRMSE) is 24%, meaning that mean yields are well captured (see Supplementary Figure 3 for plots showing mean observed and simulated yields). The observed yield standard deviation, averaged across countries, is 0.32 T/Ha. The simulated mean standard deviation is 0.43 T/Ha, meaning that simulated yield variability is similar in magnitude to observations although slightly overestimated. Correlations between observed and simulated yields for the baseline period are shown in Figure 2. The majority of countries have positive correlation coefficients. Most significant yield correlations are in Europe where stronger relationships between observed yields and climate inputs exist. The 18 countries with positive correlations and p-values < 0.1 are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Costa, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Macedonia, Mauritania, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan. figure 2 FIGURE 2. (A) Correlation coefficient between simulated and observed national yields. (B) Mean simulated duration of growing season. Low model skill occurs when relationships between observed yields and climate variables are not well-captured, or more commonly when these observed relationships are weak (see Supplementary Figures 4\\u20136). Only four of 102 countries showed significant correlations between observed yields and both rainfall and temperature. Simulated growing season durations are shown in Figure 2B. These are typically 120\\u2013140 days in the northern hemisphere and higher in subtropical and tropical regions. The start of the planting window and varieties chosen for the baseline evaluation are shown in Figure 3. Planting windows typically begin in the first half of the year in Europe and North America. In subtropical and tropical regions planting tends toward the latter half of the year, although there is variation, as expected given the varied potato growing seasons in these regions. Observed planting dates from experimental sites across 17 countries in Raymundo et al. (2017) are significantly correlated with mean planting dates in GLAM (correlation of 0.77, p-value < 0.001). figure 3 FIGURE 3. (A) Start of selected planting window. (B) Variety chosen for each grid cell in the baseline climate. Important potato growing countries of the USA, India, and China show poor correlation coefficients between observed and simulated yields. These countries show different signs of temperature correlations in the two halves of the time series used for model calibration and evaluation, making evaluation difficult as the model is calibrated on a section of time series with a drastically different relationship to temperature. In some countries (Angola, Ukraine, Russia, and China) model skill is poor when the time series being evaluated on is short (often only 9 years); there are limits to the inferences that should be made on correlations based on such short time series, and when relationships between observed yields and climate variables change so drastically in different sections of the time series. In China, for example, climate-yield relationships are not well simulated and model skill is poor. Two agri-ecological zones dominate potato agriculture: the northern region and the south western region (CIP, 2009). The northern region contains the most potato production, and here planting is most commonly in the spring (Zhao et al., 2018). GLAM also simulates spring planting dates in China, and captures mean yields well. Correlations between observed yield and temperature are not well-simulated, although the second half of the time series has an opposite (positive) relationship between observed yields and temperature which GLAM simulates accurately. Correlations between observed yields and temperature and rainfall are low in most areas of the USA. Planting windows and durations are sensible however, being in the northern hemisphere spring and harvesting in late summer, and mean yields are accurately represented. In India, the most important areas for potato cultivation are across the Indo-Gangetic plain. Potato is a winter crop here, sown from October to November (CIP, 2009). Year-round production occurs in high altitude southern areas. Simulations match these observed planting dates. A negative correlation between rainfall and observed yields is not picked up in GLAM in these areas, although durations, planting dates and mean yields are well captured in the country, as is the magnitude of observed yield variability. 3.2. Global Future Yield Changes Global median yield increases range from 9 to 20% with adaptation to climate change (see Figure 4 for mean yield changes across climate models globally and Supplementary Figures 10\\u201313 for yield changes associated with each climate model). Standard deviations of simulated yields change marginally from 0.45 to 0.50 T/Ha in the baseline to 0.50 to 0.62 T/Ha in the future adaptation simulations (ranges across climate models). figure 4 FIGURE 4. Yield percentage change from baseline climate to 2040\\u20132060. Values shown are mean values across climate models. (A) Non-adaptation simulations. (B) Adaptation to future climate. When taking into account only the grid cells that contain both adaptation and non-adaptation future climate simulations, median benefits of adaptation simulations over non-adaptation simulations range from 10 to 17% (depending on the climate model). This is slightly less than the global benefit of CO2 fertilisation in this analysis of 23% (see section 2.3). In the non-adaptation future climate simulations over half of grid cells are excluded (see Supplementary Figure 14B), meaning that at least some change to baseline sowing windows or varieties is necessary in order to fulfill selection criteria of durations <180 days and a majority of years successfully planting the crop within the chosen planting window. Without removing these grid cells a fair comparison across adaptation and non-adaptation simulations cannot be made given these model selection criteria. Yield gains of 6\\u201314% are seen on average globally in non-adaptation simulations for the grid cells that are remaining. Figures 5, 6 show positive and negative yield changes by country for the adaptation and non-adaptation simulations, respectively. Most countries show yield increases in adaptation simulations, and more high area countries show yield increases than decreases (therefore contributing a greater amount to global production). Yield increases are primarily driven by the length of the growing season being maintained or increasing in the adaptation simulations as well as CO2 fertilisation. figure 5 FIGURE 5. Countries associated with the 20 largest increases in mean yields across climate models from the baseline to 2040\\u20132060, with ranges across climate models, for the adaptation simulations.

Numbers next to country names refer to the normalised growing area for each country, with a value of 1 indicating the largest growing area in one country, which is 4,394,406 ha in China. figure 6 FIGURE 6. Countries associated with the 20 largest decreases in mean yields across climate models from the baseline to 2040\\u20132060, with ranges across climate models, for the non-adaptation simulations. Boxplots show medians, interquartile ranges and the whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range. Dark red boxes show top 10 countries for growing area, light red = top 25, orange = top 50%, and yellow = bottom 50%. Numbers next to country names refer to the normalised growing area for each country, with a value of 1 indicating the largest growing area in one country, which is 4,394,406 ha in China. Planting dates and varieties selected in the future climate are shown for one of the four climate models in Figure 7 (other model planting dates and varieties are similar and are shown in Supplementary Figures 7\\u20139). The adaptation simulations that allow planting dates and varieties to shift in the future climate show that in the northern hemisphere in particular, planting takes place later (into the autumn) or earlier (into the spring) in the growing season to take advantage of the warmer conditions in parts of the year that contain sufficient rainfall (Supplementary Figure 15B). Climate model projections show similar warming in most growing areas but shifting growing seasons mean there are lower temperatures in south east USA and China (Supplementary Figure 15B). Durations usually do not vary substantially, as is expected in adaptation simulations (Supplementary Figure 17B). Tropical regions in Africa and South America show yields sometimes decreasing due to sharp reductions in rainfall and duration. figure 7 FIGURE 7. (A) Start of the planting window. (B) Varieties chosen for 2040\\u20132060 using the HadGEM2-ES model. Climate projections show that temperatures over the growing season will increase in most of Europe by approximately 2\\u00b0C by 2050 (Supplementary Figure 15A). Growing season total rainfall is projected to decrease in many growing areas in Europe, although it increases in parts of Russia and strong yield gains are projected as a result (Supplementary Figure 16A). South Asian countries show yield decreases even when including adaptation to climate change. This is due to rising temperatures and decreases in growing season duration (see Supplementary Figures 15, 17). In these countries, temperatures rise to the point where growth and development of potato become adversely impacted in model simulations. 4. Discussion This analysis shows that potato yields are likely to increase globally by 2050 due to CO2 and adaptation benefits\\u2014even with the more pessimistic RCP8.5 scenario simulated in this study. The range of global average yield increases shown across climate models is 9\\u201320% with adaptation. The benefits of adaptation simulations over non-adaptation simulations range from 10 to 17% globally, depending on the climate model. Hijmans (2003) reported similar benefits to potato yields from adaptation\\u2014from about 10\\u201315% globally, as do Challinor et al. (2014b), although for other major crops. These projected adaptation benefits are substantial, although less than yield increases due to CO2 fertilisation (Kimball, 2016). The importance of adaptation is also highlighted by the many grid cells that do not meet duration and planting window conditions in future non-adaptation simulations. These simulations suggest that changes to potato growing seasons are needed in order to realise yield benefits. The yield gains reported in this study are higher than those reported by Hijmans (2003) and Raymundo et al. (2018), although neither of these studies incorporate both CO2 fertilisation and gains from adaptation. When including the level of adaptation benefit reported in this study and in Hijmans (2003), similar yield increases can be inferred from the projections of Raymundo et al. (2018), given the 5.6% decrease for RCP8.5 by 2055 they report without adaptation. If including the 22\\u201333% yield increases from CO2 fertilisation as reported by Kimball (2016), the global yield decreases projected by Hijmans (2003) of 9\\u201318% would also be positive. Fleisher et al. (2017) show that uncertainty across currently available potato models can be large, highlighting the need for more global potato yield impacts studies that need to include both CO2 fertilisation and climate change adaptation for more detailed comparisons to be made. In section 3.1, we evaluate GLAM model performance, concluding that observed yield variability is adequately captured when it is driven by climate variables and that mean yields and the magnitude of yield variability are well-captured. Correlations between observed and simulated yields are insignificant in most cases however (18 countries showing significant correlations). This is due to most relationships between observed yields and climate variables also being insignificant in most cases at the national scale\\u2014only four of 102 countries had significant relationships between yields and both rainfall and temperature. Crop models that simulate only direct climate influences on yield (such as the model used in this study as described in section 2.1) cannot be expected to simulate observed yield variability when this is due to non-climatic factors. Given that when strong, consistent relationships between observed yields and climate inputs exist the model performs well, we have confidence in model projections of future yields, especially given the sensible planting dates selected in important growing areas. Past global potato modeling studies do not report correlation coefficients for assessing observed yield interannual variability or model outputs such as growing season length. Previous global crop modeling studies for other crops show skill in some cases at representing mean yield levels and interannual variability (e.g., M\\u00fcller et al., 2017). M\\u00fcller et al. (2017) however found poor model skill for Chinese wheat and soybean, illustrating the difficulties in evaluating crop models in these important growing regions using national scale yield data. Raymundo et al. (2018) show mixed results in representing the variability and mean of FAO national yields across the globe. Their results showed higher simulated than observed yield variability and high RRMSE (56% on average globally), especially in China and Russia. In India and China, correlations are poor between observed and simulated yields. In India, it is possible that the lack of a flooding parameterisation in GLAM is hampering model skill. In both of these countries however, correlations between temperature and observed yields change drastically in the two halves of the time series used for calibration and evaluation, making evaluation with correlations challenging. Planting dates are in general satisfactorily simulated in the important potato growing regions in these two countries, giving us confidence in the model's predictive potential. The larger countries simulated in this analysis usually have poor model skill and this is probably not a coincidence. The use of national scale yield data is likely a part of the reason for poor skill as the variability of the national scale yield data may not apply to that at the level of the grid cell. The FAOSTAT yield data are associated with the year when the majority of the harvest takes place. Large and climatically-variable countries such as China and India have planting dates at different times of the year in different regions, and therefore the yield data for a given year may not be representative of all grid cells. Shorter time series of yield data are also often associated with poor model skill; again this is probably no coincidence, as data quality could be associated with the quantity of data available. Further confidence can be gained by comparing model projections for these three countries with results from other potato yield projection studies. In China, yields are projected to increase in Raymundo et al. (2018) and decrease in eastern USA (Tubiello et al., 2002; Raymundo et al., 2018), as does this analysis. India yields are projected to increase in the Indo-Gangetic plain in Raymundo et al. (2018) unlike the decreases projected here however. Raymundo et al. (2018) do not go into details as to why yields change in different regions, and do not publish plots showing e.g., temperature or rainfall changes from which to infer such conclusions. Other studies also show yield decreases projected in this important Indian region however (Hijmans, 2003; Kumar et al., 2015). Projections in this study show that CO2 fertilisation can help to mitigate negative influences of climate change. Other studies have shown similar results: for example. Haverkort et al. (2013) found that increasing CO2 more than compensated for yield losses due to rising temperatures and reduced water availability for South African potatoes by 2050. Ozone-induced damage can also be compensated to some extent, although the size of the effects from CO2 fertilisation and ozone damage are uncertain (Magliulo et al., 2003; Finnan et al., 2005; Fleisher et al., 2008; Feng and Kobayashi, 2009; Raymundo et al., 2018). Projected future yield losses for potato from ozone damage are estimated to be around 12% on average across studies (Feng and Kobayashi, 2009). Decreasing the projected yield changes simulated in this study by projected median ozone damage still leads to positive yield change overall however. CO2 and ozone impacts on potato tuber quality and nutrition are complex\\u2014studies have reported losses in protein, calcium, and potassium tuber content but impacts on tuber quality are uncertain (Vorne et al., 2002; H\\u00f6gy and Fangmeier, 2009). More studies are needed to make robust statements about the implications of nutrient loss with climate change. Changing planting dates and varieties may not be straightforward due to market pressures, pests, and diseases, other crops and water availability (Hijmans, 2003; van Bussel, 2011). There is a large diversity of potato varieties that could be exploited by breeders to help improve tolerance to climate change impacts (Schafleitner et al., 2011), but the access of new varieties to farmers will likely remain problematic in some developing countries. The realism of altering planting dates will likely depend on factors not accounted for in this study, namely other crops, market pressures, and pest and disease impacts. The assumption that pests and disease impacts will remain the same may underestimate impacts given that pests and diseases are expected to saturate areas in which their host crops are found (Bebber et al., 2014). Moore and Lobell (2014) found that the rate at which farmers adapt to warming is an important source of uncertainty in climate impact projections. Although the representation of adaptation used in this study is arguably optimistic as access to varieties and planting window changes are unrestricted, other adaptations are not included which could help in adapting to climate change such as tolerance to excess water, low water, or heat stress. The lack of representation of a more diverse array of adaptation options is common in crop modeling studies (Beveridge et al., 2018; Challinor et al., 2018). Given that the modeled yield variability captures the magnitude of observed yield variability, and that many regions maintain or even increase rainfall with adaptations of changing sowing dates and varieties, it is likely that if freely allowing changes to when potatoes are grown, then yields can be maintained in the future. Extreme conditions are usually avoided and therefore these adaptations can be seen as successfully avoiding the need to adapt in other ways (although in some cases, including other adaptation benefits will likely lead to further yield increases). The impacts of climate change on potato are favourable compared to other major crops. Challinor et al. (2014b) provide a meta-analysis of climate change impact projections and conclude that losses are likely for maize, rice, and wheat without adaptation, with maize likely to see yield declines even with adaptation. Rosenzweig et al. (2014) concur that maize yields will suffer from climate change, with wheat, soybean, and rice yields likely to decline with warming at lower latitudes. Soybean and wheat were also projected to mostly see yield declines by Osborne et al. (2013). With other major crops likely to see yield decreases due to climate change, the case for potato being a strong future cropping option becomes stronger, especially given the high nutrient content of potato (Lutaladio and Castaldi, 2009) and the increase in potato growing areas in food insecure regions (FAO, 2019). Given the substantial contribution agricultural systems make to global emissions it is important to consider the implications of adaptation options for emissions (Challinor et al., 2018; Whitfield et al., 2018). The adaptation options simulated here are not associated with increased emissions. Other potential adaptations, such as increasing use of fertiliser, involve increases to emissions (Baggs et al., 2003). An assessment of climate smartness can therefore be made without the need for direct quantification of the kind demonstrated by Arenas-Calle et al. (2019). Given that potato is a low emission crop (Flynn et al., 2005; Haile-Mariam et al., 2008; Nemecek et al., 2012; Clune et al., 2017) and that the adaptation options shown here do not lead to increased emissions, global potato agriculture can be viewed as part of a climate smart agricultural future. 5. Conclusion This study shows that when including adaptation to climate change, yield increases range from 9 to 20% globally depending on the climate model input. The emissions associated with potato agriculture are lower than most other staple crops and potato yields show higher yield increases with adaptation by 2050 than other major crops. We therefore suggest that potatoes are a viable climate smart crop that can adapt to play an important role in a sustainable future food system.

Adam Abstract. Food supply is affected by a complex nexus of land, atmosphere, and human processes, including short- and long-term stressors (e.g., drought and climate change, respectively). A simulation platform that captures these complex elements can be used to inform policy and best management practices to promote sustainable agriculture. We have developed a tightly coupled framework using the macroscale variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrologic model and the CropSyst agricultural model. A mechanistic irrigation module was also developed for inclusion in this framework. Because VIC\\u2013CropSyst combines two widely used and mechanistic models (for crop phenology, growth, management, and macroscale hydrology), it can provide realistic and hydrologically consistent simulations of water availability, crop water requirements for irrigation, and agricultural productivity for both irrigated and dryland systems. This allows VIC\\u2013CropSyst to provide managers and decision makers with reliable information on regional water stresses and their impacts on food production. Additionally, VIC\\u2013CropSyst is being used in conjunction with socioeconomic models, river system models, and atmospheric models to simulate feedback processes between regional water availability, agricultural water management decisions, and land\\u2013atmosphere interactions. The performance of VIC\\u2013CropSyst was evaluated on both regional (over the US Pacific Northwest) and point scales. Point-scale evaluation involved using two flux tower sites located in agricultural fields in the US (Nebraska and Illinois). The agreement between recorded and simulated evapotranspiration (ET), applied irrigation water, soil moisture, leaf area index (LAI), and yield indicated that, although the model is intended to work on regional scales, it also captures field-scale processes in agricultural areas.

However, due to the shortage of open critical information in agriculture such as soil, precipitation, and crop status, farmers heavily rely on empirical knowledge to schedule irrigation and tend to excessive irrigation to ensure crop yields. This paper presents WaterSmart-GIS, a web-based geographic information system (GIS), to collect and disseminate near-real-time information critical for irrigation scheduling, such as soil moisture, evapotranspiration, precipitation, and humidity, to stakeholders. The disseminated datasets include both numerical model results of reanalysis and forecasting from HRLDAS (High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System), and the remote sensing datasets from NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The system aims to quickly and easily create a smart, customized irrigation scheduler for individual fields to relieve the burden on farmers and to significantly reduce wasted water, energy, and equipment due to excessive irrigation. The system is prototyped here with an application in Nebraska, demonstrating its ability to collect and deliver information to end-users via the web application, which provides online analytic functionality such as point-based query, spatial statistics, and timeseries query. Systems such as this will play a critical role in the next few decades to sustain agriculture, which faces great challenges from climate change and increased natural disasters. Keywords: irrigation; geographical information system; geospatial cyberinfrastructure; remote sensing; high-resolution land data assimilation system (HRLDAS) 1. Introduction As exceptional drought increased in the western United States and south Europe in the summer of 2021, topics about the impact of climate change and the consequences this devastating drought has had on farming and farmers in those regions are highly debated. The sixth assessment report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Geneva, Switzerland) [1] projected that climate change-derived impacts will affect all of North and Central America, and pose a unique challenge for adaptation and risk management in agriculture. The report pointed out both the sophistication of the challenge as well as the indirect consequences of climate change such as plague, disease, species evolution, soil erosion, decreasing groundwater supply, and increasing extreme weather. To tackle the challenge, agriculture must be equipped with smarter and highly efficient strategies [2,3,4] for collecting actionable information, disseminating this information to stakeholders in a timely manner, and helping make practical decisions based on real-world scenarios. Irrigation is one of the most important activities in farming. Like other farming activities of modern agriculture in the high plains and Midwestern states (the Corn Belt, USA) [5], irrigation is mechanized and automated [6,7]. A common irrigation device used in the Midwest is the central pivot irrigation system (CPIS), which pumps water (usually groundwater) into the center through a long pipe suspended on an arm-like motor vehicle [8]. The pipe is installed with regularly spaced sprinklers to spread water evenly to a certain diameter. Farmers can control the irrigation water amount and circles by setting up the scheduler on the control device on a CPIS. During the irrigation season (normally July to early August in the Corn Belt), farmers will irrigate once every 5 to 10 days. The decision is based on either field observation and manual examination of soil moisture content or a fixed irrigation scheduler, which normally will not change with rainfall events. Using more flexible and efficient data-driven irrigation scheduling can potentially save water [9,10]. However, popular adoption of the scientific irrigation management for large geographic region (e.g., a state) has not happened. Timely and accurate data of crop, soil, and weather conditions is necessary for farmers and water managers to make optimal irrigation decisions. Useful information, such as remotely sensed soil moisture and model-generated evapotranspiration, are actually existing and open to the public for free. OpenET project [11], for example, made a great effort to generate and distribute ET data at a filed scale to advance the use of data-driven irrigation scheduling. Many other standard land surface parameters at various spatial and temporal resolutions are available freely and near-real-time from NASA data centers. Our goal in this study was to collect the timely and accurate data from remote sensors and weather/soil/crop models, and then synthesize them to drive the irrigation reasoning on a web portal, which can provide a one-stop solution literally for free for those who need to access all necessary information for irrigation management in a timely and easy manner. Integrating multi-source datasets, and processing and visualizing them into a ready-for-action form in one data portal will help fill the gap between information providers and consumers which would otherwise eventually waste the time value of the data and damage chances for farmers to make better decisions. Many types of data needed to drive irrigation decisions are routinely produced and distributed by federal agencies. There are three major challenges to overcome when leveraging existing free federal data resources and providing irrigation decision supporting information. The first is the big data nature of streaming agricultural data. The tremendous number of data produced by model and remote sensors requires large data storage and processing capability for irrigation application developers to maintain an operational service [12]. The second issue is how to bring together the datasets from hybrid sources. Datasets from various agencies have heterogeneous formats and specifics, and it takes great effort to harmonize and integrate them into one application. The third challenge is that most of the model and remote-sensed datasets need to be further analyzed, taking the local environmental/societal conditions into consideration [13]. For example, irrigation practices in semiarid regions are very different from those in wetter regions, and farmers from different regions care about various indicators [14]. Some emphasize soil moisture, while others may take serious measures to monitor precipitation and evapotranspiration. Collecting and providing analysis on various meteorological and social factors is a critical task for irrigation information systems. This paper developed a web-based geographic information system, WaterSmart-GIS (https://geobrain.csiss.gmu.edu/watersmartport/, accessed on 8 February 2022), to deliver near-real-time information about soil moisture, evapotranspiration, precipitation, humidity, etc., to stakeholders in a timely manner. The hosted or collected datasets include both real-time numerical model results from HRLDAS (High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System, https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/high-resolution-land-data-assimilation-system-hrldas (accessed on 17 April 2022)) [15], and the remote sensing datasets from NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive, https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)) [16] and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)) [17]. This aims to help farmers quickly and easily create a wiser customized irrigation scheduler for their individual fields to relieve the burden on farmers and significantly reduce wasted water, energy, and equipment cost in excessive irrigation. The system is prototyped here with an application in Nebraska, demonstrating its ability to collect and deliver information to end-users via web application and the provided functionality such as point-based query, spatial statistics, and profiling. Systems such as this will play a critical role in the next few decades to sustain humanity in the face of challenges such as global warming, frequent exceptional drought, plague, wildfires, the exploding human population, and greenhouse gas emissions. The whole development procedure using open-sourced web GIS tools and standard protocols for data access should also be effective as a reference to other disciplines involving a number of data sources. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work. Section 3 and Section 4 explain the design and implementation of WaterSmart-GIS. In Section 5, we present a real-world use case to validate the system, and the results are displayed. Section 6 discusses the system and its benefits for the future, and the last section concludes the work. 2. Related Work There are many ongoing research and development efforts in both the industry and academia to develop easy-to-access visualization applications to support practical irrigation [11,18,19,20,21,22]. Visualization of geospatial data, shortened as geovisualization, integrates approaches from visualization in scientific computing, cartography, image analysis, information visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geographic information systems (GIS) to provide theory, methods, and tools for visual exploration, analysis, synthesis, and presentation of geospatial data [23]. In the digital era, geovisualization has greatly expanded the static 2D maps and 3D models to an interactive and dynamic form on the web with the help of web GIS development tools and frameworks. With the digitalization acceleration, geovisualization has been boosted to handle multidimensional big geospatial data [24,25], support photogrammetric processing [26], and integrate knowledge networks for visualization of 3D geospatial models [27]. Geovisualization technology has been proved successful in promoting geographical analysis and decision making in fire prevention, water quality assessment [28], seismic risk simulation [29], excavation process [30], and criminal activity [25]. Many agricultural decision support systems (DSS) and information dissemination systems have been developed for irrigation decision support using geovisualization tools. IrriWatch (https://www.irriwatch.com/en/, accessed on 17 April 2022), based on the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL)[22], is commercially available. It combines multiple data resources, and is able to provide field-scale irrigation recommendation. A web-based irrigation decision support system (WIDSS) [31] is presented for canal irrigation management in large irrigated districts. This system utilizes basic data related to irrigation system engineering information, crop and soil characteristics, and historical meteorological data, which are stored in the system in advance. Its decision is made based on water balance simulation considering real-time in-field data and weather forecast data, which are acquired automatically. IrrigaSys [20] provides an irrigation water management service using the MOHID-Land model [32], a physically based, spatially distributed, continuous, variable time-step model for water and property cycles in inland waters, to compute soil water dynamics and irrigation scheduling at field-plot scale. The success of this system relies heavily on initial input of crop type, sowing dates, soil texture, and irrigation method of every field plot served by the system, which should be defined by a manager who is also responsible for reporting irrigation events carried out by farmers. A web-based irrigation decision support system with limited inputs (WIDSSLI) [33] adopts the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach [34] to simulate the soil water balance. Irrigation decisions are made by comparing the soil water content with the corresponding lower limit. Recently, LCIS-DSS [18] compares three different decision-making methodologies: in situ soil sensor, remote sensing, and simulation modeling of water balance. Evaluation in a case study involving maize has shown that the method based on an in situ sensor supplied more water to achieve maximum maize production, while the other two methods require a high level of user expertise. While agricultural DSS focus on irrigation decision making, providing farmers ready-to-act irrigation recommendation for their assigned fields, agricultural information dissemination systems are designed to exhibit one product or one series of products from remote sensing or model results, with limited analysis functions. These systems visualize various types of agricultural data regionally and globally, contributing to the availability of necessary data for driving irrigation decisions. CropGIS [35] visualized modeled biomass information of maize using the crop growth model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, https://www.apsim.info/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)), with historical meteorological data from 2001 to 2014 and high-resolution satellite imagery. This web application is a demonstration for displaying its biomass production and forecasts from its modeling results. CropScape [19] was developed to visualize, disseminate, and analyze the annually updated Cropland Data Layer (CDL), which contains crop- and other specific land cover classifications for the conterminous United States. A cloud environment is built for serving CDL products to provide geo-referenced, high-accuracy, 30 or 56 m resolution, crop-specific land cover information since 1997 [36]. This web application provides great convenience for different users to access, view, and analyze the product. VegScape [37] generates and visualizes geospatially varying vegetation condition indices for timely crop condition using 250 m MODIS daily surface reflectance data for the conterminous United States. TerraGIS [38], a web application based on the Google Maps application programming interface (API), delivers Digital Soil Maps of the physical, chemical, and hydrological properties of soil for cotton fields in Australia. HidroMap [39] is an open-source geographic information system (GIS) for irrigation monitoring organized in two modules, desktop-GIS and web-GIS. The desktop module detects irrigation activities based on satellite imagery, while the web module visualizes them. The Global Agricultural Drought Monitoring and Forecasting System (GADMFS, http://gis.csiss.gmu.edu/GADMFS/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)) [40,41] is a cloud-based web system with an integrated advanced cyberinfrastructure framework that provides global drought indicators derived from satellite- and model-based vegetation condition datasets. 3. Architecture Design This section will detail the system design. The system consists of three layers: user layer, service layer, and model layer, as shown in Figure 1. Each layer handles one particular type of task and interacts with the other layers to form a workflow. The system is designed to serve the latest advanced observations and model simulation about soil, vegetation, and climate in one single system. The details of each layer are introduced below. A special design to handle issues of big data download and storage and large throughput which result from frequent (hourly) model runs is also presented. Figure 1. WaterSmart-GIS architect design. 3.1. Soil Vegetation and Climate Model Layer This layer is responsible for collecting observations and data assimilation outputs from government public servers as initial condition and input files, and running models of WaterSmart-GIS to produce the soil moisture (SM)/evapotranspiration (ET)/vegetation products. The collected datasets include SMAP Level 4 product from Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA, USA), field reports from USDA NASS (https://www.nass.usda.gov/, accessed on 17 April 2022), National Water Model (NWM, https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm (accessed on 17 April 2022)) [42] outputs from the Office of Water Prediction in NOAA (Washington, DC, USA), Global Forecast System (GFS, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast (accessed on 17 April 2022)) [43], outputs from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in NOAA, MODIS land surface temperature product (MOD21) from NASA, and AmeriFlux [44] stationary data of soil moisture (only three sites in Nebraska). This layer mainly generates products under five categories: soil profile, vegetation status, remote sensing-observed SM, HRLDAS-simulated SM and ET, machine learning-derived SM and ET. Each category has various data and model sources. HRLDAS model running: We run the models twice to generate the state of SM and ET using NWM and GFS, respectively. The results from NWM are a reanalysis estimation of the situation in the past few hours. The results from GFS forecast the SM and ET in the next few days. Meanwhile, we also serve the downloaded NWM and GFS input files into the WaterSmart-GIS as references, including temperature, humidity, pressure, long/short-wave radiation flux, and wind. SMAP: Due to failure of its radar, the NASA\\u2019s SMAP mission only produces the surface layer of soil moisture product (top 5 cm) at spatial resolution of 36 km [45]. The SMAP Level 4 product provides both surface and rootzone soil moisture at 9 km resolution, which is derived from the assimilation of standard 36 km data into a land surface model [46,47]. Consistency has been demonstrated between SMAP soil moisture retrievals and qualitative soil moisture condition surveys conducted by USDA NASS at county scale [48]. We therefore use the NASS reported categorical soil moisture conditions to grade SMAP soil moisture products into four categories: very short, short, adequate, and surplus. The SMAP categorical products are much easier for practical use in daily irrigation decision making. Soil properties are considered as relatively static conditions for a region. The physical and chemical soil properties considered here include calcium carbonate content, carbon exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, pH, sodium adsorption ratio, soil organic matter, available water holding capacity, bulk density, permanent wilting point, sand, silt, clay, etc. We used the web API of Soil Web developed by the UC Davis team to retrieve their aggregated products from USDA point-based datasets [49]. Vegetation Status: Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation condition index (VCI) [50] are used to indicate the health status of crops [51]. The products are retrieved from VegScape and generated using NASA MODIS datasets with a 250 m resolution and about a one-day delay. NDVI indicates the absolute status of vegetation health, while VCI compares the current NDVI to the range of values observed in the same period of the past twenty years to estimate the relative health of the vegetation in the current period [52]. Therefore, VCI is one option to look at vegetation condition and characterize the potential drought. NDVI and VCI have been proven to be very helpful in detecting potential water stress and drought conditions during the growing season [53]. Machine-learning-derived (ML-derived) SM and ET: As an experimental product, we employed Random Forest to train on the AmeriFlux in situ data of SM and ET, and produced a new version of SM and ET aside from the HRLDAS and SMAP [54]. This ML model uses remote sensing predictors such as land surface temperature (LST), vegetation index, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS, as well as meteorological parameters such as wind speed and air pressure, in the training. MODIS products used in this model include land surface reflectance (MOD09GA), LST (MOD11A1), and LAI (MOD15A2). The land surface reflectance and LST products are both 500 m daily data, while LAI product is 1000 m data with a temporal resolution that is 4 days. Therefore, all MODIS data are resampled to 1 km. The AmeriFlux data provide ET and soil moisture measurements of isolated points based on their site stations. Each site includes one ET measurement and three soil moisture measurements in depths of 0\\u201310 cm, 10\\u201350 cm, and 50\\u2013100 cm. The energy balance closure of the ground-truth data is first evaluated using the regression correlation of estimated available energy and surface energy flux [55]. Then, ET corrected by the energy balance closure correction factor (LE_CORR) corresponding to the MODIS Terra satellite overpass time, which is 10:30 am local time, is used as in situ observed ET. The motivation is to fix the problems that HRLDAS tends to estimate lower soil moisture in rootzone and SMAP is too coarse in spatial resolution for field-scale irrigation management. Each category of products is generated separately and located in one accessible place and made available for WaterSmart-GIS to use. The HRLDAS and ML-derived products are generated hourly. The scripts for generating SMAP categorical products are triggered every four hours starting at midnight every day. Table 1 lists spatial and temporal resolution specifications of the five categories of products as well as weather variables from NWM and GFS. Table 1. Resolution specifications of the five categories of products and weather variables. 3.2. WaterSmart-GIS Service Layer This layer is the middleware to open the data products accessible to everyone via the Internet. The major function has three modules: data interaction, analytics, and dissemination. The interaction module is responsible for providing the web services that serve the cropland data for product browsing, visualization, and query. As there are many types of products served in the system, the product inventory service is developed to produce a list containing all the supported data categories in the system. The inventory provides metadata such as product name, short description, time extent, frequency, depth, and unit. With this inventory of all products served in the system, the data specified by users can be easily searched and located, and, thus, rendered and analyzed on client side. The query service takes user inputs of product type, location, and area of interest (AOI), and outputs the corresponding data on the location/area. Query web service is compliant to standardized Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Service, OGC Web Feature Service, and OGC Web Coverage Service. It makes the query service interoperable by both API users and WaterSmart-GIS users. The standard operations for obtaining values include GetFeatureInfo, GetFeature, GetCoverage, etc. This is one of the most frequently visited services, so the performance requirement for the querying is higher than other services. In order to reduce the latency, the granularity of individual files is controlled to avoid producing big files. The visualization service adopts MapServer to publish the tremendous number of GeoTiff files into Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS). As for NetCDF [56] files, we use ncWMS [57] to visualize them directly and save the extensive work of converting NetCDF into GeoTiff. The visualization style stays consistent with community standard or de facto rules to make it easier for users to comprehend. The data analytics module is responsible for generating insights into the WaterSmart products and meeting routine requirements by clients in agriculture. It allows users to conduct basic statistics on the SM, ET, weather, and vegetation products, such as calculating the area of the selected AOI, generating a histogram of SM moisture values over the AOI, converting the pixels into acreage, and calculating the percentage of each SM category in the region. Meanwhile, a typical requirement by farmers or agricultural agency officials is to obtain crop and soil timeseries data. The timeseries data depict the trends of each variable over a period of time at various temporal resolutions (hourly, daily, weekly). The returned data are a single dataset containing the data points with time labels and variable names. The objective of the timeseries service is to compare the values for the same location at the same time over a period. Thus, it is flexible to request multiple variables at the same time or at different times but with the same time frame and temporal resolution. Another essential function required especially by the agriculture department is to produce a PDF report containing the map, legend, and variable information for them to put into crop field regular reports. Sometimes, it is more efficient to preserve the map as a report material with detailed explanation about the crop and soil status in irrigation assisting. The data dissemination module is responsible for distributing the data files. Due to the tremendous number of files (updated hourly over two years), we have to control the data read and ensure the file system can keep up with frequent requests. For frequently visited data products such as HRLDAS SM and ET, we first convert the NetCDF files to be Climate and Forecast (CF) convention [58]-compliant and make them available to the WMS. Less-visited data, such as some of the weather model results, will not be converted until they are requested. If the system receives a download request, an on-demand script transforming the NetCDF into GeoTiff and clipping to the inputted AOI will be called. 3.3. WaterSmart-GIS User Layer This layer includes the front end of WaterSmart-GIS directly delivering all the functions and products to the users. Its usability defines the openness and accessibility to backend resources. Overall, it provides the following interfaces: Product Catalog provides a browser and selector to all the SM and ET products. The catalog serves as the entry point for users to choose a product from a hierarchical tree selector based on the irrigation needs. Each product name is associated with a short description and unit explanation. Layer Management controls all the layers selected in the product catalog and added into the map. Via this module, users can manipulate the layers\\u2019 visibility, order, and opacity to discover abnormal events, water stress information, and potential wilting point for irrigation. AOI selector is a drawing tool to specify the area of interest. It supports drawing multiple types of AOIs including point, rectangle, polygon, and uploading a Geography Markup Language (GML) file or a zipped ESRI Shapefile. It also allows users to choose from the county list to define the AOI by county administrative boundaries. Legend is explicitly displayed along with the rendered products, showing the value range and corresponding color palette. The units of products are placed alongside as the units of different products are quite different. Map Viewer is the interface to display the WMS layers of the WaterSmart products. It comes with a base map as location and context reference, such as the OpenStreetMap tile map layer, and Global Land Cover layer. The most recent SM image layer is placed on top as default. Map Controller allows users to manipulate the map viewer and find more information from it. It provides functions such as obtaining pixel info of all the displayed layers on the clicked position. Other basic functions such as panning/zooming in/out, navigation window, and changing base maps (including the latest cropland data layer), are supported. Data Analysis is the graphical interface allowing users to directly invoke the data analysis web services described in the section above. This system is specifically designed for agriculture and irrigation. Therefore, the analysis is able to focus on cropland by overlaying a crop mask. It also allows users to export or print the analysis results. Data Download is a function for directly downloading the data of the selected AOI. GeoTiff is the essential format for the output files due to its feasibility and flexibility in subsequent processing. Comparison enables side-by-side observation by adding a slider line to directly compare two layers in one view. Animation provides advanced features for users to view the changes in SM and ET in a dynamic way. Spatial pattern changes can be easily observed by users through this function. Reasonable timeframe, e.g., irrigation season or early growing season, are recommended considering server burden. 4. WaterSmart-GIS System Implementation The WaterSmart-GIS web system aims to deliver visualized geospatial data to non-GIS users in a responsive and interactive way using modern techniques. This interface allows for temporal and spatial analysis, download, and manipulation of the information. Various APIs on the server backend are responsible for hosting data and handling requests from the client side. 4.1. Technology Used The web application was designed to be component-based using the React framework (https://reactjs.org/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)) and responsive using a CSS framework called Bootstrap [59]. The application system functionalities were implemented using the lightweight Python Flask framework [60] and Web Processing Service (WPS) based on OGC standards in backend. The data visualization was realized by JavaScript OpenLayers 6.1 (https://openlayers.org/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)) on the client side. OpenLayers framework provides basic map controllers including panning, zooming and mouse position on map. The geospatial data were hosted by MapServer, which implements industry-standard OGC protocols such as Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS), and ncWMS, which is an extended WMS for displaying environmental data. MapServer (https://mapserver.org/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)) is selected because it is an open-source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web. Both of the mapper servers were deployed on the servlet container Apache Tomcat. Table 2 elaborates data servers, geoprocessing and map services, and frontend libraries used in our system. Table 2. Technologies used in WaterSmart-GIS. 4.2. Web-Based Interface The WaterSmart-GIS web application is developed to facilitate the direct use of different groups of web services by users. The design of web browser-based client is illustrated as Figure 2. In this prototype implementation, users can customize visualization of geospatial data in Nebraska, and request analytics services over these data via the graphic user interface (GUI). The GUI is composed of a map explorer and a configuration panel. The map explorer displays interactive layers and supports common map operations such as zoom in/out and panning. The data product, together with auxiliary layers such as boundary layers, base map layers, and crop mask layers, can be selected through the configuration panel. The configuration panel supports various operations including AOI editing, data selection, layer manipulation, map swipe, animation, requesting statistics of the layer within user defined AOI, generating a printable map in PDF format, querying time series of specific data type on a selected point, downloading data, and other functionalities. The returned results of queries will be displayed in a dialog, which can be further saved or rendered as a chart. Figure 2. WaterSmart-GIS web interface. 4.3. Developer-Oriented Web API This application also provides rich web APIs for developers to download, analyze, and query data. As all of our data are served by MapServer and ncWMS server, developers can access our data directly by WMS with suitable parameters. The response to a WMS request is one or more geo-registered map images that can be displayed in a browser application. Functionalities on the client side, such as statistics, PDF, and timeseries requests, are all handled by APIs based on the Python Flask framework, which is open to developers as well. These APIs are applicable to all the data types available on our application. The PDF API will return a PDF-formatted report for a specified AOI, while other results from APIs for statistics and timeseries are sent back to developers in the form of a data-interchange format (JSON). On the client side, these results are visualized in graphical widgets via interactive and customizable charts using the Google Visualization API on the client side. However, users can retrieve the raw data in JSON using proper API requests for their developing and researching. Another important API to fully utilize our data is to download raw data of user-selected AOI. This is different from the PDF API as the data are downloaded in a GeoTiff format with a geospatial reference so that users can do their own process and calculation, while PDF API returns a visualized map as a readable report. 5. Use Cases in Nebraska Nebraska is one of the leading states in terms of agricultural output. The state\\u2019s fertile farms produce bountiful yields of corn, soybean, wheat, hay, sorghum, and sugar beets. Most of its corn is raised in the central and southern counties, which lie in the great corn belt of the mid-United States. Due to the importance of agriculture to the state, Nebraska continues to seek better ways to harness and preserve its rich natural resources. Compared to its rich and fertile soil resource, Nebraska\\u2019s precipitation averages more than 30 inches annually in the southeast to less than 20 inches in the western panhandle, as most of the state\\u2019s moisture comes from the distant Gulf of Mexico. Since a minimum of 25 inches is usually considered necessary for normal crop production, about one-half of Nebraska may be considered semiarid. Figure 3 presents Nebraska\\u2019s location and basic information. Through these following use cases in Nebraska, our application demonstrates its ability to help users optimize water use efficiency and protect the quality of water resources by providing thorough information about soil properties, soil water use, and soil moisture level. Figure 3. The Nebraska maps of its: (a) location; (b) crop types; (c) soil texture class; and (d) annual total precipitation (mm). 5.1. Use Scenario #1: Early Growing Season (April, May, June) In the early growing season, the temperature is cooler. This lessens the amount of water lost to soil evaporation and allows more of the stored soil water to be used for crop transpiration. Meanwhile, the amount of rainfall in this period is greater than the amount of crop ET. Therefore, irrigation is not usually applied in this period. Users would mainly use our portal to monitor soil moisture, ET, and precipitation daily or hourly on one specific crop field or the general Nebraska cropland. A calendar widget provides the options to select the day or hour of interest during the early growing season. Users can find a brief introduction about the product type they selected, as shown in Figure 4. Based on selected time and product type, the product layer will be fetched from the server side then visualized on the map explorer. Figure 4. Soil moisture map in Nebraska on 7 March 2022. In addition to the visualization of multiple products on the map explorer, the statistical function on the left sidebar provides a more detailed and accurate scope to investigate the distribution pattern of ET or other products for a given AOI. As shown in Figure 5a, the table lists pixel numbers, acreage, and percentage of different categories of ET on 7 April 2021. A pie chart and bar chart are available on top of the dialog to represent the retrieved statistic result in a more attractive way. The statistic function is also able to return the result of cropland only and overall result. Regarding the defined AOI, raw data as well as a PDF formatted map decorated with scale, compass, legend, and geographic frame can be downloaded. As forecasted data are also available, users may not only try to monitor ET in a near-real-time manner, but also consider the timeseries of ET in the near future for a certain field. Once product type, timeseries step, and period are determined, for example, daily ET from 1 May 2021 to 1 July 2021, the daily ET time series would be returned and delineated in a line chart. The raw data of the result in CSV format are also available for downloading. Figure 5 exhibits the results of statistics and timeseries functions. Figure 5. Results table and charts for selected AOI and points returned by provided analysis functions: (a) Statistical result of ET in the user-defined AOI; (b) Hourly ET time series of line chart of user-selected point; (c,d) Pie chart and bar chart of the statistical result in (a). 5.2. Use Scenario #2: Irrigation Season (July, August) As the growing season progresses and canopy cover increases, evaporation from the wet soil surface gradually decreases. When the crop reaches full cover, approximately 95 percent of ET is due to transpiration and evaporation from the crop canopy, where most of the solar radiation is intercepted. Beginning from July, high temperature and long daylight time result in a much larger ET than that in the early growing season. The rainfall amount, decreasing in the meanwhile, cannot keep the stored soil water at file capacity. In this period, farmers have to observe their farms very closely and carefully and irrigate in time to make sure the crop yield will not be affected by water shortage. It is a very complicated and dynamic process to decide when and how much water to irrigate in a given field. Traditionally, farmers need to check the soil surface, crop leaves, local weather forecasting, as well as their following work schedule before they make a decision of irrigation. Usually, they tend to apply more water than necessary to their fields at a much earlier time, before soil water cannot afford crop ET, to ensure the crop health. With the support of the WaterSmart-GIS, farmers can now easily find out the soil properties, crop health condition, soil water level in the root zone, daily and hourly ET, and weather conditions, most of which will be updated in a near-real-time manner together with forecasted data. Therefore, all the information needed for irrigation decision making is provided to farm users in our portal. The following describes two different ways to utilize our portal for irrigation decision making. For one crop field located in 41.1651\\u00b0 N, 96.4766\\u00b0 W, users may need to know its soil properties, which should be constant for a long time, as well as recent and forecasted ET, soil moisture, and weather variables. Other than the time series information for ET and soil moisture products, the timeseries function also provides a comprehensive list of soil property and weather condition variables. All these requested data are returned and listed in a table or line chart by the timeseries function. Figure 6 lists this information in the scenario that an irrigation is pending on 8 July 2020 for this field. The soil properties, as listed in Figure 6a, provide important information including available water holding capacity, fragments of sand, silt, and clay in the soil, as well as other chemical and physical properties. Together with the soil moisture level like in Figure 6c, users can determine the upper limit of the irrigation amount, exceeding which the irrigated water would be a waste of resource. Detailed weather variables such as wind speed, temperature, rain rate, and surface pressure are given out by the National Water Model in Figure 6b. A clear decreasing trend in soil moisture is presented in Figure 6c from 28 June to 8 July, which is probably caused by the high ET and no rain since 2 July according to Figure 6e,g. The decision must be made whether to irrigate or not. By checking the forecasted rain rate and ET, in Figure 6f,h, users can expect a small rain on 9 July and another larger rain on 11 July, while the ET keeps decreasing. The increasing forecasted soil moisture in Figure 6c confirms this. Considering the information above, irrigation may not be necessary on 8 July. Figure 6. Information needed before irrigation decision making. (a) Soil properties; (b) Weather variables; (c,d) Recent and future soil moisture; (e,f) Recent and future ET; (g,h) Recent and future rain rate. In the previous case, although users could have a thorough overview of all the information related to the crop field, they would need to request multiple times for different data. If one wishes to know only some of the information in an independent dialog, we recommend another way to inspect the layers. After layers are loaded for viewing, users can request the exact values of all the loaded layers on the selected point. That is to say, a function to query pixel information is designed and provided to users on the top right toolbar. After entering this inspection mode, users can check their interested place on the map. A popup window will appear nearby containing the grid values of all visible layers on the map together with the point latitude and longitude, as shown in Figure 7b. Through this way, a user-customized profile at this point can be generated. In the example below, the high ET and low level of rootzone soil moisture indicate that irrigation is potentially needed. Furthermore, weather forecasting data indicate nearly no rain in the following several days. The soil moisture will keep reducing if there is no other intervention as the forecasted soil moisture illustrates. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that it is necessary to irrigate this field in the next few days. Figure 7. (a) Selected farm field; (b) Generating a customized profile of multiple variables for the selected location; (c) A photo of the selected farm filed. 5.3. Evaluation of HRLDAS SM and ET with Ground Observations The major task of WaterSmart-GIS is to provide products on monitoring and forecasting SM and ET. The primary products are generated by HRLDAS, thus it is necessary to evaluate and validate the accuracy of HRLDAS products. HRLDAS model soil moisture has been verified against observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet [61] in the past, which demonstrated that HRLDAS was able to capture the observed seasonal tendency of soil moisture evolution [15]. In this study, data from all three sites of AmeriFlux network inside Nebraska, namely, US-Ne1, US-Ne2, US-Ne3, in 2020 growing season, are collected for evaluation. US-Ne1 and US-Ne2 are irrigated and US-Ne3 is rainfed. We therefore incorporated in situ irrigation information of these sites into the model input to capture soil moisture peaks caused by irrigation. As shown in Figure 8, the orange curve is the observed SM from AmeriFlux network, and the blue line is the HRLDAS output in 2020. In the early growing season, the HRLDAS soil moisture is generally lower than observed values at both surface and rootzone soil. From June to the end of the growing season, the HRLDAS starts to do well on capturing most peaks caused by precipitation, and the simulated values are very close to the real values, or at least in the same range. We use root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate the overall accuracy of the model soil moisture. The RMSE of surface (top 10 cm) soil moisture is 0.036 m3/m3, and 0.038 m3/m3 for the rootzone (10 cm to 100 cm) soil moisture, which is similar to former verification study of model soil moisture [62] and below the SMAP mission accuracy requirement of 0.04 m3/m3 [45]. Although HRLDAS produces slightly lower soil moisture in the rootzone layer during the growing season, the RMSE of 0.023 m3/m3, and 0.037 m3/m3 for surface and rootzone soil moisture during irrigation season (from middle of June to the end of August), are still acceptable. Figure 8. A comparison of HRLDAS SM and ground-observed SM in 2020, averaged over three sites inside Nebraska (from top to bottom: 0\\u201310 cm, 10\\u2013100 cm depth). Figure 9 shows a comparison of the HRLDAS ET and the sensed real ET data from the same three sites of AmeriFlux network. HRLDAS ET has a generally good agreement with observations with a correlation (R2) of 0.81, and the RMSE of ET is 0.92 mm/day. This is within the error range of ET in irrigation water management, and agrees with another ET modeling study [63]. In the early growing season, ET is generally low due to the lack of vegetation. During the growing season, as there is a steady amount of water vapor from crops, ET starts to rise from late May and keeps high to the end of the growing season. Although the figure shows a certain level of inconsistency, the seasonal tendency of ET has been depicted well by the model. Figure 9. A comparison of HRLDAS ET and ground-observed ET in 2020 growing season, averaged over three sites inside Nebraska. Results without in situ irrigation information incorporated are also presented in Figure 10 and Figure 11 to demonstrate the model performance without user-supplied information. Compare to the results with in situ irrigation information, some soil moisture peaks are not depicted by the model without irrigation information during the irrigation season. Estimated surface-layer soil moisture and ET are very similar with or without irrigation data incorporated. Only rootzone soil moisture is accumulated and higher than that without irrigation data incorporated during the irrigation season when irrigation is frequently applied. The overall soil moisture accuracy also reduces to 0.043 m3/m3 for surface, and 0.049 m3/m3 for rootzone. The RMSE of model ET is 1.10 mm/day without the in situ irrigation information and its correlation with real ET is 0.77. Although these results can still capture the seasonal tendency and support irrigation decision making, the accuracy reductions indicate that past irrigation activities in the current growing season should be fully considered in simulation. Note that this is a very preliminary evaluation of model results at only three sites and for one year. A more complete evaluation plan is outlined in Section 6.2. Future Work. Figure 10. HRLDAS SM with and without in situ irrigation information incorporated in 2020, averaged over three sites inside Nebraska (from top to bottom: 0\\u201310 cm, 10\\u2013100 cm depth). Figure 11. HRLDAS ET with and without in situ irrigation information incorporated in the 2020 growing season, averaged over three sites inside Nebraska. 6. Discussion 6.1. Benefits for Agriculture Researchers and Decision Making This system can serve as a one-stop shop for agronomists and agriculture researchers to browse, observe, analyze, and download almost all the types of data related to irrigation, including remote sensing and model simulation. Its novel contribution to the research community is its comprehensiveness and flexibility on data manipulation and visualization. Using standardized web interfaces, the agriculture-themed data are organized and streamed in layers via OGC web services and RESTful APIs. Researchers can not only intuitively browse the data, but also obtain data time series of interesting locations. It also allows people to compare across product types by creating profiles of a location. People can obtain a holistic report about the soil texture, water content, chemical properties, wilting point, field capacity, historical soil moisture, etc. With such a tool, researchers can easily extract required information without spending time searching and performing data formation or transformation work. For decision makers, WaterSmart-GIS could serve as a bridge between them and scientists. They can gain a direct visual understanding of the soil moisture status with less explanation from scientists and stimulate the communication to drive in-time effective decisions. Compared to other web information systems, WaterSmart-GIS combines the most popular GIS functionalities such as statistics and profiling and expands them to HRLDAS model results, which has rarely been seen in numerical model visualization systems. The soil status and evapotranspiration that can actually impact the real-world decisions should be accessed easily through web systems. WaterSmart-GIS fills in that gap and provides rich data from multiple sources on SM and ET in a timely manner. Remote sensing data products such as SMAP and MODIS-based vegetation have about a 3\\u20135 days delay, while HRLDAS products only have a 4 h latency, and can be used as a reliable data source for daily operation. 6.2. Future Work The accuracy of SM and ET products is critical for supporting irrigation decision making. In this study, a preliminary evaluation of model products was presented based on in situ data of three sites inside Nebraska from AmeriFlux network. An extensive evaluation would be conducted in our next step. In situ data of more sites from AmeriFlux and other monitoring networks such as the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/crn/ (accessed on 17 April 2022)) developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN, https://www.drought.gov/data-maps-tools/soil-climate-analysis-network-scan (accessed on 17 April 2022)) were collected from 2019 to 2021 for further evaluation of model products. Moreover, the NASA SMAP science team has conducted several algorithm validation field campaigns, including those specifically for agricultural fields. The data collected from those field campaigns will be used to validate the model products. The common validation practices described in the SMAP Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBDs, https://eospso.nasa.gov/content/algorithm-theoretical-basis-documents (accessed on 17 April 2022)) will be followed. On the other hand, we will also use SMAP soil moisture products and NASA MODIS ET products for a spatially comprehensive validation. The HRLDAS products will be aggregated to the spatial resolution of the SMAP or MODIS ET products and compared with these products to compute RMSE at the coarse resolution. Since accuracy of the SMAP and MODIS ET products is known, this comparison will indirectly evaluate the quality of our ET and SM estimation. Many things can be done to further improve the accuracy of the existing SM and ET products. The bottleneck challenge is the missing gaps in remote sensing products caused by clouds and satellite revisiting cycles. So many researchers are troubled by the lack of continuous and long-term data. Machine learning has been proven to be a robust tool to fill in the gaps, given adequate training data [64]. Free and open ground-truth data should also be made available along with the remote-sensed and model-simulated data for on-the-fly validation. Crowdsourced datasets such as roadside photos or field-collected soil samples (loam or clay) could be loaded to assist evaluation of the current situation on points [65]. Intercomparison among ground-sensed, remote-sensed, and model-simulated datasets should be made easier [66] by providing a one-click button for the selected AOIs. For researchers, machine learning-augmented continuous observations should be made available for downloading or hot analysis such as interpolation or correlation analysis. For decision makers, considering farmers\\u2019 work environment, it would be better if we make all the information accessible via mobile devices such as the smartphone, PDA devices on the tractors, or big equipment in the fields (such as central pivots). The ultimate goal is to make WaterSmart-GIS a one-stop outlet service for users to access and manipulate multisource SM and ET information and make wise decisions based on that. Current coverage is only for Nebraska and it can be extended to other states or even countries as well due to the global coverage of the remote sensing datasets and the HRLDAS model scaling capacity. 7. Conclusions To address the shortage of near-real-time, useful public information on soil moisture and evapotranspiration, this paper developed a web application named WaterSmart-GIS to deliver near-real-time information about SM, ET, as well as weather variables such as precipitation, humidity, etc., to the stakeholders in a timely manner. The hosted or collected datasets include both real-time numerical model results from HRLDAS (High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System), and the remote sensing datasets from NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). It aims to help farmers quickly and easily create a wiser customized irrigation scheduler for their individual fields, relieving the burden on farmers, and to significantly reduce the water waste, and energy and equipment cost, in excessive irrigation. Our current coverage of Nebraska shows that the system can effectively collect and deliver key information to the right users via a web application with the additional provided functionality of point-based query, spatial statistics, and profiling. Systems such as this will play a critical role in the next few decades to sustain agriculture and food security for humankind, as we face great challenges such as global warming, frequent exceptional drought, plague, wildfires, caused by the dramatic climate change, exploding human population, and tremendously accumulated green gas emission.

Previous water scarcity assessments largely considered \\u201cblue water\\u201d (surface and groundwater) and overlooked \\u201cgreen water\\u201d (soil moisture), despite its key role in supporting crop production. Moreover, the long-term evolution of water scarcity remains unclear. Here, we propose an agricultural water scarcity index (WSIAW) that explicitly combines green and blue water. The WSIAW measures the degree to which both green and blue water availabilities can satisfy the agricultural water requirement. The WSIAW can directly indicate water scarcity in both rainfed and irrigated areas, which cannot be captured by the blue water scarcity index alone. Using the WSIAW, we assessed the evolution of water scarcity across regions of the world during 1971\\u20132010 at a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc degree. We found that 22% of the 228 river basins with a WSIAW of >1 presented a much broader geographical coverage compared with estimates of water scarcity based on blue water only (8% of total basins). The WSIAW also exhibited a clear trend of increasing severity over the study period, particularly in major agricultural regions. Expanding cropland and increasing/competing water withdrawals by other sectors were the main reasons for the intensification of water scarcity, which was pronounced in some Asian and African river basins. The proposed WSIAW can be applied to different regions with various scales and is important for addressing global water scarcity issues. Key Points We propose a new agricultural water scarcity index (WSIAW) by explicitly incorporating green and blue water for crop production WSIAW indicated severe water scarcity over a much broader geographical coverage compared with water scarcity based on blue water only WSIAW exhibited an increasing trend in many regions, mainly due to expanding cropland and increasing water withdrawals by other sectors 1 Introduction Water scarcity is the condition under which the water demands of agriculture and other economic sectors cannot be satisfied by water availability (Oki & Kanae, 2006). Cropland expansion, industrial development, and population growth have led to increasing water withdrawals and water scarcity in many regions of the world (Falkenmark, 2013; Postel et al., 1996; Qin et al., 2019; Schewe et al., 2014). Water scarcity, which is recognized as a global challenge, has been studied comprehensively since the late 1990s (J. Liu et al., 2017). The most commonly used water scarcity index (WSI) is the blue WSI (hereafter referred to as the WSIBW), which is defined as the supply/availability ratio of blue water, where blue water is usable freshwater from streams, lakes, and groundwater. Current estimates of the WSIBW indicate severe water scarcity in the central and southwestern parts of the United States (US), Mexico, North Africa, parts of the Middle East, North China, Northwest India, and Pakistan (Gosling & Arnell, 2016; Greve et al., 2018; Hanasaki et al., 2013a, 2013b; X. Liu, Tang, et al., 2019). Precipitation over land differentiates into blue and green water, with green water being the water \\u201cstock\\u201d as soil moisture and can be used for evapotranspiration by plants (Falkenmark & Rockstr\\u00f6m, 2010; Schyns et al., 2019). Blue (irrigation) and green water are essential for agricultural production. Although green water alone accounts for approximately 85% of crop water use worldwide (Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012; J. Liu et al., 2009), it has often been overlooked in water resources and scarcity assessments (J. Liu et al., 2017). A common reason is that green water is taken for granted, while only blue water is considered to be in limited supply for human use. Nevertheless, with increasing recognition of the importance of green water, green water scarcity assessments have been conducted (Schyns et al., 2015). Compared with blue water scarcity, the definition of green water scarcity is more complex and lacks consensus. For instance, Xu and Wu (2018) defined green water scarcity as the fraction of green water resources remaining available for non-cropland managed ecosystem services (wood production and pasture) after the demand for cropland is met. Schyns et al. (2019) defined a green WSI as the ratio of green water flow allocated to plants grown with an economic value to the total green water availability; however, this ratio reflects the fraction of water being used by plants in managed lands rather than the actual water limitation of economic services. More broadly, other studies have investigated the sustainability of green water indirectly by assessing water scarcity through the introduction of alternative indicators. For example, Yano et al. (2016) used a \\u201cwater unavailability\\u201d factor to indicate the impact of crop water use on source-specific water sustainability. Tuninetti et al. (2019) proposed a \\u201cwater debt\\u201d indicator to measure the time required to replenish the water resources used for annual crop production. The above studies on green water sustainability have, to some extent, highlighted the importance of green water in the context of water scarcity. However, the relationship between green water use and availability and its connection with blue water has not been addressed clearly. Moreover, changes in green water availability and demand over time in agricultural production have not been considered in previous studies. In addition to assessing blue and green water scarcity separately, there have been some attempts to combine them in an integrated water scarcity assessment. Gerten et al. (2011) and Rockstr\\u00f6m et al. (2009) compared the annual per capita shares of blue water supply and green water supply to the amount of water required to produce a standard daily diet of 3,000 kilocalories per capita to determine the water stress status of a country. This metric measures the number of people competing for a unit of water availability (blue and green) per annum (capita m\\u22123 yr\\u22121), or water availability per capita (m3 capita\\u22121 yr\\u22121), which is linked to a set of predefined thresholds based on basic human needs, such as a normal diet. However, a limitation of this approach is that it ignores differences in per capita water consumption across regions. In addition, a direct addition of blue and green water availabilities may not be appropriate because the presentation of blue water is in flux, while green water is in stock. To date, appropriately incorporating blue and green water in water scarcity assessment remains a key challenge (J. Liu et al., 2017). Building such an integrated index is important for gaining a more complete picture of the water scarcity status and for comparing different regions with a consistent metric. On the other hand, water scarcity is mainly due to agricultural water use, but its quantification is complicated because crop water use includes both soil moisture and irrigation. In addition, the temporal evolution of agricultural water scarcity, considering both blue and green water, is still unclear on a global scale. To address the above research gaps, this study constructed an agricultural green + blue water scarcity index (hereafter referred to as the WSIAW) by incorporating blue water and green water explicitly. The long-term trend of the WSIAW was then examined for the period 1971\\u20132010. Using this index, we assessed water scarcity on a global scale at the grid cell level and river basin level. Given the fact that green water is mainly used for the agricultural sector and that crop irrigation consumes the largest proportion of blue water withdrawals (Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012), the proposed WSIAW focuses on crop production by linking the crop water demand and total water availability (both blue and green) for evapotranspiration (ET). Such a focus reflects the fact that global water scarcity is mainly related to food production (Savenije, 2000). The study was structured as follows: (a) Construction of the WSIAW to provide a more complete and consistent assessment of water scarcity status across regions as opposed to blue water only or the separation of blue and green water assessments. (b) Assessment of water scarcity conditions based on the WSIAW, and a comparison of the WSIAW and WSIBW calculated using the conventional method at the grid cell level and for 228 hydrological basins worldwide, thus providing insight into the importance of green water in determining the integrated water scarcity status. (c) Examination of the temporal evolution of the WSIAW during 1971\\u20132010 at the river basin level to determine the trends and fluctuations compared with those of the WSIBW. (d) Identification of major factors driving changes in water scarcity across regions by considering green water availability for ET, crop water demand, and irrigation water use efficiency. This study is novel in that it is the first time that an integrated green + blue WSI is constructed as a consistent metric and used in global and regional assessments over time, focusing on agriculture. This approach improves the representation of global water scarcity, particularly in regions where green water dominates agricultural water supply and use. This study highlights the spatiotemporal features of the proposed WSIAW that differ from previous indicators, and provides deeper insight into the severity of water scarcity on a global scale. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Rethinking Water Scarcity The traditional WSIBW is generally defined as the ratio of total water withdrawals for irrigation and other sectors to the total blue water availability above some minimum environmental flow requirements (J. Liu et al., 2017): (1) where WSIBW [\\u2013] is the WSI based on blue water only; IWW [km3 yr\\u22121] is irrigation water withdrawal; BWWOS [km3 yr\\u22121] is blue water withdrawal for other sectors, including domestic, livestock, electricity, manufacturing, and mining; BWA [km3 yr\\u22121] is the total blue water availability; and EFR [km3 yr\\u22121] is the minimum environmental flow blue water requirement. Green water is ignored in Equation 1. As green water is tightly associated with crop production, ignoring it in an assessment can lead to underestimation or overestimation of the severity of water scarcity across regions. Blue and green water have different temporal and spatial availabilities and uses. Considering that agriculture is the only sector in which blue and green water both contribute mutually, and that this sector dominates the total water use globally, we propose a new index called the WSIAW as the ratio of the crop water demand represented by crop ET under the condition of no water limitation (ETc) to the sum of green water availability for ET over cropland and blue water after the EFR and water demands of other sectors have been met: (2) (3) where WSIAW [\\u2013] is the agricultural green + blue WSI; ETci [km3 yr\\u22121] is the crop ET under the condition of no water limitation for crop i; n is the number of crops considered; GWAET,i [km3 yr\\u22121] is the green water availability for ET during the growing season of crop i, defined as the water supply derived from soil moisture in the rooting depth of the soil column over cropland; and BWAET [km3 yr\\u22121] is the blue water availability for ET. In this study, BWAET was scaled by the irrigation efficiency (IE) to account for water losses through percolation and evaporation during conveyance and application, and water undelivered to crops. The country-specific IE was derived from Rohwer et al. (2007). For a specific crop, variables relating to green water in Equation 2 (ETc and GWAET) were only considered during the growing season. As multi-crops were included in this study (19 crops in total), a crop water demand over the entire year could exist for a given grid cell. Therefore, variables related to blue water in Equation 2, namely BWA, EFR, and BWWOS, were treated as annual fluxes. It should be noted that the ETc used in this study is not crop consumptive water use. Instead, it represents the potential crop water requirement without water limitation. The WSIAW is the ratio of the crop water requirement to the total water availability for crops, while the WSIBW is defined as the ratio of the sectoral water withdrawal to the total BWA. Both of these indices measure the degree to which water availability can meet water requirements, and were compared in this study. ETc refers to a crop-specific ET corresponding to no water stress. In previous studies, actual ET (AET) was used to indicate water requirements for croplands (J. Liu et al., 2009; W. Liu et al., 2019; Quinteiro et al., 2018). AET is ET under actual water availability conditions, which could be lower than ETc due to possible water limitation. In fact, AET can be estimated by multiplying ETc by the water stress coefficient (Allen et al., 1998). However, crop water requirements should be maintained at the level of ETc even with water limitation, for example, under rainfed conditions. Therefore, using AET may lead to underestimation of agricultural water scarcity because AET is already downregulated under stressed conditions. Devineni et al. (2013) used the same method to define agricultural water demand without distinguishing rainfed and irrigated conditions, while Zhu et al. (2019) explicitly treated ETc as the agricultural water demand under rainfed conditions. We estimated ETc as the product of a crop-specific coefficient and potential ET (PET), where PET is the evaporative demand of the atmosphere, independent of crop type, crop development, and management practices (Wang & Dickinson, 2012). In addition to using PET, the reference ET (ET0) value, which was calculated based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) method (Allen et al., 1998), was also used to estimate ETc for comparison. It should be noted that the WSIAW defined here is a \\u201ccrop-based\\u201d WSI, justified by the dominant role of crop production in water use in many regions. Considering the increasing attention given to water management at the river basin level, we assessed water scarcity globally using the WSIAW compared with the WSIBW at the grid cell level (0.5 arc degree) and river basin level. A total of 228 river basins based on the FAO GeoNetwork (http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=38047) were considered. We aggregated the volumes of IWW, ETc, GWAET, BWA, EFR, and BWWOS for each river basin from gridded datasets (see Section 2.4) and estimated the WSIBW and WSIAW for each basin using Equations 1 and 2. 2.2 Identifying Crop Growing Stages According to Allen et al. (1998), the growing season of each crop includes the initial stage, development stage, middle stage, and late stage. The crop-specific unstressed evaporation coefficients vary at different stages. In this study, we considered 19 crops that corresponded to the most important crops globally and calculated their water demands during their growing seasons. These crops include barley, cassava, citrus, cotton, grapes, groundnut, maize, millet, potato, pulses, rapeseed, rice, rye, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugar cane, sunflower, and wheat. Multi-growing seasons were also considered, for instance, three seasons for rice, according to Portmann et al. (2010). Nineteen crops occupy 80% of the global total cropland (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home). The growing season lengths (days between planting and harvesting dates) for the 19 crops were obtained from the MIRCA2000 dataset (Portmann et al., 2010) and subdivided into four growing stages. Accumulated fractions (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1) of the entire growing season lengths were used to determine the end dates of these four stages: (4) where DOYs,end [day of a year] is the last day of stage s; s can be initial (ini), development (dev), middle (mid), or late (lat) based on the growth stage; DOYp [day of a year] is the planting date; fs [\\u2013] (unitless) is the fraction of the length from the planting date to the last date of stage s [days] to the total growing season length (GSL) [days]. 2.3 Definitions of Water Availability and Uses 2.3.1 Crop Water Demand The unstressed crop water demand ETc was calculated from the product of PET using crop-specific coefficients. For a given crop, Allen et al. (1998) suggested the initial crop coefficient (Kini), middle crop coefficient (Kmid), and end crop coefficient (Kend) (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1). The crop coefficients are assumed to be constant at the values of Kini and Kmid during the initial and middle stages, whereas they vary linearly between Kini and Kmid for the development stage and between Kmid and Kend for the late stage. The crop coefficients for each day during the development and late stages were estimated as follows: (5) (6) where Kdev,d [\\u2013] [unitless] is the crop coefficient in the development stage dev on day d of the growing season, and Klat,d [unitless] is the crop coefficient in the late stage (lat) on day d of the growing season; Lini, Ldev, Lmid, and Llat [days] are the lengths of the initial, development, middle, and late stages, respectively. For crop i, the water demand throughout the growing season is the sum of the water demands in the four stages: (7) where Ki,d [unitless] is the crop coefficient of crop i on day d within the growing season; PETd (mm d\\u22121) is the potential ET on day d; Ai [ha] is the area of crop i; and the number 10 is the unit transformation. As multiple crops were considered in this study, we summed the ETc across different crops to obtain the total water requirements of multiple crops in a grid cell. 2.3.2 Green Water Availability We transferred green water resources from stock to flow regulated by the soil moisture content, wilting point, field capacity, and maximum daily soil water supply. Based on Gerten et al. (2007), when soil moisture is saturated, GWAET reaches a maximum daily soil water supply (5\\u20137 mm d\\u22121), reflecting the maximum transpiration of plants under various climatic conditions. Otherwise, GWAET is linearly scaled between the wilting point and field capacity by the actual rooting zone soil moisture content and becomes zero when the soil moisture content is lower than the wilting point: (8) (9) where GWAET,i [km3 yr\\u22121] is the green water availability (accounting for soil moisture up to the rooting depth) for the ET of crop i during the growing season; RSM,d [unitless] is the ratio of the difference between the actual rooting zone soil moisture content (SMd) [mm] and wilting point (WP) [mm] to the difference between the field capacity (FC) [mm] and WP on day d; WSmax [mm d\\u22121] is the maximum daily water supply from green water. In this assessment, we used 6 mm d\\u22121 for WSmax. After transformation, the volume of GWAET and the volume of blue water resources were of the same dimension, and thus could be summed directly. 2.3.3 Renewable Blue Water Availability, Environmental Flow Requirements, and Others The total renewable BWA (km3 y\\u22121) was defined as the total surface and subsurface runoff. We followed the variable monthly flow (VMF) method (Pastor et al., 2014) to estimate the EFR. Here, 60% of water resources were allocated as the EFR during low flow months (monthly flow: <0.4 times the long-term average); 45% of water resources were allocated for medium flow months (monthly flow: 0.4\\u20130.8 times the long-term average); and 30% of water resources were allocated for high flow months (monthly flow: >0.8 times the long-term average). A global application has shown that the VMF method performs well in representing locally estimated EFR values (Pastor et al., 2014). Monthly EFRs were aggregated to obtain the annual EFRs in each grid. The blue water availability for crops, BWAET, was calculated as BWA minus the sum of EFR and BWWOS, multiplied by IE to account for water losses during conveyance and irrigation. 2.4 Data Sources We conducted the analysis at a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc degree for the period from 1971 to 2010 at both monthly and annual timescales. Monthly PET and BWA were simulated by four large-scale hydrological models, namely H08 (Hanasaki et al., 2018), LPJmL (Sitch et al., 2003), PCR-GLOBWB (Wada et al., 2014), and WaterGAP2 (M\\u00fcller Schmied et al., 2016), at a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc degree. The formulas for estimating PET by the four hydrological models are provided in Text S1. The four models performed historical simulations for the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP, http://www.isimip.org) Phase 2a forced by the WFDEI climate data (Weedon et al., 2014). Monthly water withdrawal data for IWW and BWWOS were provided by Huang et al. (2018) at a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc degree. This water withdrawal data set was reconstructed from reported data of the FAO AQUASTAT and the US Geological Survey (USGS) and simulated irrigation water withdrawal from ISIMIP 2a simulations. Annual data for domestic, electricity, mining, manufacturing, and livestock sectors from AQUASTAT and the USGS were downscaled to a monthly scale, while the irrigation water withdrawal from ISIMIP 2a simulations by the above-mentioned four hydrological models were corrected using data reported by AQUASTAT and the USGS. Huang et al. (2018) provided four different sets of irrigation water withdrawal estimates based on four hydrological models, and the mean values of the four sets were used to estimate water scarcity. The annual variation of the cropland area during the assessment period was based on land use data set used in ISIMIP2a (Fader et al., 2010), which were derived from the HYDE 3.0 data set (Klein Goldewijk & van Drecht, 2006) and the MIRCA2000 data set (Portmann et al., 2010). The time series of the HYDE 3.0 total cropland area was allocated to each crop with the fraction from MIRCA2000 assuming that the fraction remained constant over time. Figure 1 presents the average fraction of total cropland coverage during 1971\\u20132010, while Table 1 shows the mean irrigated, rainfed, and total cultivation areas of 19 crops over the study period. In addition to the total land coverage, this cropland data set also provides information on rainfed and irrigated cultivation areas separately (Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1). The growing seasons of the selected 19 crops across different regions were obtained from the MIRCA2000 data set, including multi-cropping systems. The field capacity and wilting point data were downloaded from the Spatial Data Access Tool (SDAT) of NASA EarthDATA (https://webmap.ornl.gov/ogcdown/dataset.jsp?ds_id=569&startPos=0&maxRecords=20&orderBy=variables&bAscend=true). The monthly rooting zone soil moisture was provided by the PCR-GLOBWB model. All the data sets mentioned above were provided at a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc degree.

The Theil-Sen method calculates the slope as the median value of all slopes between paired values and provides a robust estimation of the linear slope. A positive slope indicates an increasing trend, whereas a negative slope indicates a decreasing trend. In addition to the trend analysis, we also conducted an uncertainty analysis of the two water scarcity indices because large-scale hydrological models are subject to high uncertainties in PET (W. Liu et al., 2016) and BWA (X. Liu, Liu et al., 2019) estimations, resulting in substantial uncertainties in the WSI assessments (Greve et al., 2018; Schewe et al., 2014). In this study, the impacts of different values of IWW, PET, and BWA derived from the four hydrological models mentioned above on water scarcity estimation were considered. We plotted the mean WSIBW and WSIAW values along with their standard deviations to show the corresponding uncertainties in nine major river basins across different continents. The nine major river basins were selected by choosing at least one basin on each continent, except Antarctica. 3 Results 3.1 Water Demand and Availability The average of global total ETc of the selected 19 crops over the period 1971\\u20132010 was estimated to be 6,003 km3 yr\\u22121 (Table 1). Wheat accounted for the largest proportion (18%) of the estimated ETc, followed by maize (14%) and rice (12%). These results were consistent with their fractions in cropland coverage. The global GWAET was estimated to be 4,954 km3 yr\\u22121 for the same period. Croplands of wheat, maize, and soybean collectively contributed the largest fraction (50%) of the total GWAET. The ETc and GWAET values showed similar spatial distributions (Figure 2) because they were both associated with cropland areas (Figure 1). The areas with high ETc and GWAET values were distributed in the middle of the US, parts of India, and southern Brazil, with values exceeding 1.5 km3 yr\\u22121 per grid for the study period due to high levels of cultivation. High values were also found in some hotspot regions in Africa, for example, in Nigeria. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Crop water demand (ETc, a) and green water availability for evapotranspiration (GWAET, b) over the growing season averaged over the period 1971\\u20132010. The difference between GWAET and ETc represents the green water deficit to meet the optimal crop water demand. Although GWAET exceeded ETc in the eastern US, Europe, and Japan (Figure 3a), this does not mean that irrigation was not required in these regions. This is because both parameters were measured for the entire growing season and ETc could exceed GWAET in some specific stages, for example, the middle stage with a high crop coefficient (Table S1 in Supporting Information S1). In contrast, many regions had GWAET values below the ETc values, for example, Mexico, most of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Australia. This deficit of green water to meet ETc was especially high in India, which was mainly contributed by wheat, rice, and pulse cultivation (Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). The observed GWAET in these regions was insufficient to meet the water demand of the rainfed croplands, resulting in a reduction in crop growth due to water stress in the absence of irrigation. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Difference between green water availability for crop evapotranspiration and crop water demand (GWAET - ETc, a) and blue water irrigation availability for crop evapotranspiration (BWAET, b) averaged over the period 1971\\u20132010. Figure 3b reveals an abundance of BWAET along the equator, particularly in the Amazon River basin and Southeast Asia, where BWAET reached 2.0 km3 yr\\u22121 per grid cell. In central Africa, southeast China, eastern India, and other countries in South Asia, the BWAET values were also relatively high (>0.5 km3 yr\\u22121 in each grid cell). However, regions with high BWAET values did not match the intensity of agricultural areas, as indicated by the spatial patterns of croplands in Figure 1. This was mainly because high BWAET values were observed in tropical regions, where there are no major cropland areas. For example, the regions with abundant blue water resources, such as the Amazon basin and Southeast Asia, have cropland coverages of <15%. Regions where ETc exceeded GWAET were generally those with relatively low BWAET values, thereby further exacerbating water scarcity. 3.2 Water Scarcity Indices at the Grid Level Overall, both the WSIBW and WSIAW values at the grid level indicated severe water scarcity in Pakistan, India, North China, the Middle East, and southwestern parts of the US (Figure 4). However, considerable differences were also observed in the spatial patterns of water scarcity estimated by the two WSIs. The WSIBW (Figure 4a) indicated that the most water-scarce regions (e.g., WSIBW > 1) were those with intensively irrigated areas (Figure S1a in Supporting Information S1) and/or low blue water resources (Figure S3a in Supporting Information S1). However, the WSIBW could not properly reflect the agricultural water scarcity situation in rainfed crop areas due to the sole consideration of blue water. As rainfed croplands accounted for approximately 81% of the total cropland areas of the selected 19 crops (see Table 1 and Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1 for details), the areas of water-scarce regions indicated by the WSIBW were underestimated. Considering the green water requirements in the calculation of the WSIAW, the water-scarce crop areas (WSIAW > 1) were larger and included Spain, Turkey, central parts of the US, southern Australia, eastern Brazil, and central and southern parts of Africa (Figure 4b). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of the water scarcity indices based on blue water only (WSIBW, a) and agricultural green + blue water (WSIAW, b) at the grid cell level averaged over the period 1971\\u20132010. In addition to the differences in spatial patterns, there were also differences in the levels of severity between the assessments based on the WSIBW and WSIAW (Figure 4). For example, in Libya and Egypt, the water scarcity indicated by the WSIAW was less severe than that indicated by the WSIBW, which was mainly because low precipitation limited the cropland coverage (Figure 1) and GWAET (Figure 2b). Low cropland coverage corresponds to low ETc values, and therefore low WSIAW values. On the other hand, with low BWA in the vast regions of Libya and Egypt, already relatively small water withdrawals for irrigation and other sectors resulted in high WSIBW values. On the other hand, on the southern and northern edges of the sub-Saharan region and in Spain, eastern Brazil, and the central northern region of the US, the WSIAW indicated a higher degree of water stress than the WSIBW. These regions generally have intensive rain-fed crop production (Figure S1b in Supporting Information S1); therefore, the severity of water scarcity in these areas is probably predominantly induced by rain-fed crop production. This further indicates the lack of available green water for rainfed crops, which would have been under water stress. In addition to water scarcity assessments at the annual level, we also estimated the mean monthly WSIBW and WSIAW during 1971\\u20132010, as shown in Figures S4 and S5 of Supporting Information S1, respectively. The monthly WSIAW values exceeding 1 covered larger areas than those with WSIBW > 1, especially from June to September. The distribution of the number of months (Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1) with both WSIBW and WSIAW > 1 was similar to that of the annual water scarcity. In addition, a WSIAW of >1 was associated with larger areas than the WSIBW in at least 1 month of a year, but the duration of water scarcity based on the WSIAW was lower in some hotspot regions, such as India, the Middle East, and the North China Plain. 3.3 Water Scarcity Indices at the River Basin Level We estimated the WSIBW and WSIAW for the 228 basins during 1971\\u20132010 (Figure 5). Similar to the grid cell assessment, the WSIAW was associated with a larger area of water scarcity than the WSIBW. Based on the WSIAW and WSIBW, approximately 22% and 8% of these river basins experienced water scarcity (WSI > 1), respectively. These basins covered approximately 15% and 5% of the terrestrial land areas, respectively. The WSIBW and WSIAW values also exhibited different spatial patterns. Basins with high WSIBW values were mainly concentrated in areas around 30\\u00b0N (Figure 5a) with low blue water resources (Figure S3a in Supporting Information S1) and high water withdrawals for irrigation and other sectors (Figures S7 and S8 in Supporting Information S1). In contrast, basins with high WSIAW values were distributed more evenly around the globe, especially between 30\\u00b0S and 45\\u00b0N (Figure 5b) because this index includes the crop water demand (Figure S9a in Supporting Information S1) and total (blue and green) water availability for crop ET (Figure S10a in Supporting Information S1). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of the water scarcity indices based on blue water only (WSIBW, a) and agricultural green + blue water (WSIAW, b) at the river basin level averaged over the period 1971\\u20132010. The locations of nine river basins used for the uncertainty analysis are outlined in blue in subplot (a). Many basins exhibited very different WSIBW and WSIAW values (Figure 5). The WSIBW was generally low in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Australian basins, while the WSIAW was relatively high in many basins of these regions. For example, the WSIBW value was very low (0.03) in the Niger River basin, whereas the WSIAW was 1.1. This situation often occurs in basins dominated by rainfed croplands. Therefore, the water stress in such regions with high WSIAW values is responsible for the gaps between the actual crop yield and potential yield on rainfed land. In contrast, some basins dominated by irrigation cropland, such as the Haihe River basin in China, the WSIAW values were lower than the WSIBW values. At the monthly timescale, there were also significant differences between the WSIBW and WSIAW across river basins (Figure S11 in Supporting Information S1). For instance, the WSIAW was higher than the WSIBW in the Niger basin for the entire year. In the Danube River basin, the WSIAW was higher than the WSIBW in summer, whereas it was lower in winter. 3.4 Trends and Uncertainties of the Water Scarcity Indices at the River Basin Level Over the study period, most river basins showed increasing trends in water scarcity based on both the WSIBW and WSIAW; however, the extent of these trends varied among the basins (Figure 6). Large increases in the WSIBW (Figure 6a) were observed in basins with low blue water resources (Figure S3a in Supporting Information S1), especially in the Middle East, South Asia, and North China Plain. These increases were mainly driven by decreases in BWA (Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1) and increases in IWW (Figure S7 in Supporting Information S1) and BWWOS (Figure S8 in Supporting Information S1). Increasing trends in the WSIAW were also significant in these regions (Figure 6b), but of a lower magnitude compared with the trends in the WSIBW. On the other hand, compared with the WSIBW, a larger increase in the magnitude of the WSIAW was observed in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and Australia. A decreasing trend (although not significant) in the WSIBW in Europe was observed due to decreases in IWW and BWWOS, while the WSIAW exhibited a significant increasing trend because of the climate-induced rising trend of ETc (Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1). In contrast, most basins over 45\\u00b0N presented decreasing trends in both the WSIAW and WSIBW due to increased water resources (Figures S3 and S12 in Supporting Information S1) and decreased water use (Figures S7\\u2013S9 in Supporting Information S1). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Trend slopes of the water scarcity indices based on blue water only (WSIBW, a) and on agricultural green + blue water (WSIAW, b) at the river basin level during 1971\\u20132010. Basins with insignificant slopes (i.e., the slope is not significantly different from 0 at a significance level of 0.05) are hatched with points. Several different patterns of changes in the WSIBW and WSIAW were clearly observed for the nine selected major river basins (Figure 7). The trends for the WSIBW and WSIAW values were similar for the Yangtze, Nile, and Indus basins during the study period. The WSIAW presented an increasing trend for the Danube basin, while the WSIBW exhibited an increasing trend for the period 1971\\u20131990 before decreasing thereafter. The Haihe basin presented a stable WSIAW, whereas the WSIBW exhibited an increasing trend. The trend analysis also revealed another advantage of using the WSIAW instead of the WSIBW, that is, the impact of changes in rainfed cropland. For example, the WSIAW in the Niger basin increased considerably during the study period, while the increase in the WSIBW was minor. The two water scarcity indices showed quite distinct trends in the Niger and Haihe basins, reflecting the different key factors contributing to water scarcity. The Haihe basin was mainly dominated by increasing water use for \\u201cother sectors,\\u201d whereas the Niger basin was dominated by expanding cropland. This difference further highlights the relevance of using the WSIAW to indicate emerging water scarcity due to cropland expansion, especially in areas of rainfed land. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Evolution of the water scarcity indices based on blue water only (WSIBW) and agricultural green + blue water (WSIAW), and the associated uncertainties for nine river basins worldwide. The blue and green lines show the mean WSIBW and WSIAW values, while light blue and light green represent their \\u00b11 standard deviation ranges. The locations of the nine river basins are shown in Figure 5a. We note high uncertainties in the WSI assessments, such as high standard deviation ranges for the WSIAW in the Danube basin and the WSIBW in the Haihe basin (Figure 7). The coefficients of variation for the WSIBW and WSIAW were generally >0.3 (Figure S13 in Supporting Information S1). The uncertainties were particularly large in water-limited regions, for example, North Africa, the Middle East, and central Australia. In addition, the selection of the WSmax value could have affected the estimation of the WSIAW. The WSmax value generally varies between 5 and 7 mm d\\u22121, and we set it to 6 mm d\\u22121. However, we found that the WSIAW presented quite similar patterns and values when setting WSmax to 5 and 7 mm d\\u22121 (Figure S14 in Supporting Information S1); thus, the selection of WSmax values in this range had little impact on the WSIAW estimates. 4 Discussion 4.1 Comparison of the WSIAW and WSIBW Taking agriculture as the nexus of blue and green water use, we introduced the WSIAW by including both types of water resources for crop production. Given that crop production is the largest sector of water use and the main driver of water scarcity in the world, it is important to have good insight into the water scarcity status with crop production water availability and use at the center of the metric. By including green water, the WSIAW better reflects water scarcity in cropland areas subject to a dry climate in the growing season, which cannot be captured by the WSIBW. We found that the WSIAW values were higher than the WSIBW values in approximately 79% of the studied river basins, especially in those with limited irrigation withdrawal, as indicated by the low IWW/BWA ratios in Figure 8. In rainfed-dominated areas, particularly in Africa, central southern parts of the US, and the southeastern part of South America, ETc was very high, whereas GWAET was insufficient to meet the high water demand of crops (Figure 3a). Therefore, even if these regions have relatively high precipitation and/or blue water resources, they can still be water scarce based on the WSIAW. This situation is typical in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where blue water resources are plentiful but irrigation areas are not developed; hence, the WSIBW did not generally indicate water scarcity in this region. Instead, there are vast areas of parched croplands in the region, which were clearly reflected by the WSIAW. Overall, 19 basins presented blue water scarcity (i.e., WSIBW > 1); among these, 18 basins also had agricultural water scarcity (i.e., WSIAW > 1). However, of the 47 basins with a WSIAW of >1, only 18 had a WSIBW of >1. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of water scarcity indices based on blue water only (WSIBW) and agricultural green + blue water (WSIAW) at the river basin level. The point size indicates the ratio of irrigation water withdrawal (IWW) to blue water availability (BWA). The color represents the fraction [%] of green water availability for evapotranspiration (GWAET) to crop water demand (ETc). For a better illustration, the WSIAW and WSIBW values for the Sabarmati and Sinai Peninsula basins and the WSIAW value for the Guadiana basin are changed in the figure. Their true values are indicated below the basin names. The WSIBW generally increased with an increase in the IWW/BWA ratio, indicating the dominant role of irrigation water withdrawal on blue water scarcity (Figure 8). The Sabarmati River basin in India and Pakistan had the largest IWW/BWA ratio, which resulted in the highest WSIBW. In contrast, the WSIAW was not primarily controlled by the IWW/BWA ratio but was related to the fraction of GWAET to ETc. Generally, the lower the fraction of GWAET to ETc, the higher the WSIAW. For example, the Guadiana basin had a very low fraction of GWAET to ETc (9%), and its WSIAW was the highest (5.1). There are exceptions, for example, the Arabian Peninsula River basin in the Middle East had a WSIAW of 0.3, even though the GWAET could only meet 3% of its ETc. The low WSIAW value in the Arabian Peninsula basin was mainly due to the small cropland area (Figure 1), meaning that ETc was much smaller than BWA (only 9%). In contrast, the Haihe basin in China had a high fraction of GWAET to ETc (89%), and its WSIAW reached 1.0 because it is located in a populous and industrialized region, where 37% of BWA goes to BWWOS instead of irrigation water. This ratio is extremely high compared with the global average of 3% (Rost et al., 2008). After deducting the EFR, minimal BWAET would remain for crops in the Haihe basin. Withdrawn water for irrigation includes a fraction delivered for crop growth and losses due to leaching and evaporation during the conveyance and application processes (J\\u00e4germeyr et al., 2015). Leaching losses can be reinfiltrated to groundwater; however, it was unclear how they could be reused in the same grid, although some of them could be reused at the basin level, expressed as recoverable return flow. Therefore, the use of the IE information from Rohwer et al. (2007), which considered both leaching and evaporation losses, could have overestimated the WSIAW at the river basin level in this study. This mainly relates to the lack of IE data assessing solely evaporation losses on a global scale. Moreover, we used fixed IE values for 2,000 to represent the 1971\\u20132010 period due to unavailable long-term IE series on a global scale, and noticed that the IE values varied between 0.3 and 0.8 across river basins (Table S2 in Supporting Information S1). To illustrate the possible impact of changes in IE values on the WSIAW, we recalculated the WSIAW with IE ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 and plotted the WSIAW against the WSIBW for the nine major river basins. The results showed that different IEs could lead to changes in the WSIAW (Figure 9). Although the WSIAW increased with an increase in the WSIBW, improving IE could reduce the WSIAW, particularly in years with high water scarcity. However, improving IE would not help to decrease the WSIAW in regions where other sectors already limit the amount of useable water for irrigation, such as the Haihe River basin (Figure 9). Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Impacts of irrigation efficiency (IE) on the calculation of the water scarcity index based on agricultural green + blue (WSIAW), and a comparison with the water scarcity index based on blue water only (WSIBW) for nine river basins worldwide. Six values of IE between 0.3 and 0.8 are selected for illustration purposes. The locations of the nine river basins are shown in Figure 5a. 4.2 Comparison of the WSIAW With Existing Water Scarcity Indicators and the Implications J. Liu et al. (2017) reviewed nine types of water scarcity indicators used in the literature. Only two of them considered green water: the \\u201cgreen-blue water scarcity\\u201d proposed by Rockstr\\u00f6m et al. (2009) and amended by Gerten et al. (2011), and the \\u201cwater footprint-based assessment\\u201d of Hoekstra and Mekonnen (2012). Although green water was included in the water footprint, only blue water was used to estimate water scarcity (Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2016). Our WSIAW assessment determined severe water scarcity in the central part of the US, many regions of Africa, eastern Brazil, and southern Australia. However, none of the blue water-based WSIs indicated water scarcity in these regions. High water scarcity in Africa was only diagnosed by the \\u201cphysical and economic water scarcity\\u201d and \\u201cwater poverty\\u201d indices (J. Liu et al., 2017). However, water scarcity in Africa denoted by these two indicators is more due to economic constraints rather than physical water limitations. The only WSI incorporating blue and green water also failed to reflect water scarcity in vast rainfed regions, for example, in the central part of the US and in southern Australia. This was because it aims to meet the per capita water demand based on a normal diet rather than the actual crop water demand (Kummu et al., 2014). Compared with the conventional calculation of green water availability for cropland, which is estimated from the total soil moisture content (Xu & Wu, 2018) or actual crop ET (Gerten et al., 2011), the method proposed in this study calculates GWAET based on the maximum daily water supply and a ratio incorporating the actual soil moisture content, wilting point, and field capacity. This approach converts green water from \\u201cstock\\u201d to \\u201cflow\\u201d. By using ETc as the crop water demand, our proposed scarcity index can detect emerging agricultural water scarcity worldwide. As the WSIAW is mainly used for agricultural water scarcity assessments, its disadvantage lies in the fact that it cannot reflect water scarcity due to water use from other sectors. The WSIAW measures the extent to which blue and green water resources meet the crop water requirements. In contrast, the WSIBW indicates the extent to which blue water resources can meet the blue water demand of different sectors, including agricultural irrigation. Therefore, the WSIAW and WSIBW were measured in different dimensions. While we emphasize the advantages of the WSIAW in reflecting the status of water scarcity given that crop production is the largest water user with respect to both green and blue water, we are aware that it does not explicitly reflect the water scarcity caused by the water demand of other sectors. To this end, assessments using both indicators may provide more complete information to support water resource management. 4.3 Evolution in Water Scarcity and the Contributing Factors Distinct spatial patterns were observed in the evolution of the WSIBW and WSIAW (Figure 6). Considerable increases in the WSIBW were mainly observed in the Middle East, India, and eastern China. As the total blue water is relatively stable in these regions, as expressed as an insignificant trend in BWA (Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1), the increasing trend in the WSIBW can be attributed to the increasing trends in water withdrawals for irrigation (Figure S7 in Supporting Information S1) and other sectors (Figure S8 in Supporting Information S1). On the other hand, the decreasing trend in the WSIBW in the regions north of 30\\u00b0N corresponds to the increasing BWA and decreasing IWW and BWWOS. However, contributors to the evolution of the WSIAW are more complex than those of the WSIBW as more factors are involved, including changes in BWA, withdrawals, green water availability over croplands (both irrigated and rainfed), and crop water demand. Increasing blue water withdrawals in non-cropland production sectors (Figure S8 in Supporting Information S1) decreases the remaining BWA for crops when the total BWA is stable. This is particularly true for the regions south of 30\\u00b0N, where the WSIAW presented a significant increasing trend. However, GWAET and ETc contributed differently to changes in the WSIAW values in these regions. For example, the increasing trends of the WSIAW in the Middle East and Australia were further intensified by rising ETc and declining GWAET, while an additional contribution to the increasing WSIAW in Africa was because the rate of the rising trend in ETc exceeded that of the rising trend in GWAET. Similar to the WSIBW, the WSIAW also exhibited a declining trend north of 30\\u00b0N, which was further triggered by increasing GWAET, in addition to an increase in BWA and a decrease in BWWOS. 4.4 Limitations of the Research and Outlook In this study, we proposed the WSIAW by incorporating blue and green water into the metric. The approaches for quantifying green water availability and cropland water demand presented here are applicable for assessments at varying spatial scales. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the limitations of this approach. Most of these are related to uncertainties in the input data and estimation. Crop ET (i.e., ETc) was used to indicate the crop water demand, implying that no stress was considered. However, this may overestimate the water demand when crop growth is constrained by other factors, such as nutrient stress, pests, or poor soil quality. This could be particularly true in Africa, where crop growth is generally limited by nitrogen inputs (W. Liu et al., 2018). Allen et al. (1998) estimated ETc based on ET0 rather than PET. We found that the ETc based on ET0 presented a spatial pattern similar to that of the ETc based on PET (Figure 2a and Figure S15 in Supporting Information S1). As a result, the global distribution of the WSIAW based on PET was only slightly different from that based on ET0, mainly in the central part of the US and Argentina (Figure 4b and Figure S16 in Supporting Information S1). To illustrate the uncertainty from hydrological models, we used PET in this study. The EFR, which affects the spatial and temporal patterns of blue water resource availability, was estimated using only the VFM method. However, various EFR methods can lead to quite different estimations of EFR (Pastor et al., 2014). Hence, using different EFR estimations can significantly affect the degree of estimated water scarcity. For future studies, analyzing the basin-specific EFR by various methods would be helpful for reducing uncertainties in EFR estimations, and thus, water scarcity assessments. However, determining EFR uncertainties is complicated because the EFR exhibits temporal and spatial variations in the proportion of the mean annual flow to maintain different levels of ecological conditions (J\\u00e4germeyr et al., 2017). This would require an integrated metric or framework that simultaneously considers the interaction between conservation status and water management goals. Such detailed research is beyond the scope of this study, but should be a task for future research. 5 Conclusions We proposed a new WSI incorporating green and blue water to assess agricultural water scarcity on a global scale for the period 1971\\u20132010. The new index measures the degree to which the total blue and green water availability can meet the water demand for cropland. Instead of AET, ETc was used to indicate the water demand of crops. The maximum water supply from green water and a ratio integrating the actual soil moisture content, wilting point, and field capacity were used to estimate GWAET, which transfers green water availability from \\u201cstock\\u201d to \\u201cflow\\u201d to be consistent with the flux mode of blue water. The assessment using the WSIAW showed that the coverage of water-scarce areas was much broader than that of the traditional assessment focusing only on blue water, that is, 22% of river basins were found to be water scarce based on the WSIAW versus 8% based on the WSIBW. The comparison also revealed that water scarcity based on the proposed approach had higher values over the rainfed croplands. The main reason for this is that rainfed land also has a high water demand, but soil water is insufficient to support the demand. The expansion of croplands and the increase in water withdrawals by other sectors were the main reasons for the intensification of water scarcity during the study period, which was clear in many river basins worldwide, particularly in some Asian and African river basins. Improving IE could reduce the WSIAW, especially in regions with high amounts of blue water remaining for cropland.

In order to inform water management decisions especially in scarce water environments, it is important to assess ET vegetation use by differentiating irrigated socio-economic areas and natural ecosystems. The global remote sensing ET product MOD16 has proven to underestimate ET in semiarid regions where ET is very sensitive to soil moisture. The objective of this research was to test whether a modified version of the remote sensing ET model PT-JPL, proven to perform well in drylands at Eddy Covariance flux sites using the land surface temperature as a proxy to the surface moisture status (PT-JPL-thermal), could be up-scaled at regional levels introducing also a new formulation for net radiation from various MODIS products. We applied three methods to track the spatial and temporal characteristics of ET in the World Heritage UNESCO Do\\u00f1ana region: (i) a locally calibrated hydrological model (WATEN), (ii) the PT-JPL-thermal, and (iii) the global remote sensing ET product MOD16. The PT-JPL-thermal showed strong agreement with the WATEN ET in-situ calibrated estimates (\\u03c1 = 0.78, \\u03c11month-lag = 0.94) even though the MOD16 product did not (\\u03c1 = 0.48). The PT-JPL-thermal approach has proven to be a robust remote sensing model for detecting ET at a regional level in Mediterranean environments and it requires only air temperature and incoming solar radiation from climatic databases apart from freely available satellite products.

Introduction The global water cycle is changing due to the combined effects of climate change and human interventions during the 21st century [1]. One of the greatest challenges is keeping water consumption at sustainable levels, which is more complex due to the increasing population in a context of climate uncertainty [2,3] and 3.5\\u20134.4 billion people estimated under water scarcity conditions in 2050 [4]. Many regions of the world can expect a combination of increasing temperatures (largely increasing evaporative demand) and decreasing precipitation patterns, which leads to increased stress on tackling water demand [5]. A prime example of this is the Mediterranean region, which is consistently projected as a \\u201chotspot\\u201d of drying trends and prolonged water scarcity conditions [6,7]. The Iberian Peninsula is predicted to be among the most affected areas by severe droughts by the end of the 21st century [8]. In this region, where irrigated agriculture represents over 80% of the total extracted water [9], land use shifts towards higher market-valued crops represent a major driver of change, which will markedly increase water withdrawals [10]. In the Guadalquivir basin in Spain, irrigation water requirements are expected to increase between 15% and 20% by 2050 [11]. This may cause a redistribution of water between the surface and groundwater [12]. Monitoring the variations in the hydrological cycle components more closely, among them evapotranspiration (ET), is of major importance in countries facing intensified drought spills [13,14]. After precipitation, ET is the major component in the terrestrial water budget [15]. Evapotranspiration at specific locations can be estimated by using methods such as lysimeters, the Bowen-ratio, or Eddy Covariance (EC) [16]. However, ET estimations at large-scales are complex to achieve due to spatial heterogeneity in the land surface [17,18,19]. As the only connecting term between the water cycle and the land surface energy budget [20,21,22], ET can be estimated by hydrological models (HMs) relying on the water balance or by land surface models (LSMs) computed through the mass-transfer equations between the land surface and the atmosphere [23]. Conceptual lumped HMs consider an undivided entity with individual values of input variables and parameters [24]. Spatially distributed HMs or prognostic LSMs enable ET to be estimated at large scales in a spatially explicit manner [25]. This type of models requires a priori information on land use and surface properties, which are not always up-to-date and may be complex for retrieving in situations of fast land use changes such as new irrigation developments. Diagnostic or historical LSMs using remote sensing (RS) datasets to prescribe vegetation and other surface variables can provide spatially distributed fluxes and fast updating on the land surface [26,27]. Diagnostic RS-LSMs need limited a priori data on soil and vegetation parameters to estimate ET and can rely on remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) as a proxy to the surface moisture status [28]. The complexity of RS-based models to retrieve ET depends on the process considered [29,30]. ET can be directly estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance equation or can be based on potential evapotranspiration adjusted to actual rates using different constraints factors from remote sensing. The Penman-Monteith (PM) equation [31,32] is the base to compute ET in some global RS-ET products such as the first widely available ET product MOD16 [33,34] whose main challenge relies on estimating surface and aerodynamic resistances to the water vapor [35]. Hu et al. [36] found that MOD16 best performs in temperate and fully humid climates and produces a consistent underestimation of ET in semiarid regions such as Spain, Portugal, the neighborhood of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and semiarid climatic zones in the conterminous United States [37]. In these regions and under water stress conditions, ET is very sensitive to soil moisture. In MOD16, canopy resistance to water vapor relies on vegetation-related RS inputs (e.g., LAI) [38] and stomatal conductance while soil resistance to water vapor relies on the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and relative humidity (RH), which are indicators of water stress [33,34]. The Priestley-Taylor equation [39] bridges the limitation of estimating these resistances by using an empirical multiplier \\u03b1PT [40]. The Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model combines the PT-approach with the reduction of potential ET based on eco-physiological constraints to land-atmosphere water fluxes [41]. With the aim to minimize the need for RH climatic reanalysis data and to improve the performance in semiarid regions, Garc\\u00eda et al. [42] proposed a modification of the PT-JPL model (PT-JPL-thermal herein) by introducing the LST with a thermal inertia approach as a proxy to the soil moisture status. This approach has proven to perform well in the drylands under Mediterranean and monsoonal conditions and to perform better than other RS models as the PM model adapted by Leuning et al. [15]. Although the PT-JPL-thermal model has been benchmarked at EC flux sites [42], it has not been tested with modelled net radiation or at regional levels. The main objectives of this work were: (i) to assess whether the RS PT-JPL-thermal model that uses the thermal inertia approach for soil evaporation can perform similarly to a hydrological model calibrated with in-situ data that requires soil moisture-associated parameters to retrieve ET, (ii) to compare and assess the ET derived from the PT-JPL-thermal against the global ET product MOD16, which estimates soil evaporation as a function of VPD and RH climatic reanalysis, in the Mediterranean region of Do\\u00f1ana including natural ecosystems (wetland, shrubland, and coniferous forest) and irrigated areas (mixed-irrigated areas and rice fields). 2. Study Area The study area presents Mediterranean climate under Atlantic influence with warm and dry summers and temperate and semi-humid winters. The temperatures range from 24 \\u00b0C on average in the summertime to 10 \\u00b0C on average in the winter [43]. The average rainfall is about 560 mm of which more than 80% occurs between October and March. The study area covers the Do\\u00f1ana National Park (54,251 ha) differentiating between three natural ecosystems: seasonal wetlands, shrublands, and coniferous forests, which rest over the aquifer Almonte-Marismas, extensive rice fields [44] on the right and left bank of the Guadalquivir river, and mixed-irrigation croplands established in the ancient marshes. In particular, the mixed-irrigation BXII converted into arable land in the 1960s [45] is one of the most-water-intensive irrigated areas in the Guadalquivir River basin with approximately 15,000 hectares and above 6000 m3/ha per year. The study area is of great international importance. The Do\\u00f1ana National Park is included in the Ramsar Convention as one of the largest wetlands in Europe [46]. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1995 and buffered by a Natural Park, which entered the endangered Montreux Record of Ramsar sites in 1990 [47]. The high variability of land uses in the Do\\u00f1ana region, where conflicts between the environment conservation and socio-economic development have increased [48], makes this region a particularly interesting water-scarcity hot-spot for assessing water demand on different land uses and water availability conditions (Figure 1). Figure 1. Map of the study area including (i) irrigated areas: mixed-irrigation areas (BXII District and left bank) and rice fields, (ii) natural ecosystems in the Do\\u00f1ana National Park: wetland, shrubland, and coniferous forest. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Remote Sensing Dataset Multiple remote sensing observations were acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using sensors from both Aqua and Terra satellites. Satellite data were used in combination with in situ meteorological data (air temperature and radiation) as inputs for the PT-JPL-thermal model. MODIS land products were retrieved from The Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), which is a core capability in National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) Earth Science Data Systems Program. All the selected MODIS products (version 5) were acquired at 1 km pixel resolution for the study period between 2003 to 2012. The temporal resolution of the data sets were: (1) daily for land surface temperature (LST), land emissivity ( \\u03b5 S ) and MODIS overpass time from MOD11A1 and MYD11A1, (2) 8-day-composites for land surface temperature (LST) from MOD11A2 and MYD11A2, (3) 8-day-composites of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photo-synthetically active radiation (fAPAR) from MOD15A2, broadband surface albedo (\\u03b1) acquired from MCD43B3, and (4) 16-day-composites of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) retrieved from MOD13A2. To interpolate to daily from 8 and 16 day-composites variables, the same value was used for the entire period. 3.2. Meteorological Data Meteorological data were obtained from the agro-climatic station Lebrija I (36.98\\u00b0N, 6.13\\u00b0W, https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/ifapa/ria/), which is a station site of the Agroclimatic Information Network of Andalusia (RIAA). This station is controlled by a CR10X data logger with sensors to measure Tair (Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean), relative humidity RH (RHmax, RHmin, and RHmean), solar radiation Rs, precipitation P, wind speed and direction, and reference evapotranspiration ETo, transferred by GSM modems for quality control and data validation [49]. 3.3. Remote Sensing ET Model (PT-JPL-Thermal) The PT-JPL-thermal model is described in Garc\\u00eda et al. [42], which is a modified version of the PT-JPL model in Fisher et al. [41] using thermal remote sensing data. In this work, the PT-JPL-thermal model was spatially distributed over the study area for a 10-year period at a daily time-scale. Daily estimations provided by the model were further aggregated per month to be comparable to the other evaluated models\\u2019 temporal-scale. The PT-JPL-thermal model retrieves actual evapotranspiration (ET) in mm/day by estimating actual canopy transpiration (ETc) and soil evaporation (ETs) as two layers (Equation (1)). The quantity of water intercepted by the canopy was not considered in the formulation of the model as seen in Garc\\u00eda et al. [42]. E T   =   E T c + E T s (1) Potential crop evapotranspiration E T p is downscaled to actual ET by considering biophysical limitations from the canopy and the soil. E T p depends on net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G). G was considered negligible at the daily scale, which was outlined in Fisher et al. [41] for monthly time steps (see Purdy et al. [50] for further expansion on G). Rn is the sum of longwave (RL) and shortwave radiation (RS) where incoming longwave radiation ( R L i n s t \\u2193 ) depends on the air temperature at the time of the MODIS overpass ( T a i r M O D I S \\u2212 t i m e ) and outgoing R L i n s t \\u2191 relies on surface emissivity ( \\u03b5 S ) and LST. LST, \\u03b5 S and T a i r M O D I S \\u2212 t i m e were retrieved from daily Aqua MYD11A1 for each pixel, replacing the LST, \\u03b5 S and T a i r M O D I S \\u2212 t i m e by Terra MOD11A1 values only in case of no data due to clouds or other factors. The \\u03b5 S was calculated as the average of the two thermal channels from the MODIS sensor. Shortwave radiation was calculated based on local shortwave radiation data and broadband surface albedo from MCD43B3. A conversion factor, J, between instantaneous and daily radiation variables based on the diurnal sinusoidal course of shortwave and net radiation was used [51]. This specific formulation using MODIS data was expanded from Garc\\u00eda et al. [52] and Bisht et al. [53] and to our knowledge it has been formulated herein with these data sources for the first time. To simplify the comprehension of the model, all the equations and variables used to retrieve the ET as the combination of canopy transpiration and soil evaporation are detailed in Table 1. Table 1. Equations and variables used to estimate daily values of ET in the PT-JPL-thermal model. \\u03b1PT = 1.26 Priestley-Taylor coefficient, \\u0394 slope of the saturation-to-vapor pressure curve (Pa K\\u22121), \\u03b3 psychrometric constant (0.066 kPa C\\u22121), G soil heat flux (Wm\\u22122) negligible at the daily scale as in Fisher et al. [41], kRn = 0.6 [59], LAI from MOD15A2, \\u03c3 Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 \\u00d7 10\\u22128 Wm\\u22122), c and d constants (0.261 and 7.77 \\u00d7 10\\u22124 respectively), Tmax and Tmin (\\u00b0C) max and min climatic Tair [60], N (h) time lag between sunrise and sunset (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/researchp.html), d time lag for maximum temperature before sunset (1.86 h), M O D I S t i m e from MYD11A1 or MOD11A1 depending on clouds, c time lag for minimum air temperature after sunrise (\\u22120.17 h), \\u03b5 S average of emissivity bands 31 and 32, LST from MYD11A1 or MOD11A1 (depending on clouds), R S d a y \\u2193 (MJ/m2/day) climatic data [60], \\u03b1 B S A and \\u03b1 W S A broadband black and white-sky albedo, t (h) time lag between sunrise time from NOAA and M O D I S t i m e , fAPAR fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation, fIPAR fraction of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation as a function of the NDVI acquired from MOD13A2 [41], Topt optimum temperature for plant growth (25 \\u00b0C) as in Garc\\u00eda et al. [42], Tam daily mean Tair (\\u00b0C), ( L S T D a y \\u2212 L S T N i g h t ) maximum daily LST oscillations from 8-day MYD11A2 and MOD11A2, \\u03d1 latitude, and \\u03c6 solar declination factor. 3.3.1. Canopy Transpiration Potential canopy evapotranspiration E T p c was downscaled to actual E T c by determining the fraction of the canopy actively transpiring (fg) and considering some reductions to potential transpiration due to a moisture constraint (fm) and a temperature constraint (ft) for canopy transpiration. The green canopy fraction (fg) is the ratio between the photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by the vegetation cover (fAPAR) acquired from the 8-day-composite MOD15A2, and the photosynthetic active radiation intercepted (fIPAR), which is estimated as a function of the NDVI acquired from the 16-day-composite MOD13A2 as in Fisher et al. [41]. The plant moisture constraint (fm) considers a reduction of light utilization for canopy transpiration in response to water stress [41]. The plant temperature constraint (ft) considers a decrease of canopy transpiration when the temperature differs from an optimum temperature range. Originally, Topt was calculated individually for every pixel by selecting the value of air temperature associated with a maximum NDVI and irradiance and minimum VPD, which is shown in Fisher et al. [41]. Garc\\u00eda et al. [42] found that this approach led to unrealistic Topt values in Mediterranean environments, obtaining better results using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model (CASA) [42,54]. In addition, the PT-JPL was not very sensitive to Topt in arid areas tested by Garc\\u00eda et al. [42] and, therefore, to avoid calibrations of Topt depending on the site, it was fixed in 25 \\u00b0C as in other global studies such as Yuan et al. [55] across a wide range of biomes. 3.3.2. Soil Evaporation Potential soil evaporation E T p s was downscaled to actual E T s by applying a soil moisture constraint ( f s m ) , which is outlined in Garc\\u00eda et al. [42]. The soil thermal inertia (TI) can be indicative of soil moisture content variations [56]. A simple approximation to this concept is the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) derived from multi-spectral remote sensing images [57,58]. ATI results from combining the RS surface albedo \\u03b1 , maximum daily land surface temperature oscillations ( L S T D a y \\u2212 L S T N i g h t ), and a solar flux correction factor. The formulation of f s m based on ATI in this paper relies on the minimum and maximum seasonal ATI, respectively. Assuming that maximum ATI values occur at saturated soil moisture content conditions and that minimum ATI corresponds to the residual soil moisture content in the soil, f s m would estimate the difference between actual soil moisture content and field capacity [58]. As the ATI requires both day and night LST, which increased significantly the number of gaps when using daily data, we assumed that 8-day data can capture well the general soil moisture dynamics. The daily maximum L S T D a y (daily minimum L S T N i g h t ) temperature was estimated for each pixel and 8-day period as the maximum (minimum) value between the day (night) observations from Terra and Aqua MOD11A2 and MYD11A2. 3.4. Hydrological Model WATEN Developed in Moyano et al. [65], WATEN is a conceptual model that approaches water balances where streamflow data are not available. The model is calibrated with the energy data to pump the drainage discharge from an irrigation district to the river and was applied to the mixed-irrigation BXII from 2002 to 2012. The accuracy of WATEN fitted the ideal Theil\\u2019s proportion distribution for good model performance and reached a correlation coefficient up to \\u03c1 = 0.93 and a coefficient of efficiency e2 = 0.90. WATEN requires climatic, crop-soil, and farm management data and relies on the water balance (Equation (2)) to solve ET and drainage (D) based on changes in soil moisture (S) in mm/month. Considering \\u0394 t = 1 month, we obtain the equation below. P i + I i   =   E T i + D i + S i \\u2212 S i \\u2212 1 (2) where Pi is the precipitation in month i, Ii is irrigation, Di is drainage, and ( S i \\u2212 S i \\u2212 1 ) is soil moisture variation between one month and the preceding. To estimate ET, potential crop evapotranspiration ETp is adjusted from reference evapotranspiration ETo by local basal crop coefficient values and downscaled according to soil moisture variations. The maximum amount of water retained by the soil and made available to the plant is characterized by the total available moisture (TAM). When moisture depletion reaches this value, the plant would not extract any water and transpiration would not occur. The readily available moisture (RAM) is a fraction of TAM depending on the crop and its development phase. Soil moisture depletion (SMD \\u2245 TAM \\u2212 S), which is the amount of water depleted from the root zone, facilitates the estimation of losses and gain estimates of the water budget [32]. This is expressed as S i \\u2212 S i \\u2212 1   =   \\u2212 ( S M D i \\u2212   S M D i \\u2212 1 ) . When the depletion level is below RAM, ET reaches potential levels. For a moisture depletion between RAM and TAM levels, ET is reduced from potential levels (Equation (3)). E T   =   { E T P , S M D \\u2264 R A M E T P \\u00b7 T A M \\u2212 S M D T A M \\u2212 R A M , S M D > R A M (3) Considering the fraction of effective precipitation (RP) and irrigation (RI), drainage accounts for the fractions of precipitation P \\u00b7 ( 1 \\u2212 R P ) and irrigation I \\u00b7 ( 1 \\u2212 R I ) not-efficiently used by the soil-canopy unit. When the soil presents the maximum moisture it can hold, SMD = 0, the water that is supplied by irrigation or precipitation is drained (Equation (4)). D   =   {   P \\u00b7 ( 1 \\u2212 R P ) + I \\u00b7 ( 1 \\u2212 R I ) , S M D   >   0   P \\u00b7 ( 1 \\u2212 R P ) + I \\u00b7 ( 1 \\u2212 R I ) + P \\u00b7 R P + I \\u00b7 R I \\u2212 S M D i \\u2212 1 \\u2212 E T , S M D   =   0 (4) Soil moisture depletion SMD is calculated in Equation (5) with a maximum SMD = TAM. S M D   =   {   S M D i \\u2212 1 + E T \\u2212 P \\u00b7 R P \\u2212 I \\u00b7 R I , 0   <   S M D   <   T A M T A M , S M D   >   T A M   (5) The model was calibrated through the energy consumption required to pump the drainage discharge from the study area (BXII) to the river. The calibration period covered a decade of study from 2002 to 2012 with a Nash\\u2013Sutcliffe coefficient e2 = 0.90 between observed and estimated drainage discharge data. 3.5. Remote Sensing Global Evapotranspiration Product MOD16 ET MOD16 ET is a globally available algorithm (freely accessible from http://ntsg.umt.edu/project/mod16) for ET retrieval based on the Penman-Monteith equation [31], Firstly introduced by Mu et al. [33] based on a revision of the algorithm proposed by Cleugh et al. [66], the algorithm resolves, during the day-time, the crop and surface resistances to transpiration and evaporation flows to the atmosphere. In Mu et al. [34], the algorithm was updated by considering the ET contribution during night-time and other improvements on the vegetation cover fraction, stomatal conductance, or aerodynamic conductance. The logic behind the MOD16 ET algorithm utilizes daily air pressure, air temperature, humidity, and radiation as meteorological data with remote sensing data derived from MODIS including land cover, LAI, fAPAR, and \\u03b1. In this study, the monthly ET product has been used. 3.6. Validation of the PT-JPL-Thermal ET RS ET estimations derived from (i) the 2-sources PT-JPL-thermal model and (ii) the global 2-sources ET product MOD16 were compared against WATEN ET calibrated data in the mixed-irrigation BXII from 2003 to 2012 where WATEN outputs were available. Monthly ET estimations as well as the average seasonal (monthly) and inter-annual ET dynamics were evaluated and compared. In this work, ET has been expressed in mm/day because of the importance in this region of irrigation in which ET is usually given per mm/day. This value is calculated by dividing monthly ET by the number of days in the month. Table 2 illustrates the inputs and parameters required to derive ET from the three methods. Potential ETp data series from PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 ET were further compared against ETp at the agro-climatic station at (BXII), Lebrija I. Table 2. Model inputs and parameters required for ET retrieval from WATEN, PT-JPL-thermal, and MOD16.

The performance of the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 ET models was evaluated through the Pearson correlation coefficient \\u03c1 (Equation (6)), p probability value, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (Equation (7)), the bias (Equation (8)), and the Root Mean Square error (RMSE) (Equation (9)). \\u03c1 x , y   =   c o v ( x , y ) \\u03c3 y \\u00b7 \\u03c3 x (6) M A E   =   1 n \\u2211 i   =   1 n | y i \\u2212 x i | (7) b i a s   =   1 n \\u2211 i   =   1 n   ( y i \\u2212 x i )   (8) R M S E   =   1 n \\u00b7 \\u2211 i   =   1 n ( y i \\u2212 x i ) 2   (9) where cov (x,y) is the covariance between the observed ET values xi and the estimated RS ET values, yi; \\u03c3x and \\u03c3y are the standard deviation of the variables, and ( y i   \\u2212   x i ) the estimated RS model error. The coefficient of efficiency (e2) [67] was used to determine the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance [68] (Equation (10)). e 2   =   1 \\u2212 \\u2211 i   =   1 n ( y i \\u2212 x i ) 2 \\u2211 i   =   1 n ( x i \\u2212 x \\u00af ) 2 (10) In addition, Theil\\u2019s inequality decomposition was useful for breaking down the error in monthly ET rates into three different characteristic sources: bias (um) in which large values indicate a systematic error, variance (us) in which large values indicate large difference in the fluctuation of the series, and covariance (uc) in which low values indicate unsystematic errors due to randomness [69,70] (Equation (11)). 1   =   u m + u s + u c   =   n \\u00b7 ( y \\u00af \\u2212 x \\u00af ) 2 \\u2211 i   =   1 n ( y i \\u2212 x i ) 2 + ( n \\u2212 1 ) \\u00b7 ( \\u03c3 y \\u2212 \\u03c3 x ) 2 \\u2211 i   =   1 n ( y i \\u2212 x i ) 2 + 2 ( n \\u2212 1 ) \\u00b7 ( 1 \\u2212 \\u03c1 x , y ) \\u00b7 \\u03c3 y \\u00b7 \\u03c3 x \\u2211 i   =   1 n ( y i \\u2212 x i ) 2 (11) According to Pindyck and Rubinfeld [69], Theil\\u2019s inequality components distribution is close to the optimal value when the sum of all three components follows the ideal distribution um \\u2245 us \\u2245 0 and uc \\u2245 1. Otherwise, undesirable occurrences would point to a revision of the evaluated model. 3.7. Assessment of PT-JPL-Thermal vs. MOD16 ET in the Do\\u00f1ana Region We compared the PT-JPL-thermal ET estimations against the globally available product MOD16 ET series over the Mediterranean region of Do\\u00f1ana (number of pairs np = 152,640, i.e., 1272 region-pixels in the 120 month-period from 2003 to 2012). ET annual values, inter-annual variability, and seasonality patterns (monthly) were assessed and compared for different land use (in Figure 1) on a pixel basis. Multi-year average ET values normalized to the total average in the region (ET/ETav) were used to assess the agreement between models in the spatial distribution of the ET estimates. Multi-year average ET values were also compared in terms of land use (np = 906 in the irrigated areas, np = 366 in the natural ecosystems). Seasonal (monthly) and inter-annual patterns of ET over the study period were compared on a pixel basis by correlation coefficients (np = 120 i.e., 120 months per pixel, and np = 10 i.e., 10 years per pixel), which were further partitioned and analyzed by the individual month and land cover class. 4. Results 4.1. Validation of the PT-JPL-Thermal ET The daily PT-JPL-thermal ET was aggregated into monthly estimates (mm/day) and compared against the in-situ calibrated hydrological model WATEN ET and MOD16 ET. Annual ET values are shown in Figure 2c. The 10-year ET average from 2003 to 2012 was 739 mm for PT-JPL-thermal and 352 mm for MOD16, which represented a 7% overestimation and 49% underestimation compared to WATEN (ET = 691 mm), respectively. The ET time series resulting for the period of 2003 to 2012 is shown in Figure 2a. The average seasonality derived from the PT-JPL-thermal ET and WATEN ET, which is shown in Figure 2b, presented maximum ET values in June while MOD16 ET maximum values were in April/May. The PT-JPL-thermal ET showed a high agreement with WATEN results after a lag of one month. Figure 2. (a) Monthly ET (mm/day), (b) average ET seasonality (mm/day), (c) annual ET (mm/year) derived from WATEN, PT-JPL-thermal, and MOD16 in the mixed-irrigation BXII for the period between 2003 to 2012. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 monthly average ET values versus WATEN ET over the study period between 2003 to 2012. Table 3 illustrates the performance of the models based on the estimators proposed (\\u03c1 coefficient, e2, MAE, bias, and RMSE) for monthly and annual average values. In general, the PT-JPL-thermal showed higher performance than MOD16. The PT-JPL-thermal vs. WATEN correlation remarkably increased when considering the one-month lag between both models although MOD16 accuracy was even lower in this case. Figure 3.

Potential evapotranspiration ETp from MOD16 did, however, significantly correlate with the on-site ETp at the agro-climatic station Lebrija I (\\u03c1 = 0.98, bias = 0.2 mm/day) and ETp derived from the PT-JPL-thermal also resulted in high correspondence with the ETp at Lebrija I (\\u03c1 = 0.99, bias = 0.17 mm/day) (Figure 4).

Assessment of PT-JPL-Thermal vs. MOD16 ET in the Do\\u00f1ana Region From 2003 to 2012, the average evapotranspiration ETav in the region including irrigated areas and natural ecosystems was estimated in 657 mm/year and 379 mm/year by the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16, respectively. MOD16 reached 58% of the PT-JPL-thermal estimated ETav. The monthly average ET in the region, which is shown in Figure 5a, showed a low correlation (\\u03c1 \\u2245 0.48) and a large bias = \\u221223.6 mm between models for a number of pairs np = 120 months. At an annual time-scale for a np = 10 years, the agreement between models increased (\\u03c1 \\u2245 0.94, p < 0.001) and the bias remained large (see Figure 5b). Figure 5. (a) Region-averaged ETav (mm/day), (b) region-averaged ETav (mm/year) derived from the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 in the study region (irrigated areas plus natural ecosystems) from 2003 to 2012. In the Do\\u00f1ana region, MOD16 showed a systematic negative bias with respect to the PT-JPL-thermal estimation for all the land cover classes. In addition, the timing of the peak intra-annual ET values did not coincide between models (Figure 6). The mixed-irrigation lands shown in Figure 6a,b presented maximum ET values in the summer (June to August) for the PT-JPL-thermal and spring (April to May) for MOD16. The rice fields presented maximum ET values from July to August for both the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 (Figure 6c). In the natural ecosystems, the PT-JPL-thermal showed maximum ET values in May for the wetland (Figure 6d), in June for the shrubland (Figure 6e), and in July for the coniferous forest (Figure 6f) while MOD16 detected maximum ET values in April for the three natural ecosystems.

(a\\u2013c) in the irrigated areas (rice fields and mixed-irrigated lands) and (d\\u2013f) in the natural ecosystems (wetland, shrubland and coniferous forest). The spatial patterns of the normalized ET values (ET/ETav) in Figure 7 showed high agreement between models in which both depict the areas with higher and lower ET rates accordingly except for the wetland. Both models identified the higher normalized ET values in the rice fields and coniferous forests, and identified ET values close to the region average ETav in the mixed-irrigation areas and shrublands. However, a significant disagreement between both models was found in the ET for the wetland. It resulted well above and below the ETav in the region in the estimations derived from the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16, respectively. Figure 7. Normalized ET values: ET/ETav where ET is the multiyear average ET per pixel and ETav is the average ET within the region over the period between 2003 to 2012. (a) PT-JPL-thermal ETav = 1.81 mm/day and (b) MOD16 ETav = 1.03 mm/day. The scatterplots in Figure 8a,b show the relationship between the multi-year daily average ET estimations derived from the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 over the period from 2003 to 2012, which differentiate by irrigated areas and natural ecosystems. The correlation was found significant in the irrigated areas with \\u03c1 = 0.74 (p < 0.001) and a bias = \\u22120.73 mm/day. In contrast, the correlation values were low in the natural ecosystems with \\u03c1 = 0.17 (p < 0.01) and a bias = \\u22120.90 mm/day except for the shrubland, which showed a correlation value \\u03c1 = 0.68 (p < 0.001) and a bias of \\u22120.59 mm/day. Figure 8. PT-JPL-thermal vs. MOD16 multi-year average ET estimations (mm/day) in (a) the irrigated areas and (b) the natural ecosystems. Figure 9a,b show the temporal correlation values between model estimations at seasonal (months) and inter-annual scales. Higher correlation values were found in the inter-annual ET dynamics compared to the seasonal correlations. Figure 9. Temporal correlation between PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 (a) seasonal (np = 120, 120 months per pixel), (b) inter-annual (np = 10, 10 years per pixel). The scatterplots in Figure 10 show the relationships between the PT-JPL-thermal and MOD16 ET estimations for all the land covers grouped for each month (np = 12,720 i.e., 1272 pixels in 10 years). Significantly higher correlation values were found in the summer months (i.e., July, August, and September) than in the period from October to March while the rest of the months did not show any significant correlation. Figure 10. Monthly ET (mm/month) from PT-JPL-thermal vs. MOD16 in the study region (irrigated areas plus natural ecosystems), np = 12,720 (1272 region-pixels in 10 years from 2003\\u20132012). This information is complemented by Figure 11a,b, which show specific correlation values for each month and land cover class. Figure 11. Correlation coefficients of the PT-JPL-thermal vs. MOD16 ET monthly patterns from 2003 to 2012 for: (a) the irrigated areas and (b) the natural ecosystems. A high significant correlation was found in the irrigated areas during the months of maximum water demand (Figure 11a). In the natural ecosystems, a non-significant correlation was found (Figure 11b). Particularly for the wetland, the correlation coefficient was \\u03c1 = 0.07 with p = 0.25. For the coniferous forests, the correlation coefficient was \\u03c1 = \\u22120.04 with p = 0.86. However, a significant correlation was observed in the shrubland during the spring and summer months (\\u03c1 > 0.7). 5. Discussion 5.1. Validation of the PT-JPL-Thermal ET The ET derived from the PT-JPL-thermal showed, for all the estimators proposed (Table 3), a better performance than the estimated ET from MOD16 in which the high bias obtained indicates a significant underestimation of ET rates. Moreover, significant differences were observed in the ET dynamics between models with non-coincident timing of the peak annual values. The PT-JPL-thermal ET dynamics at a monthly scale (Table 3) showed satisfactory agreement with WATEN ET and better results with the WATEN one-month lag. WATEN is a finite differences model run in one-month discrete time intervals whose inputs data may induce a lag in its calculation. Additionally, due to in-field irrigation data not available for modeling, WATEN uses water transfer data to the reservoir that stores the water to be applied as irrigation in the BXII [65]. All this introduces uncertainty regarding the time scale. The amount of variance and the e2 coefficient indicate that the PT-JPL-thermal model is able to accurately capture the ET dynamics. However, MOD16 e2 negative values suggest a high variance in the residuals which, together with the high values of the calculated errors, indicate a low capability for reproducing the WATEN ET dynamics. In addition, the Theil\\u2019s distribution components of the ET estimations (Table 4) obtained with the PT-JPL-thermal were close to ideal. With a low bias, there is well-represented variance and non-systematic residual errors in the ET estimations. For MOD16, the Theil\\u2019s inequality components distribution showed a poor model performance under our Mediterranean conditions. When considering the average seasonality in the ET dynamics (Table 3), the PT-JPL-thermal estimates showed better results than the ET dynamics at a monthly scale with a higher amount of variance explained and smaller errors. On the other hand, the WATEN ET seasonality was not accurately represented by MOD16, which showed a similar e2 coefficient and error values than those obtained at a monthly scale over the whole study period. Since potential ET values estimated by Penman-Monteith (used in MOD16) and Priestley-Taylor (used in the PT-JPL-thermal) were similar (Figure 4), it could be assumed that differences between meteorological data sets used in the two RS models were negligible. This points out to the downscaling process from potential to actual ET as the source of disagreement, i.e., the use of the VPD (by MOD16) instead of the thermal approach (by the PT-JPL-thermal) to downscale to ET. With regard to semiarid irrigated areas, high values of VPD may reflect the surrounding arid conditions but do not take into account the real values of water availability [42]. Similar conclusions were achieved by Cicu\\u00e9ndez et al. [71] when comparing MODIS GPP with EC-derived GPP showing the importance of water availability apart from VPD. In addition, MOD16 considers the surface of the soil covered by water to be zero when RH is less than 70%. RH records were below 70% over the irrigation season from 2003 to 2012 at the agro-climatic station Lebrija I and, in consequence, MOD16 assumed the wet surface fraction as non-existent, which led to an underestimation of ET. Likewise, Biggs et al. [38] found the evaporative fraction from the irrigated cotton (the major cultivated crop in the mixed-irrigation BXII) to be underestimated in 67%. The significant correlation between the PT-JPL-thermal and WATEN ET estimations proved that the use of the thermal inertia concept as a proxy indicator of moisture status together with the re-formulation of the outgoing longwave radiation makes it possible to reproduce the dynamics of ET under our Mediterranean conditions in a more accurate manner than using the VPD alone. 5.2. Assessment of PT-JPL-Thermal vs. MOD16 ET in the Do\\u00f1ana Region In the whole Do\\u00f1ana region, MOD16 estimations were also significantly lower than the PT-JPL-thermal ET values (Figure 5). Yet, a high agreement between models\\u2019 ET estimation was found in the whole region inter-annual dynamics (Figure 5b) and at a pixel level (Figure 9b) with \\u03c1 values around 0.8 in most of the pixels. As previously found by Mu et al. [72], although VPD alone may fail to capture the seasonality of water stress in some areas (Figure 9a), the inter-annual variability of water stress could be captured by VPD alone in most areas (Figure 9b), which indicated the adaptation of this approach for inter-annual global studies [72]. The PT-JPL-thermal ET estimations reasonably approached documented ET rates in the region per land cover class. The mixed-irrigation areas were found to evapotranspirate 4\\u20135 mm/day in the summertime by using the PT-JPL-thermal approach (Figure 6a,b) in accordance with the on-site calibrated WATEN ET estimations in the mixed-irrigation BXII. In the rice fields, the irrigation supply is documented to be 6.3 mm/day on average in a five-month crop-cycle [73], which is reasonably approached by the PT-JPL-thermal ET estimations (Figure 6c). Previous studies [74] in Mediterranean-climate wetlands showed similar ET average values than those estimated by the PT-JPL-thermal from May to October (i.e., 6 mm/day with \\u03c3 = 1.9 mm/day vs. 4 mm/day), which indicates that MOD16 may be underestimating evaporative fluxes (Figure 6d). Penatti et al. [75] obtained similar results in the world\\u2019s largest wetland (Pantanal) with a significant ET underestimation after winter and spring rainfall-periods. For the shrubland, (Figure 6e) MOD16 may underestimate ET due to a land use characterized as poorly vegetated surfaces, which is seen in previous findings in the Central Great Plains of the United Sates [37]. Although MOD16 has been documented to overestimate ET in forested areas over the Northeast Asia monsoon region [36,76], it was found to underestimate ET for coniferous forests under Mediterranean conditions as well (Figure 6f). Intra-annual dynamics derived from the PT-JPL-thermal ET coincided with on-site irrigation management and natural ecosystems patterns in the region, while MOD16 ET presented some inconsistencies. The two mixed-irrigation areas (BXII and left bank) showed maximum MOD16 ET values in April contrary to the irrigation-patterns in the region (June to August), which were more accurately identified by the PT-JPL-thermal approach (Figure 6a,b). For the rice fields, both MOD16 and the PT-JPL-thermal identified maximum ET values in July and August (Figure 6c) according to the rice fields management in the region, which involves a five-month cultivation-cycle from May to September after which plots are drained and rice is harvested in October [73]. In the natural ecosystems, maximum PT-JPL-thermal ET fluxes were observed when the evaporative demand from the atmosphere ETp was high and when water was available and easily accessible. The PT-JPL-thermal was able to capture the natural ecosystems different ET patterns depending on their capability to access water. Therefore, the wetland ET dynamics were accurately captured (Figure 6d), showing the highest ET fluxes in April-May when water is available after rainfall and vegetation sprouts [77]. Our results match ET intra-annual dynamics previously documented by Drexler et al. [74] in a similar Mediterranean-climate wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California. For the shrubland (Figure 6e), maximum rates were observed later in the spring (i.e., around June) coincident with the spring green-up period, which is supported by deep infiltration of winter and early spring precipitation, which was previously observed by Nagler et al. [78] in semiarid shrublands. In the coniferous forest, (Figure 6f) maximum ET values occurred later in the summer (i.e., July\\u2013August), which coincided with maximum ETp values and showed their root capability to access deeper soil moisture layers [79]. On the contrary, MOD16 showed the maximum ET values in April and the lowest ET values in July for the three ecosystems equally since this model relies on large-scale meteorological variables to estimate ET and is not able to capture ecosystems differences. In addition, the lowest ET values identified by MOD16 in July indicate the low capability of this model to assess ET fluxes in dry atmospheres with adequate soil moisture availability [33]. Since MOD16 bases the soil evaporation on RH and VPD alone, it does not take into account the availability of water in deep layers accessible for the shrublands\\u2019 and forests\\u2019 roots during part of the summer. This is especially important in the Do\\u00f1ana region because of the presence of the aquifer Almonte-Marismas on which the region rests, which assures water availability for some natural vegetation. The ET spatial patterns derived from both model estimations clearly depict the land use distribution in the region with a significant agreement between models except in the wetland (Figure 7) where MOD16 ET values were lower than the average values in the region while the PT-JPL-thermal ET values were higher. MOD16 uses a land cover map for parameterization and, therefore, a differentiation of land uses was expected. The fact that the land use map does not include a wetland class may partially explain the low ET rates in this area. In addition, the RH criterion used in MOD16 [34] results in an erroneous elimination of the surface water cover fraction from April to October in the study region (RH below 70%). However, the PT-JPL-thermal is able to capture the distinct moisture dynamics among land cover classes accurately, which produces spatially consistent values within land uses and identifies large differences among them (Figure 7). This indicates that the physical concept of thermal inertia is applicable to different patterns of moisture availability such as areas with free water surfaces, irrigated crops, and natural vegetation extracting the water from deep layers. Within land uses, the correlation of the multi-year average ET between the models at the pixel level was relatively high (\\u03c1 = 0.74) in the irrigated areas (Figure 8a) while, in the natural ecosystems, the agreement was much lower (\\u03c1 = 0.17) (Figure 8b). In the irrigated areas, despite the ET underestimation by MOD16, both methods seem to differentiate pixels with more and less evaporation accordingly (Figure 8a). However, the two models do not coincide in identifying the pixels with higher and lower ET values in the natural ecosystems especially in the wetland (Figure 8b). The availability of water for natural ecosystems due to the underlying Almonte-Marismas aquifer might be better captured by the thermal inertia approach used by the PT-JPL-thermal than with the HR and VPD approach used by MOD16. In addition, higher correlation values (\\u03c1 > 0.80) were found in the months of maximum water demand and high evapotranspiration from July to September (Figure 10). In particular, the rice fields and mixed-irrigation left bank showed the highest agreement in these months (Figure 11) in contrast to the natural ecosystems (except for the shrubland). A possible explanation is that the land cover product used by MOD16 to constrain ET values depending on land use is correctly assigned to the shrublands but fails in the wetland (classified as grassland) and coniferous forest (classified as permanent wetland and grassland). 6. Conclusions We compared two RS evapotranspiration models in natural ecosystems and irrigated lands within the UNESCO protected Do\\u00f1ana Mediterranean region from 2003 to 2012. The intensification of human activity in the surroundings protected areas jeopardizes the effectiveness of these areas for preventing the degradation of natural ecosystems. RS-based evapotranspiration models provide a valuable tool for assessing human pressures and the risk of natural ecosystems collapse. We validated the ET estimates obtained from the modified PT-JPL model (PT-JPL-thermal) that introduces land surface temperature (LST) with a thermal inertia approach as a proxy to the soil moisture status against the on-site calibrated hydrological model WATEN and compared inter and intra-annual ET patterns with the globally available product MOD16 ET. The PT-JPL-thermal was found to reasonably reproduce the ET dynamics under our Mediterranean conditions (\\u03c1 = 0.78, \\u03c11-month lag = 0.94) in contrast to MOD16 ET estimates, which pointed to poor model performance in the region. We found that MOD16 would allow us (i) to easily identify land uses with the lowest and largest water use and (ii) to assess inter-annual variability of ET in water-limited regions. However, the large negative bias (58% underestimation) found on MOD16 ET estimations in the evaluated land uses (irrigated areas plus natural ecosystems: wetland, shrubland, coniferous forest) would not allow MOD16 to approach the ET quantification under water-limited conditions. The PT-JPL-thermal reasonably approached ET rates in the region, revealing well-differentiated and coherent spatio-temporal patterns among the evaluated land uses. This study has proven that the use of the thermal inertia concept as a proxy indicator to soil moisture status, together with the re-formulation of the outgoing longwave radiation, is capable of reproducing ET at a regional level in semiarid environments. This requires only air temperature and incoming solar radiation from climatic databases apart from standard satellites and products freely available for ET estimations. In addition, this study highlights the potentiality to estimate ET of a simpler model less vulnerable to the uncertainties of multiple types of forcing data in comparison to more theoretically accurate models that require complex parameters difficult to characterize globally.

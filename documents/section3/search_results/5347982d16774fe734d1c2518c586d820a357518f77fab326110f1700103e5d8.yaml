    2013   Published: 5 September 2013 Abstract Physiological and developmental traits
    that vary over time are difficult to phenotype under relevant growing conditions.
    In this light, we developed a novel system for phenotyping dynamic traits in the
    field. System performance was evaluated on 25 Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense
    L.) cultivars grown in 2011 at Maricopa, Arizona. Field-grown plants were irrigated
    under well watered and water-limited conditions, with measurements taken at different
    times on 3 days in July and August. The system carried four sets of sensors to
    measure canopy height, reflectance and temperature simultaneously on four adjacent
    rows, enabling the collection of phenotypic data at a rate of 0.84 ha h–1. Measurements
    of canopy height, normalised difference vegetation index and temperature all showed
    large differences among cultivars and expected interactions of cultivars with
    water regime and time of day. Broad-sense heritabilities (H2)were highest for
    canopy height (H2 = 0.86–0.96), followed by the more environmentally sensitive
    normalised difference vegetation index (H2 = 0.28–0.90) and temperature (H2 = 0.01–0.90)
    traits. We also found a strong agreement (r2 = 0.35–0.82) between values obtained
    by the system, and values from aerial imagery and manual phenotyping approaches.
    Taken together, these results confirmed the ability of the phenotyping system
    to measure multiple traits rapidly and accurately. Additional keywords: cotton,
    genetics, Gossypium barbadense, phenomics, proximal sensing.  References Allen

    Contributions References Reader Comments Figures Abstract Research on practices
    to share and reuse data will inform the design of infrastructure to support data
    collection, management, and discovery in the long tail of science and technology.
    These are research domains in which data tend to be local in character, minimally
    structured, and minimally documented. We report on a ten-year study of the Center
    for Embedded Network Sensing (CENS), a National Science Foundation Science and
    Technology Center. We found that CENS researchers are willing to share their data,
    but few are asked to do so, and in only a few domain areas do their funders or
    journals require them to deposit data. Few repositories exist to accept data in
    CENS research areas.. Data sharing tends to occur only through interpersonal exchanges.
    CENS researchers obtain data from repositories, and occasionally from registries
    and individuals, to provide context, calibration, or other forms of background
    for their studies. Neither CENS researchers nor those who request access to CENS
    data appear to use external data for primary research questions or for replication
    of studies. CENS researchers are willing to share data if they receive credit
    and retain first rights to publish their results. Practices of releasing, sharing,
    and reusing of data in CENS reaffirm the gift culture of scholarship, in which
    goods are bartered between trusted colleagues rather than treated as commodities.

    alter the authors'' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and
    materials. Introduction With improvements in technology, tools, and communications,
    research data have become far easier to collect, save, manage, distribute, and
    reuse. Data-rich research environments can promote new fields of study, improve
    understanding of complex systems such as the Earth''s climate, and lead to new
    products such as pharmaceutical drugs [1]. Accordingly, funding agencies, policy
    makers, research institutions, and journals are encouraging researchers to release
    their data. Data management plans, deposit requirements, linking of journal articles
    to the data reported in them, and development of community-specific data sharing
    policies all are part of this trend. Policies that require or encourage the release
    of data are predicated on the assumption that those data are useful to others
    [2]. However, little is known about how researchers manage their data, or about
    when, how, or whether researchers will share their data. Even less is known about
    when, how, and whether researchers use data they have not collected themselves.
    Challenges for leveraging research data are many, including disparate practices
    of individual scientists, teams, and research specialties; labor and expertise
    needed to manage data; lack of incentives to release data; variant intellectual
    property regimes; competing policies for data release and control; and the difficulty
    of defining “data” in any given research endeavor [2]. The slow adoption of tools
    and services such as data repositories are indications that technology alone cannot
    change scientists'' practices; other social and cultural factors must also encourage
    data sharing. Policies for data sharing should rest upon knowledge of how researchers
    share data and how researchers use data that have been shared with them. In this
    article we explore data sharing practices among scientists and technology researchers
    in a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. The range of scientific
    and technical applications, and the size and diversity of the Center for Embedded
    Networked Sensing (CENS), make it an ideal site to address behavioral and policy
    questions surrounding data sharing. CENS, which began in August, 2002, and whose
    funding as an NSF Center ended in July, 2012, developed and studied networked
    sensing systems for critical scientific and social applications through collaborations
    between engineers, computer scientists, and domain scientists. We focus on the
    willingness of these researchers to share their data, their motivations to share
    data, conditions they place on sharing, means by which they share data, sources
    from which they obtain data, and purposes to which they put data obtained from
    sources outside their research teams. The breadth and depth of analysis, covering
    multiple disciplines over a period of ten years, using multiple methods, yields
    a rich set of insights about data sharing and reuse. Literature Review and Background
    Data long have been the cornerstone of science. Hence, the ability to share, reuse,
    and combine data offers scientists a wealth of opportunities: reanalysis of evidence,
    verification of results, minimized duplication of effort, and accelerated innovation
    [3]–[8]. Particularly appealing to the “big sciences” (large, long-lived, highly
    instrumented projects [9]) is Jim Gray''s “fourth paradigm,” a computational,
    data-intensive approach to science that constitutes a new set of methods beyond
    empiricism, theory, and simulation [10]. Digital data offer the potential for
    greater returns on investment, provided that data are properly managed and are
    shared among researchers [11], [12]. Data sharing can include attaching datasets
    to published articles, depositing datasets in repositories, posting data on a
    personal or laboratory website, or fulfilling requests from other researchers
    for data. Different methods for sharing may be more or less effective, and the
    degree of usefulness, trustworthiness, and value of the shared data will vary
    widely between researchers and disciplines. For the purposes of this article,
    any form of release of research data for use by others constitutes data sharing.
    The motivations for sharing data are diverse and reflect the interests of many
    stakeholders, from individual researchers to funding agencies. Arguments for sharing
    data include providing the ability to reproduce and verify the results of past
    research [13], [14], making the outputs of publicly funded research available
    to the public [15], allowing researchers to ask new questions of extant data [16],
    and advancing research and innovation [2], [10]. Research also suggests higher
    citation rates for papers whose associated data are publically available on the
    Internet [17]. Few standards yet exist for citing data, per se, though many efforts
    are under way to establish standards and practices for data citation and attribution
    [18], [19]. Despite these and other arguments that data have value in reuse, in
    only a few disciplines are scientists making their research data readily accessible
    to others on a consistent basis [20]. A recent survey in Science (2011) found
    that among their peer-reviewers, only 7.6% archive data in a community repository,
    while 88.7% archive data in university servers or laboratory computers, out of
    the immediate reach of other scientists [21]. Another study reported that only
    an estimated 1% of ecological data are accessible after the results have been
    published [8]. Partly in response to this low rate of data availability, a group
    of ecological sciences journals recently announced a joint policy for data release
    [22]. While a promising development, a 2009 study found that explicit journal
    policies requiring authors of journal articles to share data do not necessarily
    result in authors making their data available to outside researchers [23]. Tenopir
    et al, [24] studied general trends in data sharing by conducting an online survey
    of scientists. At the core of their sample population were members of the Data
    Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) consortium, which is a DataNet project
    funded by the National Science Foundation [25]. They sent the survey link to the
    project''s members, to federal agencies that manage and produce large amounts
    of data, and to scientific researchers at universities, asking recipients to answer
    the survey and to distribute the link to others who might be interested. In total,
    1329 scientists from North America, Europe, and Asia responded to the online survey,
    which Tenopir et al. estimate to be a 9% response rate from this snowball sample.
    The small proportion of those contacted who chose to respond to the Tenopir et
    al. survey were strongly in favor of sharing data. Of the 1329 survey respondents,
    75% agreed that they share their data with others, and 78% said they were willing
    to put at least some of their data in a central data repository with no restrictions.
    Respondents indicated strong interest in using datasets from other researchers,
    if the data were easy to access. Despite the overwhelming support for data sharing
    and reuse among respondents, only 46% made their data available on the Internet,
    36% agreed that their own data are easy to access, and less than 6% made all of
    their data available. These results raise important questions about the complexities
    of data sharing and reuse but shed little light on the types and circumstances
    of data sharing or reuse. Surveys can reach far larger populations than can interview
    studies or ethnographies, but their validity is limited by low response rates
    and by the inability to observe actual behavior. Much more is known about why
    researchers do not share data than about why they do share. Among the many reasons
    for not making data available are a lack of appropriate infrastructure [26], concerns
    about protecting the researcher''s right to publish their results first [27],
    incentive systems that favor publishing articles over publishing data [28], difficulty
    in establishing trust in others'' data [29], and the individual investment needed
    to preserve and manage data in ways that will be understandable and useful to
    others [30]. This is not to suggest that researchers are selfish, lazy, or greedy.
    Rather, these findings suggest that despite the current interest in managing,
    sharing, and reusing research data, the infrastructure and incentives to do so
    do not yet exist. Another explanation for the lack of sharing is the “gift culture”
    of scholarship [31]–[34], [27]. Researchers exchange data, documents, specimens,
    and other intellectual resources with each other through trusted relationships.
    Data often are closely held, as they can be bartered for other data or resources
    [27]. If openly deposited for anyone to use, researchers may lose the ability
    to barter data privately, thus creating a disincentive for deposit [28]. The sharp
    difference in sharing rates reported in the Tenopir et al. survey (75% saying
    they share, 36% saying their data are easy to access, and 6% saying they make
    all their data available) similarly suggests that much sharing is private, rather
    than public. Underlying the arguments for data sharing are assumptions that available
    data will be used or reused by others. However, surprisingly few studies have
    addressed how and when researchers reuse data they obtain from other researchers.
    Mayernik''s [35] study found that CENS researchers could not readily imagine what
    uses others might make of their data, and so creating documentation to facilitate
    data reuse in the future was a low priority. Zimmerman''s [36] study of ecologists
    defines reuse as “the use of data collected for one purpose to study a new problem”
    (p. 634). In ecology, reuse of data is complicated by the wide variety of variables
    collected in subtly different ways by different researchers. Faniel and Jacobsen
    [37] studied how and when earthquake engineering researchers reused data from
    other studies. These researchers relied heavily on their own domain expertise
    to assess the veracity and appropriateness of others'' data. Among the most important
    factors were the quality of documentation, the ability to interpret the data,
    and the applicability to the problem at hand. Hartswood et al. [38], studying
    the reuse of mammography images, found that the data were very difficult to interpret
    once separated from contextual information about the patient. Such complexities
    and circumstantial matters in the creation and use of data are well known in the
    social studies of science, but only recently are being applied to the study of
    data practices and data sharing [28], [39], [40]. Researchers are under increased
    pressure to release data, whether by requirements of funding agencies or by journals
    in which they publish. As long as data continue to be treated as a supplement
    to the written record of science, little motivation exists for scientists to alter
    their behavior, and ultimately, efforts to mandate data sharing will fall short
    [12]. As a recent Science editorial put it, “We must all accept that science is
    data and that data are science, and thus provide for, and justify the need for
    the support, of much-improved data curation” [4]. A collaborative effort is needed
    to address data sharing and data reuse, one that supports the needs of scientists,
    researchers, funding agencies, and the public. Characteristics of Data An agreed
    scope of what is meant by “data” is crucial for a discussion of data sharing.
    What researchers consider to be their data will influence whether they are willing
    to release those data. Influential factors include the methods by which data are
    collected, the forms of handling required, the availability of standard tools
    for analysis, and the purposes to which the data are to be put [2]. Most formal
    definitions of data tend to reify the notion of “data” as fixed objects. A case
    in point is this widely cited definition, that data are “A reinterpretable representation
    of information in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation,
    or processing. Examples of data include a sequence of bits, a table of numbers,
    the characters on a page, the recording of sounds made by a person speaking, or
    a moon rock specimen” [41]. As Bruno Latour [40] put it long ago, documents are
    malleable, mutable, and mobile. Data are even more malleable, mutable, and mobile
    than documents as they tend to exist in small units, are linked to many other
    related units, and are difficult to interpret without considerable documentation
    and context. Because data are so context dependent, they are difficult to transfer
    across research groups, sites, and disciplines [42], [43]. The mobility of data
    also appears to be a function of the type of research by which the data are generated
    and by which they might be used. Data from big science (large teams, long-term
    projects, extensive instrumentation) may be great in volume but usually are consistent
    in structure. As more people are involved, and as time periods to design research
    and instrumentation become longer, greater consistency is required in the resulting
    data. Big data from big science are intended for sharing among big teams [44]–[46].
    Conversely, in “small science,” which is coming to be known as “the long tail”
    of science, individuals and small teams collect data for specific projects. These
    data tend to be small in volume, local in character, intended for use only by
    these teams, and are less likely to be structured in ways that allow data to be
    transferred easily between teams or individuals. While “big data” is getting the
    attention, small science and the long tail appear to constitute the major portion
    of scientific funding [45], [47]–[50]. Making data from the long tail discoverable
    and reusable is emerging as a major challenge 51–53 Data, for the purposes of
    this article, are the objects – digital or physical – that researchers consider
    to be their sources of evidence for a given study. For the CENS researchers, data
    include sensor readings, temperature measurements, samples of water from lakes,
    streams, rivers, oceans, or beaches, software code, and diagnostics from physical
    hardware. Some researchers include as data laboratory and field notebooks, models,
    and figures and tables in publications. Data also are transformed through multiple
    states, from raw instrument readings, through cleaning, modeling, verification,
    replication, and other stages of analysis [54]–[59]. Practices to Collect Data
    The practices by which researchers collect data vary along many dimensions. Dimensions
    identified elsewhere include (1) the specificity of purposes for collecting data,
    ranging from exploratory research to building observatories, (2) scope of data
    collection, from describing particular events or phenomena to modeling systems,
    and (3) goal of the research, from empirical to theoretical [2]. Data collection
    practices differ also greatly between “big science” and the “long tail” of science.
    In big science areas such as astronomy and high energy physics, data collection
    tends to be well planned, well curated, highly visible, and collected by highly
    automated instrumentation. The majority of scientific data collection activity
    occurs in the long tail, however. In these cases, data are gathered via small
    projects that involve only one or a few researchers. The resulting datasets are
    specialized and not often preserved or reused [50]. Sources of Data Most scientific
    data are collected for scientific purposes. In contrast, the social sciences and
    humanities often draw upon data that were collected for non-research purposes,
    such as records of business and government, social activity, genealogy, or literary
    works [28]. Scientists collect much of their own data in laboratories and in the
    field, whether collecting observations, conducting experiments, or building models
    or simulations [7]. Many external sources of scientific data are available for
    use in investigations or for corroboration. Observatories are important sources
    of data on distributions of natural phenomena. These are institutions that systematically
    collect observations such as air quality, wind speed and direction, water quality,
    plant and animal species, soil, carbon flux, and astronomical objects. Examples
    include NEON and LTER in ecology [60]–[62], GEON in the earth sciences [63], [64],
    and synoptic sky surveys in astronomy such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the
    Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System, and the Large Synoptic Survey
    Telescope [65]–[67]. The most comprehensive observatories attempt to provide an
    integrated view of some whole entity or system, such as the earth or sky. Their
    value lies in systematically capturing the same set of observations over long
    periods of time. Global climate modeling, for example, depends upon consistent
    data collection of climate phenomena around the world at agreed-upon times, locations,
    and variables [68]. Astronomical and environmental observatories are massive investments,
    intended to serve a large community. Investigators and others can mine the data
    to ask their own questions or to identify bases for comparison with data from
    other sources. Scientists also can obtain data from other kinds of repositories
    that aggregate data of a common type, but do not represent systematic capture
    of phenomena. GenBank, for example, is a repository of genetic data generated
    by individual researchers or research groups working on projects with narrow scope
    [69]. Repositories of social surveys, such as the Inter-University Consortium
    for Political and Social Research [70] gather important social surveys, but each
    survey may have its own data structure and codebook. Results of individual surveys
    are not easily combined. Software code repositories such as SourceForge, Free(Code)
    (formally Fresh Meat), and CodePlex [71]–[73] serve a function similar to repositories
    of survey data. Open source software can be deposited; others may reuse and improve
    upon the code. Software in these repositories may be described with basic metadata,
    but is not necessarily described consistently nor is any software package necessarily
    interoperable with other code in the repository. Another useful, but less common
    source of data are registries. These are catalogs of datasets that allow researchers
    to indicate the existence of data without going through the process of adding
    their data to a repository [74]–[76]. Not all domains have data repositories where
    researchers could deposit their data, and not all researchers can or want to expose
    their data; in these cases a registry can still make the data visible for discovery.
    A registry entry may include a link to obtain data directly, or it may provide
    contact information and conditions for access to the data. Center for Embedded
    Networked Sensing The research reported here was conducted at the Center for Embedded
    Networked Sensing (CENS), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology
    Center funded from 2002 to 2012. The Center supports multi-disciplinary collaborations
    among faculty, staff, and students of the five partner universities (UCLA, USC,
    Caltech, UC-Merced, and UC-Riverside), with research on developing and implementing
    innovative wireless systems. A typical research scenario is one in which scientists
    and technology researchers jointly develop and deploy a wireless sensor network
    in an environment that a scientific team wishes to observe. Both the sensor network
    and the environment are studied – the sensor for its effectiveness and ability
    to collect accurate data, and the environment for trends and patterns that can
    be found in the data collected by the sensors. Two of the authors of this paper
    have studied the data practices of researchers at CENS since the Center''s inception,
    reporting elsewhere on aspects of data, collaboration, and scientific research
    [54], [55], [77], [59], [57], [58]. The data collected or used by CENS researchers
    in science and technology span the dimensions of specificity, scope, and goal
    that were identified in the previous section. CENS data are diverse and small
    in volume, and hence fall into the long tail of science. Much of the scientific
    research with embedded network sensing is exploratory. Teams go into the field
    with research questions about particular phenomena and may return to the laboratory
    either to test or to generate hypotheses. Some researchers model systems, and
    others use models of phenomena to design their data collection methods. Most of
    the scientific and engineering research is empirical, some of which leads to theoretical
    models of system and network behavior. CENS researchers are not in the business
    of building observatories, except on a very small scale. One of the participating
    sites is part of the University of California Natural Reserve system. James Reserve
    monitors local environmental conditions and streams them to a public website for
    anyone to use [78], [74]. The diversity of data created by CENS researchers is
    one of the reasons why it is such a productive site for studying data practices.
    Definitions of data differ from person to person and situation to situation [54].
    Data collected during CENS deployments typically fall into four categories [59]:
    sensor-collected proprioceptive data, sensor-collected performance data, hand-collected
    application data, and sensor-collected application data. Each of the four data
    categories has multiple variables, as shown in Figure 1. The variables listed
    are only a subset of the overall inventory of CENS variables and data types. Download:

    types organized by collection method and use (adapted from [47]). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067332.g001
    Most CENS researchers are interested in the sensor-collected application data
    (center set in Figure 1), albeit for different purposes. Scientists are interested
    in discovering trends and patterns within numerical data such as growth patterns
    of plants in a particular lake. For them, the sensor-collected application data
    are evidence. The computer science and engineering researchers use the presence
    or absence of these data to monitor system and sensor performance. For them, these
    data are a means to test and improve their systems, software code, or tools [54].
    For CENS participants, the data objects and their uses are deeply intertwined.
    For example, application scientists need to know the power levels of a barometric
    pressure sensor to be sure that the sensor was collecting accurate measurements,
    and technology researchers need the hand-collected samples to corroborate the
    sensor-collected measurements. Every participant has some form of “research data”
    associated with a field deployment or laboratory study. However, participants
    use other types of information to provide context for their research that were
    not identified as their “data.” We categorized these as foreground and background
    data, respectively [77] “Foreground” data are the focus of the research, whether
    a field deployment or laboratory study. These forms of data are described as “core”
    or “primary” data, distinct from “background” data that serve other purposes.
    The sensor-collected application data in Figure 1 are foreground data to application
    scientists such as biologists and seismologists. Hand-collected application data
    (bottom set in Figure 1) tend to be foreground data only to application scientists.
    Sensor-collected performance data, such as packets transmitted, are foreground
    data to engineers studying network properties. To the roboticists, the proprioceptive
    data are foreground data. Background data are those that are important to research
    activities but that are not necessarily reported in publications nor kept for
    future use or reuse. Most participants mention such types of data. The sensor-collected
    application data in Figure 1 can serve as background data to application scientists
    when used to verify the results of their hand-sampling, for example. The sensor-collected
    application data typically serve as background data to the engineers, who use
    them as system metrics, and to roboticists, who use them for navigation. The levels
    of quality required of data depend upon their intended use. Systems researchers
    use the presence or absence of sensor data as indicators of functionality and
    are not concerned with the values themselves. The application scientists, on the
    other hand, need precise values of observed phenomena. Research Questions Although
    researchers are under increased pressure to manage and to share their data, the
    infrastructure to do so varies widely between the big science and the long tail.
    Big science fields have established community standards for data structures and
    associated repositories, tools, and services, whereas long tail science relies
    on local practices for data management, generic tools such as spreadsheets and
    statistical software, and have few options for contributing their data to repositories.
    CENS researchers epitomize the long tail of science. They are members of an NSF
    Science and Technology Center devoted to developing new technologies that will
    advance scientific research. Researchers in science, technology, and engineering
    collaborate to design new tools, new methods, and new interpretations of results.
    Each partner brings established methods and practices from his or her respective
    field. CENS is thus an idea locale to study data sharing and reuse. We address
    the following research questions in this article: What motivates researchers to
    share their data? What conditions do researchers place on sharing their data?
    How do researchers share data with others outside their research group? What data
    are used that were not generated by a researcher''s own group? How are data from
    external sources used in research? Methods Results presented here are based on
    interviews and ethnographic observation from 2002 to 2012 at multiple sites associated
    with the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing. We draw upon data from several
    waves of studies, selecting responses to questions about data sharing and situations
    where data sharing or reuse occur. Ethics Statement The study method described
    below was submitted to and approved by the UCLA North Campus General Institutional
    Review Board. All participants interviewed and observed during the reported research
    provided their written informed consent, and were given the opportunity to withdraw
    from the study at any time. Interview and observational data collected as part
    of this research cannot be made publicly available because of conditions stipulated
    by the consent form. Specifically, that the data would not be made available without
    de-identifying the participants. This has been performed within the confines of
    the following publication, but is impossible with a full interview transcript
    where the participant has been asked to describe their research and career in
    some detail. Interviews Interview data for this article are drawn from two rounds
    of data practices interviews, 43 in total, with participants from the CENS community.
    As CENS was founded in August, 2002, these interviews were conducted during the
    fourth (2005–2006) and eighth (2009–2010) academic years of the Center. These
    were optimal times to conduct interviews, as research activities were at their
    peak, collaborations were well established, and the technology was becoming more
    stable after a long startup period. Interviews ranged from 45 minutes to 2 hours,
    with an average of 60 minutes per interview. For the first round of interviews,
    in 2005–2006, 22 participants were selected using stratified random sampling based
    on whether their research fell within the realm of technology or application science
    [79]. For the second round, in 2009–2010, 21 participants were selected using
    stratified random sampling based on the magnitude of their coefficient of betweenness
    centrality (i.e., the degree of connectedness they had with the rest of a co-authorship
    network constructed from CENS publications) [54], [80], [81]. Five persons were
    interviewed in both rounds of interviews due to the random draw. Although these
    interviews were not conducted as part of a proper panel study, the two rounds
    of interviews were conducted on a fairly stable population, and the interview
    questions were nearly identical. The two rounds of interviews are sufficiently
    comparable to identify changes in data sharing practices over time. However, we
    note that we interviewed more scientists (15) than technology researchers (7)
    in Round 1, and that the sample was more balanced between these groups (10 and
    11, respectively) in Round 2, as shown in Table 1. By combining these two rounds
    of interviews with ten years of ethnographic observations, we can draw more comprehensive
    conclusions than by reporting the results separately. Download: PPT PowerPoint
    slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 1. Interview participants and
    their distribution. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067332.t001 At the time
    of both the first and second rounds of interviews, CENS was comprised of approximately
    70 faculty and other researchers, about 140 student researchers, and several full-time
    research staff affiliated with the five participating universities. The CENS''
    roster fluctuated in size over the 10 years of the Center, peaking at about 300
    members. The count also varied from year to year depending on the number of students,
    faculty, and staff associated with individual research grants affiliated with
    the Center at any given time [80], [81]. Interview passages note the year in which
    the interview took place, the job status of the interviewee (student, faculty,
    post-doc, or staff), and whether the person works in a scientific domain or in
    technology. The science domain participants are in the CENS areas of ecology,
    biology, marine sciences, seismology, and related areas. Environmental engineering
    participants are classified in the sciences as they are working primarily on science
    problems such as water quality and contaminant transfer. Technology participants
    include those in computer science and in other areas of engineering, primarily
    electrical engineering and robotics. Our research subjects are classified consistently
    as being science or technology participants in CENS in papers for which this distinction
    is relevant [54], [55]. Given the size of the sample, any more detail in disciplinary
    labels risks revealing the identity of our subjects. Other research on this population
    shows differences between those in the sciences and in technology, but finer distinctions
    in this population are not conclusive [54], [55]. Our interviews asked participants
    a series of questions about their data and data practices. Findings reported here
    are based on the following interview questions: Are you willing to share your
    data? Under what conditions? Do you ever put your data in a repository? Do you
    use data you did not generate yourself? These open-ended questions drew rich responses.
    Where interviewees touched on these issues in response to other questions, those
    answers also were coded into the analysis reported here. Ethnographic Observation
    Ethnographic research incorporated in this article includes field observations
    of participants performing research, laboratory and community meetings, and other
    events. As members of the CENS community, the authors interact with CENS researchers
    during formal gatherings, such as research reviews and retreats, weekly research
    seminars, and informal gatherings such as discussions within the lab and offices
    of CENS. Time spent in the field with researchers and participating in this community
    provides context for interpreting our interview results. We also include a brief
    case study of CENS'' datasets from 2005 in the results. As members of the community,
    we were asked to review the usefulness of datasets posted to the CENS website.
    Qualitative Data Analysis All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and
    complemented by the interviewers'' memos on noteworthy topics and themes. Transcription
    of the interviews from Round 1 (2005–2006) totaled 312 pages, and the transcription
    of the Round 2 (2009–2010) interviews totaled 406 pages. Initial analysis of the
    transcripts and field notes revealed emergent themes. We developed a codebook
    and a full coding process using NVIVO software. Themes were tested and refined
    through further coding. Four coders (these three authors plus Matthew Mayernik,
    an author on other publications from this body of research) analyzed these data,
    with appropriate tests for inter-coder reliability. Results The results are organized
    by research question. Findings from Round 1 and 2 interviews are reported separately
    and then compared in the discussion section. What motivates researchers to share
    their data? CENS researchers – faculty, students, and staff alike – are willing
    to share their data. What data they are willing to share, when, with whom, and
    under what conditions, are much more difficult questions, with rich and nuanced
    answers. Round 1. In Round 1, all of the 22 participants interviewed indicated
    that they were willing to share at least some of the data they had generated during
    their research with others outside their team. One reason for their willingness
    was the increase in the amount of data being generated. One participant noted
    the overabundance of data by the fourth year of CENS: “There''s tons and tons
    and tons of information out there now” (2006 Interview 2 – Faculty – Science).
    This participant went on to explain how researchers need to share data so that
    others can pursue different lines of research later: The one criticism I think
    you will hear of observatories over the next 10 years is, well they did exactly
    what that one did. Why aren''t they sharing their data? Why aren''t they looking
    at these things together? Why are they making separate measurements of exactly
    the same thing, finding exactly the same result? And why are these guys doing
    it, when 10 years ago somebody did it over there and found the same thing? (2006
    Interview 2 – Faculty – Science). Here the participant also identified the need
    to avoid repeating the work of the past by working together and sharing data,
    rather than by pursuing common lines of research independently. Another participant
    collected data primarily to share them with others. Similar to the above participant,
    he recognized how the availability of data might positively affect the progress
    of science: I''m just motivated to see this type of data, microclimate data, really
    fine scale bird behavior data or whatever else we collect being used for scientific
    research in ways that people observing themselves can''t do. I''m just motivated
    that I think it''s going to allow biologists to ask a lot of questions and answer
    a lot of questions that before have just been completely impossible to do. So
    just kind of in general being able to ask more interesting scientific questions
    and being able to come up with better answers. That''s my motivation as a biologist
    (2006 Interview 14 – Student – Science). For the above participant, the motivation
    for sharing was to enable other researchers to ask new questions, especially questions
    that would otherwise have been impossible to address. Yet another participant
    noted that she shared data because she recognized that others may find the data
    interesting or useful. She explained that she posted some of her data online because,
    “I think some of our data showing the changes, like the seasonal changes and patterns
    in the lake, would be of interest to other people” (2006 Interview 10 – Staff
    – Science). Although she did not specify whom she thinks would be interested in
    her data, her realization that someone would want her data was motivation enough
    to try to make them available. Round 2. In Round 2, all participants again indicated
    that they are willing to share some data, if not all, with others outside their
    research group. One motivation was to make results of publicly funded research
    available to the public, as was noted by the following participant. Coincidentally,
    she was interviewed in both rounds and is the same person quoted immediately above
    in Round 1 (between the two rounds her status changed from staff to graduate student):
    For scientists, you don''t really want to put all of your data on the web. But
    if it is funded by public money you know, for us we are dealing with things that
    are relevant to people and beaches. We want to share that (2009 Interview 3 –
    Student – Science). Some perceived direct advantages for sharing data. This participant,
    who develops open source robotic platforms, suggested that his research group
    would benefit from the adoption of their data due to network effects: If such
    a request arrives, then we immediately grant it because we would like to actually
    share all of our information and all of our systems to the wider academic community.
    And so such a request arrived before, and [we] provided the data immediately,
    and we not only share the data but also the platforms we developed. We would like
    other researchers to adopt them and use them in their research as well and there
    are many cases when we did that as well (2009 Interview 10 – Staff – Technology).
    What conditions do researchers place on sharing their data? Although the participants
    interviewed were willing, in principle, to share their data, they identified a
    number of conditions to be met before they would share. The most commonly cited
    conditions for sharing data were (1) first rights to publish results, (2) proper
    attribution to the data source, (3) familiarity between sharer and recipient,
    (4) funding agency expectations, and (5) the amount of effort required to share.
    Table 2 lists the conditions identified by the participants and the number of
    participants in each round who cited the condition in their interview. In Round
    1, 16 of the 22 participants discussed specific conditions for sharing. These
    16 participants identified 15 conditions; these conditions were mentioned a total
    of 36 times. In Round 2, 16 of the 21 participants discussed conditions. The latter
    16 participants identified 13 conditions, which were mentioned a total of 36 times.
    Many participants listed multiple conditions for sharing their data; one participant
    in Round 2 named five different conditions. The only singular condition mentioned
    was retaining first rights to publish, which was the greatest concern overall.
    Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 2. Conditions
    for data sharing. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067332.t002 Round 1. In
    Round 1, most of the 16 conditions for sharing data were mentioned by only one
    or two participants, as seen in Table 2. Two conditions for sharing dominated:
    retaining first rights to publish results and attribution for the source of the
    data. 15 of 22 participants said that they would share data only in situations
    where the originating team retained the first rights to publish results from the
    data. This condition was by far the most frequently mentioned. As the participant
    below explains, researchers should only release their data when they are comfortable
    that the data are fully exploited in their own publications: I would feel robbed
    if I turned around and I looked at a paper and someone else published my work
    that I was planning on doing. Or even if someone did something that made what
    I was doing null or no longer interesting… I think what is more logical is that
    you collect data and you retain it for awhile until you get what you need out
    of it or at least until you are far enough along that someone can''t come and
    usurp you (2006 Interview 1 – Student – Science). Five of the 22 participants
    in Round 1 were concerned about receiving proper attribution for the work they
    had done to collect and to share their data. As the researcher below explained,
    a standard for systematically citing data is necessary to encourage data sharing,
    especially for repositories that mediate the interaction between the person using
    the data and the person or team sharing the data: You would have to have, I think,
    standards for citation and for encoding the authorship of that data even if it
    hadn''t necessarily been officially published. So I think some shared resources
    would be great, but I think people would be a little scared of dumping all their
    data into a repository, if there was a chance that someone would be able to just
    take that data and not cite it responsibly (2006 Interview 10 – Staff – Science).
    Round 2. In the second round of interviews, 13 conditions for sharing emerged,
    four of which were mentioned by at least four participants, as shown in Table
    2. Concerns for attribution dropped to two mentions. Competition for publishing
    rights remained in first place, but without the clear margin in Round 1. Five
    of the 21 participants stated that they would only share data on the condition
    that the originating team retained first rights to publish. The team or individual
    receiving the data was welcome to publish their own interpretations of those data
    thereafter. Four participants from Round 2 would share data only with someone
    they knew. These concerns intersected with those of first rights to publish. One
    participant who mentioned both of these conditions said, “If someone else called
    me that I didn''t know, I would definitely think about… giving over data, because
    it makes it less publishable in even what we do” (2009 Interview 7 – Faculty –
    Science). Another participant was willing to share data with almost anyone, but
    when she knows someone personally, she would invest extra effort to prepare and
    to share the data: I either refer people, if I don''t know them at all, I refer
    them to the [Domain Data Repository]. So I am not handing over a lot of data.
    If I had worked very closely with the person in the past, then I might go out
    of my way to actually prep the data that they want and put on some site where
    they can easily download it (2009 Interview 13 – Faculty – Science). In Round
    2, four of the 21 participants placed conditions on data sharing depending on
    their source of funding and the expectations of the funding agency. The following
    participant follows funding agency rules for when, whether, and how to release
    data for use by others: The Mexico data might not go into [X repository], because
    we have funding from the [private foundation] rather than from NSF. NSF would
    require that we deposit the data in [X repository]. But because we don''t have
    NSF funding, we have [foundation] funding, depositing data in [X repository] would
    be out of the goodness of our hearts (2009 Interview 15 – Faculty – Science).
    In cases such as these, the researcher may be willing to share if contacted by
    another researcher, but if the funding agency does not require data to be put
    into a repository, the data may be maintained locally and not made readily accessible
    to others. Four of 21 participants in Round 2 expressed concern about the amount
    of effort required to help someone else understand the data he or she might share.
    As this participant notes, he is more likely to share his data when he feels that
    the person receiving the data will not need much help or explanation to use them:
    That would be the main one, how much work would the sharing take. I would hope
    they would be collaborative, not take it and run. But I also would be, I also
    do know that some of the data sets are pretty complicated and the nuances of,
    it''s not… I think it will be quite easy when we have the stations, because here
    is the station, there is a picture of it in the river, and dwell time series.
    And that would be much more shareable than, for example, [technology project]
    data set were, first of all you got to explain to him what [technology project]
    is, and then you gotta, okay and this is where it is in the river and its right
    here at this bend and there was some plants over here, and there was a log over
    here (2009 Interview 21 – Faculty – Science). How do researchers share data with
    others outside their research group? Our interview questions did not ask specifically
    what methods were used to share data. Other questions such as, “Are you willing
    to share your data?, Under what conditions?, and Do you ever put your data in
    a repository?” elicited a number of methods by which they share, as shown in Table
    3. In Round 1, 21 of the 22 participants discussed methods they used to share
    data, for a total of 34 mentions. In Round 2, 15 of the 22 participants discussed
    methods for sharing data, also for a total of 34 mentions. Some participants mentioned
    more than one method that they had used to share data with others. Download: PPT
    PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Table 3. Methods for sharing
    data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067332.t003 We identified subtle but
    important differences between the use of repositories and registries to share
    and to obtain data. They are coded as separate categories for sharing and for
    sources of data. Repositories contain data, whether from observatories or contributed
    by individual investigators. Registries record the existence of a dataset and
    include a brief description and contact information, but do not ingest the data,
    per se. Below we discuss the three methods most commonly mentioned for sharing
    data, whose order varies between interview rounds: (1) fulfill personal requests,
    (2) post data to a website, and (3) submit data to a repository. Also reported
    in this section is a complementary case study of datasets posted to the CENS website.
    Round 1. In Round 1, the method of sharing mentioned by the most participants,
    15 of the 22, was to share data by posting them on a local website. Five participants
    specifically used the CENS website to host data. This method allows anyone interested
    to discover and to download data without mediation by the researcher, as the following
    participant indicates: We have now an almost continuous long-term data set of
    that information. And we just put it in spreadsheet format and post it to our
    Web site and people can download it. And we tell them how to attribute it to the
    people who collected it (2006 Interview 12 – Faculty –Science). The data to which
    the above quote refers are ornithology observations collected in the California
    National Reserve associated with CENS. All use of the Reserve is tracked and reported
    to the funding agency, including uses of data collected there. Any project that
    wishes to conduct research at the Reserve, including CENS participants, must complete
    an application form. That form requires researchers to agree to the data sharing
    policy that allows these data to be posted. In an effort to promote the release
    of CENS data, a website page was added to the CENS site in 2005 – concurrent with
    the Round 1 interviews – for members to post their datasets. Only seven datasets
    were posted, of varying types and formats. Our team was asked to evaluate the
    datasets and their usefulness. The seven datasets consisted of one simulation,
    three spreadsheets that contained time-series data in a comma-delimited format,
    source code for a tool, and one database where users could generate a query specifying
    sensors and time periods to create simple data visualizations or select the data
    for download in a CSV file. Each of the seven datasets contained a link for further
    information or access to a larger set of data. These links varied greatly in their
    destinations and in their stability. The most useful links were the three that
    led to a project landing page that described the data resources available for
    downloading and provided guidance for proper attribution. The other four links
    were of questionable value. One link led to a project description only, with no
    available data. Another link led to a set of data download instructions. However,
    that link pointed to a server that ceased to function within two weeks of posting
    the instructions. A third link led to a mislabeled page with a series of links
    that initiated download of various datasets, but without descriptions of those
    datasets. The fourth link initiated a download of a large data file with no warning.
    No other datasets were ever added to this page, and it eventually disappeared
    from the CENS website in 2009. In sum, we found that posting data or links to
    data, while well intentioned, did not necessarily result in making useful or usable
    data available. In Round 1, ten of the 22 interviewees indicated that they had
    been contacted with a request to share data from a CENS project. Nine of these
    participants subsequently fulfilled the request; the tenth said he intended to
    comply but had not yet done so. One participant responded to a data sharing request
    thusly: I can only think of one instance right now, but there''s another team,
    or another scientist doing [phenomenon] studies in New Mexico, who wants to see
    how she''s interpreting what she gets, and whether it''s equivalent in any way
    to how we''re interpreting what we get. So are we quantifying things in similar
    ways or not. So I''m trying to gather a subset of what we have, to send her, that
    she can then look at and compare with what she''s collecting. It''s like that
    quality control verification thing, to see if it matches (2006 Interview 21 –
    Staff –Science). The above data transfer required multiple actions. First, a data
    seeker identified the CENS participant as a potential data source. Second, the
    data seeker contacted the CENS scientific team. Third, the data seeker and CENS
    team member discussed what data existed, what use of the data was desired, and
    what data could identified and processed at CENS to be useful. Fourth, the CENS
    team member gathered and processed appropriate datasets. Fifth, these custom datasets
    were conveyed to the requestor. While participants often mentioned that public
    repositories are a good method of sharing, only four participants in Round 1 could
    name a repository that they would use, and only two had deposited their data into
    a public, discipline-specific repository. The data being deposited, in both cases,
    were genetic in nature. Genetics is an area where data deposit is expected and
    where public repositories exist, as illustrated by this quote: We do this with
    our DNA data, if we publish an article then if there is a repository, a national
    repository like there is for DNA data, Gen Bank, we actually will put that information
    into Gen Bank (2006 Interview 2 – Faculty – Science). Ten of the 22 participants
    were unaware of repositories that would accept data from their type of research.
    A typical response when asked if they deposited their data into a repository is:
    “Yeah. I mean, I know nothing about that. There''s data repositories?” (2006 Interview
    1 – Student – Science). Round 2. Participants from the Round 2 interviews also
    identified many different methods for data sharing. The same three methods were
    common, but repository deposit increased and posting data on websites decreased.
    In Round 2, twelve of 21 participants had been contacted by someone outside their
    research group with a request to ask for data, and all twelve said they fulfilled
    these requests. This was the most common form of data sharing in Round 2. One
    participant, when asked about being contacted to share data, explained that although
    he was generally willing to comply with requests, he tried to get a sense of who
    was asking, to gain more control over the release of his data: I generally try
    to give, I try to comply. I do weigh it a little bit because sometimes you can
    tell who, you know, can sort of handle it, and who is going to just be a lot of
    work, kind of keep coming back with questions. But I mean, we kind of have to
    give it to them. So I usually start off by sending them, you know, they can join
    our site now, give a quick little, a couple of lines like “Here''s the site …
    these are where other files are. And if you are looking for some of the results
    then something here (2009 Interview 21 – Faculty – Science). In Round 2, only
    six of 21 participants said they make their data available on a website, which
    is a steep drop from 15 of 22 in Round 1. A common reason for posting was to refer
    requestors to the online source rather than to address data requests individually:
    “In most cases the student ends up putting that on a website somewhere and sending
    people the link” (2009 Interview 16 – Faculty –Technology). By Round 2, ten of
    21 participants had deposited data into a public, discipline-specific repository
    as can be seen in table 4. This is a steep increase from Round 1, in which we
    found little awareness of repositories. As with the Round 1 data, one of the participants
    deposited data in genomic repositories, such as GenBank. One of the participants
    mentioned contributing data to a CENS-built repository, SensorBase. Two participants
    from ecology mentioned contributing invasive species data to a larger invasive
    species mapping initiative. Four of these participants were computer scientists
    who had shared code or system details in a repository. For example, the following
    participant would deposit his data into the repository Free(Code) then known as
    “Fresh Meat:” Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image
    Table 4. Repositories used by participants to share data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067332.t004
    …it will be locally hosted here at [my university] to Fresh Meat which is a big
    publication board for projects and just say hey, if you wanna look, check this
    out. …It''s a repository of release announcements software. And you can search
    for different types of software (2009 Interview 17 – Student – Technology). Two
    participants working with seismology data deposit their data into seismology''s
    community repository, IRIS, and one states, “We follow the national rules or the
    IRIS rules, where we make our data public in 2 years after the last instrument
    is out of the field” (2009 Interview 15 – Faculty –Science). This quote identifies
    several important factors for contributing data to a repository. First, a well-established
    disciplinary repository exists to accept their data. Second, the discipline has
    standards for describing and sharing data, which simplifies the process of depositing
    data. Finally, seismology has rules about what data must be deposited and when,
    which encourages (or requires) researchers to make their data available. These
    rules are subject to interpretation, of course. Researchers may delay removing
    the last piece of equipment from the field to gain additional time to analyze
    their data. Eleven Round 2 participants did not contribute any of their data to
    a public, discipline-specific repository. As in the Round 1 interviews, some participants
    remained unaware of any relevant repositories in which they could deposit their
    data. What data are used that were not generated by a researcher''s own group?
    Findings for the fourth and fifth research questions are based on responses to
    the interview question, “Do you use data you did not generate yourself?” Participants
    identified sources of data originating outside of their research groups and then
    described their uses of them. Although in Round 1 interviews, 14 participants
    said that they use data they themselves did not generate, only nine participants
    mentioned specific data sources. Only one participant had contacted a researcher
    outside their group for data. In Round 2, of the 17 participants who answered
    that they use others'' data, only 11 named specific data sources. Some participants
    named only one external data source, while others named two or three. Only three
    participants mentioned asking someone they did not know directly for data. Table
    5 presents the observatories and repositories named by respondents, and the data
    they obtained from those sources. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image
    TIFF original image Table 5. Where researchers find data for reuse and what data
    they use. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067332.t005 Round 1. In Round
    1, the 9 participants who mentioned using external data sources typically used
    types of data that included tidal charts, GIS data, or weather information; for
    example, “We''ve been tapping into the James Reserves'' weather sensor. They have
    that whole suite of meteorological instruments” (2006 Interview 10 – Staff – Science).
    The data most commonly mentioned were those collected by government observatories
    such as USGS, NASA, or the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System,
    or for-profit companies who collect data on a regular basis, as shown in Table
    5. These observatories collect and disseminate digital data. When asked about
    using data that he had not created himself, one participant said, “The only outside
    data that we routinely use is remote sensing and that comes from the USGS and
    from TerraServer” (2006 Interview 12 – Faculty – Science). Data from USGS are
    free to researchers from the United States; imagery from the TerraServer must
    be purchased. Observatories and repositories listed in Table 5 were the only external
    sources of data mentioned in Round 1 interviews. At that time (2005–06) none of
    those interviewed were reusing experimental, field, or laboratory data obtained
    from repositories or from other investigators. Round 2. In Round 2, the 11 participants
    who mentioned external data sources commonly used climate data, tidal charts,
    GIS data, photos, or other similar types of data that they are able to obtain
    online, like the following participant: “Most of the projects we''re doing right
    now incorporate some kind of external map data or GIS data” (2009 Interview 6
    – Faculty – Science). As in Round 1, most Round 2 participants obtained data from
    observatories like USGS, the California Data Exchange Center, or other regional
    sources such as these: I get some data from NASA. I get some data from local Web
    sites, the Southern California Ocean Observing System, (SCOOS), and also CeNCOOS,
    the Central and Northern California Coastal Observing System (2009 Interview 18
    – Staff – Technology). The Southern CA Coastal Ocean Observing System, the Central
    and Northern CA Ocean Observing System, and James Reserve are classed as observatories
    because they collect and disseminate consistent measurements and also as repositories
    because they accept individual investigator''s data from trusted sensors. Only
    two participants in Round 2, both from technology, used data from other types
    of repositories. One used the Fresh Meat repository to find software code, and
    the other used the Crawdad repository, explained below: So, there''s this website
    put together by some people at Dartmouth called Crawdad which has all these 802.11
    or WiFi measurements. So there''s like collection after collection after collection
    of data. I can just go and look at them and use it as they were (2009 Interview
    2 – Student – Technology). How are data from external sources used in research?
    When researchers do obtain data from external sources, most use them for background
    or context purposes. Data from external sources rarely are the focal point, or
    foreground of research. Round 1. The 14 participants (of 22) who said they use
    data they did not generate themselves typically do so for context or as baselines
    for their own research process. For example, one participant explained that before
    heading into the field, he refers to data about river conditions that are collected
    by the California Department of Water Resources and are distributed online through
    the California Digital Exchange Center: We use it every time when we''re going
    down to the river to see what the conditions are and what they''re projected to
    be, so we can know whether the banks are going to be under water or not, what
    the rough conditions are going to be (2006 Interview 13 and 2009 Interview 15
    – Faculty – Science). Another participant purchased data to establish the baseline
    for the team''s research. This team was developing a system to recognize specific
    bird sounds, so they needed recordings of these birds as training data for the
    system. We bought some recordings from Cornell from the same species that we''re
    trying to recognize. And you know, just to perform preliminary tests (2006 Interview
    16 – Staff –Science). Similarly, one participant uses data from the Heal the Bay
    project, “when I''m trying to figure things out.” Since the data are intended
    as context or background to the research, this participant explains that, “I haven''t
    used it in terms of my own analysis yet. The data are just as more of kind of
    a reference tool, I guess” (2006 Interview 1 – Student – Science). Although he
    does not use the data for analysis, he suggests that he might blend this type
    of data with his own in the future. Round 2. In Round 2, some participants used
    data for comparison, as described below: I would say we are using them for supplemental.
    I think the only time we are using it for comparison was when we did, where we
    were trying to use [our sensing system] to measure flow in the river and we did
    right next to the [USGS] gaging stations, we took a number there (2009 Interview
    21 – Faculty – Science). In this case, the team uses external data as a supplement
    to their own data. They compare the measurements because the data were available,
    not because that was the purpose of the study. Technology researchers also used
    data generated by others for comparison purposes. As in Round 1, the external
    data are used for background, rather than foreground, purposes: I''ve taken general
    published values for a lot of the drag coefficients and things like that. I haven''t
    actually done model testing on our vehicle, so I''m making some approximations
    there from other people''s testing and from the manufacturer of the vehicle (2009
    Interview 18 – Staff – Technology). The use of external data to test algorithms
    was a common theme in Round 2 interviews. This computer scientist obtains network
    traces from others to test his algorithms: I definitely have for past projects.
    I mean I used like standard network traces gathered by different organizations
    to analyze what that network traffic looks like (2009 Interview 17 –Student –
    Technology). Another participant tests algorithms with photos obtained from a
    University of California Natural Reserve (and a CENS partner) or from other webcams
    that provide free photos: “We used some data from the wired cameras that were
    deployed some years at James Reserve” (2009 Interview 12 –Faculty – Technology).
    This participant uses images of birds to evaluate the ability of their algorithms
    to identify phenomena of interest from a steady stream of images. Discussion Our
    two rounds of interviews with researchers, students, and staff in CENS, conducted
    in the fourth and eighth years of the Center, and complemented by ten years of
    ethnographic observation, reveal a rich picture of the interactions among types
    of data collected and shared, conditions for sharing data, methods by which data
    are shared, sources of external data, and uses of data from external sources.
    The discussion of results is organized by our five research questions. What motivates
    researchers to share their data? Sharing data clearly is viewed as good behavior
    in science and technology research. All members of the CENS community, from both
    rounds of interviews, expressed willingness to share their data. However, our
    two rounds of interviews and long-term ethnography suggest that stated “willingness
    to share” may bear little relationship to actual release of data. Only about half
    of our participants could identify a case where they had been asked for their
    data, and few could identify a case in which they had asked other investigators
    for their data. Thus, when it comes to sharing research data, actions speak louder
    than words. When asked in hypothetical terms whether they are willing to share
    their data, most researchers say they will share or that they do share [17], [24],
    [59], [56]. “Yes” is a predictable response for at least two reasons. One reason
    is that “willing to share” is now the pro-social answer. Funding agencies and
    journals are pressuring researchers to release their data. Few researchers are
    likely to make public pronouncements that they will not share their data in the
    face of this rising tide. The second reason is methodological. Social science
    research methodology discourages the use of hypothetical questions because the
    answers do not accurately predict what people actually will do if that situation
    occurs. More valid results are obtained by asking people about specific actions
    they have taken in specific situations, as we have done in this study. CENS researchers
    identified cases where they did share data, and also explained their motivations
    for doing so. Motivations include facilitating other researchers'' ability to
    pursue new lines of research, demonstrating the value of their own accomplishments,
    facilitating comparisons between methods and sites, and promulgating their technology
    as a basis for others'' research. These motivations for sharing data align with
    policy arguments for sharing data, such as the ability to allow researchers to
    ask new questions and to advance research and innovation [2], [10], [16]. However,
    no cases were mentioned for which data were requested to replicate a study, an
    oft-cited purpose for sharing data [2], [13], [14]. Foreground data – those associated
    with the main research questions of a study – are most likely to be released,
    as background data often are not considered “data.” This finding further confirms
    and contextualizes results we report elsewhere [77]. Sharing occurs most often
    upon individual request, rather than via a data repository. What conditions do
    researchers place on sharing their data? Although participants were willing, in
    principle, to share their data, they placed many conditions on data release. Conditions
    varied from researcher to researcher, regardless of research role or discipline.
    We identified 20 distinct conditions (Table 2), the most common of which was retaining
    first rights to publish results. This is an oft-stated concern in discussions
    of data sharing, and among the first to be identified [30], [27]. The concern
    for first rights to publish was more pronounced in the first round of interviews
    than the second, in which the conditions for sharing were more evenly distributed
    over 13 categories. Several explanations for this change are possible. One reason
    is simply that these samples are too small for a trend analysis. Another is that
    application scientists predominated in Round 1 (15 of 22 participants), and they
    appear to be more concerned about others claiming their findings than do technology
    researchers. Lastly, the sophistication of researchers regarding data sharing
    appeared to increase over the four years between interview rounds. By the time
    of the second round of interviews, embargoes and other mechanisms to assure that
    originating researchers maintain control over their data for reasonable periods
    of time were maturing. In distant second place for data release was the condition
    that shared data be attributed properly to the originating researchers. The lack
    of standards for how to cite data and the lack of professional practice in citing
    data were concerns. Standards for data citation are now being developed and deployed,
    but these practices are far from mature [19]. Closely following in third place
    were two conditions. One is that the requestors are known and trusted individuals.
    Data sharing is viewed as a peer-to-peer relationship to many in the CENS community.
    This result is reinforced by our finding that fulfilling personal requests is
    the most common form of data release. If a researcher knows and trusts another
    researcher, he or she is more willing to release data, and even to do more work
    in preparing the data for release. Trust must be mutual, as the person sharing
    wants to ensure that the data will not be misused, and the person reusing the
    data needs to trust the accuracy and validity of data acquired. The necessity
    of trusting others'' data, which in turn may depend on trust in others'' data
    collection methods, is another consistent finding of studies on data sharing and
    collaboration [59], [37], [30], [36]. The other condition in third place is that
    investigators follow funding agency rules for data release. Sometimes this condition
    is stated generally, that data collected with public funds should be available
    to the public. At other times, the condition was stated in the negative, in that
    investigators felt less obligated to release data if the research were supported
    by a private foundation that did not expect sharing. This was a condition that
    researchers placed on themselves rather than on recipients of their data. Notably,
    these interviews were conducted prior to the National Science Foundation requirement
    for data management plans. NSF requirements for data sharing long predate the
    data management plans, however. Thus the CENS researchers'' motivations to share
    are aligned with international public policy for data sharing [15]. How do researchers
    share data with others outside their research group? Among our most striking findings
    is the lack of use of repositories for sharing data. While CENS researchers do
    obtain data from repositories, as discussed further below, their use of repositories
    to deposit data ranks a distant third, after responding to individual requests
    and posting data on local websites. Scientific data are contributed to repositories
    in the disciplines where those repositories exist, which is primarily for seismology
    and genomics, and code repositories for computer science. The rest of CENS data
    fall into the “long tail” of science and technology, which is the diverse array
    of datasets that have no obvious home [50]. Few CENS scientists could name a repository
    that would be a likely home for their data, nor could we find obvious repository
    homes that they had overlooked. In both rounds of interviews, about half of the
    participants had been asked directly for data, and in both rounds they indicated
    that they fulfilled those requests. A close second in methods of sharing was to
    post data to a website, although this answer was much more common in Round 1 than
    in Round 2. Posting data on the website of the lab, university, or research center
    is sufficient to share them, in the eyes of many of our participants. This method
    enables researchers to respond to data sharing requests with a link to where datasets
    are posted. Thus website posting of data is often personal sharing. Making data
    available and making data usable are not equivalent, however. Our case study of
    the datasets posted on the CENS site suggests that reuse is often difficult. The
    CENS site hosted a mix of data types and formats, with minimal documentation and
    few links to associated publications or other contextual materials. That site
    was taken down after about four years. Those interviewed who posted data did not
    mention plans for maintaining access to their data. Website posting thus lacks
    sustainability and may also lack discoverability, as datasets are not well indexed
    by search engines. In the Tenopir et al. [24] study, only 36% of respondents agree
    that their data are easy to access, although “easy access” is undefined. We did
    not ask specifically about perceived ease of access, but it is clear that most
    CENS data are not readily discoverable or usable. CENS data most often are identified
    through publications or through contact with the investigators. CENS teams sometimes
    will document data further upon request of trusted colleagues. Seismology is a
    particularly interesting case of data release and sharing. Data from research
    conducted with U.S. federal funds must be deposited in IRIS – the community repository
    for seismic data – within two years after the last instrument is removed from
    the ground. In our small sample of seismologists, we found nuanced attention to
    these requirements. Removal of instruments may be delayed to gain more time for
    data analysis prior to release of the data. Seismic data resulting from private
    foundation funds may or may not be deposited in IRIS. Another important case is
    the contribution of software code to repositories. Software code and models are
    among the most important research products of CENS, particularly in the view of
    researchers in computer science and engineering. Here the motivations to deposit
    are somewhat different than for other forms of scientific data. If enough other
    researchers reuse a team''s software, then the software may become a common platform
    through network effects. The originating team gains community advantages by building
    related tools and by having other researchers build tools that interoperate with
    theirs. This is a common business strategy, and one more amenable to software
    than to sensor data. What data are used that were not generated by a researcher''s
    own group? CENS researchers do use data they do not collect themselves, mostly
    drawn from observatories and other public repositories. A total of 18 sources
    were mentioned, most of which were observatories, as shown in Table 4. These data
    were typically observations of phenomena or conditions in an area under study,
    such as weather patterns or wireless network calibrations. CENS technology researchers
    retrieve software from code repositories and also submit their own software to
    these repositories. A few participants mention asking other researchers directly
    for data. Given how little use CENS researchers make of other investigators''
    data, it is not surprising that they cannot readily imagine what uses others might
    make of their data, as Mayernik [35] found in another CENS study. No one mentioned
    seeking data from other researchers'' web sites. The apparent lack of reciprocity
    has two related explanations. One is that website posting is a convenient form
    of personal exchange. Rather than moving large files by email, ftp, Dropbox, or
    other means, researchers simply post datasets locally and send the requestor a
    link. The other explanation is that web posting of datasets is intended for exchange
    among collaborators and not for discovery. Our case study of datasets posted to
    the CENS websites confirms that data posted on local websites often are poorly
    documented and poorly maintained. Thus, they are difficult to discover, locate,
    or interpret. How are data from external sources used in research? CENS researchers
    use external data, principally drawn from observatories, as baselines, context,
    calibration, or other forms of background for their research. Similarly, when
    others have asked CENS researchers for data, the form of request suggests that
    data were sought for background purposes. External sources of software are used
    to test algorithms; this also appears largely to be a background activity. In
    sum, the majority of participants in our studies reported using some data or software
    they did not generate themselves, and all of these uses appear to serve background
    roles. No cases were mentioned, nor observed in the ethnographies, where data
    from external sources served foreground purposes for research. Possible explanations
    are that it is often more difficult to discover appropriate data, to trust data
    generated by others, or to use and interpret others'' data [37], [30], [36], yet
    data from public observatories are especially important and trusted sources. Because
    the data from these observatories are not the foreground of the study, researchers
    may not view them as “using the data,” and may not cite them as sources in their
    papers [18]. Thus, in sensor network research, data are not being mined and integrated
    to ask new questions, as the Fourth Paradigm would predict [10]. The Fourth Paradigm
    notion is more apt for “big data” than for the long tail of science, however.
    Conclusions Our ten years of studying science and technology research at the Center
    for Embedded Network Sensing – throughout the full life span of this National
    Science Foundation Science and Technology Center – yields a rich description of
    the data sharing and reuse practices of the researchers at CENS. We address the
    question posed in the article title, “if we share data, will anyone use them?”
    The answer varies by the characteristics of the data, the method of sharing, and
    the types of uses that might be made of the data. Data sharing in CENS, and presumably
    in other types of long tail science, is demand-driven rather than supply-driven.
    Data are not readily discoverable because investigators do not contribute them
    to repositories, accompanied by metadata and documentation. The effort to make
    data discoverable is difficult to justify, given the infrequency with which investigators
    are asked to release their data. The lack of demand and the lack of discoverability
    appear to be a chicken-and-egg problem, which we divide into three sets of implications:
    practices for releasing and sharing data, practices for using external sources
    of data, and requirements for scholarly infrastructure to support the long tail
    of science and technology research. Releasing and Sharing Research Data In the
    few domain areas of CENS where data release is required by funding agencies, principally
    seismology and genomics, investigators contribute their data to the appropriate
    repositories. Software code and models also are deposited in code repositories,
    following open source practices in these areas of computer science and engineering.
    For most scientific domain areas of CENS, however, suitable repositories do not
    exist to accept their data. This too is a chicken-and-egg problem endemic to the
    long tail of science and technology. Insufficient data are released to justify
    developing a repository, and insufficient demand exists to justify releasing and
    depositing data. As Mayernik [35] found, CENS investigators invest little effort
    in metadata creation because they cannot foresee who might use their data. In
    most areas of CENS, data sharing is a personal matter. Investigators share data
    with colleagues they know and trust, and when asked to do so. This finding reaffirms
    the gift culture of scholarship [27], [31]–[34]. Researchers will trade valuable
    intellectual goods with each other. Data are not treated as commodities to be
    traded on an open market, at least not in the CENS type of long-tail research.
    Most studies of data availability [8], [20], [21] focus on research data that
    are openly discoverable online. Our findings show that repository use and online
    searching are an incomplete view of data sharing. While CENS scientists do post
    some datasets on their website, they usually do so in support of personal requests.
    Posting a link to a spreadsheet, for example, is a form of data sharing. However,
    such links are not readily discoverable, nor are the contents of the files necessarily
    useful. It is the documentation and tacit knowledge gained through personal exchange
    that make these files valuable. We also find that conditions for sharing matter.
    Investigators want credit for their data, both in terms of first rights to publish
    their findings and in attribution for any reuse of their data. Another concern
    that echoes other findings is that data not be misused or misinterpreted [28],
    [82]–[89]. When exchange is personal, it is easier to maintain a degree of control
    over the uses of a team''s data. CENS researchers are understandably concerned
    about the amount of effort required to make their data useful to others. They
    are more willing to invest effort in documenting data for people they know and
    trust, again reinforcing the personal nature and gift culture of data sharing.
    Issues of interpretability of borrowed data are especially acute in the long tail
    of science and technology. Data handling practices range from artisanal to industrial
    [2], [27], [90]. Most CENS data handling is artisanal, as often occurs in the
    long tail. These data are labor-intensive to collect, such as hand-gathered samples
    of water and soil, and to process, such as reconciling sensor time stamps with
    the hand-sampling. Some CENS data handling, in areas such as seismology, is further
    along the continuum toward industrial data collection. Once placed in the field,
    seismic sensors can capture data automatically and reliably for months at a time.
    Even in seismology, however, sensors can require considerable tending. Our partners
    in seismology often placed experimental instruments in less-than-ideal conditions,
    subject to damage by weather, animals, or vandals, and out of reach of cell towers
    and satellites for automatic retrieval of data. Interpreting such data requires
    extensive contextual knowledge of how they were collected and processed. Reusing
    Research Data CENS researchers do reuse data collected by others. Their primary
    external sources of data are observatories, which collect consistent data on natural
    phenomena. Records of climate, flora, and fauna, all provide essential background
    data for comparison, calibration and “ground truthing” of CENS research [54].
    CENS researchers sometimes obtain data from other teams, and that also appears
    to be for background uses. Similarly, it appears that most data borrowed from
    CENS was sought for background uses such as verification of instruments and design
    of field research. CENS researchers appear to collect all of their own foreground
    data, whether physical samples or sensor readings. Foreground data are those that
    are the focus of research questions for a given study, whereas background data
    are those that provide context or calibration [77]. The same data can be foreground
    to one researcher and background to another, even on collaborating teams; the
    distinction is in the use of the data. Implications for scholarly infrastructure
    Despite great pressure to share research data, and consistent findings that researchers
    are willing in principle to share their data, relatively little research data
    are shared or reused. Is this a failure of practice, of policy, or of science?
    Is it a failure to comprehend the nature of scholarship? Or does the data sharing
    imperative simply address the wrong problem? Data sharing is perhaps better understood
    as the problem of making best use of research resources. Researchers produce large
    amounts of data, some of which may be useful to others. Making those data useful
    to others requires a substantial investment in documentation, and often in interpersonal
    negotiation, above and beyond the conduct of the research per se. It is not possible
    to justify making that level of investment in all data just in case someone, somewhere,
    at some future time, might wish to use them. The originating investigator bears
    the cost of data preparation. Other entities such as data repositories, universities,
    libraries, and funding agencies are likely to bear the cost of curating those
    data for sustainable access. Unknown – and often non-existent – reusers reap the
    benefits. This equation is not viable in economic or social terms. Thus, the better
    question to ask is which data are worth the investment for reuse? This is yet
    another chicken-and-egg problem, unfortunately. Data for which demand exists should
    be kept and curated. Demand arises only if data are discoverable, accessible,
    and usable. How can demand be built until a critical mass of useful data are available?
    Who should bear the burden of building that critical mass? The answers are many
    and complex, especially in the long tail of science and technology research. In
    the big sciences, the cost of instruments, data collection, and data curation
    can be amortized over large numbers of users. Projects such as the Sloan Digital
    Sky Survey have yielded manifold more papers, dissertations, and educational activities
    than the SDSS investigators alone could have been produced. Research on the human
    genome accelerated when gene sequences were aggregated in public repositories.
    These are big wins, with big data, at the industrial data production end of the
    spectrum. Some CENS scientists are producing orders of magnitude more data than
    was possible with artisanal methods alone. Others are asking new questions made
    possible by the greater granularity of data collection offered by sensor networks,
    and improved scientific validity made possible by combining sensor and hand sampling
    data. They have scaled up their data collection, but it will never be on a par
    with astronomy or genomics. Far fewer people will be interested in the root growth
    of mini-rhizomes, wind patterns in the San Jacinto mountains, or biological triggers
    of harmful algal blooms. Their science, however, may be equally significant. The
    findings of CENS scientists and technology researchers may offer critical insights
    to climate change and to modeling of biological phenomena, for example. These
    data should not be lost, but neither can we expect these researchers to double
    their investment in each project just to assure that their data might be useful
    to some unknown future user. This is the classic long tail problem. The technical,
    policy, and service infrastructure to support scholarly research must address
    the characteristics and needs of long tail science as well as the needs of big
    science [51]. Some of the infrastructure will serve all parties, such as high
    capacity data storage and transmission, workflow tools, and data visualization
    tools. Scientists in the long tail need better tools to collect and manage their
    data, especially at the early stages of data capture. Here the difficulty is to
    find tools that are adaptable to diverse local practices. What works for habitat
    ecology may not be useful to roboticists, but tools should not create silos of
    small communities. Attention to the social factors is essential. The value of
    private sharing between interested parties should be acknowledged, even celebrated.
    Data repositories fill important niches, but they are expensive to sustain and
    are not the only means to support data reuse and discovery. In prior work we have
    recommended the development of data registries which expose high-level metadata
    about datasets with a very low barrier to submission, but this approach has not
    been around long enough to provide concrete results [74]. Data creators deserve
    attribution and credit. Observatories and repositories also deserve credit for
    the roles they play. Our findings show that researchers may not cite those sources,
    thus usage is probably much greater than citation metrics suggest. As these mechanisms
    mature, and to the extent that they become embedded in reward systems, they will
    promote data reuse. The role of education should not be underestimated. While
    CENS researchers are on the leading edges of their respective fields, most lack
    expertise in data management or data curation. As the volume of data produced
    in the long tail of science accelerates, so will the demand for this expertise
    increase in graduate training. Despite our efforts to assist CENS in building
    a uniform strategy for data management over the decade-long life of the Center,
    we found more differences than commonalities in the needs of CENS teams [54],
    [55], [57], [77]. The wide range of data sharing and reuse practices identified
    in CENS suggests the richness and variance that is likely to exist in other slices
    of the long tail of science and technology research. These researchers are not
    alone in needing better tools, services, and skills to manage their data. Infrastructure
    to facilitate the exploitation of those data must respect and honor the breadth
    of their research activities. Data sharing is not an end in itself, but rather
    a means to leverage knowledge for the advancement of science and technology. Acknowledgments

    Get rights and content Highlights • LCIS irrigation tools achieve similar maize
    production with different water supply. • IRRISAT and W-Mod approaches are the
    best solution to save water. • Integration of W-Tens and IRRISAT approaches to
    irrigation support is reccomended. Abstract The efficient use of water in agriculture
    is one of the most significant agricultural challenges that modern technologies
    are helping to cope with through Irrigation Advisory Services (IAS) and Decision
    Support Systems (DSS). These last are considered powerful management instruments
    able to help farmers achieve the best efficiency in irrigation water use and to
    increase their incomes through obtaining the highest possible crop yield. In this
    context, within the project “An advanced low cost system for farm irrigation support
    – LCIS” (a joint Italian-Israeli R&D project), a fully transferable DSS for irrigation
    support, based on three different methodologies representative of the state of
    the art in irrigation management tools (W-Tens, in situ soil sensor; IRRISAT®,
    remote sensing; W-Mod, simulation modelling of water balance in the soil-plant
    and atmosphere system), has been developed. These three LCIS-DSS tools have been
    evaluated, in terms of their ability to support the farmer in irrigation management,
    in a real applicative case study on maize grown on Andosols in a private farm
    in southern Italy in the 2018 season. The evaluation considered the predictive
    performance of the tools and also the pros and cons of their application, due
    their different spatial scale applicability, costs and complexity of use. The
    results have shown that all three approaches are able to realise the maximum obtainable
    maize production. However, the method based on in situ soil sensor (W-Tens) supplied
    40% more water compared to the other two methods, whereas the IRRISAT® and W-Mod
    approaches represent the best solution in terms of irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUE). Moreover, IRRISAT® has the advantage of being able to work without soil
    spatial information, although unlike W-Tens both the latter methods need a high
    level of user expertise and consequently support of external service providers.
    Integration between different tools represents an opportunity for improved water
    use efficiency in agriculture (e.g., field sensors and remote sensing). Graphical

    for irrigationWater use efficiencyMaize 1. Introduction United Nations and Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), through the Sustainable
    Development Goal 2 (SDG2–Zero Hunger) and the Sustainable Crop Production Intensification
    (SCPI) Strategic Objective A of the FAO STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK 2010–2019 (FAO, 2009),
    have underlined the need for an increase in crop productivity and quality, based
    on scientific and sustainable practices able to improve resource use efficiency
    (water and nutrient), thereby also contributing to meeting the broader aims of
    food security, rural development and livelihood enhancement. In this context,
    irrigated agriculture represents the bulk of the demand for water, being the first
    sector affected by water shortage, resulting in a decreased capacity to maintain
    per capita food production (Bonfante et al., 2018). Therefore, the efficient use
    of water in agriculture is one of the most important agricultural challenges that
    modern technologies are helping to resolve (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). To realise
    this purpose, we have also to consider the impact of climate change (CC) on the
    agricultural sector due to changing temperature and rainfall patterns. While temperature
    directly affects crop growth, influencing the duration of the growing season or
    establishment of the different phenological stages (e.g. Cutforth et al., 2007;
    Hatfield et al., 2011; Southworth et al., 2000; Tingem et al., 2009), rainfall
    affects crop water availability and thereby crop yield production (Bonfante et
    al., 2015; Monaco et al., 2014). Irrigation Advisory Services (IAS) as well as
    Decision Support Systems (DSS) designed for irrigation support are powerful management
    instruments to achieve the best efficiency in irrigation water use. The DSS for
    irrigation can help the farmer during the decision process, increasing incomes
    through optimisation of water use and guaranteeing the best expected crop production
    in a specific growing season. These systems often are conceptually oriented to
    simulate or predict the crop water demand, giving a set of options, rather than
    solutions for irrigation management (the decision is always in the farmer''s hands).
    They are considered user friendly and able to function with minimum data input
    (lowering costs), and they minimise the need for professional consultancy. Some
    irrigation DSS assist in the planning (Kuo et al., 2000) and operational phases
    (Nixon et al., 2001). Others are more general in application, as with SIMIS (Mateos
    et al., 2002), a DSS for irrigation scheme management adopted by the FAO. Such
    systems, initially designed for desktop application, are now usually delivered
    via the web, as in the case of PlanteInfo (planteinfo.dk) launched in Denmark
    in 1996 (Jensen et al., 2000), WISE (Washington Irrigation Scheduling Expert)
    (Leib et al., 2001), IRRINET expert system developed by Rossi et al. (2004) and
    used in some regions of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), IrriSAT (Australia), ISS-ITAP
    (Albacete, Spain), BEWARE (Crete, Greece), Anglia river Basin (UK), IRRISA (France),
    and IRRISAT® (Campania Region, Italy). An important component for the successful
    application of a DSS is the graphical user interface, whose role is the communication
    between the system and the user (e.g., farmers), which is a key topic in the implementation
    of irrigation scheduling services (Terribile et al., 2015). The irrigation scheduling
    can be transferred to the user in various forms (e.g., irrigation turns or volumes)
    and with different delivery systems such as internet services or mobile phones
    (Belmonte et al., 1999; de Santa Olalla Sánchez, 1999). DSS for irrigation management
    have been implemented combining various approaches in terms of spatial and temporal
    scale, data type and data collection techniques (in situ soil sensor or remote
    sensing) and level of modelling complexity. Using variables related to climate
    is the most common approach to create crop water requirement models (Jensen et
    al., 1970; Smith and Raine, 2000; Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Root Zone Sensors
    (RZS) application is a widely used proximal sensing approach used to schedule
    irrigation (Pardossi et al., 2009; Zotarelli et al., 2009). Here, the farmer uses
    the data from the sensing point(s) in the root zone to determine the moment and
    duration of watering. Several devices (e.g., GP1, Delta-T Devices Ltd.) are commercially
    available to provide a ‘start-and-stop’ irrigation control based on two or more
    RZS buried in and underneath the root-zone. This set of sensors can monitor water
    movement into the deeper layers and minimise percolation losses. Abrisqueta et
    al. (2015) and Valdés-Vela et al. (2015) incorporate the volumetric soil water
    content, manually collected with a neutron probe, along with agro-meteorological
    data. This information is then fed into a fuzzy logic system to estimate the stem
    water potential. Other approaches in the literature also make use of machine learning
    techniques—such as principal component analysis, unsupervised clustering, and
    artificial neural network—to estimate the irrigation requirements in crops (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2016). Navarro-Hellín et al. (2016) proposed an automated decision support
    system based on machine learning techniques to manage the irrigation on a certain
    crop field, taking into account both climatic and soil variables provided by weather
    stations and soil sensors. The authors emphasise the importance of soil sensor
    information, the use of which accomplished a 22% reduction in weekly error compared
    to using only weather information. Remote sensing imagery from satellites, airplanes,
    UAVs or drones or similar systems has been recognized as an exceptional tool to
    produce spatial information for crop evapotranspiration (ET) assessment to be
    applied in standard procedures for estimating crop water requirements (e.g., the
    FAO-56 method, Allen et al., 1998). The ET estimation (e.g., big leaf area model
    and further development of the Penman-Monteith equation, Monteith and Unsworth,
    1990; Shuttleworth, 1991) is used to calculate the net irrigation water requirements,
    which is the water that must be supplied by irrigation to satisfy evapotranspiration,
    leaching and miscellaneous water supply that is not provided by water stored in
    the soil and precipitation that enters the soil (Jensen et al., 1990). The benefits
    of these methodologies with respect to most classical information sources (field
    measurements or general knowledge) are the possibility of covering large areas,
    enabling sampling at high spatial resolutions and zonation and/or integration
    over diverse areas (Calera et al., 2017). Recently, Li et al. (2018) developed
    a web-based irrigation decision support system with limited inputs (WIDSSLI) based
    on the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach to simulate the soil water balance
    using an online weather forecast. The timing and quantity of irrigation was obtained
    by comparing the field water availability simulated by the system and the lower
    limit of the soil moisture for irrigation. All the above approaches suffer from
    specific drawbacks. For example, irrigation models based only on climate parameters
    rely on an open loop structure. This means that the model is subject to stochastic
    events and it may not be able to correct the local perturbations that can occur
    when an unexpected weather phenomenon occurs (for instance irrigating the crop
    when it''s already raining) (Dutta et al., 2014; Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015).
    Machine learning techniques, unsupervised clustering and artificial neural networks
    do not specify the quantity of water needed (Dutta et al., 2014); they reduce
    the prediction to true or false, and/or they are based on open loop structures
    (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015; Jensen et al., 1970; Smith and Raine, 2000;
    Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004), only considering the weather information, and therefore
    are unable to correct deviations from their predictions. To be really operable,
    the methods based on remote sensing approaches need high temporal and spatial
    resolution data capable of monitoring the crop biophysical parameters related
    to crop as well as field information for model calibration (e.g., Leaf Area Index
    – LAI, derived from satellite images). In recent decades, the increase in free
    and open access imagery (e.g., European Space Agency; 10-m imagery acquired by
    Sentinel-2), the number of commercial sensors at very high spatial resolution
    (e.g., of 1–5 m, WorldView2, PLEIADES, DMC, DEIMOS and Venμs) and the availability
    of low cost drones with multispectral cameras have contributed to making these
    approaches more widespread and operational. The use of soil water status sensors
    is considered a key complement to modulating the water requirements of crops.
    Soil variables, such as soil water content or soil pressure head, are considered
    by many authors as a crucial part of scheduling tools for managing irrigation
    (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010; Soulis et al., 2015). On the other hand,
    field sensors (soil and weather) need continuous and proper maintenance. In this
    context, complex agro-hydrological simulation models of soil water balance could
    help to identify and schedule the best irrigation management for a specific crop
    (Coppola et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2016; Marsal and Stöckle, 2012; Thorp et
    al., 2017), but to date their use is relegated to scientific applications rather
    than real and operational conditions. Indeed, while some meteorological variables
    are representative of a large area and can be easily measured by a single sensor
    for a vast land area, soil and plant variables are characterised by high spatial
    variability. It follows that implementing appropriate management procedures is
    not always straightforward in practice, and each possible approach to irrigation
    support application presents pros and cons, due to different spatial scale applicability,
    costs and complexity of use. Moreover, simulation models need high data input
    (e.g., soil spatial variability, soil morphology and hydraulic properties) as
    well as a high level of user expertise for proper application. They are seldom
    developed on a platform able to integrate automatic data acquisition with a user
    friendly graphical display (Wang et al., 2017). It is clearly quite difficult
    to find a single approach able to cover all operational conditions (field dimension
    and soil spatial variability, farmer knowledge, farm infrastructure, etc.), and
    also the related costs for farmers, which might limit these systems'' use. The
    project “An advanced low cost system for farm irrigation support – LCIS” (a joint
    Italian-Israeli R&D project; “industrial track” funded by the Ministry of Foreign
    Affairs and International Cooperation General Directorate for Country Promotion
    - Italian Republic and Ministry of Science Technology and Space of the State of
    Israel), forms part of this scenario, with the development of a DSS for irrigation
    support based on the integration of the top tier knowledge of all scientific sectors
    related to agriculture systems'' performance. The LCIS-DSS put together proximal,
    remote sensing and simulation modelling approaches in a unique and fully transferable
    system able to work at different spatial scales at specific spots on field, farm
    and district under different pedo-climatic conditions, and with different crop
    management under different water/nutrient resources availability. The main idea
    is to use different approaches in order to create a flexible system dedicated
    to irrigation support, able to fit different field and operational conditions
    (soil spatial information, weather information, field data collection, etc.) and
    the farmer''s willingness to invest in sustainable agricultural management (each
    approach is characterised by different operational cost). The system consists
    of three main tools for irrigation support, which are based on three different
    methodologies representative of the state of the art in irrigation management
    tools: W-Tens (in situ soil sensor), IRRISAT® (remote sensing) and W-Mod (simulation
    modelling). Thus, the main objective of this paper is to report the results of
    the application of LCIS DSS tools in a real case study in maize and discuss their
    ability (pros and cons) to support the farmer in irrigation management. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Methodology applied and DSS The LCIS web-DSS framework consists
    of three principal tools oriented to support decisions of end-users (farmer or
    stakeholder) in handling water and crop/soil stress (Fig. 1): W-Tens, IRRISAT®
    and W-Mod. Download : Download high-res image (467KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. LCIS DSS irrigation tools. The system is implemented on a web-DSS
    platform designed to support users in irrigation management at field scale. The
    platform has a 3-tier structure, with the three components being: 1) the database,
    where the data from field sensors and remote sensing are stored and retrieved
    when required for data processing (e.g., daily climate data for the modelling
    application); 2) the server, that performs the data processing and controls the
    application functionalities; and 3) the graphical user interface, the component
    which displays the information coming from data processing and basically connects
    the users with the system. The GUI architecture consists basically of three modules,
    each of which is designed to function as an interface with the three different
    LCIS irrigation tools, as reported below: ✓ W-Tens: the tool is based on a field
    tensiometer monitoring system consisting of a set of soil water status sensors
    (tensiometers are placed at different soil depths) communicating with a software/hardware
    system for data acquisition, recording and sending to LCIS DSS server. This system
    consists of an Arduino device (https://www.arduino.cc/), a power pack, a solar
    panel and a GSM module. The system collects the soil water pressure heads at different
    soil depths in the field, with a time-step of 10 min. This information is used
    by the DSS to advise the farmer when to start and stop each irrigation event during
    the cropping season. The irrigation is scheduled when the soil water pressure
    head, at a specific depth or at combinations of different soil depths, reaches
    a crop specific threshold (ht) (e.g., −600 cm for maize, absolute value), in accordance
    with t threshold values reported in Van Dam et al. (1997). A pre-alert threshold
    is fixed by the user based on the soil characteristics (e.g., at −150 cm less
    than the threshold (hp = −450 cm)). This rule was applied to allow time for the
    farmer to organise the water supply and to realise the irrigation event to avoid
    plant water stress (i.e., if the farmer was not able to realise the irrigation
    in one or two days after the system alert). During the irrigation event, the system
    shows the tensiometer behaviour in real time and advises the farmer when to stop
    the water supply. Normally, the irrigation is stopped when the field capacity
    is reached (− 330 cm), but the system allows for specific rules (e.g., consider
    two different tensiometer values at two different depths) and values of pressure
    head. Moreover, a pre-alert threshold can be applied to give time for the farmer
    to stop the irrigation and save water resources. Then the W-Tens tool determines
    the moment and duration of watering. ✓ IRRISAT®: It is a satellite-based irrigation
    advisory service developed in Italy and has been operational since 2007 in the
    Campania region (Southern Italy). Irrigation needs are estimated using high resolution
    data from Earth Observation satellites (EO) and an FAO methodology for the calculation
    of crop water requirements. Data are aggregated at various spatial scales (from
    field or irrigation unit to district or river basin scale) and temporal scales
    (real time or historical series). The methodology for the estimation of crop water
    requirements adopted in IRRISAT® is the so-called “one-step” approach of FAO-Paper
    56 (Allen et al., 1998; D''Urso et al., 2013). The EO-direct approach for calculation
    of potential crop evapotranspiration (ETp) is applied by using the crop albedo
    (α) and LAI derived from processing of Sentinel-2A/B data, assuming fixed values
    for the stomatal resistance (sr ≈ 100 sm−1) and crop height (hc = 0.4 m), in the
    case of herbaceous crop. This approach exploits the consistent effort to estimate
    vegetation parameters (α, LAI) from EO in the VIS and NIR regions (Atzberger and
    Richter, 2012; Vuolo et al., 2015), allowing adaptation of the Penman–Monteith
    equation to be used directly with EO based LAI and α (D''Urso, 2010), which can
    be measured in the field, for providing an assessment of accuracy of the ET method
    and to derive the maximum irrigation water requirement (IWR) (Vanino et al., 2018).
    To do so the calculation of ETp requires standard meteorological data, LAI and
    surface α. The IWR is then calculated by considering the following simplified
    equation (Eq. (1)): (1) Runoff and percolation are negligible, considering the
    low amount of rainfall during the two growing seasons. Net precipitation (Pn)
    is calculated in the equation (Eq. 2) as a function of the actual rainfall (P),
    LAI and Fractional Cover (Fc) by using the semi-empirical model of interception
    proposed by Braden (1985). (2) where P is the actual rainfall in (mm d−1), and
    α in (mm d−1) is an empirical parameter representing the crop saturation per unit
    foliage area (~0.28 for most crops). Maps of canopy development (LAI, α and fractional
    vegetation cover (Fc), used for the calculation of the Pn) have been derived from
    high-resolution multispectral satellite images, delivered in near real time (<12 h)
    and processed by using in situ agro-meteorological variables (observed or modelled
    by Numerical Weather Prediction, i.e., COSMO-LEPS and BOLAM models). ✓ W-Mod:
    The W-Mod tool is based on the approaches reported in SWAP simulation model (Kroes
    et al., 2008) to solve the soil water balance. W-Mod is a physically based simulation
    model that assumes 1-D vertical flow processes and calculates the soil water flow
    through the Richards equation. It applied the soil water retention θ(h) and hydraulic
    conductivity K(θ) relationships proposed by Van Genuchten (1980). Unit gradient
    was set as the condition at the bottom boundary. The upper boundary conditions
    are described by the potential evapotranspiration ETp, irrigation and daily precipitation.
    Then the potential evapotranspiration is partitioned into potential evaporation,
    Ep, and potential transpiration, Tp, according to the LAI evolution, following
    the approach of Ritchie (1972). W-Mod simulates water uptake and actual transpiration
    (Ta) according to the model proposed by Feddes et al. (1978). Crop growth was
    simulated by means of a simple crop model using, according to the development
    stage, the LAI and rooting depth measured in the experimental field and the water
    uptake parameters from the literature (Feddes et al., 1978). The LAI development
    was estimated with a minimal amount of input data by means of a simple thermal
    model, based on the underlying physiological and phenological processes that govern
    these properties in plants. The empirical model used for LAI development was the
    “Log Normal Model” (Su et al., 2015) based principally on GDD (Growing Degree
    Day), maximum LAI reached by the plant and the GDD corresponding to the maximum
    LAI. More details of the procedure are reported in Su et al. (2015). The data
    applied for the empirical model in the present case study were derived from experimental
    trials conducted on maize (same FAO class, same cycle length) in Campania region.
    During the cropping season the data collected in field on LAI and root development
    were used in a data assimilation procedure in order to improve the crop development
    description applied in the model and then the irrigation amount predictions. The
    irrigation scheduling was realised using the ratio between actual and potential
    transpiration (Ta/Tp), which is fixed according to the type of crop and the farmer''s
    requirement (e.g., the farmer can decide to irrigate in deficit). In the following
    case study on maize the value was fixed at 0.9. 2.2. Case study on maize The experimental
    site was located in southern Italy in the Campania Felix area at the “Arca 2010”
    experimental farm (Acerra – NA; 40°57.952′ N, 14°25.808′ E, 27 m a.s.l). The climate
    is typically Mediterranean (cold winters and hot summers), with an average monthly
    rainfall of 47.1 mm (±26), and mean air temperature of 19.7 °C (±4.3) during the
    maize growing season (from April to September, data from Servizio Metereologico
    Aereonatica Militare, period 1971–2000). The soils were developed on volcanic
    material, with a loam texture and high chemical and physical fertility. 2.2.1.
    Field experiment Silage maize (FAO class 700, P1921 Pioneer hybrid) was sown in
    mid-April of 2018 (0.75 m × 0.17 m) and harvested in early August under ordinary
    tillage practices (plough up to 0.4 m) and fertilisation (three treatments with
    urea 65 kg ha−1 and two with ammonium sulphate 36 kg ha−1). The study was conducted
    in three plots: the first and second of about 1479 m2 (≈22 m × 68 m) and the third
    of about 1224 m2 (≈18 m × 68 m), in which the soil spatial variability was evaluated
    by a soil survey supported by a geophysical survey before the cropping season.
    A different irrigation management (timing and amount) was associated with each
    plot, based on the three different DSS tools: W-tens (P1), IRRISAT® (P2) and W-Mod
    (P3). The irrigation was realised by means of surface drip irrigation, with emitters
    spaced 0.10 m apart on the drip lines and a nominal flow rate varying from 25
    to 30 m3 h−1. Each plot was equipped in accordance with the irrigation tool applied,
    in particular P1 (W-Tens) with tensiometers and P3 (W-Mod) with TDR probes (detailed
    information is reported in the following paragraphs). During the experiments,
    the weather information was collected from the “Acerra” weather station of the
    Campania region meteorological network, located <100 m from the field experiment.
    Moreover, an additional weather station was placed in the experimental site (Watchdog
    450 data logger, Spectrum technologies Inc., Plainfield, IL, U.S.A.). Daily reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) was estimated according to the equation of Hargreaves
    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). The daily weather information collected during
    2018 was used as input in the W-Mod tool and IRRISAT®. Moreover, for weather forecasting,
    data have been derived from the BOLAM model, produced at the CNR-ISAC Institute
    in Bologna. BOLAM is a limited-area hydrostatic model which integrates the primitive
    equations with a parameterisation of the atmospheric convection. At present, it
    is being run with a grid size of 0.075 degrees (8.3 km) in rotated geographical
    coordinates, with 60 atmospheric levels and 7 soil levels. BOLAM runs start at
    00:00 UTC of each day with a 3-day forecast on the European-Mediterranean area.
    2.2.2. Crop and soil monitoring Crop measurements were realised in all the plots
    during the cropping season on a weekly or biweekly basis. The identification of
    crop sampling areas was realised with a new approach based on the analysis of
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images collected before the crop sampling.
    The procedure was based on normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) spatial
    variability analysis inside each plot, and classification of the areas representative
    of crop behaviour over the whole plot. The crop samples were dissected (root,
    stem, leaves and ears) and fresh and dry weights were measured (fresh matter oven
    at 50 °C until constant weight was reached). At physiological maturity, maize
    biomass production was measured over the whole plot. LAI was determined in field
    by means of LI-3100 AREA METER by LI-COR- INC., Lincoln, Nebraska (USA) and in
    lab on the plant sampled. Finally, the rooting depth was measured inside plot
    3 where the W-Mod tool was applied. Soil water status was monitored in two of
    the three plots (P1 and P3). In particular, in P1, where the W-Tens tool was applied,
    a tensiometers monitoring system was installed. The system consisted of four tensiometers
    (two tensiometers at −35 cm, one at −55 cm and one at −80 cm soil depth) connected
    to an Arduino system for real time monitoring. In P3 on the other hand, the soil
    water content (SWC) was measured by means of time domain reflectometry technique
    (TDR) (Tektronix, Model 1502C, USA), applying TDR three-wire probes 15 cm long,
    placed at five different depths from 0 to −0.8 m soil depth (0–01 m - vertical;
    −0.30, −0.45, −0.65 and − 0.8 m horizontal) with 2 replicates. The applied relationship
    between the water content and the dielectric constant was Topp''s formula (Topp
    et al., 1980). 2.2.3. Soil pedological survey A combined geophysical–pedological
    approach was used to study the soil spatial variability in the experimental field.
    This step is very relevant in order to avoid wrong conclusions being derived from
    comparison of the crop responses from different soil types (Bonfante et al., 2017).
    The soil survey (soil profiles, minipit and augering) was supported by non-invasive
    survey techniques such as geoelectrical soil mapping, which is considered a successful
    geophysical method that provides the spatial distribution of relevant agronomic
    information for precision farming (Lück et al., 2009). Methods based on electrical
    conductivity, which are strongly correlated to soil physical properties, which
    change in space, can represent spatial soil distribution. In this study the apparent
    soil electric conductivity (ECa) was obtained by electromagnetic induction (EMI)
    sensors, which are useful for identifying soil map units and soil properties related
    to clay content (Morari et al., 2009), soil depth (Saey et al., 2009), water content
    (Davies, 2004; Cousin et al., 2009; Lück et al., 2009; Tromp-van Meerveld and
    McDonnell, 2009)and water salinity (Doolittle et al., 2001). The instrument used
    for surface mapping of the electrical conductivity was the EM38-DD (Geonics Ltd.,
    Ontario, Canada) used in both vertical dipole mode (VDM) and horizontal dipole
    mode (HDM). The sensor was calibrated before the survey and maize cultivation
    in October 2017. The data were recorded on a GPS-equipped data logger with European
    geo-stationary Navigation Overlay Service and Wide Area Augmentation System correction
    (accuracy <3 m), which made it possible to georeference and map the measured property.
    Data post-processing was performed by means of ordinary kriging with 1 m resolution.
    The final result of the EM38-DD survey was therefore a regular grid of data points,
    including ECa for two depths (1.6 m for VDM and 0.76 m for HDM). These horizontal
    (HDM) and vertical (VDM) ECa maps were used as baseline data for a pedological
    survey based on soil augering and soil profile descriptions. Soil profiles were
    described according to IUSS (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2014). The soil texture was
    determined by a PARIO device (METER Group inc. USA) that automatically calculated
    the particle size distribution by Stokes'' law. Undisturbed soil samples (volume
    750 cm3) were collected from each soil horizon and their hydraulic properties
    were determined in the laboratory to simulate the hydrological conditions of the
    soil by means of an agro-hydrological model. Soil samples were saturated from
    the bottom and the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured by means of a
    permeameter (Reynolds et al., 2002; Wösten et al., 1999). After sealing the bottom
    surface to set a zero flux, measurements were taken during drying. At appropriate
    pre-set time intervals, the weight of the whole sample and the pressure head at
    three different depths were determined (the latter by means of tensiometers).
    An iterative procedure was applied for estimating the water retention curve from
    these measurements. The instantaneous profile method was used to determine the
    unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Moreover, some points at a lower water content
    of the dry branch of the water retention curve were determined by a dew-point
    system (WP4 dew-point potentiometer, Decagon Devices Inc.). Details of the tests
    and overall calculation procedures have been described by Basile et al. (2012)
    and Bonfante et al. (2010). 2.2.4. Data analysis and W-Mod model performance evaluation
    Statistical analyses of plot results were performed through the general linear
    model procedure of SAS/STAT. Duncan test at 0.05 probability level was used as
    mean separation test. All statistical analyses were carried out by using Graph
    Pad Prism v 6.01. Soil distribution map was drawn using Quantum GIS 2.18.15. In
    the field experiment, the W-Mod model performance was evaluated by means of the
    agreement between measured and estimated values of soil water content (SWC), expressed
    by using the indexes proposed by Loague and Green (1991): the root mean squared
    error (RMSE, minimum and optimum = 0), coefficient of residual mass (CRM, 0–1,
    optimum = 0, if positive indicates model underestimation), modelling efficiency
    (EF, positive or negative values, 1 being the upper limit, while negative infinity
    is the theoretical lower bound; EF values lower than 0 result from a worse fit
    than the average of measurements) (Greenwood et al., 1985) and the parameters
    of the linear regression equation between observed and predicted values (Addiscott
    and Whitmore, 1987). Finally, the irrigation DSS tool performance was evaluated
    by means of Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI), which is the ratio between the
    yield and irrigation water supplied during the growing season. (Purcell, 1999;
    Skewes, 1997). It does not include rainfall, and therefore is only useful for
    comparing nearby fields or farms in the same season. 2.2.5. Image processing In
    this study, n. 27 multispectral high-resolution images from Sentinel-2A and 2B
    were acquired. Sentinel is a mission of the European Space Agency, as part of
    the Copernicus program (http://www.copernicus.eu/) (Drusch et al., 2012). The
    multi spectral instrument on board Sentinel-2A/2B captures data at 10, 20 and
    60 m of spatial resolution over 13 spectral bands (see supplemental material)
    with a very high temporal resolution of five days at the equator. Individual Sentinel-2
    Level-1C granules (processed at Top-of-Atmosphere (ToA) reflectance) were acquired
    from Copernicus Open Access Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/), ortho-rectified
    in UTM/WGS84 (image tiles of 100 × 100 km2). The information recorded by the Sentinel-2
    system (orbit, altitude, and viewing directions of all detectors) allows excellent
    accuracy for the geolocation of all Sentinel-2 pixels. The overall geolocation
    accuracy is around 11–12 m, for about 97% of the cases, which is about the size
    of one Sentinel-2 pixel. The standard need for multi-temporal registration errors
    is 0.3 pixels, and the current performance showed that in >50% of cases the performance
    does not meet that requirement. By combining the Sentinel-2 satellite data with
    the weather data derived from the BOLAM model, maps of ETp and IWR forecasts were
    produced with a lead-time of up to 3 days. 3. Results 3.1. Soil survey results
    and plot definition An EMI survey was conducted at the field experiment in order
    to support and guide the pedological survey (in terms of soil variability). The
    ECa maps (VDM and HDM configuration; Fig. 2) showed a low range of variation (from
    13 to 21 mS m−1). The presence of a hot spot in the lower part of the field was
    immediately recognized, in the maps. This outlier was due to the presence of a
    small, buried well. Therefore, by removing this outlier from the map, the field
    variability was reduced even more. Then, four soil profiles and 10 augers were
    localised to include points showing major variability (Fig. 2). Download : Download

    soil profiles (triangles) and augers (circles); ECa map of vertical dipole mode
    (VDM) and horizontal dipole mode (HDM). On the right is the representative soil
    of the field experiment. The homogeneity of the ECa map was confirmed by the pedological
    survey showing a homogeneous soil. One soil type, representative of the whole
    field, was identified as Mollic Vitric Andosols (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2014).
    This last classification was in agreement with that reported by Di Gennaro et
    al. (1999) for the representative soil of the Nola plain area in which the experimental
    field lies. The physical characteristics of soil profiles are reported in Table
    1. The soil texture was sandy loam with an average value of clay content along
    the soil profile of 6.8% and an increase in sand content from the upper to lower
    soil horizon of about 70% (from 51 to 86%), concurrently with an increase in gravel
    from 7 to 42%. The saturated soil water content and “n” parameters were very close
    among the soil horizons, 0.43 (± 0.009) cm3 cm−3 and 1.26 (± 0.02) respectively.
    Maximum saturated hydraulic conductivity was 200 cm day−1 at the upper horizon
    (Ap1 soil horizon), and the minimum was 25 cm day−1 between 0.4 and 0.8 m (Bw
    soil horizon). Table 1. Physical properties of representative soil of field experiment.

    to identify the plots'' surface omitting the hot spot present in the bottom part
    of field (Fig. 2). 3.2. Maize case study results Fig. 3 presents the trends of
    principal weather information collected during the maize cropping season (April–August)
    in the year 2018. The data show a mean air temperature of 22.3 (±3.4) °C (abs.
    Max temp. 37.0 °C; abs. Min temp. 7 °C), a cumulative rainfall of 134 mm (max
    event of 31 mm) and a cumulative ET0 of 531 mm, with a hydrological deficit (Rainfall-ET0)
    of 397 mm. Download : Download high-res image (129KB) Download : Download full-size

    uncertainty as to the representativeness of the sampling area for crop growth
    analysis, UAV images collected during the growing season (until the achievement
    of the LAI peak) were analysed to identify areas inside each plot showing an average
    crop growth, where the samples of the vegetation were collected. Fig. 4 shows
    two images defining the crop sampling areas (pixels in red colour) for two different
    times of the growing season: (a) early June during the crop development before
    the flowering and (b) after flowering in early July. Download : Download high-res

    examples of identification of crop sampling areas (red) according to the NDVI
    spatial information obtained by UAV multispectral images at 05/06/2018 (a) and
    05/07/2018 (b) in each plot of field experiment (P1 - W-Tens; P2 - IRRISAT®; P3
    – W-Mod). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) The main advantages
    in the implementation of this approach in a field experiment are to reduce the
    number of plants to collect, to have punctual crop samples representative of crop
    behaviour at plot scale and to avoid the collection of outlier samples, due for
    example to the effect of localised plant disease or from irrigation applied. An
    example of this last scenario is evident in Fig. 4b, where the irrigation pipeline
    placed at the upper edge of the field produced an area not suitable for the crop
    sampling (the water pressure was probably higher in that section of the pipeline).
    Indeed, in the upper part, the NDVI was higher compared to the rest of field.
    About the crop growth, no significant differences in above ground biomass (AGB)
    were found among the three plots. The absence of differentiation between the plots
    is also clearly expressed by the LAI measurements realised in the three plots,
    as reported in Fig. 5. The peak LAI was 4.6 m2 m−2 (±0.47) for P1, 5.0 m2 m−2
    (±0.70) for P2 and 5.0 m2 m−2 (±0.50) for P3, with a maximum rooting depth of
    about 0.5 m (measured during the growing season in P3 for W-Mod application and
    verified at harvest in the other plots). Download : Download high-res image (71KB)

    The similar crop behaviour between the plots is in agreement with the expectations
    of the irrigation tools (W-Tens, IRRISAT® and W-Mod), for which maximum production
    represents the main goal. In our specific case, a similar crop yield (fresh) was
    realised with the amount of water supplied ranging from 2819 to 4699 m3 per hectare.
    The specific results for each tool are reported in the following paragraphs. 3.2.1.
    W-tens The irrigation timing and water volumes realised during the field experiment
    by applying the W-Tens tool are reported in Table 2. This irrigation tool defined
    nine irrigation events with an average water amount of 522 (±121) m3/ha per event
    and crop yield of 57.3 t ha−1. Table 2. Irrigation and maize yield results of

    the irrigation events were performed applying the hstart and hstop values for
    maize of −330 cm (field capacity) and − 600 cm (start of crop water stress) respectively,
    with an ht of 150 cm. Thus, the W-Tens tool warned the farmer each time the tensiometer
    value at −0.35 m reached the pressure head value of −450 cm. This rule was applied
    to give time for the farmer to organise the water supply and to realise the irrigation
    event. In Fig. 6, two irrigation events demonstrate the achievement of hstop (−600 cm)
    before the irrigation event on both dates at −0.35 m of soil depth. Download :

    −0.35, −0.55 and − 0.80 m during two irrigation events (DOY 155 and 184). From
    early June (DOY 155 to 162) to early July (DOY 185 to 189), the value of the pressure
    head at −0.55 m was, on average, lower after one month, reaching the peak of −600 cm.
    This behaviour was strictly dependent on the increase of temperature and the evapotranspiration
    demand, crop growth (the maximum LAI was reached at the end of June) and root
    depth which reached a length of −0.5 m (data collected in field). 3.2.2. IRRISAT®
    The irrigation timing and water volumes realised during the field experiment by
    applying the IRRISAT® tool are reported in Table 2. This irrigation tool defined
    eight irrigation events with an average water amount of 313 (±199) m3ha−1 per
    event and a crop yield of 58.6 t ha−1. The application of the IRRISAT® procedure
    is reported in the supplemental material. Fig. 7 reports the trends of daily and
    cumulated IWR estimated during the maize cropping season in plot 2 and applied

    farm activities, corresponding in part to the date realised by W-Tens. 3.2.3.
    W-Mod The irrigation timing and water volumes realised during the field experiment
    by applying the W-Mod tool are reported in Table 2. This irrigation tool defined
    six irrigation events with an average water amount of 490 (±154) m3 ha−1 per event
    and the highest crop yield at 60.2 t ha−1. For application of the tool, the soil
    physical properties (Table 1) were calibrated by modifying the soil water content
    at saturation through trial and error procedure realised on the first four TDR
    measurements (differences of Ɵ0 from lab to field of 10%). The accuracy of the
    simulation, applied to predict the irrigation scheduling, was evaluated by comparing
    the measured and estimated SWC values at five soil depths (0–0.1 m; −0.3 m; −0.45 m;
    −0.65 m; −0.80 m) (Fig. 8, Table 3). The statistical indexes applied have shown
    good agreement between measured and estimated SWC, with an average RMSE value
    of 0.02 ± 0.005 m3 m−3, EF of 0.76 ± 0.28, CRM of −0.03 ± 0.02 m3 m−3 and r of
    0.88 ± 0.06. These results confirm the accuracy of the simulation and the irrigation
    amount defined, with an average RMSE of 0.012. Download : Download high-res image

    case study of maize, a comparative analysis of each LCIS DSS tool for supporting
    irrigation has been carried out by taking into account i) limiting factors towards
    the operational support for improving irrigation efficiency, ii) implementation
    costs vs. production revenues and iii) current and future environmental issues
    (e.g., climate change, sustainable agriculture, SDG goals). 4.1. W-Tens The W-Tens
    tool has its strengths and weaknesses (Table 4), the most important being as follows:
    - Duration of watering: As evidenced by experimental field results, this system
    supplied 40% more water than the other methods, without any increase in crop production.
    The lack of efficiency in preserving water resources might be mainly attributable
    to the absence of the identification of soil specific pre-alert threshold for
    irrigation termination (hstop + ht). In our case study, although we tried to take
    into account the wetting front velocity and the time needed by the farmer to switch
    off the irrigation system, the used ht proved to be not entirely efficient. This
    was because its nature is too dependent on the timing of field data acquisition
    and farmer reactivity to the system warning. The first factor was strictly influenced
    by the soil hydraulic characteristics, and in our case study the fixed value (10 min)
    was not able to optimise the irrigation management. Farmer reactivity can be overcome
    only through an automated irrigation system. The result of the combination of
    all factors is an excess of irrigation time and water applied. We have estimated
    about 20–30 min per irrigation event, with an excess amount of water of about
    15 m3, equal to 19% of the water supplied. The best way to optimise the water
    use with W-Tens is to use an automated irrigation system to switch on and off
    the pump directly through the system DSS. - Tensiometer management: Tensiometers
    are quite fragile and must be operated carefully in order to avoid the formation
    of air bubbles in the shaft, which may result in temperature-dependent errors.
    Moreover, they must be protected from frost and need regular maintenance, for
    instance refilling the water in the tube and avoiding contamination by algae.
    They require more maintenance, and in very dry soils they fail. Suitable hand-held
    vacuum pumps are generally supplied by tensiometer manufacturers to recharge tensiometers
    in situ. - W-Tens measurement accuracy and its dependence on other environmental
    variables: This is a relevant strength of the W-Tens tool, because the accuracy
    of tensiometer measurements is not influenced by temperature or soil osmotic potential,
    because the salts move freely through the ceramic cup. Generally, tensiometers
    operate between 0 and 80 °C. Below 0 °C, it is necessary to take precautions due
    to ice formation, although some tensiometers can work even at −10 °C. Application
    of W-Tens does not require environmental information such as weather information
    for its operability, and no medium-specific calibration is needed. - Spatial scale:
    The efficiency of the W-Tens tool is strongly influenced by soil spatial heterogeneity,
    because it is based on punctual measurements that might be not be representative
    of all soil-plant patterns on the irrigated surface. To close this gap, the irrigated
    surface has to be divided into different sectors according to the soil spatial
    variability and managed separately, resulting in an increase in implementation
    costs for farmers (one point of irrigation control costs between 400 and 600€).

    and weather information Soil complexity might be a limitation (e.g. extreme soil
    physical characteristics; presence of gravel in the soil horizons) It takes into
    account the soil information and its spatial variability to realise the soil water
    balance and determine the irrigation event. Morever, it can give information on
    the crop water stress and manage the irrigation in stress Required Required with
    forecast Small, mid and big farm where the detail of soil spatial information
    is high Soil spatial information acquisition and provision is becoming increasingly
    important among farms that aim at environmental sustainability. The use of drones
    or a new app for user-friendly field data collection is also useful for the model''s
    application a The system itself estimates the LAI development with a thermal model
    (LAI-Mod), but field measurements are able to improve the capability of tool to
    improve the water use efficiency. b A preliminary soil survey to define the soil
    map of the farm allows identification of the different irrigation sectors where
    the tensiometer systems should be placed in field to improve the use of water.
    4.2. W-Mod The use of the W-Mod tool also has its strengths and weaknesses (Table
    4), and the most important among them are the following: - The estimation of soil
    water balance: This aspect is the main strength of this tool. Indeed, compared
    to the other two methods, it was able to describe the soil water balance and identify
    the irrigation events (timing and amount) and also provide information on the
    accumulated or expected crop water stress. This aspect is powerful for the application
    of this tool in the agricultural sector, in which water stress management is important
    for the yield quality (e.g., viticulture) and for farmer incomes, as well as when
    a fixed seasonal amount of water must be managed for each specific crop (e.g.,
    consortium constriction). - Spatial scale application: The W-Mod tool does not
    have spatial scale restrictions. The limitations can be due to the quality of
    input information (weather and soil) which might not account for the spatial and
    temporal variability of the application area (different fields and irrigation
    sectors), creating spatial error in the model''s application. In general, it is
    easier to apply the W-Mod tool in a small field, where the farmer can improve
    the model''s performance using a low-cost weather station and add punctual crop
    information from field (e.g., crop growth). However, when the model is correctly
    spatially parameterised, then it is able to take into account the soil and weather
    spatial variability. Its application on a large scale can be done by integration
    with remote sensing (UAV for mid-scale and satellite for large-scale) information
    on spatial crop behaviour (e.g., LAI) to improve the ability to increase water
    use efficiency, thereby also conserving water resources. At the same time, it
    is important to emphasise that soil spatial information (detailed soil map) is
    an additional cost for the farmer. The measurements of soil physical properties
    for the simulation model parametrisation and application, as well as the know-how
    to apply it, represent a major cost for the farmer, which is necessary when they
    want to move towards precision farming. However, the soil physical parameters
    for simulations can be determined by lab measurements or estimated by means of
    PTF (pedotransfer functions); but in any case the applied soil physical parameters
    need to be calibrated by the user, representing a de facto requirement for the
    best W-Mod tool use and thus probably a cost for the user (e.g., external expertise).
    Once the soil physical properties have been calibrated, they can be used for irrigation
    management for subsequent cultivations with some precautions (change in soil tillage
    practices, as well as the organic carbon in soil, can strongly affect the soil
    hydraulic properties of first horizon “Ap”, and a re-calibration of the simulation
    model might be needed). - Use of information from field: Use of field information
    on crop (LAI) and root development during the cropping season is important to
    improve the model''s performance. W-Mod has a thermal model for LAI crop development
    simulation (LAI-mod) as well as the simulation of potential root development.
    A difference in terms of water use has been evaluated by applying, in the simulation
    run, the crop growth data collected from the field (LAI and rooting depth data
    assimilation) and estimated by LAI-mod. The obtained results showed an average
    increase of water use of 252 ± 112 m3ha−1, with the maximum increase being 340
    m3ha−1, when LAI-mod and potential root development were used, compared to the
    application of data assimilated by field. The minimum difference was achieved
    when potential root development was associated with LAI development derived from
    field data (125 m3ha−1). Thus, the requirement of field data collection represents
    a cost for the farmer (Table 4). In this last scenario, some new smartphone App
    may help lower costs (e.g., LAI by smartphone, Confalonieri et al., 2013). 4.3.
    IRRISAT® The use of the IRRISAT® tool too has strengths and weaknesses (Table
    4), of which the most important are the following: - Estimation of IWR: the main
    concept underlying IRRISAT® is that the irrigation water requirement is computed
    considering the actual crop development as described by the relevant parameters,
    i.e., surface albedo and LAI, which result from the actual soil conditions and
    local farming practices, including fertilisation. This method implicitly takes
    into account all the factors affecting crop growth, and it optimises the calculation
    of water needs. Uncertainty in LAI estimation can lead to slightly non-linear
    responses in ETp when the Penmann-Monteith method is applied. In general, a direct
    relation between LAI and ETp is reported in the literature. In particular, an
    LAI variation of ±30% corresponds to an ETp variation of about ±13% (McKenney
    and Rosenberg, 1993). Moreover, for wheat crops Martin et al. (1989) reported
    that if LAI is increased by 15% with no other changes (e.g., climatic and plant
    parameters in the formula), the ET increases by 5% (for high or low flux days:
    630 Wm−2 and 342 Wm−2), whereas if the climatic parameters involved in the Penman-Monteith
    equation also change, the ETp values can vary between −4% and + 19%. The changes
    in LAI have a direct effect on ETp and as a consequence on estimated IWR. Obviously,
    the magnitude of the effect is strictly related to the specific climatic variables
    involved in the ETp calculation. Although the estimation of LAI from Earth Observation
    (EO) suffers from saturation effects for LAI > 4, the value of the canopy resistance
    in the Penman-Monteith equation under standard conditions of water availability
    can also be considered as constant for LAI > 4 (Allen et al., 1998; Gardiol et
    al., 2003; Kelliher et al., 1995; Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). - Spatial scale
    application: The IRRISAT® tool does not have spatial scale restrictions in its
    use. Multiscalarity is a strength point of this tool. Indeed, it can cover different
    spatial scales corresponding to the details of the remote sensing spatial information.
    Currently, use of this tool at consortium scale represents the best solution available;
    however, for a small field, its proper use might require high resolution satellite
    images (not free) and a consequent increase in cost for its application. - Ease
    of use and application costs: The development of the IRRISAT® tool and the elaboration
    of the information layers needed requires high expertise in remote sensing, which
    generally is not present on farm, so its application can be done only by means
    of an external service (www.ariespace.com). Use of the IRRISAT® approach is very
    easy for farmers. They do not need to buy or install any device, because the information
    is delivered through common communication channels (Internet, smartphones) by
    external service providers. The tool reports the irrigation volume to be applied,
    leaving to the farmer the decision about the exact schedule, according to their
    current practices. IRRISAT® does not only support irrigation management, but it
    also provides data and images about the crop growth uniformity, in line with the
    requirements of precision agriculture. Its usage is very intuitive and the user
    interface can be easily adapted to farmers'' utilisation requirements. In particular,
    it can be used in a bi-directional way, i.e., the farmer can send information
    about the exact schedule adopted and pictures about peculiar issues observed in
    the field, such as weeds and diseases. However, IRRISAT® is not able to detect
    water stress conditions at the early stage, but only its effects on crop growth,
    that is when the crop damage has already occurred. Otherwise, tensiometer readings
    are able to monitor directly the occurrence of water stress; soil water balance
    models can also identify this condition, provided that actual irrigation data
    are timely and included in the simulation runs. Finally, the costs of service
    can be supported by public bodies, as in the case of the Campania region, which
    gives free irrigation support to local farmers with the aim of conserving the
    limited water resources. 4.4. General considerations, a final synthesis Typically,
    the farmers decide when the irrigation event should be done, if they are supported
    in different ways by tools. The final choice is theirs, and it is not easy to
    convince them to operate in an alternative way. However, if farmers have full
    control of their fields, in terms of plant status and weather information, this
    rule may be considered useful because it represents real control on the field,
    the ability to make decisions on the basis of local evidence and personal knowledge
    oriented towards reducing the crop production risks. A proactive presence of the
    farmer in the operational decisions might help the DSS system performance. For
    example, in our case study the farmer decided based on the farm''s internal needs
    to anticipate a scheduled irrigation (defined by the model) of Sunday to Friday.
    This simple change led to an irrigation event one day before a rainfall event,
    with an apparently incorrect use of water for irrigation. However, when the rainfall
    event was introduced in the W-Mod, the simulation accounted for precipitation
    until the end of season, influencing the soil water balance and the dates of subsequent
    irrigations. Indeed, if a new simulation over the whole cropping season was performed,
    considering all rainfall events, the simulated plant transpiration was very close
    to that realised during the experimental case study (1 mm difference at harvest
    with field experiment result), but with an increase in irrigation amount and a
    shifting of irrigation dates. Moreover, it is important to stress that some tools
    can be used in an integrated way. The point we are marking is not that in the
    case of the experimental field reported herein there have been advantages from
    the strengths of both models. The point is the integration of W-Ten with IRRISAT®
    which can work together, where the first is able to give in-field information
    on when irrigation is needed to avoid plant damage due to water stress, and the
    second can define the irrigation water needs. At the same time, integration between
    W-MOD and satellite image analysis can also be done, using this last method as
    model data input (data assimilation) to improve W-Mod results. 5. Conclusion Implementing
    appropriate irrigation management procedures is not always straightforward in
    practice, and each possible approach presents pros and cons in its application,
    due to the nature of the methodology. A DSS oriented towards realising a real
    and profitable irrigation support must integrate different methodologies to achieve
    the best solution for the farmer, which fits different application scenarios (environmental
    conditions, soil data availability, farmer know-how, farmer''s spending capacity,
    farm dimension, etc.). When three different approaches to support irrigation water
    supply (W-Tens, IRRISAT® and W-Mod) were applied in a real case study on maize
    cultivation, the following conclusions were reached: The compared approaches were
    able to realise the maximum maize production for that cropping season, but with
    different amounts of water applied. ✓ The method based on in situ soil sensor
    (W-Tens) supplied 40% more water compared to the other two methods. The excess
    of water applied can easily be reduced by means of automated irrigation events.
    ✓ The IRRISAT® approach represents, along with W-Mod, the best solution in terms
    of IWUE, with the advantage that it doesn''t need information on soil spatial
    information for its application. ✓ W-Mod integrated with field data assimilation
    on crop development (LAI information temporally or spatially, e.g., by UAV images)
    can represent a great opportunity for irrigation support at different scales.
    A current limit to an advantageous application of this method is the information
    required: detailed soil spatial information, daily weather data monitoring and
    forecasting and last but not least the necessity of irrigation field sectors being
    organised in accordance with soil spatial variability. ✓ Each method requires
    a different level of user expertise. The only approach really “user friendly”
    for the farmer is W-Tens, whereas both IRRISAT® and W-Mod require an external
    service. ✓ Finally, an integration between tools based on field sensors and remote
    sensing as well as the use of W-Mod with data assimilation from satellite or UAV
    image analysis might represent a significant future opportunity to improve water
    use efficiency in precision agriculture. Acknowledgements We acknowledge Mrs.

    Comments ABSTRACT Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be a valuable decision-support
    tool for farmers. This motivated our deployment of a WSN system to support rain-fed
    agriculture in India. We defined promising use cases and resolved technical challenges
    throughout a two-year deployment of our COMMON-Sense Net system, which provided
    farmers with environment data. However, the direct use of this technology in the
    field did not foster the expected participation of the population. This made it
    difficult to develop the intended decision-support system. Based on this experience,
    we take the following position in this paper: currently, the deployment of WSN
    technology in developing regions is more likely to be effective if it targets
    scientists and technical personnel as users, rather than the farmers themselves.
    We base this claim on the lessons learned from the COMMON-Sense system deployment
    and the results of an extensive user experiment with agriculture scientists, which
    we describe in this paper. References H. Diwikara and M. Chandrakanth, "Beating

    are an important input for assessing potential benefits of algae cultivation on
    the future of innovative agriculture. The Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership
    was established with the goal of investigating open pond algae cultivation across
    different geographic, climatic, seasonal, and operational conditions while setting
    the benchmark for quality data collection, analysis, and dissemination. Identical
    algae cultivation systems and data analysis methodologies were established at
    testbed sites across the continental United States and Hawaii. Within this framework,
    the Unified Field Studies were designed for algae cultivation during all 4 seasons
    across the testbed network. With increasingly diverse algae research and development,
    and field deployment strategies, the challenges associated with data collection,
    quality, and dissemination increase dramatically. The dataset presented here is
    the complete, curated, climatic, cultivation, harvest, and biomass composition
    data for each season at each site. These data enable others to do in-depth cultivation,
    harvest, techno-economic, life cycle, resource, and predictive growth modelling
    analysis, as well as development of crop protection strategies throughout the
    algae cultivation industry. Design Type(s) factorial design • strain comparison

    Article Open access 20 January 2022 Background & Summary Even though algae are
    at the nexus of the next generation of agricultural innovations for food and fuel
    production, significant challenges associated with consistent year-round productivity
    demonstrations at scale remain. Perhaps one of the largest challenges is associated
    with the lack of a consistent framework for standardized data collection and analysis
    such that diverse cultivation or pond operational strategies, pond or equipment
    design, or other associated variables can be compared on a level playing field.
    Although there are a wide variety of algal cultivation data available in the scientific
    literature, for example, the Aquatic Species Program closeout report1 reviewed
    algal cultivation research sponsored by the US Department of Energy, none of the
    literature describes data from the same species grown during the same season at
    different geographic or climatic conditions or even collected data for a consistent
    set of metrics. Even though several reports have called for increased research
    and development of algae technology at scale to address the data gap between assumed
    and actual experimental values of outdoor pond performance and algal productivity
    to reduce risk and uncertainty in large-scale deployment, few coordinated projects
    have been funded2–5. Thus the goal of the Algae Testbed Public Private Partnership
    (ATP3) was to provide year-over-year, well-characterized, algal cultivation datasets
    to the research, development, and commercialization community to help improve
    the understanding of algae biomass production in terms of geographic and seasonal
    variation in cultivation, harvest, and productivity to allow for improved techno-economic
    analysis (TEA), life cycle analysis (LCA), resource assessment (RA), predictive
    growth modelling, and crop protection strategies for algae cultivation6. With
    the successful establishment of the ATP3 algae culturing testbed network, the
    objective of the Unified Field Studies (UFS) was to address this knowledge gap
    and generate a robust dataset of algae growth metrics in outdoor open ponds with
    a focus on the comparison of algae biomass productivity in identical ponds under
    different seasonal, climatic, and operational conditions at 1000 L scale by controlling
    the non-geographical related variables of inoculum production, biomass production
    systems, processes and protocols, system scale, and algae strain. We report here
    the datasets from the setup and standardization of the testbed network and the
    subsequent harvest operations (UFS) of identical algae growth systems across 5
    geographic regions over the course of 19 months. This is the first ever demonstration
    of a multi-site coordinated algae productivity experimental design that required
    tight management of operational parameters for the cultivation studies, as well
    as a highly flexible and dynamic environment for data collection that allowed
    rapid adaptation to user (algae cultivation scientists) feedback. The goal of
    this paper is to present the complete datasets (Table 1 (available online only))
    as well as the cultivation and analytical data collection and curation methods
    to establish a standardized data collection and curation benchmark for future
    algae cultivation. By establishing this benchmark, we intend to contribute to
    the implementation of a set of standardized data metrics for understanding the
    critical aspects of algae cultivation. A common set of standardized data will
    facilitate further analysis, discussion, and optimization of algae cultivation
    as a productive and widespread agricultural crop. Table 1 Listing of complete
    UFS experimental protocols and data sets. Full size table Methods We recently
    published a detailed description of the ATP3 framework which covers the experimental
    and operational alignment for data collection5,6. A strong emphasis on the initial
    validation phase of the project was to ensure that laboratories at different sites
    were able to carry out the implementation of analytical procedures for data collection
    in a consistent manner6,7. Here, we briefly summarize the essential features of
    the experiments that produced the data from the UFS, including the location of
    the sites, the general design of the studies, the equipment used, the algae strains
    tested, and the typical pond operations during these studies. Testbed sites Five
    testbed sites were originally chosen for their differing climatic and geographic
    locations; Southwest, desert (AzCATI, Arizona State University (ASU), Mesa, AZ);
    Western, coastal (California Polytechnic State University (CP), San Luis Obispo,
    CA); Southeast, inland (Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), Atlanta, GA); Pacific,
    tropical (Cellana LLC (CELL), Kona, HI), and indoor greenhouse (Touchstone Research
    Labs, TRL); (Fig. 1a–f). Note that TRL was replaced in the ATP3 consortium by
    Southeast, coastal region (Florida Algae (FA), Vero Beach, FL) after the UFS-1.

    (f) CELL: 19.734646, −156.053119. Full size image Experimental Design The ponds
    were installed and a baselining growth experiment without harvesting operations
    was performed during October to December 20136. With the successful build-out
    and initial operation of the testbed ponds, the UFS were initiated to determine
    algae biomass production at each of the geographically diverse sites with three
    different strains during all four seasons. The experimental design of the UFS
    was to cultivate algae across the five different geographic regions in the exact
    same manner. In this way, seasonal and geographic effects could be observed in
    algae performance data. Pond production experiments were run during each season
    (identified as approximately 13 week periods) with each individual cultivation
    experiment lasting at least 8 weeks. The UFS began in April 2014 and ran through
    July 2015 to conclude this phase of the ATP3 project (Table 2). For the purposes
    of the UFS, we did not attempt to run continuously throughout the entire year
    to determine the number of pond operational days that could be achieved in a one-year
    period as this was outside of the scope of the UFS. Rather we intended to explore
    the seasonal impacts on algae cultivation across the testbed network by running
    cultivation experiments during each season. Pond crashes caused by fungus (e.g.
    Chytridiomycota), bacteria, other algae (predatory, e.g. Poterioochromonas, or
    competitive, e.g. other eukaryotic algae), and predators (e. g. amoeba) are indicated
    by underlined values for each experiment (Table 2) and noted in a separate column
    as a crash in the summary harvest data. The data were collected continuously throughout
    the experimental duration, periodically checked by each of the site representatives,
    and ultimately subjected to rigorous quality control (as discussed below in the
    Data Collection, Review, and Compilation section) when the experiment was completed.
    Table 2 Number of UFS pond operational days per strain, site, year, and season.
    Full size table Algae Strains The performance of three different algae strains
    are included in the data reported here: Nannochloropsis oceanica KA32 (source:
    Cellana) grown in a saltwater medium, Chlorella vulgaris LRB-AZ-1201 (source:
    ASU) grown in a freshwater medium, and Desmodesmus sp. C046 (source: Cellana),
    grown in both saltwater and freshwater media. Inoculum for these algae strains
    was produced in indoor columns using appropriate respective growth media, scaled
    up, and transferred to outdoor ponds as previously described6. Pond Design & Operation
    At each of the testbed sites, 6 identical raceway ponds measuring 3.5 m by 1.5 m
    and 35 cm in depth (1025 L nominal volume at 25 cm working depth, with a surface
    area of 4.2 m2 including the paddlewheel area) were installed. Each UFS experiment
    was performed according to the specific experimental protocol which is included
    with the dataset as listed in Table 1 (available online only). In general, the
    experimental plan was designed around a semi-continuous, also known as a drain-and-fill,
    strategy with harvesting operations to commence once cultures reached a biomass
    concentration of 0.5 g ash-free dry weight (AFDW) L−1. Ponds were operated with
    24-hour paddlewheel mixing at 7.2 rpms creating an average flow rate of 9.3 cm s−1
    with on-demand CO2 sparging at 5 L min−1 based on pH. Although carbon uptake efficiency
    is an important metric in terms of algal cultivation, the UFS was setup to ensure
    CO2 was not a limiting reagent and was thus supplied in excess. While the flow
    rate of CO2 to the system was controlled through a pH setpoint, actual volume
    delivered was not quantified. The initial grow-out period varied but typically
    took approximately 2 weeks. Harvesting operations to achieve the dilution rate
    as specified for a given experiment typically involved removing either 25% or
    50% of the pond volume three times per week, or 75% of the pond volume once per
    week. The ponds were harvested using a portable pump and drained to a specified
    depth depending on the harvesting regime detailed in the protocol for each experiment.
    Depending on the amount harvested, the time to reset a triplicate set of ponds
    was typically 45 min including sampling. Since the algal biomass was typically
    disposed of and not used for downstream processing, harvesting efficiency and
    percent solids harvested were not calculated and was outside of the scope of the
    UFS. After routine harvesting, the ponds were re-filled with fresh media to continue
    the cultivation trial. Ponds were also harvested in response to contamination
    events and occasionally pre-emptively due to large amounts of rain. Pond samples
    were taken daily and analysed for water quality and biochemical composition in
    triplicate according to Table 3. Table 3 Sample data, units, schedule, and method
    for data collection. Full size table Compositional analysis methods for total
    protein, total carbohydrate, and total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) followed
    consensus methods that were validated and implemented across the ATP3 testbed
    network. These analytical procedures are complex and built on years of experimental
    analytical biochemistry research and were recently described in detail elsewhere7,8.
    Detailed analysis protocols are available at https://www.nrel.gov/bioenergy/microalgae-analysis.html.
    Data Collection, Review, and Compilation Researchers at each site were responsible
    for recording primary experimental data in pre-formatted spreadsheets (available
    upon request). For any individual experiment (e.g., UFS-1) all spreadsheet formats
    were the same, but the standard spreadsheet format was modified over time to improve
    fidelity in recording data. For example, the spreadsheets were set up to automatically
    highlight outliers (e. g. samples having a relative standard deviation greater
    than 10%) or identify user input errors (e. g. negative values for pH measurements).
    The spreadsheets were also occasionally modified to facilitate data entry due
    to changes in experimental design. For example, the original version of the spreadsheet
    tracked only the nitrate concentration in ponds while later versions tracked both
    ammonia and nitrate concentrations (variation in nitrogen source was an integral
    part of a later experimental design), and the original version of the spreadsheet
    tracked the optical density of the algae ponds at 750 nm (OD750) while later versions
    tracked both OD750 and OD680. The final datasets provide columns for nitrate and
    ammonia and both wavelengths, with “NA” inserted for experiments where these measurements
    were not taken. The spreadsheets were shared among ATP3 researchers, and resulting
    datasets underwent multiple rounds of review and correction over the course of
    the experiment. These reviews identified missing and incorrectly formatted data,
    and data entry errors. At the conclusion of each experiment, the spreadsheets
    were transferred to a centralized data repository that was accessible to the core
    group of data analysts at ATP3. We used the statistical programming language R9
    (www.R-project.org) to process the data in the spreadsheets into text files. Primary
    “builder” scripts (one for each data sheet) combined data from the different spreadsheets.
    Secondary scripts plotted these data to simplify data review and correction. A
    final script parsed the combined data into separate files for each experiment.
    Code availability Custom code was written in R to both perform quality control
    and collate all the data from different spreadsheets. The scripts used to combine,
    review, and parse the primary spreadsheet data, along with individual primary
    spreadsheets, are available upon request. Data Records The data from the ATP3
    UFS are organized into five different types as shown in Table 1 and described
    in detail below. These data include measurements from routine pond operation,
    measurements from automated instrumentation, weather data, harvest data, and algae
    compositional analysis data (Data Citation 1). The instrumentation and weather
    data are available either as complete data sets or as daily-averaged data. Datatype
    1: Pond Operational Data Pond operational data include the measured pond depth
    (cm), pH, salinity (g L−1), pond water temperature (oC), nitrogen concentration
    (mg L−1 N), phosphorus concentration (mg L−1 P), N:P ratio (molar), the sample
    ID and tracking ID of a physical sample (if taken), the algae concentration (g
    L−1) as dry weight and ash-free dry weight (AFDW), the ash content of the algal
    biomass (%), and the OD750. The OD680 is also available only for UFS-7. Datatype
    2: Summary Harvest Data Complete harvest data are available for each experiment
    at each site. These data include date, strain, batch and source ID, pond treatment,
    and depth (cm). Harvest data include harvest number, time between harvests, harvest
    volume (L), amount harvested (g), ash-free dry weight (AFDW; g L−1) at the time
    of harvest, and an indication of a pond crash. The UFS-1 Baseline Experiment was
    an initial start-up, equipment, and operator trial run thus no harvest data were
    collected. Datatype 3: Compositional Analysis Data Compositional analysis data
    were generated on samples taken at regular intervals during each experiment, including
    all harvest operations. These data include total protein, total carbohydrate,
    and FAMEs. Individual samples that did not meet the QC requirements or that experienced
    experimental errors during analysis are not included7. Datatype 4: Instrumentation
    Data The complete and daily-averaged YSI-5200 instrumentation data are available
    for each experiment at each site. These data include continuous measurement of
    pH, pond water temperature (oC), pond conductivity (ms cm−1), dissolved oxygen
    concentration (DO, mg L−1), dissolved oxygen saturation (%), salinity (g L−1),
    and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, μmol m−2 s−1). The PAR sensor was
    connected to only one of the ponds, thus only one pond collected light intensity
    data, and these data are used to characterize the entire site. Datatype 5: Weather
    Data The complete and daily-averaged weather data are available for each experiment
    at each site. These data were collected either on site (ASU and CELL) or using
    publicly available data in close proximity (within 6 miles) to the site. For the
    CP site, data from the California Irrigation Management Information System, San
    Luis Obispo station #52 were used. For the GT site, data from the Clark Atlanta
    University weather station (http://weather.uga.edu) were used. For the FA site,
    data from Weather Underground, station: KFLVEROB15 were used. For the TRL site,
    data from the National Solar Radiation Database delineated by the latitude and
    longitude of the TRL site were used10. These data include air temperature (oC),
    relative humidity (%RH), Global Light Intensity (W m−2 s−1), daily precipitation
    (cm), wind speed (km hr-1), and wind direction (degrees). Datatype 6: Summary
    Combined Data The primary Pond Operational Data (Datatype 1) and Summary Harvest
    Data (Datatype 2) were combined into one spreadsheet for each experiment to aid
    in the further analysis of these datasets. Additional metrics beyond primary data
    collection were also calculated to provide greater utility to the dataset. These
    calculated metrics include nutrients supplied (g) (nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4),
    and phosphorous (P)), nutrients utilized (g), nutrient utilization efficiency
    (%), and nutrient demand (g N or g P g AFDW−1). Daily evaporation rate (cm day−1)
    and biomass per unit energy (mg AFDW mol photons-1 and mg AFDW kW−1) are also
    included. In addition, pond operator comments are included in these spreadsheets
    to provide information about what was being observed in the ponds. Technical Validation
    The experimental protocol document for each UFS provides details regarding procedures
    on data collection. Routine pond operational measurements (e. g. pH, temperature,
    optical density) were collected using standard laboratory instruments subjected
    to regular calibration. Physical samples for AFDW and ash content were collected
    and analysed in triplicate. The probes used to collect the instrumentation data
    were calibrated regularly or if a probe was determined to be giving erroneous
    values. The raw data were plotted using R scripts as noted above as part of the
    technical validation process. These plots were then manually examined for obvious
    outliers, for example, a series of pH values rapidly and temporarily changing
    to values of approximately 4 or 10 indicate pH probe calibration data that were
    accidentally included in the automated data collection run, or a sudden deviation
    in temperature when the pond is stable at 30 oC indicating the temperature probe
    was briefly removed from the pond for cleaning without interrupting data collection.
    These values were typically flagged with a comment in the primary datasheet. The
    weather data collected from independently-operated weather stations was not curated
    by ATP3 researchers. Further details of the initial harmonization across the sites
    and of the technical validation associated with the algae compositional analysis
    data are presented elsewhere6,7. We have deliberately not removed large amounts
    of data, since it is quite difficult to determine with high confidence which data
    are “good” and which are “bad”. Some of the challenges we experienced in curating
    these data are illustrated in Fig. 2. The figure shows the pH data collected for
    three ponds at ASU during the UFS-1 experiment. The black points show the pH measured
    at 15-minute increments using a pH probe connected to an automated data logger.
    The magenta points show the daily average value of these pH measurements. The
    blue points show the manually-recorded pH measurements, collected twice per day
    (just after sunrise and just before sunset) Monday through Friday along with other
    pond operational data. Figure 2 Auto-logged (black), manually-logged (blue), and
    daily average (magenta) pH in 3 ponds during the UFS-1 experiment at ASU. Full
    size image The pH data from the auto-logger (black points) show a small diurnal
    oscillation due to the change in algae metabolism under illumination and darkness.
    The daily-averaged data (magenta points) reduce this oscillation. The manually-recorded
    pH data (blue points) show slightly more variability than the daily-averaged auto-logger
    data. In the top figure, the auto-logger data show a number of excursions from
    the apparent “true value” of approximately 8.5. These excursions are highlighted
    with red boxes in the figure. These excursions in measured pH are due to the inadvertent
    logging of the pH probe recalibration process, where the probe is removed from
    the pond and immersed in a series of pH standards. The experimental protocol called
    for the auto-logger to be paused for the recalibration process. These inadvertent
    measurements result in slightly lower daily-averaged values as well. The manually-recorded
    pH data do not show this effect. There appears to be a slight positive bias in
    the manually-recorded pH data compared to the auto-logger pH data as well, despite
    being calibrated regularly. In Fig. 3, we show the corresponding pond temperature
    data, to the pH data in Fig. 2. The black points in Fig. 3 show the temperature
    measured at 15-minute increments using a temperature probe connected to an automated
    data-logger. The magenta points show the daily average value of these temperature
    measurements. The blue points show the manually-recorded temperature measurements,
    collected twice per day Monday through Friday (morning and evening) along with
    other pond operational data. The diurnal variation in pond temperature is evident,
    and the daily-averaged temperature value reduces this variation. The manual temperature
    measurements are very close to the extreme daily values, since these were made
    shortly after sunrise and shortly before sunset. Due to a malfunction in the pond
    P2 auto-logger there are no auto-logger data for pond P2 for this experiment.
    There is overall a good agreement between the temperature data collected for each
    of the three ponds, with minimal pond-to-pond variability. There is much better
    agreement in temperature values as opposed to pH between the manually-recorded
    data and the auto-logger data. Figure 3 Auto-logged (black), manually-logged (blue),
    and daily average (magenta) temperature in 3 ponds during the UFS-1 experiment
    ASU. Full size image Usage Notes The complete description of a specific UFS experiment
    requires all five data types as well as the operational protocols (as discussed
    in the Data Records section). To effectively use these data, it is necessary to
    link the data from each file. Pond operational data, instrumentation data, and
    summary harvest data are linked through the site location, pond number, and date
    and time. Because the weather data and the PAR data characterize the entire site,
    they can be linked to the pond operational and harvest data through the site location
    and date and time. Pond operational data and harvest data are linked to the algae
    compositional data by the use of a tracking ID recorded on the pond operations
    spreadsheet at the time of harvest, since each biomass sample with compositional
    analysis data has a unique tracking ID. Though the datasets were curated for outliers,
    typographic errors upon data entry, and instrumentation sensor data that was clearly
    due to a bad sensor, we felt that too much curation could jeopardize the notion
    that these datasets are purely objective (not selective) datasets. Thus, for example,
    present in the YSI pond temperature data there are occasional rapid spikes to
    40 oC. This represents times when during harvest or other pond operations, the
    temperature probe was removed and set in a cup of water by the pond. Being in
    such a small volume of water, the temperature invariably spiked upwards on sunny
    days. Similarly, as described above, there are multiple instances of the pH measurement
    for a pond spiking to pH10 or pH4 for several minutes. This was caused by the
    periodic recalibration of the pH probes while the instrumentation was collecting
    data. While the protocol called for the instrument to be placed in “standby mode”
    during the recalibration, this did not always occur. It is anticipated that many
    users of these data will be interested in algae productivity; the rate at which
    algae biomass is either produced or harvested from outdoor ponds11. Algae productivity
    is generally calculated either as the increase in biomass or the summation of
    biomass harvested over time. Although a reliable representative measure of growth,
    biomass productivity calculated as an increase in biomass concentration over time
    is mainly of academic interest in the context of a biomass production scheme for
    conversion to biofuels, since it is calculated in such a way that does not account
    for how much biomass can be or was removed from the pond for conversion to biofuels
    and may not take into account the subsequent effects of biomass removal. Thus
    the algae productivity calculation that is more relevant is the calculation based
    on the actual amount of biomass harvested from the pond and available for conversion
    to biofuels during the course of a given production run. Usage of the datasets
    requires careful selection of the appropriate data and additional curation by
    researchers seeking to use average values for predictive modelling or geographical
    projections. We have previously presented guidelines and examples on the proper
    use of the ATP3 data to calculate the relevant harvest yield productivity from
    these datasets11 and the harvest yield productivity calculated from these datasets
    for the algal strain Nannochloropsis KA32 is presented (Fig. 4). Clearly the biggest
    driver of areal harvest yield productivity in Nannochloropsis is seasonal with
    the decrease in temperature and available sunlight with the change from summer
    into winter. This effect is tempered at the coastal sites of Cellana and Florida
    Algae. In addition to areal harvest yield productivity, the composition of the
    algae is a critical parameter in modelling the value and potential of algae cultivation.
    The algal biomass composition made up of protein, carbohydrate, and lipids as
    fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as % AFDW, over the course of the UFS shows how
    the various components changed through the course of an experiment, across the
    seasons, and at the various sites (Fig. 5). In general, the UFS was designed to
    provide baseline growth metrics rather than nutrient deprivation studies. This
    is evident in the composition as protein is usually high while FAME and carbohydrates
    are lower. There are examples where nitrogen became depleted with the resulting
    decrease in protein and increase in FAME and carbohydrates. Figure 4: Areal harvest
    yield productivity for N. oceanica KA32 during the entirety of the UFS. Productivity
    is shown as calculated across the entire experimental duration (blue) and for
    just the continuous portion of the experiment (orange). Full size image Figure

    Full size image Finally, the UFS encompasses typical algal growth at 5 different
    sites across the United States in regions identified as amenable to outdoor algal
    cultivation. However, as stated in the introduction, the goal of the Algae Testbed
    Public Private Partnership (ATP3) was to provide year-over-year, well-characterized,
    algal cultivation datasets. The comprehensive operational, harvest, and composition
    data, will be useful to the algae research community even though we did not optimize
    our experiments for either biomass accumulation nor algal compositional shifts,
    e. g. nitrogen stress to induce the accumulation of lipids. These datasets represent
    a conservative, non-optimized, estimation of typical algal areal harvest yield
    productivities and compositions that can be achieved with these strains at the
    scale, locations, and operational parameters chosen. Additional information How

    Abstract Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) based sensing systems have improved
    capabilities to precisely monitor environmental conditions. Plants are sessile
    organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding
    environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation,
    and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems)
    of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision
    agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication
    aspects of the WSN''s, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components
    for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured.
    The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access,
    and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed
    sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a
    framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement
    (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing
    system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities
    such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement
    estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management. Also, the modeling
    techniques were integrated with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for
    addressing water management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.

    Sensor Network 1. Introduction Agriculture is an important sector which drives
    the economy and food security of many nations. Various kinds of sensing systems
    are emerging in the area of precision agriculture in which the current trend is
    towards the design and development of cost-effective, energy efficient and fault
    tolerant Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for various monitoring and management
    applications. The focus of recent research is on improving and sustaining the
    productivity of different crops. Current advances in Information Communication
    and Dissemination Technologies (ICDT''s) have well proven their ability in information
    and knowledge dissemination. Globally, the ICDT initiatives in the field of agriculture
    have shown that with accurate monitoring and analysis of crop/weather parameters,
    it is possible to judiciously allocate available resources in agriculture (Nash
    et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010, Prabhakar et al., 2010, Li et al., 2011). Several
    WSNs are being deployed in many countries, and have a wide range of applications
    in agriculture, such as: • Crop/pest disease monitoring (Riquelme et al., 2009,
    Tripathy et al., 2011). • Crop water management (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, uAgri C-DAC, 2013, Sudharsan et al., 2012, Ojha et al., 2015). •
    Crop yield prediction (Honda et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011). • Weather
    based advisory services (IMD, 2016, ISRO, 2015, mKRISHI, 2016). In general, several
    dissemination systems are currently being deployed, which enables the discovery,
    access and retrieval of various meteorological, biophysical, ocean and coastal
    water quality parameters. This kind of systems can be divided into two types:
    (1) Stovepipe or standalone systems which provide sensor details (i.e. metadata,
    observations and measurements) in their own formats (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, Riquelme et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011, Sudharsan et al.,
    2012, Tripathy et al., 2011, Ojha et al., 2015). (2) Interoperable systems and
    platforms which implement commonly agreed standards for sensor metadata, observation
    and measurement representation (Korduan et al., 2004, Murakami et al., 2007, Mizoguchi
    et al., 2008, Nash et al., 2009, Durbha et al., 2010, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Bröring
    et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2011b, Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Jazayeri et al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015, Du et al., 2016,
    Geipel et al., 2016). However, there is a paucity of standards driven, interoperable
    systems in the Agriculture domain that severely impedes the discovery and access
    of data across Agri-WSN''s. For example, to answer a question such as “What is
    the crop water requirement during a particular crop growth stage?, there is a
    need for weather parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, solar
    radiation, wind speed, and rainfall. from weather station and crop growth stage
    information from field/cultivation practice. It''s hard for users from diverse
    areas of study to understand the exact lineage of the collected data i.e. how
    the measurement is transformed into an observation. It is possible that the measurement
    has gone through various transformations (e.g. application calibration curves),
    which can also give rise to heterogeneous data formats (Comma Separated Values
    (CSV), Tab Separated Values (TSV), EXtensible Markup Language (XML), etc.). With
    this ever increasing spread of WSNs, there is a need for standard sets of specifications
    (both syntactic and semantic) and encodings to bring multiple sensor networks
    on a common platform (Durbha et al., 2010, Bröring et al., 2011a, Patil et al.,
    2012, Liang and Huang, 2013). Which enables the development of geographically
    distributed systems that are standardized at the semantic (Folmer and Verhoosel,
    2011, Compton et al., 2012) and Syntactic (Bröring et al., 2011b) level for regional
    agricultural practices planning (i.e. irrigation, pest/disease management, etc.).
    The initiatives such as, FOODIE: Farm-Oriented Open Data in Europe (Esbri et al.,
    2014), GeoCENS: Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for the World-Wide Sensor Web (Liang
    and Huang, 2013), Sensor Asia (Mizoguchi et al., 2008) and Service Oriented Architecture
    for sensor data discovery in agriculture (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Chen et al., 2015), are some of the attempts towards facilitating the interoperability
    and sensor data discovery. These studies have shown the utility of Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) specified Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standards for sensor
    data access from geographically distributed sensing systems (OGC, 2016, Bröring
    et al., 2012, Bröring et al., 2011a). Keeping in view of the requirement of a
    sensing and analysis platform in the ever increasing precision agriculture area,
    the specific objectives of this paper are: • to design a sensor platform (hardware)
    with integrated SWE architecture for precision agro-meteorological monitoring
    • to integrate the OGC''s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to achieve interoperability
    and scalability of heterogeneous sensing systems • to demonstrate the utility
    of such interoperable sensing systems for agro-meteorological monitoring and potential
    evapotranspiration estimation. This paper is organized into various sections:
    Section 2 describes the design of sensor platform (hardware) and integration of
    sensor web architecture (software) for agriculture monitoring. A case study on
    the application of interoperable sensor system for crop water requirement analysis
    is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents results and discussions on the integrated
    sensor web system and its utility for crop water requirement analysis. Section
    5 concludes with a comparison between current SWE initiatives for precision agriculture
    and a description of the future work. 2. Materials and methods The sensor web
    enablement framework of the agro-meteorological observation and analysis platform
    consists of three layers: (1) Sensing systems, (2) Sensor Web Enablement (middleware)
    and (3) Web based visualization layer (Fig. 1). Below is a description of each

    The sensing systems layer comprise of the network of geographically distributed
    heterogeneous sensing systems (i.e. a set of standalone and interoperable sensing
    platforms). 2.1.1. Development of an interoperable sensing platform An interoperable
    wireless sensing system (henceforth called as SenseTube) has been designed using
    low powered System on Chip (SoC) single board computer (i.e. Raspberry Pi/R-Pi,
    Raspberry Pi (2016)) as a data collection and dissemination platform (Fig. 2a)
    (Sawant et al., 2015). Multiple sensor nodes (child nodes) can be interfaced with
    the SenseTube base station. Download : Download high-res image (226KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Interoperable sensing system, (a) system hardware
    block diagram and (b) interoperable sensor data communication architecture. Field
    level node to node communication has been established using Wi-Fi (i.e. IEEE 108.11)
    communication protocol (Fig. 2b) (Sawant et al., 2015). The General Purpose Input
    Output (GPIO) pins of SoC hardware are utilized to connect the Analog to Digital
    Converter (ADC), and through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) the data is collected.
    The ADC has eight analog channels for connecting external sensors. The resolution
    of ADC is 10 bit thereby facilitating to interface analog sensors such as temperature,
    and humidity. The digital (raw) voltage observations collected from ADC are converted
    into physical measurements and stored onboard. The sensor sampling and polling
    frequency can be adjusted through the configuration interface. The default sampling
    interval has been set to fifteen minutes and polling frequency to one hour. The
    sensing system comprises of sensor node collecting observations at fixed interval.
    The sensing system can be configured as a base station and child node. When set
    as base station sensor node receive observations and measurements from distributed
    child nodes and transmit over remote address/service. The child node configuration
    provides a capability to receive and locally transfer sensor observations and
    measurements to the base station. Table 1 lists sensing system configurations
    for interoperable sensing system (SenseTube). Table 1. Sensing system configuration.

    15 min 4. Polling frequency 1 h Existing infrastructure of Internet Service Providers
    (ISP''s) has been utilized in the present study for internet connectivity. Normally,
    the ISP''s dynamically assign Internet Protocol (IP) address to the field based
    sensing system, this configuration brings out two cost-effective approaches to
    communicate with the data processing layer: (1) through Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) server configured on fixed IP addressed remote/cloud service platform (Liu,
    2000), (2) using cost-effective cloud service (e.g. ownCloud, Dropbox, etc.) which
    is easily accessible to both the field based sensing system and remote/cloud based
    data processing server (ownCloud, 2016, Dropbox, 2016). Direct reliable and secure
    access to SWE sensing platform facilitate the on-board data processing (i.e. estimate
    reference evapotranspiration, daily minimum/maximum temperature, humidity, etc.).
    The remote/cloud based data processing server can access the field nodes using
    SWE requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation detailed
    information about communication between field based interoperable sensing systems,
    and sensor data storage and data analysis layer (middleware) is described in the
    subsequent section. 2.1.2. Existing standalone sensing systems Various studies
    have provided methodologies for SWE of standalone (the sensing systems which provide
    sensor details in their formats) sensing systems (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015). A wrapper (a piece of software
    to transform sensor observations) is necessary to make standalone sensing system
    into OGC standardized, interoperable sensing system. The method for design of
    Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) proposed by Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012 has been used for regional Automatic Weather Station (AWS). This methodology
    facilitates the integration of standalone AWS into interoperable sensor web layer.
    2.2. Sensor web enablement layer (Middleware) The SWE layer provides sensor data
    polling and processing facility. The OGC standards such as SOS, Observations and
    Measurements (O&M), Sensor Model Language (Sensor ML), and Web Processing Service
    (WPS) are used to establish communication between sensing systems and client interface.
    2.2.1. Background 2.2.1.1. Sensor model language The Sensor ML has the primary
    objective to provide a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes
    and processing components associated with the measurement and post-measurement
    transformation of observations. This includes sensors and actuators as well as
    computational processes applied pre- and post-measurement (Botts and Robin, 2007).
    In sensor web enablement architecture shown in Fig. 1, SensorML encoding is used
    to define each sensor of the sensing system. The sensor details include observed
    property, transducer information, manufacturer, geographical location, etc. The
    detailed description about sensor Observations and Measurements is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.2.1.2. Observations and measurements The OGC O&M standard
    specifies an XML implementation for the OGC and ISO Observations and Measurements
    (O&M) conceptual model, including a schema for sampling features. The O&M encoding
    is an essential dependency for the SOS interface standard as it defines XML schemas
    for observations and for features involved in sampling when making observations
    (Cox, 2011). The O&M specifications are used to formulate the response to the
    GetObservation request which is comprised of observed properties and constrained
    by observation schema definitions (Fig. 1). The GetObservation request states
    the feature of interest with begin and end timestamp and observed properties.
    The details of SOS component is described in subsequent section. 2.2.1.3. Sensor
    observation service The OGC SOS standard defines a web service interface which
    allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as representations of observed
    features. Further, this standard defines means to register new sensors and to
    remove existing ones. Also, it defines operations to insert new sensor observations
    (Bröring et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2012, Na and Priest, 2007). The SOS stores
    time series sensor observations in a relational database and facilitates the formulation
    of response for various requests (DescribeSensor, GetObservation, InsertObservation,
    etc.). Fig. 1 shows the integration of all sensor observations into SOS relational
    database. 2.2.1.4. Sensor event service (SES) The SES provides the user an interface
    to access sensor data and measurements (Chandy and Schulte, 2007, Echterhoff and
    Ingo, 2010). The SES facilitates user to subscribe for the particular sensor or
    set threshold value/s and enable notifications about selected phenomenon (e.g.
    event notifications are triggered on depletion of soil moisture to the set threshold
    i.e. allowable depletion). It also provides methods to dynamically add new sensors
    and send notifications to the service (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image

    notification service. 2.2.1.5. Web processing service The WPS interface standard
    provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses)
    for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, the daily mean of
    sensor observation time series, etc. The standard also defines how a client can
    request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled
    (Mueller and Pross, 2015). Fig. 1 shows the core WPS requests i.e. GetCapabilities,
    DescribeProcess, and ExecuteProcess. The GetCapabilities request provides information
    about available processes (e.g. a process to estimate root-zone soil moisture
    storage based on soil moisture sensor observations). The DescribeProcess provides
    details about selected process. For example, the process for estimation of root-zone
    soil moisture storage requires, input (i.e. time series observations from soil
    moisture in date and float data type) and output (i.e. estimated soil moisture
    storage time series of date and float data type) parameters. The ExecuteProcess
    handles actual computation defined by process and output results are provided
    in response. The detailed description of each component of SWE layer is described
    in subsequent section. 2.2.2. Architecture of SWE layer The Architecture of SWE
    layer comprises of, an SWE web services module (e.g. Sensor Observation Service
    version 1.0) for data query and access, Sensor Alerts and Notification (e.g. Sensor
    Event Notification Service) based on pre-defined parameter thresholds and rules
    and Sensor data archival module. These various components run in parallel with
    the supporting functionalities (Fig. 1) as discussed below: SWE Web services module
    maps the details about each sensing system using Sensor ML. The O&M standards
    are used for encoding the observations (e.g. observed values, observed property,
    references to feature and procedure, time stamps, etc.). For example in case of
    air temperature sensor, O&M standards are used to represent parameters such as
    observed values (i.e. actual sensor observations), observed property (i.e. identification
    of observed property air temperature), feature of interest and procedure (i.e.
    identification of associated feature with procedure), time stamp (i.e. time at
    which observation is collected), and offerings. The user interactions are handled
    through SOS requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation
    (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (530KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Sequence diagram representing interactions among various components
    of sensor web enabled service platform. The SOS GetObservation request specifies
    the sensor offering (i.e. sensor system), O&M sampling time, observed property
    and response format (Fig. 5a). The GetObservation response returns the location
    of the feature of interest (i.e. sensor) and observation collection for specified
    time interval (Fig. 5b). Details about Sensor Alerts and Notification are discussed
    in subsequent section. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download

    SOS GetObservation response. Sensor Alerts and Notification provides capabilities
    to report the sensor observations over email, social network site such as Twitter
    (2016). The main advantages of this functionality are (a) observations from sensing
    system are available on user''s social web page/account without maintaining a
    separate database on cloud service and (b) as observations are directly posted/updated
    on social media the latency in information dissemination are significantly reduced.
    The critical information about events such as sudden increase in temperature,
    and drop in relative humidity below a certain level can be effectively notified
    to the user''s/stakeholders thereby ensuring the initiation of quick response
    for mitigation of effects of these events. Social network tweet capability is
    configured to one hour in sensing system (Fig. 4). In future, the event notification
    service can be improved by incorporating the OGC publish/subscribe interface standard
    (Braeckel et al., 2016). The data from heterogeneous sensing systems is collected
    and organized in SOS complaint format by sensor data polling process. To continuously
    update the state of service the data polling process executes SOS request GetCapabilities
    and InsertObservation. As internet connectivity (GSM/GPRS network) at the test
    site (remote villages) widely varies, the process of sensor data polling is independently
    maintained, which ensures communication with all remote sensor systems. The data
    polling frequency can be configured to any duration, and it has been set to one
    hour in the present study. The size of text data transferred per sensing system
    during each polling event ranges between 1 and 1.5 kilobytes (Fig. 4). The request
    specific algorithms required for sensor data processing (e.g. daily minimum and
    maximum temperature calculation, reference evapotranspiration estimation, etc.)
    are maintained using WPS. In this study, existing implementations of the OGC SWE
    and WPS provided by OSGeo community are used (OSGeo, 2017). The OGC SOS standard
    version 1.0 implementation provided by istSOS is used, the architecture is also
    tested with OGC SOS standard version 2.0 (istSOS, 2017). Major differences identified
    between the SOS version 1.0 and 2.0 during preliminary tests of SenseTube interoperable
    sensing and analysis platform are: (a) each observation offering is limited to
    associated with only a single procedure (i.e. one to one constraint). In SenseTube
    platform, multiple procedures (e.g. for temperature sensor associated ADC values
    and observations) were stored as a single offering which caused issues while retrieving
    only the sensor observations. This improved specification for observation offerings
    in SOS 2.0 facilitated identification of correct procedure and removed ambiguity
    in obtaining the observations. (b) The improved specification for temporal and
    spatial filters added in the GetObservation request of SOS 2.0 has facilitated
    the effective retrieval of sensor observations. For example, to estimate reference
    ET for long duration (i.e. quarterly/monthly time interval) would require the
    retrieval of a large number of sensor observations. The updated temporal filters
    in SOS 2.0 enable to divide the request into smaller chunks thereby reducing memory
    overloads. The spatial filters are used to identify the nearest AWS and SenseTube
    observations to validate the observed and model estimated soil moisture and temperature.
    (c) In SOS 2.0, the response format conversion (serialization) is loosely coupled
    and can be moved from server side to client side; this helps in reducing processing
    overhead. In the long-term deployment with very high sensor sampling frequency
    this improved specification would help in reducing the energy footprint of SenseTube
    sensing and analysis platform. The OGC WPS version 2.0 implementation PyWPS 4.0
    is used (PyWPS, 2017). The SOS and WPS implementations are selected mainly because
    of lightweight Python based implementation on single board computer. The proposed
    methodology provides the on-board implementation of SWE and attempts towards independent
    hardware or software implementation. The web/mobile user interacts with SWE layer
    through SOS and WPS requests handled by the interoperable thin client. The detailed
    explanation about a web based client and SWE service platform is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.3. Web based visualization layer A web based thin client
    has been designed to establish seamless communication between the SWE processes
    and user/stakeholder. In this study thin client has been designed for user e.g.
    farmer, researcher, etc. The OGC specified standards such as SOS, WPS and third
    party Web Map Service (WMS) are the primary access point of the web based thin
    client. The service architecture can also facilitate machine to machine interaction
    through process sharing and seamless data access (this study do not cover the
    details about machine to machine communication). Designed thin client acts as
    a gateway interface to the SWE architecture, and it hides the complexities of
    sensing systems from the end user (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    (a) Details about sensing system and SOS capabilities, (b) and (c) Sensor observations
    in chart and table format and (d) Sensor observations overlaid on third party
    WMS layer. Fig. 6 shows snapshots of modules of web based thin client, (1) details
    about sensing system and capabilities, (2) sensor observations in a chart and
    table format, and (3) sensor observations over third party WMS layer (e.g. Open
    Street Map, Google Map, Bing Map, etc.). The client is interoperable with any
    SOS, WPS based sensing system. The first module provides basic information about
    service platform facilitating the details about geographic location, manufacturer,
    the number of sensors on sensing system, etc. (Fig. 6a). This information leads
    to the further query about details of each procedure and identifies the exact
    feature of interest e.g. air temperature, relative humidity, etc. Also, it provides
    details about each observed property and its associated sensor lineage e.g. minimum/maximum
    range, observed property, time of first and recent observation insert into SOS,
    etc. The sensor data access and visualization are important for any sensing system,
    particularly to the novice farming community. Sensor data observation module of
    the interoperable client comprises filter (e.g. date, time, sensor id, etc.) based
    sensor data querying mechanism. The user can select any sensor from selected sensing
    system and visualize the observations in table and chart format, and also facilitate
    the sensor data download in comma separated variable (CSV) format (Fig. 6b and
    c). The sensor observations are overlaid on third party WMS layer to understand
    the geospatial location and details of observed phenomenon (Fig. 6d). We have
    designed a web based thin client (i.e. interoperable web client) in PHP and Python
    programming language and it''s available for download on GitHub URL''s https://github.com/suryakant54321/sos-client-in-php
    and https://github.com/suryakant54321/Python-SOS-Client. A case study on agro-meteorological
    monitoring and potential evapotranspiration estimation have been discussed below
    to understand the need and utility of interoperable sensing systems. 3. A case
    study on application of SOA for citrus crop water requirement estimation A major
    Citrus (Orange/Mandarin) growing region in the semi-arid tropical region was selected
    to demonstrate the need and utility of SWE in agriculture. The details about study
    area, deployment of interoperable sensing system and estimation of agro-meteorological
    parameters are described in subsequent section. 3.1. Study area and field deployment
    of sensing system Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, India experiences severe climatic
    uncertainties (uneven rainfall and severe heat) thereby giving rise to crop failure.
    The area receives rainfall during southwest monsoon. The average annual rainfall
    ranges between 700 and 800 mm. The maximum temperature during summer recorded
    up to 46 °C while the minimum temperature during winter drops to about 5 °C (GSDA,
    2016). Wheat and Gram are major irrigated crops; Cotton, Jowar (Sorghum) and Toor
    (Pigeon Pea) are major non-irrigated crops; Orange, Cotton, and Groundnut are
    major cash crops cultivated in the region. The harvesting of Orange takes place
    in two fruiting seasons Ambiya (November-December) and Mrig (February-March).
    As per ground water resource estimates, Warud is categorized as one of the three
    over-exploited groundwater resources regions (tahsils) of Amravati district (CGWB,
    2007). The main reasons for selection of this study area to study the prospects
    of Sensor Web Enablement for irrigation management in agriculture are (a) the
    problem of ground water table depletion is more prominent in this region (NRAA,
    2011). (b) the groundwater is a major source of irrigation for Orange cultivation
    of this region and it is adversely affected due to improper irrigation practices
    (NRAA, 2011), (c) Orange crop diseases have a very close relation with poor drainage
    and excess irrigation (Grimm and Timmer, 1981). The soil-borne crop disease infestation
    is caused due to unavailability of right information on stage-wise crop water
    requirement. For initial test deployment of sensing system Orange orchard from
    Nagziri village from Warud tahsil has been selected. The World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) guidelines for automatic weather station deployment are considered
    for sensor placement in SenseTube sensing system (WMO, 2012). Two each temperature
    and relative humidity sensors are placed at 5 m (above at top of canopy) and 2.5
    m (within the canopy) from ground. Two soil temperature and one soil moisture
    sensors are placed at 15, 30 and 30 cm depth, respectively at a radial distance
    of 5 m from the Orange tree. Remaining ADC channel was closed using pull-down
    resistor (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (212KB) Download : Download

    ease in wire connection and placement of entire module on the base structure.
    The sensor observations are continuously being polled using data polling process
    (Fig. 4) since the date of field deployment (16 Feb. 2014). To monitor the state
    of the sensing system, SES (sensor Twitter feed KrishiSense) has been configured
    to upload two sensor tweets per event. Considering the character restriction of
    a tweet, each event consists of timestamp and value of recorded phenomenon. The
    URL to access sensor system Twitter feed is “https://twitter.com/KrishiSense”.
    3.2. Reference evapotranspiration estimation Widely used reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) estimation equations i.e. FAO Penman-Monteith (ETo PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (ETo Harg) (Allen et al., 1998) were used in order to understand
    seasonal variation in crop water requirement of orange crop grown and to study
    the feasibility of SenseTube sensing system for field level agro-meteorological
    monitoring and analysis. ETo estimations were performed for both AWS and SenseTube
    weather observations. The equation for estimation of ETo by Penman-Monteith (Allen
    et al., 1998) method is given as, (1) where Δ is slope of saturation vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), Rn is net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), G is
    soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), Ta is mean daily air temperature at 2 m
    height (°C), U2 is wind speed at 2 m height (m/s), es is the saturation vapour
    pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapour pressure (kPa), (es − ea) is the saturation
    vapour pressure deficit (kPa) and γ is psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1). The
    equation for estimation of ETo by Hargreaves (Allen et al., 1998) method is given
    as, (2) where Tmean mean daily air temperature (°C), Tmax is maximum daily air
    temperature (°C), Tmin is minimum daily air temperature (°C) and Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm day−1). 4. Results and discussions The agro-meteorological observations
    recorded by SenseTube sensing system during one cropping season of Orange i.e.
    July 2014 to August 2015, locally known as Mrig (July-February) and Ambiya (March-October)
    flowering (locally called bahar), are used for the study. The sampling (for air
    temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture) and polling (data
    update to the remote server) frequency were set to fifteen minutes and one hour,
    respectively. In order to compare the performance of SenseTube sensing system,
    a commercially available Automatic Weather Station (AWS) was set in the study
    area. The AWS has been set up according to World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
    guidelines for automatic weather station installation (WMO, 2012). The spatial
    distance between both sensing systems is less than one kilometer. The daily variations
    in air temperature (°C) at test site are shown in Fig. 8. Ranges of daily minimum
    and maximum temperature at the test bed during the said period were observed to
    be 6.44–34.09 °C and 20.30–46.73 °C, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    SenseTube and rainfall events observed by AWS. The soil temperature at 30 cm depth
    varies between 23 °C and 32 °C. It can be observed that there is a steady change
    in soil temperature and rainfall events have very low impact on the change in
    soil temperature at depth of 30 cm. Observed soil temperature shows seasonality
    with the return period of the year which closely resembles with variations in
    surface air temperature. Fig. 11 shows daily volumetric soil moisture at 30 cm
    depth observed by soil moisture sensor mounted on SenseTube. The variations in
    soil moisture are observed to be corresponding rainfall events. The minor variations
    in soil moisture during the absence of rainfall event are caused by irrigation
    events. In selected citrus orchard drip irrigation systems are functional during
    the crop growth period. The volumetric minimum and maximum soil moisture content
    were 12.04% and 48.77%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (445KB)

    underestimates than ETo PM (Fig. 12). The close vicinity of crop canopy and variations
    in field level relative humidity may have caused overestimates of SenseTube based

    proposed SWE hardware and software architecture has unique features over existing
    implementations. The major advantages of proposed SWE architecture are, • Scalability:
    the proposed sensor web enablement architecture based on heterogeneous sensing
    systems provides the ability to seamlessly connect with multiple sensor nodes.
    • On the fly data processing: dense observations of agro-meteorological parameters
    with seamless data access facilitate important decisions regarding irrigation
    interval and depth. • Distributed computing: design of web enabled client has
    a unique advantage for distributed computing of domain specific environmental
    and crop parameters. With evolving OGC SWE specifications there are few limitations
    in the integrated architecture. Some of the major limitations of proposed SWE
    architecture are, • Scaling up estimates from point to region: the proposed SWE
    architecture needs to be configured with OGC Web Feature Service and Web Coverage
    Service to scale-up actual ET estimates at field level. • Need for sensor plug-n-play:
    significant improvements in analog multi-bus (Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C),
    Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), RS485, RS232, etc.) sensor hardware connection
    needs to be integrated on sensing system hardware. • Public availability of sensor
    observations: very few public, private organizations are providing sensor observations
    in OGC O&M specifications which impose limitations on the utility of service oriented
    architectures. However, there is need to compare the studies based on SWE for
    precision agriculture. Comparison of available studies based on selected features
    is discussed in subsequent section. 4.2. Comparison between SWE studies Available
    published studies on SWE architectures for precision agriculture application are
    studied based on features proposed by Chen et al. (2015). The proposed features
    of SWE are architecture, sensors supported, data sharing, process sharing, services
    involved, data model, validation and complexity. In this study two additional
    features were identified for comparison of SWE implementation, (1) sensor plug-n-play
    and (2) SWE integration on hardware. The sensor plug-n-play feature describes
    implementation of OGC PUCK Protocol Standard ensuring seamless integration of
    sensors. Feature on SWE integration with hardware was identified to ensure the
    seamless communication between standardized web-enabled hardware platforms (Table
    2). Table 2. Comparison of SWE based architectures. Empty Cell Features Empty

    in precision agriculture application. The SOA proposed by Korduan et al., 2004,
    Murakami et al., 2007, Nash et al., 2009, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Patil et al.,
    2012, Sawant et al., 2012 primarily focus on SWE of existing sensing systems/platforms.
    Whereas, SOA proposed by Liang and Huang, 2013, Geipel et al., 2016, Chen et al.,
    2015, Du et al., 2016 integrate SWE on hardware layer of sensing system/platform.
    The OGC SWE standards are evaluated for their usability and applicability in precision
    agriculture application. The scalability of proposed architecture is facilitated
    by O&M, SensorML and SOS standards. On the fly data processing and distributed
    computing is facilitated by WPS standard. Integrated geospatial information with
    sensor observations facilitates spatio-temporal estimation of the critical agro-meteorological
    parameter. On-board implementation of the SWE framework facilitates ease in acquiring
    processed information at client interface which has potential to extend sensor
    as a service. The large deployment of such SWE based sensing system facilitates
    system identification and reliable access to sensor observations which facilitates
    the hardware maintenance and remote software (i.e. firmware) updates. 5. Conclusions
    With ever increasing capabilities of open source hardware and software tools,
    cost effective IoT based agro-meteorological observation systems can be designed
    for monitoring the weather conditions at very high precision and temporal scale.
    This will facilitate the open field based agricultural research and decision making
    abilities of resource poor farmers in developing countries. Through on-board implementation
    of OGC specified SOS standards the designed sensing system facilitates storage
    and dissemination of sensor observations thereby reducing syntactic heterogeneity
    among sensing systems. The multiple modes (VPN and cloud service) of sensor data
    transfer over the internet ensured the IoT capability of the sensing system. Sensor
    event notification service through social media (Twitter) has shown the effective
    mode of sensor information dissemination to the larger audience. The web based
    interoperable service oriented application client provides better sensor data
    dissemination capabilities thereby facilitating the stakeholders to easily access
    the required sensor observations. The operational field deployment of the sensing
    system in Orange orchard has proved the capabilities of designed SOA. When implemented
    on large scale these distributed interoperable sensing systems can have very wide
    range of applications in solving the regional issues pertaining to the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. The study has been initiated to collect soil moisture observations
    from multiple depths and locations for validation of proposed modeling approach
    for field scale irrigation scheduling of Orange crop. It has been envisaged to
    integrate OGC specified Sensor Planning Service on sensing platform for effective
    in-situ data processing for better decision making. Attempts are being made towards
    deployment of multiple sensing systems for agro-meteorological data collection
    for precision water management in the horticultural crop (Orange) of the semi-arid
    tropical region of Maharashtra India. Acknowledgements This is a part of research

    \ water management under the increasing pressures of\ncompeting water uses and\
    \ climate change. Diverse water governance regimes have evolved in different countries\
    \ and regions to regulate\nthe development and management of water resources and\
    \ the provision of water services. Scholars and policy analysts have been\ncomparing\
    \ these water governance regimes to analyze elements and processes, to assess\
    \ performance, or to draw lessons. Although the\nnumber of such studies has increased\
    \ since the 1980s, no comprehensive synthesis exists. We present such a synthesis\
    \ by conducting a\nsystematic review of the emerging field of comparative water\
    \ governance studies, and we critically reflect on how water governance is\ndefined,\
    \ conceptualized, and assessed in different contexts. Based on the resultant insights,\
    \ we identify four areas for future research:\n(1) improving the balance between\
    \ small-, medium-, and large-N studies that are used in comparative studies of\
    \ water governance; (2)\nconducting longitudinal comparisons of water governance\
    \ to identify temporal governance trends and patterns; (3) expanding the\ngeographical\
    \ coverage of the comparisons to include underrepresented countries and regions,\
    \ focusing more broadly on the global\nSouth; and (4) addressing the issues of\
    \ justice, equity, and power, which are becoming increasingly important in tackling\
    \ the water\ngovernance challenges that are exacerbated by the effects of climate\
    \ change, industrialization, and urbanization.\nKey Words: comparative analysis;\
    \ comparative studies; systematic review; water governance; water management;\
    \ water policy\nINTRODUCTION\nWater resources are under increasing pressure from\
    \ competing\nuses and climate change (Rockström et al. 2009, IPCC 2014).\nGovernance\
    \ is acknowledged and investigated as a key challenge\nin achieving the long-term\
    \ sustainability of this important\nresource (Rogers and Hall 2003, Bakker et\
    \ al. 2008, OECD 2015,\nPahl-Wostl 2017). Around the globe, diverse water governance\n\
    regimes have evolved to regulate the development and\nmanagement of water resources\
    \ and the provision of water\nservices (Hussey and Dovers 2007, Van De Meene and\
    \ Brown\n2009, OECD 2011). Scholars and policy analysts have responded\nby producing\
    \ a broad body of literature comparing these water\ngovernance regimes to draw\
    \ out diverse lessons (e.g., Benson and\nJordan 2010, Pahl-Wostl et al. 2010,\
    \ Herrala et al. 2012, Araral\nand Wu 2016). Here, we assess the state of scholarship\
    \ on\ncomparative water governance and its main characteristics. We\nidentify\
    \ trends, gaps, and ongoing issues to be resolved as the field\nprogresses.  \n\
    Varying perspectives exist on what defines water governance (de\nLoë and Kreutzwiser\
    \ 2007, Woodhouse and Muller 2017). For\nour purposes, water governance is defined\
    \ as “[…] the social\nfunction that regulates development and management of water\n\
    resources and provisions of water services at different levels of\nsociety and\
    \ guides the resource towards a desirable state and away\nfrom an undesirable\
    \ state” (Pahl-Wostl 2015:25). This definition\nallows for the participation of\
    \ nonstate actors but also\nencompasses situations in which actions and decisions\
    \ are taken\nsolely by state actors. Governance differs from the more\nfunctional\
    \ exercise of water management. Water management is\ndefined as “the activities\
    \ of analyzing and monitoring, developing\nand implementing measures to keep the\
    \ state of a [water] resource\nwithin desirable bounds” (Pahl-Wostl 2009:355).\
    \  \nComparisons of water governance serve several purposes. These\ninclude identifying\
    \ the ways in which water governance is shaped\nacross varied settings, assessing\
    \ performance, and drawing out\nlessons on what works in which context and why\
    \ (Wescoat 2009,\nAraral and Wu 2016). Comparisons often focus on certain\nelements\
    \ of governance. These elements include, among others,\nlaws and policies (e.g.,\
    \ Gemmer et al. 2011), performance (e.g.,\nScott 2015), intersectoral cooperation\
    \ (e.g., Jager 2016), and\npublic participation (e.g., Wehn et al. 2015). They\
    \ also include\nrelated concepts such as integrated water resources management\n\
    (e.g., Brown et al. 2003) and the water–energy–food nexus (e.g.,\nLawford et al.\
    \ 2013). Diverse definitions and methods build the\nbasis for comparing water\
    \ governance concepts and regimes\nacross cities, river basins, countries, sectors,\
    \ and regions, as well\nas across political, institutional, and economic contexts.\
    \  \nAlthough the number of comparative studies in water governance\nis increasing,\
    \ there has not yet been a synthesis of these studies.\nMoreover, little reflection\
    \ has been conducted on the different\ngovernance elements, the methods that are\
    \ chosen for\ncomparison, and the implications of those comparative choices\n\
    for different water problems (excepting Wescoat 2009). To bridge\nthese knowledge\
    \ gaps, we present a systematic review of the\nemerging field of comparative water\
    \ governance studies. We\ncritically reflect on how water governance is defined,\n\

    \ and assessed in diverse contexts, paying specific\nattention to the governance\
    \ elements and methodologies used for\ncomparative analyses. In doing so, we aim\
    \ to provide researchers\nand practitioners with clear direction on how to advance\
    \ the\npractice of comparative analysis in water governance.\nREVIEW METHOD\n\
    To obtain a comprehensive overview of comparative studies of\nwater governance,\
    \ we conducted a social science systematic review\n(Petticrew and Roberts 2008).\
    \ Systematic reviews are useful for\nsynthesizing trends and abstracting findings\
    \ from large bodies of\ninformation. \nThe \nreview \napproach \nand \nprocess\
    \ \nwere\ncollaboratively designed and executed by a team of 12\ninternational\
    \ water governance scholars. All authors participated\nin regular online meetings\
    \ to discuss the data gathering, review,\nand writing process. The review stages\
    \ are detailed in Fig. 1 and\ndescribed further below.\nFig. 1. Schematic representation\
    \ of the systematic review\nprocess.\nData gathering and screening\nThe review\
    \ focuses on publications that compare empirical cases\nfor which data were collected\
    \ by the authors of the publications\nor by other researchers. A “case” refers\
    \ here to a delimited\nphenomenon, or a unit, observed at a single point in time\
    \ or over\nsome period of time (adapted from Gerring 2007:19). During the\ninitial\
    \ screening process, three inclusion criteria were applied:  \n1. The publication\
    \ is written in English; \n2. The publication contains a comparison of at least\
    \ two\nempirical cases across geographical space; \n3. The publication focuses\
    \ on the governance of water\nresources or services (as defined earlier). Publications\
    \ that\ncompared cases from both water governance and other\nrelevant topics such\
    \ as environmental protection were\nincluded in the review (e.g., Newig and Fritsch\
    \ 2009,\nMahalingam et al. 2011). \nDuring the data gathering stage, these criteria\
    \ were translated into\na search string that was designed to capture publications\
    \ that\naddress water governance and apply comparative approaches\n(Table 1).\
    \ Both academic literature and professional publications\nwere targeted. To identify\
    \ peer-reviewed literature (i.e., scientific\njournals, books, book chapters,\
    \ and conference proceedings), the\nsearch string was used to search the Scopus\
    \ database. This search\nreturned 166 publications that met the first three inclusion\n\
    criteria. The search was limited to the period from January 1997\nto March 2017.\
    \ Scopus was selected because of its broad coverage\nof social sciences. We ran\
    \ a parallel search in Google Scholar,\nfocusing on the first 200 results. The\
    \ Google search added 34 new\npublications to our database. To capture professional\
    \ publications\n(“grey” literature), we searched the Organisation for Economic\n\
    Co-operation and Development (http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org)\nand United Nations\
    \ (http://www.un-ilibrary.org) repositories.\nThese searches added 14 publications\
    \ to the review process. After\nremoving duplicates, bibliographic data from 214\
    \ publications\nwere compiled in an online spreadsheet for analysis.  \nThe abstract,\
    \ title, and keywords of each publication were\nscreened by two members of the\
    \ review team (authors of\npublications were not allowed to review their own publications).\n\
    If these three areas provided insufficient information to make a\ndecision on\
    \ inclusion, the full text of the publication was\nexamined. After screening the\
    \ 214 publications, 139 publications\nwere retained for inclusion in the in-depth\
    \ review. We are aware\nof several potentially relevant publications that were\
    \ not captured\nEcology and Society 23(4): 43\nhttps://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\n\
    by the database scans. However, the final database is the result of\nthe strict\
    \ application of selection criteria and provides sufficient\ncoverage of publications\
    \ on comparative water governance to\ndevelop comprehensive insights.\nIn-depth\
    \ review process\nDuring the in-depth review process, two more inclusion criteria\n\
    were applied in addition to the first three criteria:  \n1. The publication provides\
    \ sufficient information to conduct\nan in-depth review of the parameters used\
    \ for the\ncomparison, data sources, data collection, and analysis\nmethods; \n\
    2. The publication’s full-text version is available to the review\nteam. \nOne\
    \ publication was excluded because the review team could not\naccess the full\
    \ text. Another 34 publications were excluded\nbecause they were conceptual rather\
    \ than empirical (N = 11) or\nthey did not focus on water governance or provide\
    \ sufficient\ninformation to conduct an in-depth review (N = 23). The results\n\
    presented here are based on the analysis of the final dataset of\n104 publications\
    \ (see Appendix 1 for the list of publications\nincluded in the in-depth review).\
    \  \nThe review process was guided by a review matrix that contained\nentries\
    \ for thematic and geographic scope, definition of water\ngovernance, comparative\
    \ framework, governance elements that\nare being compared, unit of analysis, case\
    \ selection rationale, case\ndelineation, data collection and analysis methods,\
    \ and\ncomparative methods. An initial version of the matrix was\ndeveloped based\
    \ on existing reviews of water governance and\nmanagement (e.g., Cook and Bakker\
    \ 2012, González Tánago et\nal. 2016, Varady et al. 2016). This matrix was tested\
    \ by the review\nteam using the same four publications to ensure that all team\n\
    members had a common understanding of the review categories.\nThe matrix was refined\
    \ based on feedback from team members.\nThe refined matrix (Appendix 2) was then\
    \ used to review the 104\nfull-text publications. Each publication was reviewed\
    \ by two\nmembers of the review team. Each team member reviewed\napproximately\
    \ 11 publications as first reviewer, and another 11\npublications as second reviewer.\
    \ Differences in interpretation\nwere resolved through discussions between the\
    \ two reviewers and,\nwhere necessary, with the larger review team.\nLimitations\n\
    The final database of reviewed publications does not contain any\nprofessional\
    \ studies, despite the initial aim to capture that\nliterature. The selection\
    \ criteria required sufficient information\non the comparative framework and methods\
    \ used to conduct an\nin-depth review using the review matrix. None of the professional\n\
    publications returned in the searches provided sufficient\ninformation. Book chapters\
    \ and introductions or conclusions to\njournal special issues were often excluded\
    \ for the same reason. As\nwell, given our interest in elements and methods of\
    \ comparison,\nonly publications that compared at least two empirical cases were\n\
    included in the review. As a result, conceptual papers, which did\nnot compare\
    \ empirical cases, were excluded. Finally, review is a\nsubjective process that\
    \ involves many decisions regarding how to\nclassify publications. We attempted\
    \ to limit subjectivity through\nthe review process described above. However,\
    \ some variation in\ninterpretation is inevitable.\nEMERGENCE AND CONCEPTUAL BASIS\
    \ OF\nCOMPARATIVE WATER GOVERNANCE STUDIES\nHere, we provide a descriptive overview\
    \ of the evolution of the\ncomparative water governance field based on an analysis\
    \ of the\nreviewed publications. We focus on how attention to comparative\nstudies\
    \ is evolving, how water governance is defined, what\ngovernance elements are\
    \ compared, and which frameworks are\nused.\nComparative studies of water governance\
    \ in the academic\nliterature\nTo obtain a comprehensive overview of the scholarly\
    \ literature\non comparative water governance, we analyzed the number of\npublications\
    \ over time and in different journals, the publications\nthat were most widely\
    \ cited, and the major issues on which the\nreviewed publications focused. Examining\
    \ the number of\npublications over the past two decades (1997–2017) showed a\n\
    gradual increase since 2009 (Fig. 2). Because the publications were\nselected\
    \ through a systematic process, this is an indication that\nscholarly attention\
    \ to comparing water governance across two or\nmore case studies is growing.\n\
    Fig. 2. Number of publications each year meeting the search\ncriteria (January\
    \ 1997–March 2017).\nAlthough the comparative studies on water governance are\n\
    published in diverse outlets, the most popular journals were\nEnvironmental Policy\
    \ and Governance (nine publications), Ecology\nand Society (seven publications),\
    \ Water Policy and Environmental\nScience and Policy (six publications each),\
    \ and Regional\nEnvironmental Change and Water International (four publications\n\
    each). Further analysis of the most widely cited comparative\nwater governance\
    \ publications in Scopus (Table 2) shows that\nmost of these publications were\
    \ published in water- or\nenvironment-oriented journals in the period between\
    \ 2009 and\n2012. The number of cases compared as well as the methods used\nfor\
    \ comparison vary significantly. There is no correlation between\na high number\
    \ of citations and a specific journal or method, or\na high or low number of cases.\
    \ The first publication (Newig and\nFritsch 2009), which stands out in terms of\
    \ number of citations,\nis a meta-analysis of 47 cases on environmental governance,\n\
    including cases on water governance.  \nComparative water governance studies focus\
    \ on a wide range of\nwater-related issues (Table 3). The greatest proportion\
    \ of the\nreviewed publications (N = 25) focuses on river basin\nmanagement. Other\
    \ issues that were frequently examined include\nagriculture (N = 14) and urban\
    \ water services (N = 13). The\nmajority of the agriculture-oriented publications\
    \ are centered on\nEcology and Society 23(4): 43\nhttps://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\n\

    \ services, water supply (N = 4), water\nutilities (N = 3), and wastewater (N\
    \ = 3) are the three main\nsubissues examined. The remaining categories all contain\
    \ between\nfour and seven publications. Our selection includes 27\npublications\
    \ that did not fall within one of the predefined\ncategories. These publications\
    \ focus on diverse issues such as\ncoastal recreational water quality, water quality\
    \ in urban and rural\nareas, and comparison of user- vs. agency- vs. market-based\n\
    governance.\nDefinition of water governance\nFor the selected publications, we\
    \ analyzed whether and how water\ngovernance was defined. Of the 104 publications,\
    \ 31 do not\nprovide a definition of water governance or of a specific aspect\n\
    or form of governance. Almost half of the reviewed publications\n(N = 51) provide\
    \ a definition of a specific aspect or form of water\ngovernance, rather than\
    \ a generic definition. The aspects that were\nmost commonly defined are public\
    \ participation or participatory\ngovernance (N = 6) and adaptive capacity or\
    \ governance (N = 5).\nIn addition, definitions of the following aspects or forms\
    \ of\ngovernance were provided in three publications each:\ngroundwater governance,\
    \ multilevel governance, collaboration or\ncollaborative governance, and integrated\
    \ water (resources)\nmanagement. The remaining publications in this category (N\
    \ =\n28) provide definitions for a wide range of governance aspects\nand forms.\n\

    4\nOther\n27\nTotal\n104\nOnly two publications propose their own definition of\
    \ water\ngovernance. First, Pahl-Wostl et al. (2012:25) define water\ngovernance\
    \ as a system with “structural features and transient\nprocesses at both rule\
    \ making and operational levels,” that “takes\ninto account the different actors\
    \ and networks that help formulate\nand implement water policy.” Araral and Yu\
    \ (2013:5307) define\nwater governance in terms of “various dimensions of water\
    \ law,\npolicies, and administration that have been commonly regarded\nin the\
    \ literature as determinants of performance. These include\nwater rights, pricing,\
    \ decentralization, accountability, integration,\nprivate sector participation,\
    \ user group participation, and\norganizational basis of water management, among\
    \ others.”  \nFrom the reviewed publications, fewer than one-quarter of them\n\
    (N = 20) refer to an existing definition of water governance. Only\nEcology and\
    \ Society 23(4): 43\nhttps://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\none\
    \ existing definition of water governance, which is the definition\nby the United\
    \ Nations Development Programme (UNDP 1997),\nis cited in two publications. All\
    \ other existing definitions (18 in\ntotal) are cited only once. In eight publications,\
    \ two different\nreferences are cited when providing a definition of water\ngovernance.\
    \ This result implies that there is no common approach\nto defining water governance\
    \ within studies of comparative water\ngovernance. However, this situation may\
    \ be partially explained\nby the emphasis of comparative studies on varying aspects\
    \ or\nforms of governance, rather than a broad, encompassing\ndefinition of water\
    \ governance.\nGovernance elements being compared\nTo understand what is being\
    \ compared, we identified eight\ndifferent categories of water governance elements\
    \ (Table 4). These\ngovernance elements are based on Rogers and Hall (2003), one\n\
    of the most-cited publications that elaborates on the principles\nand conditions\
    \ of water governance. Rogers and Hall (2003)\nacknowledge the integrated nature\
    \ of the principles and\nconditions for operationalizing normative or performance-\n\
    oriented governance concepts such as “good” and “effective”\nwater governance.\
    \ We used these concepts as the basis for\ncategorizing the multiple elements\
    \ of water governance; however,\nwe did not apply them to evaluate the governance\
    \ systems. While\nscrutinizing the governance elements compared in the reviewed\n\
    publications, we observed that most publications considered two\nor more governance\
    \ elements (N = 66). The most common\ngovernance element is “legislation, instruments,\
    \ and policies” (N \n= 52). For example, Lopez-Gunn (2003) compares the types\
    \ of\nrules developed by different regional water authorities in Spain.\nLikewise,\
    \ \nErickson \n(2015) \ncompares \nstate-level \nwater\nmanagement and funding\
    \ policies in USA.\nTable 4. Theoretical concepts or governance elements that\
    \ were\nassessed and compared in the publications.\n \nConcept or element\nNumber\

    29\nResources\n28\nKnowledge or expertise\n17\nOther\n20\n“Participation and stakeholder\
    \ involvement” is often interpreted\nas a key component of water governance, as\
    \ reflected in the high\nnumber of publications (N = 41) focusing on it. However,\
    \ the\nissues investigated in relation to participation vary significantly.\n\
    For example, Wehn et al. (2015) compare participation in flood\nrisk management\
    \ in the UK, Netherlands, and Italy. Benson et\nal. (2013) specifically compare\
    \ the nature and quality of\nparticipation in their examination of the collaborative\
    \ turn in\nwater management across Europe, USA, and Australia.\nPublications focusing\
    \ on “water or environmental management\nand outcomes” (N = 37) often look at\
    \ the efficacy of water\ngovernance. For example, Scott (2015) systematically\
    \ compares\nphysical water quality indicators to determine whether\ncollaborative\
    \ governance processes actually produce the\nimproved environmental outcomes that\
    \ they are assumed to\ncreate. The next most common category (N = 36) specifically\n\
    compares “cooperation and coordination.” To illustrate, Pahl-\nWostl et al. (2012)\
    \ compare regimes varying in coordination and\npower distribution and determine\
    \ that those with distributed\npower but effective coordination perform better\
    \ than those\nwithout such characteristics. Other common categories were\n“governance\
    \ qualities” such as transparency, inclusion,\ncoherence, equity, accountability,\
    \ efficiency, and adaptiveness (N \n= 35); “governance levels” (N = 29); “resources”\
    \ such as power\nand finance (N = 28); and “knowledge or expertise” (N = 17).\
    \ The\npublications in which the compared governance elements were\nnot sufficiently\
    \ captured by the eight predefined categories were\nassigned to the ninth category:\
    \ “other” (N = 20).\nFrameworks used to perform comparative analysis\nWe expected\
    \ frameworks to play an important role in comparative\nstudies. Following Ostrom\
    \ (1990:192), we define a framework as\na “set of variables and the types of relationships\
    \ among variables\nthat need to be examined in conducting any theoretical or\n\
    empirical study of a particular type of phenomenon.” The\nframeworks for performing\
    \ comparative analysis fall into one of\nfour categories: (1) application of an\
    \ existing framework for the\ncomparison of cases; (2) development of a new framework\
    \ based\non theory, which is then used for the comparison of cases; (3)\ninductive\
    \ development of a new framework out of the comparison\nof cases; and (4) no or\
    \ unclear framework.  \nAlmost half of the publications (N = 54) develop their\
    \ own\nframework from existing theory and then use it to compare cases.\nOf these,\
    \ 32 publications created “original” frameworks that used\ndiverse theory to construct\
    \ a new framework for comparison. For\nexample, Van Buuren et al. (2016) use theory\
    \ on policy processes,\npower, and framing to develop a comparative framework\
    \ that\nexamines processes of “puzzling, powering, and framing.” The\nremainder\
    \ of articles in this category (N = 22) create a new\nframework by building on\
    \ a specific existing framework or\napproach.  \nAbout one-fifth of the publications\
    \ (N = 19) use existing\nframeworks for comparison without making major modifications.\n\
    Ostrom´s institutional analysis and design (IAD) and social-\necological system\
    \ (SES) frameworks, both based on institutional\ndesign principles, are used most\
    \ frequently (N = 4 each). Dinar\nand Saleth’s (2005) framework on water policies,\
    \ laws, and\nadministrations, and Bressers et al.’s (2013) water governance\n\
    assessment tool are both applied twice. Other existing frameworks\nthat were identified\
    \ are all used just once. No single framework\nemerged that is widely used for\
    \ comparative analyses of water\ngovernance in its original form.  \nThere was\
    \ significant diversity in the frameworks used after\nmodifications or adaptations.\
    \ Two frameworks were most often\nmodified or adapted to build new frameworks,\
    \ namely, Ostrom’s\ndesign principles (N = 4), and Pahl-Wostl’s framework for\n\
    analyzing regime characteristics (N = 3). For example, Huntjens\net al. (2010)\
    \ integrate Pahl-Wostl’s (2007) framework with the\nriver basin assessment framework\
    \ of Raadgever et al. (2008) to\ndevelop a new framework for comparison.  \nEcology\
    \ and Society 23(4): 43\nhttps://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\n\
    Fig. 3. Number of cases located in a specific macroregion and country.\nIn seven\
    \ publications, authors construct new frameworks through\nan inductive approach.\
    \ In these cases, the comparative framework\nis developed as a result of the comparative\
    \ analysis instead of\nusing a predefined framework to guide comparisons. For\
    \ example,\nLebel et al. (2005) follow an inductive process to develop and test\n\
    measures of “fit” relative to water governance regimes. These fit\nmeasures are\
    \ then compared across geographical settings.  \nUpon in-depth examination, we\
    \ found that almost one-quarter\nof the studies (N = 24) that made it through\
    \ the first two rounds\nof screening do not clearly articulate their comparative\n\
    framework, i.e., they did not explicitly show which specific\ngovernance elements\
    \ they compared. These articles contained\nenough information for the review team\
    \ to conduct a review, but\nrequired close reading of the study results to determine\
    \ what\nauthors were comparing. For example, Brown et al. (2006)\nsummarize findings\
    \ across three cases and provide lessons on\nimpediments to the implementation\
    \ of sustainable urban water\nmanagement. However, they do so without clearly\
    \ describing the\nelements they compared.  \nA cross-sectional analysis of the\
    \ frameworks and the compared\ngovernance elements shows that when existing frameworks\
    \ are\nused (N = 19), comparisons mainly focus on multilevel governance\nsystems\
    \ and institutions (N = 3 each). For papers that develop\ntheir own frameworks\
    \ from existing theory (N = 54), comparisons\nfocus mainly on actors, institutions,\
    \ multilevel governance, and\nadaptive capacity.\nCASES, DATA, AND METHODS USED\
    \ FOR\nCOMPARING WATER GOVERNANCE\nHere, we focus on the empirical cases that\
    \ are compared in the\nreviewed publications. We examine why the cases are selected,\n\
    where they are located, what boundaries are used to delineate\ncases, and what\
    \ data and methods are used.\nCase selection rationale\nDuring the review process,\
    \ we collected qualitative information\nabout the rationale behind the selection\
    \ of empirical cases for\ncomparison. Four general, partly overlapping categories\
    \ emerged\nas we refined the review matrix. The most frequent rationale (N \n\
    = 42) is the selection of cases that are similar (in terms of key\ncharacteristics)\
    \ or most similar (cases are very similar and only\ndiffer in the dependent variable).\
    \ For publications in this category,\nthe authors’ main goal is to examine and\
    \ understand a specific\nissue in multiple, similar cases. For example, Brisbois\
    \ and de Loë\n(2017) studied the actions, roles, and motivations of the natural\n\
    resource industries involved in collaborative water governance in\ntwo case studies\
    \ that involve active participation of both\nprovincial government representatives\
    \ and major natural resource\nindustry actors. Silveira et al. (2016) selected\
    \ cases from two river\nbasins that are similar (industrialized, densely populated,\
    \ and\nintense trade-offs) and thus likely to necessitate cross-sectoral\ncollaboration.\
    \ They compare two cases that are very similar (two\nsub-basins of the same river\
    \ basin) as well as two sub-basins that\nare similar but differ in terms of physical\
    \ and governance\ncharacteristics (European vs. Chinese catchments).  \nAnother\
    \ popular rationale (N = 20) is to study specific issues or\nto extract some critical\
    \ findings by comparing diverse cases. For\nexample, Mosello (2015) examine adaptive\
    \ capacity across\ndeveloped and developing country cases. Meijerink and Huitema\n\
    (2010) compared 16 diverse cases to extract the change strategies\nof policy entrepreneurs\
    \ in water transitions.  \nData availability is also a frequent rationale for\
    \ case selection (N \n= 14). For example, Lebel et al. (2013) and Knieper and\
    \ Pahl-\nWostl (2016) both use the data set that was created during the\nEuropean\
    \ Twin2Go project. However, most of studies that cite\ndata availability as a\
    \ case selection rationale also indicate other\nrationales. For example, Newig\
    \ and Fritsch (2009) explain that,\nalthough completeness of information was their\
    \ main selection\ncriterion, they used a diversity of cases in terms of political\
    \ issues,\nscales, and societal contexts as other criteria.  \nLastly, almost\
    \ one-quarter of publications (N = 28) do not provide\na clear rationale for case\
    \ selection. They refer to similarities and\ndifferences at the same time (N =\
    \ 8) or simply focus on a specific\nEcology and Society 23(4): 43\nhttps://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\n\
    geographical area (N = 20). For example, Yu et al. (2016) studied\ntwo villages\
    \ in the Shiyang River basin to explore whether water\nuser associations can improve\
    \ water governance in China. The\nreasoning for selecting these cases is not explained\
    \ in the\npublication.\nLocations and boundaries of cases\nFor all reviewed publications,\
    \ we identified the locations of the\ncompared cases in terms of their macroregions\
    \ and countries (Fig.\n3). From this analysis, it can be discerned that Europe\
    \ (145 cases)\nand Asia (141 cases) are by far the most represented macroregions.\n\
    In contrast, USA and Australia are the most-studied countries, with\n25 and 22\
    \ cases, respectively, although they are both in other\nmacroregions. The Netherlands\
    \ is the most-studied country in\nEurope (21 cases), whereas China is the most-studied\
    \ country in\nAsia (20 cases).  \nIt is also worth noting that, in some publications,\
    \ the European\nUnion (EU) is treated as a single unit of analysis to compare\
    \ it with\nfederal political systems such as in USA and Australia (e.g., Benson\n\
    and Jordan 2010, Benson et al. 2012, 2013). Also of interest is that\nthe single\
    \ states of the USA are sometimes compared with other\ncountries. This means that\
    \ there are some cases where the\njurisdictional comparison is not between similar\
    \ administrative\nunits but, for example, between a subnational unit and a national\n\
    unit, or a national unit and a multinational unit.  \nPublications were also analyzed\
    \ with regard to the jurisdictional\nand hydrological boundaries applied to delineate\
    \ cases. We found\nthat 85 publications use jurisdictional boundaries, 18 publications\n\
    use hydrological boundaries, and 31 publications use both\nhydrological and jurisdictional\
    \ boundaries to delineate cases (Fig.\n4). For example, Pahl-Wostl et al. (2013)\
    \ delineate their cases by a\ncombination of jurisdictional and hydrological boundaries\
    \ (i.e.,\nHungarian Tisza basin, German Rhine basin, Dutch Rhine basin).\nIn one\
    \ publication (Edelenbos et al. 2015), it is unclear from the\ncase descriptions\
    \ whether the names of the selected cases represent\nhydrological or jurisdictional\
    \ boundaries.\nFig. 4. Number of cases using different types of jurisdictional\n\
    and hydrological boundaries.\nFrom the publications that apply jurisdictional\
    \ boundaries (either\nexclusively or in combination with hydrological boundaries),\n\
    countries are used to define case boundaries in 42 of these\npublications. Subnational\
    \ (N = 30) and local (N = 22) boundaries\nare also used. Multinational boundaries\
    \ (9 publications) are the\nleast common. In the set of publications using hydrological\n\
    boundaries, the type used most often are sub-basins of\ntransboundary or domestic\
    \ basins (N = 27) followed by whole\ndomestic basins (N = 24; Fig. 4).\nCase study\
    \ data and methods\nThe number of cases compared varies widely, ranging between\
    \ 2\nand 233. Most publications include two (N = 41) or three (N =\n20) case studies\
    \ in their comparisons. More than 50 cases are\ncompared in only three publications\
    \ (Heikkila 2004, Scott 2015,\nZingraff-Hamed et al. 2017).  \nWe categorized\
    \ the publications with regard to the use of primary\nand secondary data. Primary\
    \ data implies that original data are\ncollected directly by the researchers involved,\
    \ e.g., through\ninterviews, questionnaires, observations, or document analysis,\n\
    to meet a specific research goal (Hox and Boeije 2005). Secondary\ndata are gathered\
    \ on the basis of previous studies; these data can\ninclude sources such as censuses,\
    \ government reports, and\nprevious projects that did not involve the authors\
    \ (Ghauri and\nGrønhaug 2005). Many of the reviewed publications (N = 59) are\n\
    based on primary data. For these publications, data were collected\nmainly using\
    \ qualitative methods such as interviews and\ndocument analysis. In addition,\
    \ a few publications are based on\nlarge-N surveys (e.g., Lebel et al. 2013, Kadirbeyoglu\
    \ and Özertan\n2015, Harris et al. 2017, Zingraff-Hamed et al. 2017). We also\n\
    identified one publication for which the authors conducted field\nexperiments\
    \ (Ibele et al. 2017). Only seven publications are based\nexclusively on secondary\
    \ data. These data were sometimes\nobtained for research purposes by other authors\
    \ (Doorn 2017) or\nby the authors themselves (Pahl-Wostl and Knieper 2014, de\
    \ Boer\net al. 2016) within the context of previous research. In several\npublications,\
    \ the authors use data that were collected by others\nfor organizational purposes\
    \ (Herrala et al. 2012) or within the\ncontext of cyclical reporting (Jager 2016).\
    \ Finally, 24 publications\nused both primary and secondary data, whereas 15 publications\n\
    did not provide detailed information about how data, most\nnotably documents,\
    \ were collected and analyzed.  \nTo obtain an improved understanding of the methods\
    \ that are\nused in comparative water governance analysis, we made a\ndistinction\
    \ among three broad categories of methods: (1)\nqualitative methods, (2) quantitative\
    \ methods, and (3) set-\ntheoretic methods (Table 5). Set-theoretic methods are\
    \ studied as\na separate category because they focus on membership scores of\n\
    elements in sets. These methods are particularly useful when\ncomparison aims\
    \ to draw attention to complex causal patterns.\nOne of the most well-known set-theoretic\
    \ methods applied in\nwater governance research is qualitative comparative analysis.\
    \ It\nis often applied to the analysis of a mid-sized number of cases,\nbut can\
    \ also be used to analyze a large number of cases (Schneider\nand Wagemann 2012).\
    \  \nA majority of the analyzed publications (N = 76) compares cases\nusing qualitative\
    \ methods only. Most of these qualitative studies\n(N = 56) compare only two or\
    \ three cases. In 17 publications, four\nto six cases are compared. Three publications\
    \ compare a mid-\nsized number of cases (11–16). Three-quarters of the exclusively\n\
    qualitative studies (N = 56) compare cases on the basis of\ndescriptive information\
    \ only. To allow for a more systemic\napproach or comparison, authors sometimes\
    \ use systematic\ncoding of data (e.g., Brisbois and de Loë 2016) or present their\n\
    results in tables (e.g., Vink et al. 2015) or visuals (Pahl-Wostl et\nEcology\
    \ and Society 23(4): 43\nhttps://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\n\
    al. 2013). In addition, comparisons are sometimes made using\ncategories to rank\
    \ the cases systematically (e.g., absence or\npresence; measurement scales; low,\
    \ medium, or high; none, little,\nor strong).\nTable 5. Number of publications\
    \ using qualitative, quantitative\n(statistical), or set-theoretic methods as\

    \ methods are used together\nwith qualitative or set-theoretic methods. Therefore,\
    \ quantitative\nmethods are counted twice, and the total number sums to 15.\n\
    Quantitative methods are used to compare cases in 22\npublications, but only a\
    \ minority (N = 7) of these studies solely\napplies quantitative methods. The\
    \ quantitative methods that are\napplied include descriptive statistics (e.g.,\
    \ weighted mean,\nstandard deviation), statistical analysis (e.g., regression\
    \ or\ncorrelation analysis, measures of fit), and other quantitative\nmethods\
    \ such as economic models or data envelopment analysis\n(a programming methodology\
    \ to measure the efficiency of\nmultiple decision-making units). For example,\
    \ Chai and Schoon\n(2016) use data envelopment analysis to measure the efficiency\
    \ of\ngovernment spending, and use qualitative comparative analysis\nto compare\
    \ data for 20 counties in south China.  \nIn 12 publications, both quantitative\
    \ and qualitative methods are\nused. For example, Huntjens et al. (2010) combine\
    \ formal\ncomparative analysis with qualitative information to compare\ncases.\
    \ Pahl-Wostl et al. (2012) combine linear regression analysis\nwith case-sensitive\
    \ analysis and clustering. Zingraff-Hamed et al.\n(2017) compare cases using methods\
    \ for statistical analysis and\nqualitative textual analysis. We also identified\
    \ three publications\nthat combine quantitative methods with methods for qualitative\n\
    comparative analysis. Publications that rely on statistical methods\nalone are\
    \ relatively uncommon (N = 5).  \nIn five publications, quantitative methods are\
    \ used to compare a\nlarge number of cases (> 40). For example, Scott (2015) uses\n\
    hierarchical linear regression modeling to compare 233\ncollaborative watershed\
    \ groups. Dinar and Saleth (2005) use\ndescriptive statistics to compare water\
    \ institutions across 43\ncountries. Newig and Fritsch (2009) present a meta-analysis\
    \ of\n47 participatory governance cases. In seven publications,\nquantitative\
    \ methods are also used when authors compare a very\nsmall number of cases. For\
    \ example, Araral and Ratra (2016)\ncompare water governance in India and China,\
    \ and Harris et al.\n(2017) compare urban settlements in Ghana and South Africa\n\
    with respect to gender issues. In both publications, data were\ncollected using\
    \ a survey questionnaire and were analyzed using\nstatistical methods. The two\
    \ countries were then compared on the\nbasis of the resulting quantitative figures.\
    \ Thus, the actual\ncomparison was not done using statistical analysis.\nDISCUSSION\n\
    Our review reveals a number of findings that help characterize\nthe field of comparative\
    \ water governance, and illuminates\ndirections for improvement and future research.\
    \ We highlight\nthree important issues.\nEmergence of comparative water governance\
    \ studies as a new\nfield\nThe analysis of reviewed publications shows several\
    \ general\ntrends in the practice of comparative water governance. In\nparticular,\
    \ the comparative study of water governance is a\nrelatively recent phenomenon.\
    \ Most comparative studies of water\ngovernance have been published since 2009.\
    \ This finding is likely\nreflective of the fact that water governance itself\
    \ is a fairly young\nfield (Pahl-Wostl 2015). Discussions of “governance,” as\
    \ opposed\nto “government,” arose in the 1980s amid increasing political and\n\
    institutional reforms that introduced market-focused as well as\nparticipatory\
    \ mechanisms. Private companies and civil society\norganizations were increasingly\
    \ seen to have a role in making and\nexecuting decisions that had formerly been\
    \ the sole purview of\ngovernments (Rhodes 1996, Peters 2001). Studies that examine\n\
    water governance have proliferated since the late 1980s\n(Woodhouse and Muller\
    \ 2017). As the literature has expanded,\nit is logical that scholars have begun\
    \ to focus on what generalizable\nfindings can be gleaned by comparing across\
    \ multiple cases. We\nexpect that there will be more emphasis on comparing water\n\
    governance across different settings in the coming years.\nConceptual basis of\
    \ comparative water governance studies\nDefinitions of water governance are very\
    \ distinct or diffuse, and\nthere is no agreement on a common definition. Similarly,\
    \ there is\nno single framework that is widely used for comparative analyses\n\
    of water governance. More than half of researchers substantially\nmodified existing\
    \ frameworks, or developed their own framework\nfrom existing theory, and then\
    \ used this to compare cases (e.g.,\nHeikilla 2004, Erickson 2015). Nevertheless,\
    \ digging more deeply\ninto the frameworks that are used as base material to create\n\
    modified frameworks, the influence of Elinor Ostrom on the field\nof comparative\
    \ water governance becomes clear. Ostrom’s own\nwork (e.g., Ostrom 1990) is directly\
    \ cited only eight times across\npublications that either made use of her framework\
    \ directly or\nmodified it. However, many of the other frameworks that are cited\n\
    draw upon Ostrom’s design principles or the IAD framework. For\nexample, the management\
    \ and transition framework of Pahl-\nWostl et al. (2010) builds upon the “action\
    \ situation” concept in\nthe IAD framework (Ostrom 2005), and the water governance\n\
    assessment tool of Bressers et al. (2013, 2016) references Ostrom’s\ndesign principles\
    \ and ideas.  \nMore generally, there appear to be three distinct substreams\n\
    within the research community. In the first substream, researchers\nfocus on building\
    \ databases and abstracting findings based on\ncomparisons that use broad frameworks\
    \ in a systematic manner\nto make more defensible claims (e.g., Knieper and Pahl-Wostl\n\
    2016). This idea can be traced back to the SES framework (Ostrom\n2007), which\
    \ allows sophisticated analyses and comparisons of\nSESs to overcome the promotion\
    \ of panaceas in resources\nmanagement. Publications using the management and\
    \ transition\nframework provide another example of this substream (e.g.,\nKnieper\
    \ et al. 2010, Pahl-Wostl et al. 2013). The second substream\nbuilds upon existing\
    \ theory to fill gaps in the understanding of\nEcology and Society 23(4): 43\n\
    https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\nwater governance dynamics,\
    \ even if it is only through small-N \nstudies. This group appears to be interested\
    \ in pushing the\nconceptual boundaries as they try to account for the complexity\n\
    of water governance by using different ideas, concepts, and\nframeworks drawn\
    \ from diverse disciplines and experiences (e.g.,\nGemmer et al. 2011, Clarvis\
    \ and Engle 2015). Unlike the first\nsubstream, these studies do not abstract\
    \ from case studies, but\ninstead try to make profound descriptions of specific\
    \ governance\nconcepts. For instance, Kadirbeyoglu and Özertan (2015)\nelaborate\
    \ on the role of power in irrigation management\ndecentralization in Turkey by\
    \ linking their assessment to the IAD\nframework. Finally, the third substream\
    \ focuses on understanding\ncase- or place-based problems. These studies may not\
    \ always\ncontribute substantially to theory building but provide valuable\nobservations\
    \ and insights on the situations under study. For\nexample, Mahalingam et al.\
    \ (2011) studied three coordination\nagencies that were involved in water and\
    \ sanitation projects in\nIndia and observed their performance through five parameters\n\
    that were not linked to any specific theoretical framework.\nFindings from the\
    \ second and third substreams, if sufficiently\nestablished, are often taken up\
    \ by the first, and more rigorously\nestablished through systematic analysis.\
    \ For example, as\nMcGinnis and Ostrom (2014) argue, the IAD framework was\nmainly\
    \ shaped based on multiple case studies analyzed by the\nIndiana University Bloomington\
    \ Workshop in Political Theory\nand Policy Analysis.  \nThe wide range of conceptual\
    \ approaches used in designing and\nadapting analytical frameworks indicates that\
    \ water governance\nis a topic of broad relevance that cuts across disciplinary\n\
    boundaries. Approaches that use new or modified frameworks to\nfill gaps in the\
    \ understanding of water governance are extremely\nimportant. For example, Clement’s\
    \ (2010) use of power theory to\nmodify the IAD framework (Ostrom 1990, 1999,\
    \ 2005) provides\na valuable, refined tool that helps to account for the ways\
    \ that\npower shapes governance processes and defines outcomes.\nLikewise, large-N\
    \ studies have the ability to test theoretical\npropositions and generate findings\
    \ that can be applied across\ncontexts. For example, Knieper and Pahl-Wostl (2016)\
    \ show that\ngood environmental status in river basins seems to depend\nprimarily\
    \ on the overall level of pressure from human use rather\nthan the quality of\
    \ water management. Just as small-N studies\nare unable to claim broad generalizability,\
    \ large-N studies often\npaint with a very broad brush that needs to be contextualized\
    \ to\nbe applicable to local contexts. However, together, the two\napproaches\
    \ appear to be contributing to a robust system of\nknowledge generation.  \nOur\
    \ analysis of the frameworks also revealed that almost one-\nquarter of the reviewed\
    \ publications did not establish a clear\ncomparative framework. This finding\
    \ means that they did not\nscrutinize the relationships among the different variables\
    \ that they\nused for comparing the multiple cases and, thus, lacked the\ntheoretical\
    \ or empirical foundation for making sound\ncomparisons. The high prevalence of\
    \ such publications indicates\nthat there is significant room for improvement\
    \ for researchers,\njournal editors, and reviewers in producing strong, clearly\
    \ defined\nresults from comparative research.\nEmpirical basis of comparative\
    \ water governance studies\nDespite the expansion of comparative studies, the\
    \ number of\ncases compared remains fairly low. Studies that compared more\nthan\
    \ five cases were relatively infrequent (N = 28). This result\nlikely reflects\
    \ the largely qualitative approach that has been taken\nin studies of water governance\
    \ (N = 76). Examining large-N \nstudies using qualitative methods can be extremely\
    \ time and\nresource consuming. For this reason, it is logical that large-N \n\
    qualitative studies are rare. However, publication rates of studies\nbased on\
    \ large-N studies have been increasing in recent years. This\ntrend may lead to\
    \ a new class of generalizable findings that can\ncontribute to the understanding\
    \ of water governance. For\nexample, Zingraff-Hamed et al. (2017) analyzed 75\
    \ urban river\nrestoration projects and found that the role of macrolevel\ngovernance\
    \ is often limited. Instead, factors such as the\nrelationships between nature,\
    \ people, and the river, which are\nexpressed through microlevel governance, are\
    \ often more\nimportant in shaping governance outcomes. Using these methods,\n\
    such findings can be more reliably applied to other contexts.  \nThe compared\
    \ cases are unevenly distributed across the globe\n(Fig. 5). This pattern reflects\
    \ the uneven distribution of global\nresources, including within the research\
    \ community (Salager-\nMeyer 2008). High concentrations of studies in Europe and\
    \ Asia,\nand particularly, in USA, Australia, the Netherlands, and China,\nreflect\
    \ a bias in the distribution of global wealth, combined with\nthose countries\
    \ that have particularly pressing water issues such\nas sea-level rise in the\
    \ heavily dyked Netherlands and water supply\nand distribution in drought-prone\
    \ Australia. Although the\noverrepresentation of USA, China, and Australia can\
    \ also be\nexplained by their size, the Netherlands constitutes an exception,\n\
    given its relatively small area. Scholars publishing on water issues\nin developing\
    \ countries may also be more likely to frame their\nresearch according to development\
    \ challenges, rather than using\nwater governance terminology. Such publications\
    \ would not be\ncaptured by our review’s search criteria.  \nThe majority of reviewed\
    \ publications uses jurisdictional\nboundaries for case delineation. Since the\
    \ late 1990s, there has\nbeen a strong push to use hydrological boundaries as\
    \ management\nand governance units (e.g., Rogers and Hall 2003). This trend is\n\
    reflected in national and international water governance strategies\nsuch as the\
    \ Canadian Water for Life policy (i.e., watershed-based\nprotection and advisory\
    \ committees), the Australian Catchment\nand Land Protection Act (i.e., catchment\
    \ management\nauthorities), and the EU Water Framework Directive (i.e., river\n\
    basin districts). However, our findings indicate that it is often\nmore relevant\
    \ to examine water governance initiatives according\nto the boundaries within\
    \ which relevant laws and regulations are\nenacted, or using a combination of\
    \ administrative and watershed\nboundaries. De Loë and Patterson (2017) argue\
    \ that the focus on\nwatersheds has the potential to limit the uptake and utility\
    \ of\nwater research by framing out many of the issues that\nfundamentally shape\
    \ governance processes and outcomes. In this\nregard, Mollinga et al. (2007) also\
    \ use the term “problemshed,”\ninstead of watershed, to emphasize the importance\
    \ of inherent\npolitical characteristics and the plurality of actors, institutions,\n\
    and objectives in water governance. The importance of\njurisdictions is also reflected\
    \ in the focus of the reviewed\npublications on “legislation, instruments, and\
    \ policies,” the most\ncommonly compared category of governance elements. This\n\
    finding is consistent with recent arguments that, despite the\npurported “retreat\
    \ of the state,” governments and their formal\npolicies and legislation are still\
    \ very much integral to the practice\nof water governance (Newig and Koontz 2014).\

    Fig. 5. Number of case studies located in each country.\nthe second most common\
    \ governance element examined is\n“participation and stakeholder involvement.”\
    \ The prevalence of\npublications in our review that study participation is likely\
    \ linked\nto the enactment of the EU Water Framework Directive in 2000.\nThe Water\
    \ Framework Directive contains significant and\nchallenging requirements for public\
    \ participation. This\ncharacteristic made it one of the most popular themes for\n\
    researchers that examined the implementation of the Directive\n(Boeuf and Fritsch\
    \ 2016).  \nRegarding the use of primary vs. secondary data, we observe that\n\
    most of the reviewed publications are based on primary data\ncollected by the\
    \ researchers themselves. This means that there is\nsignificant room to exploit\
    \ these primary data and synthesize\ninsights from studies in diverse contexts.\
    \ At present, there are very\nfew large-N studies that compare across cases. However,\
    \ it should\nbe acknowledged that the diversity of governance frameworks\nused\
    \ is challenging when attempting to use existing data to\npopulate large-N comparative\
    \ studies. Established frameworks\nsuch as the IAD framework (Ostrom 2005) and\
    \ the SES\nframework (McGinnis and Ostrom 2014) might be helpful in\npreparing\
    \ a base for a rigorous combination of the outputs from\navailable small-N studies\
    \ into large-N studies.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe overarching finding of our systematic\
    \ review is that there is\nincredible variability in the field of comparative\
    \ water governance\nstudies. This variability may simply be a characteristic of\
    \ a\nrelatively young field that has yet to consolidate. To integrate the\ninsights\
    \ from our review into recommendations for future\nresearch, we first briefly\
    \ sketch out a picture of the field of\ncomparative water governance, and then\
    \ identify four research\nareas to develop the field in a manner that maximizes\
    \ its academic\nand practical potential.  \nOur review reveals that, consistent\
    \ with the larger body of work\non water governance, the definition of the concept\
    \ of water\ngovernance used in comparative studies is contested. Various\ndefinitions\
    \ of the concept, as well as its specific aspects and forms,\nare adopted in comparisons.\
    \ Furthermore, water governance is\noften studied through subelements of governance\
    \ such as\nlegislation and public participation, which are given relatively\n\
    high importance for the implementation of water policies. The\nemphasis on specific\
    \ subelements is an indication of the policy\nrelevance of comparative water governance\
    \ studies, which often\nexamine contemporary changes in water policies that address\n\
    certain elements. Many scholars use analytical frameworks that\nare rooted in\
    \ the work of Elinor Ostrom. Beyond this, there is\nlittle consistency in the\
    \ frameworks applied, which can also be\nexplained by the diversity of disciplinary\
    \ backgrounds of the\nresearchers that conduct comparative studies of water\n\
    governance. Compared to the definitions, elements, and\nframeworks, there is relatively\
    \ more consistency in the methods\nand approaches used. Comparative studies are\
    \ often qualitative\nand small-N, although there is an increasing number of\n\
    quantitative and large-N studies that aim to synthesize findings\nacross different\
    \ settings. The number of comparisons that apply\nmultiple research methods is\
    \ limited; studies mostly rely on\nqualitative methods. Comparisons are also largely\
    \ based on cases\ndefined according to jurisdictional boundaries or according\
    \ to\nboth jurisdictional and hydrological boundaries. In terms of the\ndata types,\
    \ most of the reviewed publications rely on primary data\nfor comparisons.  \n\
    We identify four future research areas to improve the theoretical\nand empirical\
    \ foundations of comparative water governance\nstudies. First, the field would\
    \ benefit from a better balance of\nsmall-, medium-, and large-N studies. Although\
    \ small-N studies\nare useful for explorative purposes and are able to capture\
    \ the\ncomplexity of water governance regimes, they seldom allow the\nderivation\
    \ of more general insights or patterns. In contrast, large-\nN studies run the\
    \ risk of resulting in simplistic blueprints or\npanaceas because they fail to\
    \ do justice to the contextual\nEcology and Society 23(4): 43\nhttps://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol23/iss4/art43/\n\
    specificity and complexity of water governance regimes.\nDiagnostic approaches\
    \ that consider context and problem\ncharacteristics are therefore particularly\
    \ promising (Ostrom 2007,\nPahl-Wostl and Kranz 2010, Ingram 2011). Our review\
    \ includes\nseveral studies in which authors systemically compare a moderate\n\
    number of cases (e.g., Huntjens et al. 2010, Pahl-Wostl et al. 2012).\nTo allow\
    \ for the systemic comparison of carefully selected cases,\nthe consistency in\
    \ methods and elements analyzed should be\nimproved to build data sets with secondary\
    \ data that can be used\nin comparative analysis.  \nSecond, our review was restricted\
    \ to comparisons across\ngeographical space. It would also be interesting to examine\n\
    longitudinal studies that compare across time while holding\ngeographical space\
    \ constant. Longitudinal comparative studies\ncan enable the identification of\
    \ temporal governance trends and\npatterns by observing water governance phenomena\
    \ over long\nperiods. Such large-scale, longitudinal studies can be supported\n\
    by small-scale studies that are conducted for shorter times, using\nconsistent\
    \ frameworks and case delineations. However, similar to\nlarge-N studies, the\
    \ financial and technical challenges of\nconducting longitudinal studies should\
    \ be taken into account.  \nThird, the geographical distribution of comparative\
    \ studies\nshould be expanded significantly to include countries from the\nglobal\
    \ South. Whereas geographic bias is often a consequence of\nfunder requirements,\
    \ data availability, and language barriers, the\ngeographic coverage of comparative\
    \ studies should be improved\nby concentrating efforts to improve the range of\
    \ comparisons\nwhere possible. Such efforts could include holding conferences\n\
    and funding governance-related research in the global South, and\npromoting water\
    \ governance research networks with the global\nSouth. Resolving issues of geographic\
    \ bias will also help to\naddress the relatively limited focus on issues of justice,\
    \ equity, and\npower (Lu et al. 2014).  \nThese concepts bring us to the fourth\
    \ and final future research\narea. Our review revealed that justice, equity, and\
    \ power have\nreceived limited attention in comparative water governance\nstudies.\
    \ This finding contradicts with the fact that addressing\nissues of power, equity,\
    \ and justice is becoming increasingly\nimportant in tackling the water governance\
    \ challenges that are\nexacerbated by the effects of climate change, industrialization,\n\
    and urbanization (Perreault 2014, Perreault et al. 2018,\nZwarteveen and Boelens\
    \ 2014). Moreover, such issues have crucial\neffects in less democratized countries\
    \ in the global South (Allan\n2007, Zeitoun et al. 2012, Molle et al. 2018). Thus,\
    \ the third and\nfourth future research areas are highly interrelated. Widening\
    \ the\ncomparative studies to represent better the global South is likely\nto\
    \ improve knowledge about justice, equity, and power issues in\nwater governance.\n\

    \ agricultural sector is one of the major users of water resources. Water is an\
    \ important\nasset that needs to be preserved using the latest available technologies.\
    \ Modern technologies and\ndigital tools can transform the agricultural domain\
    \ from being manual and static to intelligent\nand dynamic leading to higher production\
    \ with lesser human supervision. This study describe\nthe agronomic models that\
    \ should be integrated with the intelligent system which schedule the\nirrigation\
    \ and fertilization according to the plant needs, and monitors and maintains the\
    \ desired soil\nmoisture content via automatic watering. Solar fertigation is\
    \ a fertigation support system based on\nphotovoltaic solar power energy and an\
    \ IoT system for precision irrigation purposes. The system\nmonitors the temperature,\
    \ radiation, humidity, soil moisture, and other physical parameters. An\nagronomic\
    \ DSS platform based on the integration of soil, weather, and plant data and sensors\
    \ was\ndescribed. Furthermore, a three-year study on seven ETo models, such as\
    \ three temperature-, three\nradiation-, and a combination-based models were tested\
    \ to evaluate the sustainable ETo estimation\nand irrigation scheduling in a Mediterranean\
    \ environment. Results showed that solar fertigation and\nHargreaves–Samani (H-S)\
    \ equation represented a nearby correlation to the standard FAO P–M and\ndoes\
    \ offer a small increase in accuracy of ETo estimates. Furthermore, the hybrid\
    \ agronomic DSS is\nsuitable for smart fertigation scheduling.\nKeywords: crop\

    \ experiences several challenges in food and ﬁber pro-\nduction to feed a growing\
    \ population by 2050 [1]. Water, energy, and food security are\ncrucial for a\
    \ sustainable long-term economy [2]. A large amount of water is consumed in\n\
    the farming sector and about 70% of groundwater and river water is used in irrigation\
    \ [3].\nAgriculture will always be considered one of the major users of water\
    \ resources and is still\nrequired to be more efﬁcient especially in arid and\
    \ semiarid climates.\nIrrigation water management has to perform the particular\
    \ processes that could\nincrease the food production using the more crop per drop\
    \ strategy [4]. Improving irrigation\nmanagement could be provided by advanced\
    \ technology and smart irrigation systems.\nAutomating crop irrigation supports\
    \ the optimum amount of water without the avail-\nability of labor to control\
    \ valves and analyze the plant growth status. The developmental\nphases in IoT\
    \ and WSN technologies and the recent advances in sensors for the implemen-\n\
    tation of irrigation systems for agriculture, have sped up the evolution of smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystems [5].\nReal-time irrigation scheduling is important in saving\
    \ water by applying the required\nquantity to satisfy plant needs. The irrigation\
    \ process needs a high level of ‘precision’\nto optimize the crop growth and water\
    \ input, while reducing adverse environmental\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12051012\n\

    \ [6,7]. The water application in the precision irrigation process must be able\
    \ to\ncontrol the water applied per unit of time within a ﬁeld [6].\nNumerous\
    \ works have been performed by various research groups in the smart\nirrigation\
    \ domain, and many reviews works investigated the current trend in the area of\n\
    smart irrigation [5,6,8–14].\nTo improve water use efﬁciency, it is important\
    \ to monitor particular factors that\ninﬂuence crop growth and development [15–17].\
    \ Monitoring in the perspective of smart\nirrigation also entails real-time data\
    \ acquisition related to soil, plant, and weather parame-\nters. An effective\
    \ real-time irrigation scheduling event requires monitoring of the factors\nthat\
    \ affect plant growth and development and an optimum strategy for the delivery\
    \ of the\nrequired quantity of irrigation water.\nMonitoring the smart irrigation\
    \ process is based on three types, such as soil-based,\nweather-based, and plant-based\
    \ monitoring [11].\nSoil moisture monitoring includes measuring the soil water\
    \ availability which has\nbeen used widely for irrigation scheduling [18]. The\
    \ disadvantage of soil moisture-based\nirrigation scheduling is that plant water\
    \ uptake and stress do not only respond to the soil\nwater content but also to\
    \ atmospheric parameters, nutrient content, root zone salinity, and\npest and\
    \ disease infestation.\nWeather-based monitoring includes the real-time estimation\
    \ of reference evapotranspi-\nration (ETo) using the collected weather parameters\
    \ and, thus, the water lost by plants and\nsoil [6,10]. Several studies have reported\
    \ using weather parameters for irrigation schedul-\ning. Effective within-season\
    \ climate prediction could assist farmers in managing irrigation\nand minimizing\
    \ risk [19,20], but more studies using medium- or long-term meteorological\nforecasts\
    \ are needed to improve the irrigation precision [21].\nMonitoring plant–water\
    \ indices, such as the correlation between crop water stress and\nsoil water deﬁcit\
    \ provides an optimum estimation of irrigation scheduling. The sensitivity\nof\
    \ the measurement for determining plant–water deﬁcit conditions at a particular\
    \ crop\nstage highly inﬂuences the efﬁcacy of plant-based irrigation scheduling\
    \ [9]. The primary\ndrawback in the application of plant-based sensors for commercial\
    \ irrigation scheduling\nis that they do not provide a direct measurement of the\
    \ amount of irrigation water to be\napplied to crops [22].\nA smart design of\
    \ monitoring tools including accurate integration of soil, weather,\nand plant\
    \ sensors is, however, important for a successful operation of an adaptive decision\n\
    support system (DSS) [6,11,23]. Solar fertigation uses sustainably powered energy\
    \ by\nphotovoltaic panels to manage smart irrigation and to assist farmers in\
    \ decision-making\nprocesses with IoT technology. A novel irrigation control strategy\
    \ using a hybrid predictive\nmodel based on weather and crop data, and real-time\
    \ sensors were described.\nFurthermore, the experimental setup reported and analyzed\
    \ three years of ETo data\ncollected from seven different Mediterranean climates\
    \ using the real-time solar fertiga-\ntion system, and the real-time API weather.\
    \ Therefore, the data were analyzed by using\ntemperature-based and radiation-based\
    \ models which were further compared to the Food\nand Agriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) of the United Nation’s recognized Penman–Monteith\n(P–M) model for their\
    \ statistical attributes.\n2. The Proposed System: Smart Irrigation System\nSolar\

    to the particular needs of the crop and the farmer. The agronomic database contains\

    \ data related to soil and\nenvironment, the control unit deﬁnes the type and\

    \ each crop.\n2.4. Real-Time Monitoring and Suggestions\nSoil and plant sensors\
    \ were used by DSS. Soil moisture, humidity, pH, and soil\nelectrical conductivity\
    \ (EC) were used for real-time monitoring of irrigation and fertigation.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the leaf wetness sensor monitored real-time plant moisture levels in\nleaves\
    \ and supported irrigation and water systems. Dendrometer sensors were used for\n\
    monitoring changes in plant water content (only for fruits).\nReal-time monitoring\
    \ data were used for irrigation and nutrient suggestions and\ncorrection strategies.\n\
    2.4.1. Irrigation Scheduling\nCrop Evapotranspiration (ETc)\nETc is the evapotranspiration\
    \ from disease-free, well-developed crops, cultivated in\nopen ﬁelds, in optimum\
    \ soil water conditions, and receiving complete production under\nthe provided\
    \ environmental conditions.\nETc is estimated, using the crop coefﬁcient approach,\
    \ by multiplying the ETo by a crop\ncoefﬁcient (Kc) [26] which follows as:\nETc\
    \ = Kc × ETo\n(1)\nwhere ETc represents crop evapotranspiration (mm d−1), Kc represents\
    \ crop coefﬁcient,\nand ETo represents reference crop evapotranspiration (mm d−1).\n\
    ETo is the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface, not short of water\
    \ and\nis one of the major factors for determining optimum irrigation water management.\
    \ Soil\nsensors measured the ETo based on soil properties (i.e., soil permittivity,\
    \ electrical resistance,\nand soil water potential, among others). The collected\
    \ ETo values were used for irrigation\nscheduling at the ﬁelds.\nMost of the effects\
    \ of weather parameters are integrated into the ETo equation. Conse-\nquently,\
    \ as ETo is an index of climatic demand, Kc differs predominately with the particular\n\
    crop features and only to a limited extent with climate. This transfers the standard\
    \ Kc\nvalues between the ﬁeld and the climate. This has been a major reason for\
    \ the wide accep-\ntance and beneﬁcial aspects of the crop coefﬁcient approach\
    \ and the Kc factors analyzed in\nprevious literature [26]. Kc data of the most\
    \ important crops at different developmental\nstages were collected in a database\
    \ according to the FAO manual–56 methods (Section 3.5).\nAt the present time,\
    \ the irrigation strategy of the system is based on Hargreaves–\nSamani (H–S)\
    \ (Section 3.3); however, the Penman–Monteith (P–M) formula could also be\nuploaded.\
    \ Furthermore, an experimental set-up of seven ET crop models is reported in\n\
    Section 3 and were used for the implementation of the ET equation in the DSS.\n\
    The P–M model is recognized as the standard method for ETo assessment which\n\
    provides the best performance in Mediterranean environments [26–28]. However,\
    \ the\nneed for collecting a relatively large number of parameters (e.g., relative\
    \ humidity of the\nair, solar radiation, or wind speed) in different climates,\
    \ which are generally difﬁcult to\nestimate with good accuracy, restricts the\
    \ extensive utilization of this model [28]. Therefore,\nalternative methodologies\
    \ requiring lower cost observations have been developed, such as\nHargreaves–Samani\
    \ (H–S), Blaney–Criddle (B–C), Thornthwaite, Priestley–Taylor, Makkink,\nand Turc,\
    \ among others [29]. The use of simpler models for ETo estimation with a lower\n\
    level of parameters could affect accurate irrigation water management, obtaining\
    \ irrigation\nschedules of low quality with a bad impact on water savings and\
    \ crop yield.\nThe H–S model uses daily maximum and minimum air temperature data\
    \ as the\nonly input. This empirical model is one of the most commonly used in\
    \ various studies.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n6 of 24\nIt is recommended by Allen\
    \ et al. [26] as the best estimation model. As an empirical\nmethod, H–S involves\
    \ empirical coefﬁcients. While H–S could be tested with some standard\nvalues\
    \ of these coefﬁcients, several studies [26] recommended testing H–S at locations\n\
    with comparable weather. ETo values using the H–S depend on the local temperature\n\
    (Figure 2). Maximum, minimum, and mean temperature and UV-radiation parameters\
    \ are\nrequired. UV-radiation can be estimated for a particular day and location;\
    \ however, only\nmaximum, minimum, and mean temperature are the parameters that\
    \ require observation.\nThe H–S method is generally preferred to other more complicated\
    \ methods since it provides\nreasonably adequate performance and requires only\
    \ maximum, minimum, and mean\ntemperatures [30].\nWeather parameter data, such\
    \ as temperature and humidity (DHT22, by Aosong\nElectronics), UV-radiation (SQ-100\
    \ solar radiation sensor, by Apogee Instruments), wind\nspeed, and rainfall were\
    \ recorded by sensors mounted on the system.\nRainfall (Effective Rainfall)\n\
    The rainfall patterns in the local climate signiﬁcantly affect crop growth and\
    \ produc-\ntion. The rainwater that is disposed of in the shape of deep percolation\
    \ or run-off stores in\nsome other resources of the nature and could be utilized\
    \ in any other usage or part of it is\nabsorbed by the soil which remains stored\
    \ for a longer time and in a fresh form. The plant’s\nroot zone can easily utilize\
    \ and uptake the water for its growth, nourishment, and further\ndevelopment.\
    \ Part of the water content that is utilized by the crops and soil is effective\n\
    rainfall, which is different in every region of the world depending on its climate,\
    \ rainfall\nyearly durations, soil structure and texture, root depth, and variety\
    \ of planting factors [31].\nThe proposed system was based on an empirical method\
    \ that estimates the amount of\nthe effective rainfall consumed by evapotranspiration,\
    \ with reference to the utilized rainfall\n(RU), meaning the water content between\
    \ the wilting point and the ﬁeld capacity, limited\nto the layer of soil occupied\
    \ by the roots [32]. The empirical expression is presented as:\nEffective rainfall\
    \ = fc (1.253 × p0.824 − 2.935) × 10 [0.001 ET]\n(2)\nwhere fc is the correction\
    \ factor which depends on the usable water stored in the root-zone;\np is the\
    \ total monthly precipitation (mm); and ET is the total monthly evapotranspira-\n\
    tion (mm).\nLuo et al. [31] reported that estimation and utilization of effective\
    \ rainfall with DSS\ncould be a signiﬁcant method to design irrigation saving\
    \ strategies. Examples of this are\nvalidated in Texas, USA [33], Jimma–Ethiopia\
    \ [34] and Wuhan, China [31].\nDuring the rainfall occurrence, for example for\
    \ two days, the soil water potential\ndata of the system (soil sensors) recorded\
    \ similar moisture values continuously for four\ndays (depending on climate).\
    \ After this, regular irrigation water was provided as per\nregular schedules.\n\
    Crop Factors\nThe collection of crop factors leads to the development of a crop\
    \ database for the\nsuccessful running and efﬁcient management of irrigation.\
    \ The database illustrates the\ncrop factors, including crop growing stages, stage\
    \ lengths (days), depletion factor (p), crop\ncoefﬁcient (kc), yield factor (ky),\
    \ and root depth Zr (Figure 2).\nThe aforementioned crop data for each crop type\
    \ was installed into the system. To\ndetermine the amount of water applied by\
    \ the irrigators into the ﬁeld, during an irrigation\nevent, automatic calibration\
    \ of the particular growth stage and stage length of the crop\nwere compared with\
    \ the available humidity at the ﬁeld.\nFrequent readings were taken by the system\
    \ during these irrigation phases (soil\nsensors). The system continued the irrigation\
    \ until the exact values for the p-factor, kc, and\nky were reached. When the\
    \ irrigator completed irrigating the ﬁeld, the average depth of\nirrigation water\
    \ passing through the valves and the respective discharge were read for the\n\
    measurement of the ﬁeld being irrigated. The rate of water discharge and the depth\
    \ of\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n7 of 24\nwater applied depends on the particular\
    \ values of the p-factor, kc, and ky, as they differ in\nevery crop type.\nZr\
    \ of crops depends on the available soil moisture considering compaction levels\
    \ of\nthe particular soil. Determining the average Zr of each type of crop [26],\
    \ the soil moisture\nsensors were installed at a particular soil depth and distance\
    \ in the ﬁelds. The ﬁeld was\nirrigated by a couple of irrigators placed at a\
    \ particular distance from each other. The soil\nmoisture sensors, after reaching\
    \ the moisture at a particular soil and root depth, sent the\ninformation to stop\
    \ the irrigation promptly.\nFor irrigation scheduling, the effective Zr of the\
    \ available crop was considered, irre-\nspective of growth stages. Most of the\
    \ plant’s roots were located in the upper portion of\nthe root zone; therefore,\
    \ irrigation scheduling was managed to a shallower depth than the\ncrop’s full\
    \ root depth. Soil moisture content was estimated two times; one on a daily basis\n\
    and one before each irrigation application during the ﬁeld experiments. Using\
    \ the soil\nmoisture data acquired by the system (soil sensors), the depletion\
    \ factor (p) of available\nsoil water in the provided crop zr was estimated by\
    \ the equation [35]:\np-factor = 1001n∑1nFCi − θiFCi − WP\n(3)\nwhere n is the\
    \ number of layers of the rooting depth (zr), FCi is the soil moisture at ﬁeld\n\
    capacity, θi is the soil moisture in the ith layer, and WP is the soil moisture\
    \ at permanent\nwilting point.\nThe system can implement the database with data\
    \ collected through the installation of\nplant-based sensors that replace table\
    \ data with real time data.\nAlthough less precise, the use of a database allows\
    \ users to easily manage all the\nparameters which were considered useful for\
    \ optimum irrigation management.\nSoil Water Availability\nSoil water availability\
    \ is the capacity of soil to collect water available to crops. After\nirrigation,\
    \ the soil drains until the ﬁeld capacity. Field capacity is the amount of water\
    \ that\nsoil should preserve at a particular volume. In the absence of a water\
    \ supply, the water\nlevel in the root zone decreases after uptake by the crop.\
    \ As water uptake continues, the\navailable water is tightly held by the soil\
    \ particles, and makes it harder for the plant to\nextract it. Ultimately, a point\
    \ is reached where the plant can no longer extract the available\nmoisture. This\
    \ makes the water uptake zero and leads to the wilting point. Wilting point is\n\
    the water content at which plants start to permanently wilt and is a factor function\
    \ of the\nsoil texture. The total amount of water that can be stored in the root\
    \ zone is a function of\nthe type of soil texture [26].\nAs the water content\
    \ more higher than ﬁeld capacity cannot be held and as the water\ncontent lower\
    \ than wilting point cannot be extracted by plants, the total available water\n\
    (TAW) in the root zone is the difference between water content at ﬁeld capacity\
    \ and wilting\npoint [26] such as:\nTAW = (θFC − θWC) × Zr\n(4)\nwhere TAW represents\
    \ total available water in the root zone (mm), θFC represents water\ncontent at\
    \ ﬁeld capacity (m3 m−3), θWP represents water content at wilting point (m3 m−3),\n\
    and Zr represents root depth (m).\nThough water is available until the wilting\
    \ point, crop water extraction is minimized\nwell before the wilting point. In\
    \ the wet soil, the soil quickly supplies enough water to meet\nthe crop demands.\
    \ However, upon the reduction in the soil water content, water becomes\ntightly\
    \ bound to the soil matrix and is more difﬁcult to utilize. When the soil water\
    \ content\nreduces below a particular threshold, soil water can no longer be transported\
    \ to the roots\nto complete the transpiration demand, ultimately, the crop starts\
    \ to stress. The fraction of\nTAW that a crop can utilize without experiencing\
    \ stress is called readily available water\n(RAW) [26] such as:\nRAW = p × TAW\n\
    (5)\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n8 of 24\nwhere RAW is the readily available water\
    \ in the root zone (mm); and p is the average\nfraction of TAW (0–1).\nAccording\
    \ to soil type, cultivated crop, and root depth the RAW and TAW data were\ncalculated\
    \ and uploaded to the irrigation system.\n2.4.2. Nutrients\nNutrient management\
    \ was supported by the proposed system and easily used for\nfertigation, through\
    \ which crop nutrient requirements were met accurately. Due to the\nmethod the\
    \ water is applied by the system, surface applications of nutrients are sometimes\n\
    ineffective, so the system automatically mixed liquid nutrients with the irrigation\
    \ water.\nThe system allowed the delivery of nutrients and water (fertigation)\
    \ to plants in\naccurate quantities and at the appropriate time for a particular\
    \ stage of plant growth.\nThe major factor in the fertigation process was the\
    \ time, and the key in the application\nwas striking the correct balance for optimal\
    \ plant life with optimal use of water. The\nsystem also performed the fertigation\
    \ application in which the fertigation was based on the\nrelevant amounts of water\
    \ and nutrients that must be given periodically, with no feedback.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ the second type was based on a combination of fertigation application and\n\
    feedback of the necessary data to determine the amount of fertigation needed [36,37].\n\
    The database reports the accurate amount of the nutrient demands related to the\n\
    crop growth stage in a form that becomes available in synchrony with crop demands\
    \ for\nmaximum utilization of nutrients; however, modiﬁcations could be performed\
    \ according\nto the particular needs of the crop and the farmer.\nThe control\
    \ unit compares received information with those stored in the database; thus\n\
    deﬁning the type and concentrations of the fertilizers and regulating the timing\
    \ of the irriga-\ntion. These operations are obtained properly by driving the\
    \ different hydraulic/mechanical\nsections for adjusting fertilizer quantities\
    \ to be introduced into the aqueous solution in\nthe bin. Furthermore, the control\
    \ unit drives the electric pump and solenoid valves, for\ncorrectly distributing\
    \ the fertilizing solution into the different areas of the land; in fact,\nthe\
    \ system is designed in a modular way according to the extension of the land to\
    \ cul-\ntivate. The deﬁnition of agronomic mathematical models is fundamental\
    \ for processing\ndata collected by the WSN and comparing them with those reported\
    \ in the database to\ncreate a dynamic system for optimal fertigation control.\
    \ The agronomic database contains\nprecise values related to fertigation needs\
    \ for each crop type according to the seasonal\nperiod and growth phase; based\
    \ on the agronomic database and WSN data related to soil\nand environment, the\
    \ control unit deﬁnes the type and optimal quantities of fertilizer, the\ntiming\
    \ and the fertigation methods for each crop kind, with the purpose to optimize\
    \ water\nuse and improve the quality and quantity of cultivated products.\nCrop\
    \ Database\nA database for nutrients and irrigation management of nine crops was\
    \ developed;\nfurthermore, a study for other crops is in progress (Table 1).\n\

    \ Soil Moisture and Plant Water Content Monitoring\nSoil sensors are speciﬁc devices\
    \ that convert a physical parameter into soft data. The\nsoil sensors are used\
    \ to collect and communicate the parameters, such as soil moisture,\nhumidity,\
    \ and temperature (Figure 2). For estimating the particular water level, sensors\n\
    were connected to the main irrigation canals, while for estimating the water ﬂow,\
    \ they were\nconnected to a water pump. Sensors were further connected to the\
    \ database which was\nperiodically sending the data. The connected database was\
    \ monitoring the irrigation water\nlevels, analyzed the data stored, and compared\
    \ it with the threshold values. The threshold\nvalues of soil moisture were uploaded\
    \ into the database to maintain the irrigation on a daily\nbasis. Using threshold\
    \ values, the system started or stopped the irrigation based on the\nmoisture\
    \ content of the soil. In this way, soil sensors controlled the ﬂow rate of water\
    \ from\nthe tank to the irrigation ﬁeld and optimized the use of water. Soil sensors\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsupported water management decisions, used for continuously monitoring\
    \ water levels\nin the tank and moisture in the soil and provided an accurate\
    \ amount of water required\nfor crop plants. The sensors checked the temperature\
    \ and humidity of soil to retain the\nnutrient composition of the soil managed\
    \ for the growth of crops.\nSoil sensors efﬁciently schedule the irrigation events\
    \ by either decreasing or increasing\nthe intensity/frequency of water, preserving\
    \ the important soil nutrients, and on the other\nside, providing a thirst factor\
    \ to plants at their particular stage of growth. Soil sensors\nempower the farmers\
    \ to manage the water levels without any requirement for a physical\npresence\
    \ in the ﬁeld. They correctly measure the accurate level of soil moisture and\
    \ aid in\nscheduling the irrigation supply and distribution in an efﬁcient method.\
    \ They signiﬁcantly\nhelp in fertigation and irrigation management by analyzing\
    \ the soil parameters affecting\ncrop growth and production (Figure 2).\nThe types\
    \ of sensors used in the smart irrigation system are real-time fertigation moni-\n\
    toring sensors for environmental and soil parameters. The sensor nodes are isomorphic\n\
    and non-rechargeable with the initial energy being the same as E0.\nMQTT is an\
    \ extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for\nconstrained\
    \ devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. All content\n\
    is delivered to the user interface using an MQTT protocol and ActiveMQ message\
    \ broker\ndeployed on AWS as software as a service [25].\nFor real-time fertigation\
    \ monitoring, several sensors, such as DHT22, SHT11, SEN0193,\nand SEN0193 acquired\
    \ environmental and soil parameters during the study period [24].\nPlant sensors\
    \ such as leaf wetness and dendrometer sensor data could be uploaded. Fur-\nthermore,\
    \ data recorded onsite included the irrigation water pH and EC for water quality\n\
    information. The samples were checked for a pH of less than 2. The irrigation\
    \ water was\nthen checked for microbial activities and undesirable physicochemical\
    \ reactions before\nfurther analysis.\nThe leaf wetness sensor, such as the radio\
    \ frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) sensor [44],\nmonitored real-time plant moisture\
    \ levels in leaves and supported irrigation and water\nsystems. The dendrometer\
    \ sensors, such as ZN12-O-WP [45] (only for fruits), were used\nAgronomy 2022,\
    \ 12, 1012\n10 of 24\nfor detailed crop information. ZN12 measures microvariations\
    \ in stem diameter caused by\ncycles of shrinking and swelling, which indicate\
    \ changes in plant water content.\nSimilar to soil sensors, the threshold values\
    \ for leaf water content were also uploaded\ninto the database to manage the irrigation\
    \ on a daily basis.\n2.4.4. Web-Based Platform\nThe web-based platform is a highly\
    \ efﬁcient irrigation management system. The\nplatform monitors seven different\
    \ categories, including all ﬁelds, zones, the containers of\nthe fertilizer, manual\
    \ tests, events, reports, and notiﬁcations. After receiving the initial data\n\
    from the ﬁeld, the platform manages, processes, analyzes, and ﬁnally, displays\
    \ the data in\na simple and user-friendly way. The display factors include ﬁelds,\
    \ crops, environmental\nconditions, irrigation hours, soil humidity, fertilizer\
    \ amount, and their problems to solve.\nWhile, the displayed crop factors are\
    \ crop growing stages, stage lengths (days), depletion\nfactor (p), crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (kc), yield factor (ky) and root depth (Zr), as shown in Figure 3.\nIt also\
    \ displays suggestions in a timely manner so that they could be addressed without\n\
    having a higher amount of irrigation or damaging the crop. All the information\
    \ and data\nanalysis could be performed using the computer and mobile. The platform\
    \ shows an\nenergy-efﬁcient method to increase the system’s lifetime and reduce\
    \ the project’s cost.\nMoreover, the installation of the smart fertigation system\
    \ using the crop sensors, only\ncollects the soil moisture content but not the\
    \ water depth. However, water depth is a vital\nfactor for understanding the ETo,\
    \ growth, and development of the crops [46]. The ETo\ncalculation must be conducted\
    \ on a daily basis with high precision, which is dependent on\nthe environmental\

    \ Setup for ET Crop Models \nThe study consists of different regions in which\
    \ the range of fields were estimated \nfrom 10 to 12 hectares. The field sensors\
    \ collected soil and weather data after every 30 min, \nsuch as temperature (°C),\
    \ relative humidity (%), solar radiation (MJ m−2), air speed (km \nh−1), rainfall\
    \ (mm), and soil humidity. This data is considered solar fertigation system data.\

    \ soil sensors \nrange from 3 to 9 in each field (3 for each sector), respectively,\
    \ with three different depths \nstarting from 10 to 50 cm; however, they were\
    \ installed into the positions where the WSN \nnetwork could be developed in all\
    \ parts of the field. Moreover, real-time API weather data \nwas also connected\
    \ to the DSS for data collection using the web-based resources which \nare considered\
    \ as API data. The experimental setup analyzed the comparison of both, so-\nlar\

    \ is known for its Mediterranean-\ntype climate with short and mild winters, and\
    \ hot, long, and dry summers [53].\nThe data were collected on a daily basis while\
    \ a precise quality control check for\nthe ETo variables was performed. This guarantees\
    \ the data homogeneity and addresses\nany error.\n3.2. Data Collection\nData from\
    \ seven weather stations in different Mediterranean zones of Italy were\ncollected\
    \ from solar fertigation systems (soil sensors) and API (MeteoInMolise–http://\n\
    www.meteoinmolise.com/ (5 January 2022)). The collected crop data includes crop\
    \ water\nrequirement, fertilizer requirement, stages of development, stage length\
    \ (in days), depletion\ncoefﬁcient (p), root depth (Zr), crop coefﬁcient (kc),\
    \ and yield response factor (ky). The\ncollected meteorological data includes\
    \ minimum, maximum, and average temperatures;\nminimum, maximum, and average humidity;\
    \ UV-radiation; minimum, maximum, and\naverage atmospheric pressure; actual airspeed;\
    \ and rainfall. The data was then managed\nby a web-based desktop platform for\
    \ further processes.\nThe mean correlation of monthly temperatures and rainfall\
    \ at seven weather stations\nfor the study period was recorded. Minimum and maximum\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nwere recorded on a monthly basis for each weather\
    \ station. A box plot correlation of\nenvironmental parameters, such as minimum\
    \ and maximum temperature, minimum and\nmaximum relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and daily wind speed for three years of data\nwere tested in the study (Appendix\
    \ A, Tables A1 and A2; Figures A1 and A2).\nMean collected parameters, such as\
    \ maximum, minimum, and average temperature,\nrelative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ airspeed, and rainfall for the study period (1 January\n2019–31 December 2021)\
    \ were acquired. In addition, temperature and rainfall trends were\nrecorded as\
    \ linear. However, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R statistical attributes were tested for\n\
    the following temperature-, radiation-, and combination-based models.\n3.3. Temperature-Based\
    \ Models\n3.3.1. Hargreaves–Samani (H–S) Model\nThe lack of available agrometeorological\
    \ data (such as solar radiation, air humidity,\nand wind speed) in all climatic\
    \ regions limits the use of the standard FAO P–M model [26].\nTherefore, Allen\
    \ et al. [26] proposed the application of the H–S model in particular regions\n\
    where only the data related to air temperature is available. The Hargreaves–Samani\
    \ (H–S)\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n13 of 24\nmodel [47] is an empirical approach\
    \ that needs theoretical parameters for ETo estimation.\nThe model is expressed\
    \ as follows:\nETo = 0.023 (0.408) (Tmean + 17.8) (Tmax − Tmin)0.5 × Ra\n(6)\n\
    where ETo represents reference evapotranspiration (mm d−1); Ra represents extraterrestrial\n\
    radiation (MJ m−2 d−1); Tmean represents average monthly/annual temperature; and\
    \ Tmax\nand Tmin are daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (◦C), respectively.\n\
    3.3.2. Blaney–Criddle (B–C) Model\nThe Blaney–Criddle (B–C) model [54] is recommended\
    \ for the daily estimation of ETo\n(mm d−1). The equation is expressed as follows:\n\
    ETo = p (0.46Tmean + 8.13)\n(7)\nwhere ETo represents daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (mm d−1) and Tmean represents\ndaily mean temperature (◦C). In our study, Tmean\
    \ is measured based on daily Tmax and Tmin\n(such as Tmean = (Tmax + Tmin)/2).\
    \ The coefﬁcient p is considered as the daily percent of\nannual daytime hours\
    \ for each day of the year, which may be estimated using the latitude\nand the\
    \ Julian day analysis [26].\n3.3.3. Thornthwaite Model\nThornthwaite [49] proposed\
    \ an empirical model to estimate ETo by comparing the\ncorrelation between temperature,\
    \ precipitation, and changing rate of water in diverse\nregions. This required\
    \ only readily available input data for estimating ETo. This is based\nonly on\
    \ daily averaged temperatures and latitude, the latter variable used to calculate\
    \ the\nmaximum amount of sunshine duration [55]. The equation is expressed as\
    \ follows:\nETo = 16Nm [(10Tm)a1]\n(8)\nwhere Tm represents mean air temperature\
    \ (◦C), Nm represents the number of days in a\nmonth, and al represents the average\
    \ number of daylight hours per day for each month.\n3.4. Radiation-Based Models\n\
    3.4.1. Priestley–Taylor Model\nThe Priestley–Taylor [50] model is tested in a\
    \ diverse range of regions for ETo estima-\ntion. The model was initially developed\
    \ for saturated environments and open water bodies\nwith low wind effects. The\
    \ wind factor multiplied by vapor pressure deﬁcit was further\nsimpliﬁed and joined\
    \ with land cover and site condition data. ETo estimation using this\nmodel has\
    \ provided some good results, depending on the region. The Priestley–Taylor\n\
    method requires only temperature and radiation data and is considered as precise\
    \ among\nthe simpliﬁed methods with reduced parameters [56]. The method includes\
    \ a correction\nfactor known as the advection coefﬁcient with the value of 1.26\
    \ [50] and ranging between\n1.08 and 1.34 for agricultural ﬁelds [56]. The model\
    \ is expressed as follows:\nETo = 1.26\n∆\n∆ + γ(Rn − G) 1\nλ\n(9)\nwhere Rn represents\
    \ net radiation of the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1); ∆ represents the\nslope vapor\
    \ curve (kPa ◦C−1); λ represents the latent heat of vapor (MJ kg−1); G represents\n\
    the soil heat ﬂux density (MJ m−2 day−1); and γ represents the psychrometric constant\n\
    (kPa ◦C−1).\n3.4.2. Makkink Model\nThe Makkink [51] model is also considered a\
    \ reliable and easy method for the esti-\nmation of ETo. Solar radiation is the\
    \ only required parameter as input data for estimating\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n\
    14 of 24\nETo, which in most areas of the world is easily acquired. The equation\
    \ is expressed as\nfollows [51]:\nETo = 0.61 ×\n∆\n(∆ + γ) × Rs − 0.12\n(10)\n\
    where Rs represents solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1); γ represents the psychrometric\
    \ con-\nstant (kPa ◦C−1); and ∆ represents the slope vapor curve (kPa ◦C−1).\n\
    3.4.3. Turc Model\nThe Turc [52] model provides good data in a diverse set of\
    \ environmental conditions.\nIt is considered one of the simplest and accurate\
    \ empirical equations used to estimate ETo\nunder humid conditions. The Turc model\
    \ requires minimum weather parameters such as\nmean daily values of temperature\
    \ and solar radiation (Rs) [57]. The equation is expressed\nas follows:\nETo =\n\
    Tmean\nTmean + 15(Rs × 23.8846 + 50)\n(11)\nwhere Tmean represents daily mean\
    \ temperature (◦C); and Rs represents solar radiation\n(MJ m−2 day−1).\n3.5. Combination-Based\
    \ Model\nStandard FAO Penman–Monteith (P–M) Model\nETo is described as the simultaneous\
    \ loss of water from vegetation and soil surfaces.\nThe quantity of ETo depends\
    \ on the presence of water at the surface, the quantity of\navailable energy (to\
    \ convert the phase of water: latent heat of evaporation, LE), the ability\nof\
    \ an environment to accommodate water vapor (vapor pressure deﬁcit, VPD), and\
    \ the\nprocedure for water transport from the soil surface to the atmosphere (turbulent\
    \ transport).\nNet radiation (Rn) is the primary source of energy, and wind-generated\
    \ turbulence is\nconsidered the transport process.\nETo is considered as a hypothetical\
    \ reference crop with particular characteristics,\nsuch as a well-watered, 0.12\
    \ m grass with an albedo of 0.23, and an aerodynamic surface\nresistance of 70\
    \ s m−1. The equation is expressed as follows:\nETo =\n0.408∆ (Rn − G) + γ\n900\n\
    T+273U2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 U2)\n(12)\nwhere ∆ is the slope of saturation\
    \ vapor pressure at temperature curve (kPa K−1); Rn is net\nradiation at the crop\
    \ surface (MJ m−2 day−1); G is soil heat ﬂux density (MJ m−2 day−1);\nγ is the\
    \ psychrometric constant (kPa K−1); U2 is the wind speed at 2 m above surface\n\
    height (m s−1); es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa); ea is the actual vapor\
    \ pressure\n(kPa); (es − ea) is the saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit (kPa); and\
    \ T is the mean daily air\ntemperature at 2 m height (◦C).\n3.6. Data Analysis\n\
    Data analyses were performed to validate the precision of the proposed system\
    \ and\nAPI results. The statistical parameters such as mean absolute error (MAE),\
    \ mean square\nerror (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Pearson correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient (R) for\neach empirical model were studied to evaluate their effectiveness\
    \ [58]. The MAE estimates\nthe average magnitude of errors without considering\
    \ their sign and test samples of absolute\ndifferences between the observed (system)\
    \ and the estimated (API) data (Equation (12)).\nMSE is an average of squared\
    \ differences between the observed (system) and the estimated\n(API) data or is\
    \ the variance of an error (Equation (13)). RMSE is the square root of MSE or\
    \ is\nthe standard deviation of an error (Equation (14)). R shows the correlation\
    \ with a direct and\ninverse relationship between the observed (system) and the\
    \ estimated (API) data (Equation\n(15)). Statistical correlation of temperature-based\
    \ models (H–S, B–C and Thornthwaite),\nand radiation-based models (Priestley–Taylor,\
    \ Makkink and Turc) were compared with\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n15 of 24\nthe\
    \ standard FAO P–M model [26] to understand the accuracy and acceptable efﬁciency\
    \ of\neach model [59]. The statistical parameters evaluated are as follows:\n\
    Mean absolute error (MAE) = ∑n\ni=1|xi − yi|\nn\n(13)\nMean square error (MSE)\
    \ = 1\nn ∑\nn\ni=1(yi − ˆyi)2\n(14)\nRoot mean square error (RMSE) =\np\n∑n\n\
    i=1(xi − yi)2\nn\n(15)\nPearson correlation coefﬁcient (P) =\n∑n\ni=1(xi − x)(yi\
    \ − y)\np\n∑n\ni=1(xi − x)2(yi − y)2\n(16)\nwhere xi is the forecasted data of\
    \ temperature, yi is an observed (system) data of tempera-\nture, ˆyi is the forecasted\
    \ data, i is the forecasted parameter sequence number (such as 1, 2, 3,\n4, and\
    \ so on), x is mean forecasted data of parameter sequence number, y is mean observed\n\
    (system) data of parameter sequence number, and n is the number of the forecasted\
    \ data.\n4. Results\nResults were collected from meteorological data which include\
    \ minimum, maximum,\nand average temperatures; minimum, maximum and average humidity;\
    \ UV-radiation;\nminimum, maximum, and average atmospheric pressure; actual air\
    \ speed; and rainfall\nduring the study period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December\
    \ 2021. Environmental pa-\nrameters, such as temperature, RH, and wind speed range\
    \ from Tmin = 0.21–18.86 ◦C,\nTmax = 4.07–30.6 ◦C, RH = 54.6 –76.7%, and wind\
    \ speed = 0.75–11.8 km h−1 in Molise\n(Appendix A, Table A1); while 3.09–22.1\
    \ ◦C, Tmax = 10.1–34.5 ◦C, RH = 58.7–80.2%, and\nwind speed = 6.16–16.90 km h−1\
    \ in Apulia regions, respectively (Appendix A, Table A2).\nThe mean ETo data were\
    \ analyzed by six different (three temperature- and three\nradiation-based) methods\
    \ and compared with the standard combination-based FAO P–M\nmethod. Results showed\
    \ that maximum values of solar fertigation ETo were recorded in\nthe summer months\
    \ followed by spring and winter. Meanwhile, total ETo for the solar\nfertigation\
    \ system, H–S, and P–M was revealed as 3032.8, 3049.9, and 2967.3 mm in Molise,\n\
    respectively; while 5362.8, 5384.3, and 5422.2 mm in Apulia, respectively, from\
    \ 1 January\n2019 to 31 December 2021.\nThe estimated monthly and total ETo for\
    \ solar fertigation system, temperature- and\nradiation-based models were collected.\
    \ A signiﬁcant correlation for the data between the\nsystem and the standard FAO\
    \ model was revealed upon their comparison. The combination-\nbased standard FAO\
    \ P–M revealed a close trend to the solar fertigation system with no\nunderestimation.\
    \ The H–S for total ETo shows a highly signiﬁcant correlation with the\nstandard\
    \ FAO P–M. While, B–C and Thornthwaite models overestimated the considerable\n\
    value. Similarly, the monthly and annual estimation of ETo in radiation-based\
    \ (Priestley–\nTaylor, Makkink and Turc) models were acquired. Their correlation\
    \ recorded the highest\noverestimation from the standard FAO model.\nFurthermore,\
    \ daily ETo in Molise and Apulia regions are displayed in Figures 4 and 5,\nrespectively,\
    \ for the study period (1 January 2019–31 December 2021). The tested models\n\
    (B–C, Thornthwaite, Priestley–Taylor, Makkink and Turc) overestimated the ETo\
    \ compared\nto the standard FAO P–M [30,60–62]. Meanwhile, solar fertigation system\
    \ values slightly\nunderestimated the ETo. However, both the system and H–S models\
    \ showed a very close\ncorrelation to the standard FAO P–M.\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\

    \ Tables 3 and 4 revealed that among the tempera-\nture models, H–S provided signiﬁcant\
    \ results when compared to the standard FAO P–M by\nrecording the closest values\
    \ of MAE (0.55), MSE (0.62), RMSE (0.97), and R (0.87) for Molise,\nand MAE (0.64),\
    \ MSE (0.68), RMSE (0.97), and R (0.86), respectively, for Apulia, while the\n\
    furthest values of MAE (0.95), MSE (1.36), RMSE (1.74), and R (1.65) for Molise,\
    \ and MAE\n(0.99), MSE (1.36), RMSE (1.89), and R (1.81) for Apulia were recorded\
    \ by Makkink. Fur-\nthermore, the recorded data majorly showed underestimation\
    \ in B–C and overestimation\nin radiation models with respect to the standard\
    \ FAO P–M.\nFurther ﬁndings show that the solar fertigation system recorded a\
    \ near tendency with\nthe standard combination FAO P–M for MAE, MSE, RMSE, and\
    \ R as 0.52, 0.63, 0.93, and\n0.84, respectively, for Molise, and 0.63, 0.72,\
    \ 0.92, and 0.84, respectively, for Apulia region.\nSimilarly, in temperature\
    \ models, Thornthwaite produced the highest values for MAE, MSE,\nRMSE, and R\
    \ as 0.86, 0.99, 1.37, and 1.28 in Apulia, respectively, and the solar fertigation\n\
    system as the lowest values of MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R as 0.52, 0.63, 0.93, and\
    \ 0.84 in\nMolise region, respectively. Among radiation models, the highest values\
    \ of MAE, MSE,\nRMSE, and R were recorded by Makkink as 0.95, 1.36, 1.74, and\
    \ 1.65 in Molise and 0.99,\n1.36, 1.89, and 1.81 in the Apulia region, respectively.\
    \ An almost similar trend was revealed\nbetween nearby weather stations of the\
    \ Molise region (W2–Ferrazzano; W3–Oratino; and\nW4–Ripalimosani). On the contrary,\
    \ MAE correlation of radiation (Makkink, Priestley–\nTaylor and Turc) models with\
    \ high overestimation to the standard P–M model resulted;\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\
    \ 1012\n18 of 24\nhowever, solar fertigation system and temperature (H–S and B–C)\
    \ models revealed a\nslighter underestimation in the studied Mediterranean climate.\
    \ The MSE correlation was\nperformed which showed a slightly higher trend, while\
    \ the highest correlation by RMSE\nresulted in radiation models. This showed that\
    \ radiation models, particularly Makkink,\nhave less accuracy as compared to temperature\
    \ models.\nIn temperature models, the statistical analysis showed that the second\
    \ best ETo model\nis B–C with slightly accurate values in comparison to the standard\
    \ FAO model. The values\nof MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R revealed as 0.67, 0.84, 1.14,\
    \ and 0.97 in Molise, and 0.70, 0.95,\n1.28, and 0.95 in Apulia, respectively.\
    \ In radiation models, statistical analysis showed that\nMakkink revealed maximum\
    \ values of MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R as 0.95, 1.36, 1.74, and\n1.65 in Molise, and\
    \ 0.99, 1.36, 1.89, and 1.81 in Apulia, respectively. Models overestimated\nthe\
    \ daily ETo mean (3.63 mm day−1) of the standard FAO model while the solar fertigation\n\
    system and H–S slightly underestimated the ETo during the study. RMSE showed a\
    \ slightly\nhigher trend with maximum values in Makkink and minimum in the solar\
    \ fertigation\nsystem. The R statistical attribute for the solar fertigation model\
    \ and H–S showed highly\ncorrelative values to the standard FAO P–M.\nThis study\
    \ validated that radiation models may provide a certain level of accuracy for\n\
    ETo estimation [62]. However, temperature models are recorded to be the best models\
    \ for\nETo estimation in the Mediterranean climate [59].\n5. Discussion\nThe aim\
    \ of the experimental setup was to evaluate the efﬁciency of the solar fertigation\n\
    system by comparing it with three temperature-, three radiation-, and a combination-based\n\
    P–M ETo model for its accuracy in a Mediterranean region subject to signiﬁcant\
    \ spatial het-\nerogeneity in climatic conditions. The analysis was carried out\
    \ using climate records for the\n3-year historical period (1 January 2019–31 December\
    \ 2021) for 7 stations located in 2 differ-\nent agro-climatic zones of Italy.\
    \ Additionally, the study considered temperature and rainfall\ntrends, box plot\
    \ correlation of environmental parameters (Appendix A, Figures A1 and A2),\nand\
    \ statistical attributes among the tested data. The accuracy of monthly mean ETo\
    \ esti-\nmates by all six methods was assessed using ETo estimates by the FAO-56\
    \ P–M equation as\na reference considering stations pooled under different agro-climatic\
    \ zones.\nResults indicated that the performance of the monthly percent correlation\
    \ during the\nvalidation phase between the solar fertigation system and H–S was\
    \ highly correlated with\nthe standard P–M method as reﬂected in near values of\
    \ R and high values of RMSE across\nall zones. Among all the methods evaluated,\
    \ the solar fertigation and H-S approach resulted\nin the best values of correlation\
    \ in both the regions in the study area. Moratiel et al. [29]\nstudied a similar\
    \ trend and showed the non-calibrated H–S model performance to be better\nslightly\
    \ relative to the P–M model. Further correlation comparative analysis showed that\n\
    radiation models were located furthest from the standard model with low precision.\
    \ On the\ncontrary, among the empirical models, H–S was located nearest to the\
    \ standard FAO model.\nThis may result in Makkink followed by Turc as the least\
    \ precise model and Hargreaves\nas the best model among the tested ones. A similar\
    \ trend is illustrated in several other\nstudies [59]. Thornthwaite and other\
    \ relevant empirical models are extensively utilized\nworldwide due to their simplicity\
    \ and reliability of least parameter requirements [55];\nhowever, Xiang et al.\
    \ [61] stated that Thornthwaite [49] underestimates the ETo data\nin humid environmental\
    \ conditions. Several studies have shown that the background\nand the concept\
    \ presented by Thornthwaite [49] do not ﬁt to evaluate the ETo [61]. The\nThornthwaite\
    \ method mostly underestimates ETo under arid conditions and overestimates\nin\
    \ the equatorial humid climate. Priestley–Taylor [50] provides more accurate results\n\
    among radiation methods than other equations under arid environmental conditions\
    \ [63].\nYoder et al. [64] state that it overestimates the ETo in the USA. Cristea\
    \ et al. [65] report\nthat the coefﬁcient is considered as a primary factor of\
    \ variation in results under various\nevaporation surfaces and climatological\
    \ zones. Several studies compared the Makkink\nmodel with the lysimeter and showed\
    \ that observed ETo was lower than the measured\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1012\n19 of\
    \ 24\ndata [64]. Their study provided similar results to the pan evaporation data\
    \ conducted in\nSwitzerland [66]. Another study conducted in sub-humid and semiarid\
    \ regions of the USA\nshows that the Makkink model provides poor data when tested\
    \ along with a number of\nother models [67]. Turc was compared with several other\
    \ empirical models and lysimeter\nin a humid subtropical monsoon condition [68],\
    \ while RMSE of the Turc [52] showed\nthe lowest values among all. Liu et al.\
    \ [57] compared 16 models (including Turc) with\ndata observed using the lysimeter\
    \ at a semiarid zone, though the Turc [52] model showed\nmoderate results and\
    \ outrun Priestley–Taylor [50] and Makkink [51] models. The standard\nFAO P–M\
    \ model is considered the most efﬁcient method for estimating ETo. This model\n\
    is based on aerodynamic and physiological parameters of surface water available\
    \ in the\natmosphere and a huge set of meteorological parameters such as net radiation,\
    \ soil heat\nﬂux, vapor pressure deﬁcit of the air, mean air density, the heat\
    \ of the air, the slope of the\nsaturation vapor pressure, psychrometric constant,\
    \ and (bulk) surface and aerodynamic\nresistances [26]. FAO recommended this model\
    \ as a standard for estimating ETo and is\nvalidated in several studies [62].\
    \ Thus, our study used this model as a reference parameter\nto compare and evaluate\
    \ other ETo estimating models. Although preliminary analysis\nrevealed that weather\
    \ parameters were correlated with station elevations, further research\nis needed\
    \ to discover the effect of other inﬂuencing variables before models for regional\n\
    parameter estimation can be developed. Results showed that solar fertigation and\
    \ H–S\nrepresented a very close correlation to the standard FAO P–M and does offer\
    \ a small\nincrease in accuracy of ETo estimates, but this is offset by the need\
    \ to optimize additional\nparameters for worldwide utilization.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    Solar fertigation is a novel irrigation control system with a hybrid model predictive\n\
    control, based on a weather-based system integrated with a crop database controlled\
    \ by\nsoil moisture, water quality, and plant water status real-time sensors.\n\
    The system can be used by farmers to intelligently control, monitor, and automatically\n\
    schedule irrigation and fertilization strategies. The proposed system further\
    \ optimizes the\nirrigation- and nutrient-water input and maximized the crop yield\
    \ per unit of irrigation\nwater and nutrients. The photovoltaic panels make the\
    \ solar fertigation a stand-alone\nsystem that could also be installed in rural\
    \ or remote locations; furthermore, the prototype\nis a water, nutrient, and energy\
    \ saving sustainable system.\nA smart irrigation system is needed in the future\
    \ that estimates irrigation quality\nbefore irrigation in a rapid, robust, and\
    \ reliable way for ETo modeling based on limited\nenvironmental data and simple\
    \ strategies. The developed model can be installed with the\naim to estimate ETo\
    \ and sustainably manage crop irrigation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ more data-centric and requires precise, more advanced\ndata and technologies\
    \ than before, despite being familiar with agricultural processes. The agriculture\n\
    industry is being advanced by various information and advanced communication technologies,\
    \ such\nas the Internet of Things (IoT). The rapid emergence of these advanced\
    \ technologies has restructured\nalmost all other industries, as well as advanced\
    \ agriculture, which has shifted the industry from a\nstatistical approach to\
    \ a quantitative one. This radical change has shaken existing farming techniques\n\
    and produced the latest prospects in a series of challenges. This comprehensive\
    \ review article en-\nlightens the potential of the IoT in the advancement of\
    \ agriculture and the challenges faced when\ncombining these advanced technologies\
    \ with conventional agricultural systems. A brief analysis\nof these advanced\
    \ technologies with sensors is presented in advanced agricultural applications.\n\
    Numerous sensors that can be implemented for speciﬁc agricultural practices require\
    \ best manage-\nment practices (e.g., land preparation, irrigation systems, insect,\
    \ and disease management). This\nreview includes the integration of all suitable\
    \ techniques, from sowing to harvesting, packaging,\ntransportation, and advanced\
    \ technologies available for farmers throughout the cropping system.\nBesides,\
    \ this review article highlights the utilization of other tools such as unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) for crop monitoring and other beneﬁciary measures, such\
    \ as optimizing crop yields. In addi-\ntion, advanced programs based on the IoT\
    \ are also discussed. Finally, based on our comprehensive\nreview, we identiﬁed\
    \ advanced prospects regarding the IoT, which are essential tools for sustainable\n\
    agriculture.\nKeywords: IoT; agriculture advancement; UAVs; sustainable agriculture\n\
    1. Introduction\nIn order to increase agricultural production with limited resources,\
    \ major technological\nadvancements have been implemented throughout much of human\
    \ history. However, a\ngrowing population along with climate change always poses\
    \ a threat between food supply\nand demand. The world’s population is estimated\
    \ to reach 9 billion by 2050, which is\nabout a twenty-ﬁve percent increase over\
    \ the current population [1]. However, population\ngrowth will be larger, mostly\
    \ in emerging countries such as Mexico, India, China, and\nothers [2]. Additionally,\
    \ the urbanization trend is expected to accelerate in developing\ncountries by\
    \ 2050. Currently, 49% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, which\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4883. https://doi.org/10.3390/su13094883\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n2 of 31\nis expected to increase to 70% by 2050\
    \ [3]. Besides, since the living standard is expected\nto increase in the future,\
    \ it will further increase food demand, particularly in emerging\nnations. Due\
    \ to the continuous increase in the global population, we should be more\ncautious\
    \ regarding nutritional values and food quality. To meet future food demands,\n\
    food production should be doubled by 2050 [4,5]. In particular, grain crops and\
    \ meat\nproduction should be increased from 2.1 billion tons to 3 billion tons,\
    \ and 200 million tons\nto 470 million tons, respectively, to meet the world food\
    \ demand by 2050 [6,7].\nIndeed, crops such as rubber, cotton, and chewing gum\
    \ play a crucial role in various\ncountries’ economies. In addition, crop-based\
    \ bioenergy markets have recently begun to\ngrow. Even ten years ago, 110 million\
    \ tons of coarse grains (about 10% of world production)\nwere used for ethanol\
    \ production alone [7,8]. Food security is also threatened by the\nincreased use\
    \ of food crops for biofuel production, bioenergy, and other industrial uses.\n\
    These biofuel/bioenergy demands have put further pressure on already scarce agricultural\n\
    resources. Unfortunately, due to different constraints (e.g., temperature, terrain,\
    \ and soil\nand water qualities), only a limited part of the Earth’s surface is\
    \ appropriate for agricultural\nuse. Moreover, the existing farming land is further\
    \ narrowed because of economic and\npolitical factors, including population growth,\
    \ climate, and land-use patterns, while the\nrapid urbanization process is continuously\
    \ putting pressure on the availability of arable\nland. Thus, since arable land\
    \ is decreasing, these factors would be major threats to crop\nproduction. Additionally,\
    \ crop production is already reduced due to a lack of arable land\nover the last\
    \ few decades [8]. For example, in 1991, arable land for the crop production\n\
    was 19.5 million square miles, which was 39.47% of the total agricultural land\
    \ area, but\nthat area was decreased to 18.6 million square miles in 2013, which\
    \ is about 37.73% of\nthe total agricultural land area of the world and is expected\
    \ to decrease in the future [9].\nConsequently, a larger gap between the demand\
    \ and supply of food is observed, which\nbecomes apparent and shocking over time.\n\
    Further, the quality and quantity of crops rely on climate, topography, and soil\
    \ charac-\nteristics. Major features such as available nutrients, soil types,\
    \ soil health, insect resistance,\nand quality and quantity of irrigation determine\
    \ its adaptability and the quality of certain\ncrops. In most cases, crop characteristics\
    \ and yields may vary within the same farm plot.\nTherefore, site-speciﬁc analysis\
    \ or the precision farming technique is required to obtain\noptimal yields. Besides\
    \ increasing crop production, growers and farmers need to practice\nmultiple cropping,\
    \ mixed cropping, year-round cropping, or intensive cropping. To meet\nthese needs,\
    \ growers and farmers require the latest/advanced technologies and services-\n\
    based techniques to produce more foods with limited land and resources. Farmers/growers\n\
    must monitor their croplands at a near to real-time scale to apply necessary measures\
    \ to\nenhance crop production. For this reason, there is a need for smart agriculture.\n\
    Currently, farmers and growers have to spend 70% of their time monitoring and\n\
    understanding the status of the crops rather than performing actual farm work\
    \ [10]. Hence,\nprecise and advanced technologies are required to advance the\
    \ agricultural sector. Addi-\ntionally, for sustainable agriculture, the effects\
    \ of climatic and environmental conditions\nshould be minimal. The Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) gives producers better results because\nof “on-site monitoring”\
    \ capabilities, allowing them to monitor farms remotely. Wireless\nsensors help\
    \ to continuously monitor crops with greater accuracy, and most importantly,\n\
    they can identify issues at the early growth stages of crops/plants. The latest\
    \ technologies\nand tools enhance agricultural operations during the crop growth\
    \ stages, such as crop har-\nvesting, the transportation of cropping materials,\
    \ and storage conditions [10]. During these\ndevelopmental stages of crops, advanced\
    \ technology, such as the IoT, plays a signiﬁcant\nrole, making the process efﬁcient\
    \ for the growers. Currently, several tools, including har-\nvesters, robot weeders,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other automatic machines,\nare beneﬁcial\
    \ to the growers for crop monitoring. For this purpose, several sensors are\n\
    installed in the ﬁeld. These sensors rapidly provide information regarding soil\
    \ health and\ncrop health, and associated factors. The IoT is a part of the latest\

    \ \nFigure 2. Major applications, services, and sensors for advanced agriculture,\
    \ modiﬁed from Talavera\net al. [26].\n3.1. Soil Monitoring\nSoil plays a critical\
    \ role in plant growth. It is necessary to monitor the soil at the ﬁeld\nscale.\
    \ By obtaining the soil’s health information, a grower can make fruitful decisions\
    \ at\ndifferent plant developmental stages. The main objective of soil analysis\
    \ is to measure\nthe content of nutrients present in the soil, which ultimately\
    \ leads to many treatments to\nfulﬁll the level of nutrients. Remarkably, the\
    \ soil test is suggested annually in the spring\nseason; however, it can be changed\
    \ according to the local environmental conditions and\nSustainability 2021, 13,\
    \ 4883\n6 of 31\nconducted in the winter or autumn season [27]. Several soil factors,\
    \ such as soil types\nand soil moisture, are recommended to analyze and quantify\
    \ fertilizers and irrigation\nrequirements. These primary factors also help provide\
    \ information regarding the other\nvital factors, including physical, chemical,\
    \ biological ones. The soil map helps to identify\nareas with good soil health\
    \ and texture for the suitability of seeds, sowing time, and even\nsowing depth\
    \ because some plants have deep roots and others have shallow root depths.\nMany\
    \ researchers have recently developed tools, technologies, and devices to monitor\n\
    soil health. These new tools are the major resources for farmers and growers,\
    \ which can\nbe used to monitor soil features such as water holding capacity,\
    \ moisture, chemical, and\nphysical properties. These tools also help monitor\
    \ soil health, such as salinity, pH, soil\norganic carbon (SOC), electrical conductivity\
    \ (EC), nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus,\nwhich help estimate required fertilizers.\
    \ One of the latest tools introduced by Agro Cares is\nthe Scanner and Lab-in-box,\
    \ which is known as a laboratory, having complete information\nby services through\
    \ which it gives soil status information [28]. This is the modiﬁed tool\nused\
    \ by many farmers without any laboratory for sample analysis. This tool can analyze\n\
    about 100 soil samples daily.\nOne of the major issues for estimating crop water\
    \ requirements is continuously moni-\ntoring soil moisture. To monitor soil moisture,\
    \ in situ soil moisture sensors, remote sensors,\nand tools can be efﬁcient strategies\
    \ for many farms to obtain information about the soil’s\nmoisture. There are many\
    \ satellites in operation to measure soil moisture data at a global\nscale. These\
    \ remote sensing products are: (i) the Advanced Microwave Scanning Ra-\ndiometer\
    \ Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (2002–September 2011); (ii) the Soil Moisture\n\
    Ocean Salinity system (SMOS, 2010–present); (iii) AMSR2 (2012–present); and (iv)\
    \ the Soil\nMoisture Active Passive system (SMAP, 2015–present) [29]. For example,\
    \ Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS) was launched in 2009 and started to\
    \ monitor soil moisture from\nMay 2010 globally. In addition, in situ wireless\
    \ soil moisture sensors can also monitor soil\nmoisture at the farm scale.\nNew\
    \ tools, including the vision-based and wireless sensors, are used to determine\n\
    crop factors, such as soil depth, for efﬁcient seeding processes. Several robotic\
    \ tools are\ndeveloped for smart farming and improve crop production, such as\
    \ FarmBot and Agribots,\njust to name a couple. In agriculture practices, such\
    \ as sowing seeds, weeding, fertilizing,\nand irrigating, such tools would help\
    \ improve crop production if it is implemented at a\nlarge scale. Agribots is\
    \ a type of robot; the agriculture ﬁeld’s location is determined by\npairing digital\
    \ computers with the vehicle vision system. This type of robot works on any\n\
    agricultural land in which the global positioning system (GPS) helps develop location\
    \ maps.\nSensors that are mounted with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) help provide\
    \ information\nregarding the ﬂow rate of seed. Many remote sensors are used for\
    \ this purpose [30]. These\nLEDs are the source of receiving radiations that have\
    \ visible and infrared light waves. Seed\nmovement is monitored through many elements,\
    \ including light band, voltage output,\nand receiving element. Measurement of\
    \ the ﬂow rate of seed is conducted through signals\ncorrelated by transferring\
    \ seeds. Overall, advanced technologies and tools help analyze\nsoils, which further\
    \ help monitor crop growth and production.\n3.2. Irrigation\nOn the Earth, oceans\
    \ hold 97% of all water, but it is saline. The other three percent of\nwater is\
    \ fresh, among which 2% to 3% of the water is in the form of glaciers [31,32].\
    \ Out\nof three percent, half percent of freshwater is present as surface water,\
    \ and the remaining\nfreshwater is groundwater. People have to rely on the half\
    \ percent of freshwater to sustain\ntheir lives. This half percent of freshwater\
    \ includes water storage in lakes, rivers, and other\nreservoirs. Agriculture\
    \ uses almost 75% of freshwater [33,34]. In many countries, such as\nBrazil, the\
    \ demand for crops has increased to 75% [35]. Among several constraints, the lack\n\
    of proper monitoring tools to estimate crop water requirement is the actual cause\
    \ of the\nad hoc application of irrigation water. For example, the US uses about\
    \ 80% of freshwater\nfor irrigation purposes [5]. In the United Nations Convention\
    \ to Combat Desertiﬁcation\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n7 of 31\n(UNCCD) held\
    \ in 2013, it was found that about 168 countries of the world have a shortage\n\
    of water for irrigation. Research has showed that there would be a huge water\
    \ shortage for\nirrigation throughout the world by 2030 [36].\nDue to the increase\
    \ in irrigation water requirements, freshwater will only be available\nto those\
    \ countries that have adopted the best water resources management practice. For\n\
    this purpose, to reduce the water shortage, awareness programs should be promoted\
    \ to\nadopt effective irrigation practices. Many new irrigation techniques, including\
    \ sprinkler\nand drip irrigation methods, are used to reduce the losses and water\
    \ shortage. Traditional\napproaches, including furrow and ﬂood irrigation, cause\
    \ the waste of water. Moreover,\ntraditional irrigation approaches (e.g., ﬂooding)\
    \ reduce many soil nutrients through water\nlosses, which impact crop yield. Robust\
    \ technologies and tools are needed, which include\nsmart irrigation techniques.\
    \ The smart irrigation techniques help estimate crop water\nrequirements based\
    \ on soil types, antecedent soil moisture, and climatic conditions. In this\n\
    situation, many new tools such as the IoT play a signiﬁcant role in measuring\
    \ air and soil\nhumidity, which ultimately leads to the improvement of crops.\n\
    Crop improvement and its quality can be enhanced by the effective management of\n\
    soil and water. The use of the IoT, such as for irrigation management based on\
    \ the crop\nwater stress index (CWSI), is expected to improve crop efﬁciency signiﬁcantly\
    \ [30]. For this\nreason, the calculation of the CWSI requires one to obtain a\
    \ crop canopy at different times\nand temperatures. A CWSI is a wireless sensor-based\
    \ monitoring system that includes\nseveral crop parameter measurement systems\
    \ that help estimate moisture status, which is\nused to estimate irrigation water\
    \ requirements [11].\n3.3. Crop Disease and Its Management\nFamine in Ireland\
    \ occurred due to Phytophthora infestans, causing the late blight of\npotato,\
    \ which caused many crop losses. Due to this famine, about one million people\
    \ in\nIreland died [37]. In the USA, the southern corn leaf blight caused by Cochliobolus\
    \ heterostro-\nphus brought famine and crop losses of nearly one billion USD.\
    \ Later, this crop disease was\nspread to Canada [38]. The Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization (FAO) estimated 20% to\n40% annual crop loss per year due to crop\
    \ diseases [39]. Several agricultural management\nstrategies were applied to recover\
    \ these losses, such as the use of pesticides and fungi-\ncides. These approaches\
    \ are practiced in advanced agriculture since the last century. It\nis estimated\
    \ that approximately 500,000 tons of pesticides are used each year in the US\n\
    alone. In contrast, in other countries of the world, about two million tons of\
    \ pesticides are\napplied for disease management [40]. Although these pesticides\
    \ are used for plant disease\nmanagement to increase crop production, there are\
    \ many other harmful aspects to animals\nand humans’ health. It also disturbs\
    \ the world’s ecology and eventually causes severe\nenvironmental pollution to\
    \ the entire ecosystem [5,41].\nMany of the advanced technologies, such as the\
    \ IoT, play a signiﬁcant role in reducing\nthe usage of these chemicals, which\
    \ are hazardous to human health. Many crop disease\nmonitoring programs such as\
    \ crop modeling, the prediction of pests, and weather forecasts\nare monitored\
    \ by these advanced and emerging technologies in agriculture. These tech-\nnologies\
    \ are considered effective approaches for plant/crop disease management [42,43].\n\
    Although treatment, perception, and assessment are important in disease forecasting,\n\
    monitoring, and management, advanced technologies (e.g., the IoT, wireless sensors,\
    \ and\nUAVs) are beneﬁcial for disease identiﬁcation and pest management. For\
    \ example, remote\nsensing technology can be used to capture large areas of agricultural\
    \ cropland economically.\nThe remote sensors can be used to analyze crop processing,\
    \ including disease and pests,\nplant health, and the environment [43,44]. This\
    \ remote sensing tool is low cost and has\nmany advantages, such as a low cost\
    \ for automatic activation and supporting recovery.\nFor example, recently, the\
    \ yields of many crops have been severely threatened by the poor\npollination\
    \ process [45].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n8 of 31\n3.4. Fertilizer\nPlant\
    \ growth, development, and reproduction mainly depend on the necessary nu-\ntrients\
    \ received from fertilizers or organic amendments. For the development of ﬂower,\n\
    fruit, and root, three signiﬁcant nutrients are needed: for leaf growth, nitrogen\
    \ is necessary;\nfor root development, phosphorus and the expansion of stem and\
    \ water passage in pant\npotassium is required [36]. Plant health can be affected\
    \ by the imbalance application of\nthese fertilizers to the plant. On the other\
    \ hand, the excessive application of these nutrients\nand fertilizers to the plant\
    \ not only affects plant health and causes economic losses but\nalso affects the\
    \ environment, including qualities of soil, water, and air. For example, only\n\
    half of the total nitrogen is utilized for crop development, and another half\
    \ of nitrogen\nis released into the environment. The imbalanced application of\
    \ undesired nutrients to\nthe crops causes a negative impact on the environment\
    \ and climate. It also increases the\nnutrient level in the soil [46]. New technology\
    \ such as the IoT is beneﬁcial for the exact\nestimation of the rate of fertilizers\
    \ in smart agriculture. These approaches also reduce the\nnegative effect on environmental\
    \ conditions.\nNew technology is used to estimate the spatial–temporal application\
    \ of nutrients\nfor the fulﬁllment of fertilization, which is relatively less\
    \ laborious and has maximum\nefﬁciency [47]. Generally, the normalized vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) is used to monitor\nvegetation health, which ultimately helps to\
    \ predict the application of nutrients in the\nsoil. The efﬁcacy of nutrient application\
    \ can be enhanced by such efﬁcient methods, which\nultimately reduces the other\
    \ effect on the environment. Many recent enabling technologies\nsuch as geographic\
    \ information systems (GIS) [48], variable rate technology [49], and global\n\
    positioning systems (GPS) [50,51] are used to estimate nutrients in the ﬁeld [52–54].\
    \ For\nthe betterment of crops, it was observed that fertilizers are the best\
    \ source for improving\ncrop productions, and they can be triggered by only the\
    \ use of new tools and technology\nknown as the IoT [55].\n3.5. Crop Harvesting\
    \ Monitoring and Forecasting\nMoisture level, the ﬂow of grain mass, crop yield,\
    \ and quantity or number of grains per\ncrop are monitored and diagnosed by the\
    \ yield monitoring system. To analyze the crop’s\noverall performance, it is necessary\
    \ to check the level of the moisture and crop yield. Crop\nmonitoring during the\
    \ growing period is one of the essential processes. The measurement\nof crop yield\
    \ is not only critical at the time of harvest, but it is also important to measure\
    \ crop\nyield before the harvesting and during the crop’s developmental processes.\
    \ Various aspects\nare required for monitoring crop yield, including a high level\
    \ of pollination, particularly\nwhen the environment is changing; there is a need\
    \ for the prediction of seeds [56–58].\nCrop forecasting is a technique that predicts\
    \ yields before harvest occurs. Such fore-\ncasts help farmers make near-term\
    \ plans and decisions. Moreover, the accurate harvesting\ntime can be estimated\
    \ by the analysis of crop maturity and its quality. The monitoring\nprocess can\
    \ also judge many of the fruit factors such as fruit color, size, quality, and\
    \ devel-\nopmental stages. Crop disease management strategies and other developmental\
    \ stages\nsuch as crop yield and its quality can be enhanced by crop prediction.\
    \ For this, awareness\nabout the appropriate harvesting schedule is necessary\
    \ for the betterment of crops. Figure 3\nindicates a typical snapshot of the farm\
    \ area network (FAN), which gives real-time portraits\nof the whole agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to the farmer.\nA new technology, such as a developed yield monitor, can\

    \ new devices such as the IoT for agriculture advancement.\n4.1. Greenhouse Agriculture\n\
    Growing plants in controlled conditions is a relatively new technology and a type\
    \ of\nadvanced agriculture. This technique became popular in the 19th century\
    \ when a number\nof greenhouses were built in Italy, the Netherlands, and France\
    \ for growing plants, unsea-\nsonal vegetables, and fruits. This type of new agriculture\
    \ technology was enhanced in the\n20th century, and countries with climate/weather\
    \ issues started to apply this technology\nrapidly [60]. Crops that are grown\
    \ in a controlled environment require minimum inputs\nbecause crops grow under\
    \ controlled conditions. This controlled environment is developed\nin the greenhouse.\
    \ Due to this controlled environment, seasonal and unseasonal crops are\ngrown\
    \ anywhere and at any time in the world. Several new toolkits such as wireless\
    \ com-\nmunication, mobile devices, and other internet devices are used to adopt\
    \ this technology.\nBenke and Tomkins [61], who conducted a comprehensive analysis,\
    \ reported that advanced\ntoolkits could help to adopt greenhouse technology.\
    \ Various other toolkits, including\nprototype-based internet, are used to monitor\
    \ weather parameters, such as temperature,\npressure, and humidity.\n4.2. Hydroponics\n\
    The most advanced method for seasonal and unseasonal crops is to grow in water\n\
    under controlled conditions without a soil medium. In this approach, nutrients\
    \ and\nfertilizers are applied through the irrigation system. When VF and hydroponics\
    \ are used in\ncombination, every square meter farm can use almost 95% less water\
    \ and nutrients without\nusing any chemicals [62]. In a hydroponics system, the\
    \ accuracy of nutrient measurement\nis critical. Therefore, a highly reliable\
    \ wireless control system for tomato hydroponics was\nproposed [63,64]. In this\
    \ method, monitoring the water content and its accuracy is essential.\nIn a prototype\
    \ based on wireless sensors, it was proposed to provide the cultivation of crops\n\
    in hydroponics by the turnkey solution, which gives the measurements and estimations\n\
    regarding the plant growth in the absence of soil media. Furthermore, there was\
    \ a new tool,\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n10 of 31\na compact sensor that\
    \ uses the oscillator circuit. The primary purpose of this device is to\nmonitor\
    \ the occurrence and concentration of different fertilizers and irrigation levels\
    \ [65].\n4.3. Vertical Farming (VF)\nArable land is decreasing with the increase\
    \ in the human population, urbanization,\npollution, and soil erosion. The VF\
    \ is the progressive technique of advanced agriculture,\nwhich allows one to grow\
    \ the crops and plants in controlled conditions, and signiﬁcantly,\nthis efﬁciently\
    \ decreases the consumption of many resources. VF is the most suitable\nagricultural\
    \ approach in which a small patch of land is required to cultivate crops compared\n\
    to traditional farming. This conventional farming technique needs several resources,\
    \ not\nonly for crops [65,66]. Unfortunately, current farming practices, based\
    \ on industrialized\nagriculture, are destroying soil health much more than natural\
    \ reconstruction. Overall, it\nhas been reported that the soil erosion rate is\
    \ higher (10 to 40 times) than the formation\nrate of the soil. Recent measures\
    \ used for farming cause a loss of healthy soil from the\nagricultural land, which\
    \ is a major hazard to food production in the upcoming days.\nBesides, as we assume,\
    \ about 70% of the freshwater is only utilized for the farming system,\nwhich\
    \ will enhance the pressure on the existing water reservoirs or storage. VF is\
    \ the\nsolution for many limitations and challenges for land management and a\
    \ shortage of\nfreshwater.\nFor this purpose, according to Mirai, a Japanese-based\
    \ indoor farming tool provides\ndata of about 25,000 square meters of Japanese\
    \ agricultural farms. Notably, it utilizes\nthe minimum level of irrigation water\
    \ compared to the production of crops in outdoor\nconditions and 40% of the energy\
    \ [67]. The aviation farm is the leader of VF, where the yield\nof agricultural\
    \ products in New York increased by 390 times, while water consumption was\nreduced\
    \ by 95% [68]. Carbon dioxide is one of the crucial factors in farming as compared\n\
    to other aspects of agriculture. For the estimation of carbon dioxide, a new toolkit,\
    \ which is\na non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) carbon dioxide wireless sensor that\
    \ participates in the\ncomplete control of VF [69,70] connected to mobile devices\
    \ and wireless communication\ntechnologies. These devices can automatically check\
    \ the crops at each development phase.\n4.4. Phenotyping\nThe smart methods discussed\
    \ earlier seem more promising for advancing agriculture,\nas they have been utilized\
    \ to grow various crops in a conducive environment. Besides,\nsome advanced technologies\
    \ are evaluated to control their limitations through advanced\nsensing and communication\
    \ technologies, thereby further enhancing crop capabilities. The\nmost efﬁcient\
    \ method is the phenotyping approach, the advanced genetic engineering tech-\n\
    nique, and biotechnology, which correlates the genetic sequences of crops for\
    \ agronomical\nand physiological aspects, as described in Figure 4. In the last\
    \ few decades, several modiﬁ-\ncations have been made in the ﬁeld of genetic engineering\
    \ and biotechnology. However,\nmany factors such as grain weight and disease resistance\
    \ have not been dealt with yet due\nto a lack of efﬁcient techniques.\nRecent\
    \ advancements have described that phenotypes play an efﬁcient role in de-\ntermining\
    \ many quantitative factors such as plant growth, disease resistance, crop yield,\n\
    and crop quality in advanced genetic engineering and biotechnology [71]. One of\
    \ these\ntools is image-based phenotypes and sensors, which monitor how these\
    \ resolutions cannot\naccommodate numerous screen stimulants and help them understand\
    \ the mode of action,\nthereby participating in their success [72]. Moreover,\
    \ other tools such as the IoT and\nCropQuant-based phenotypes techniques are used\
    \ to analyze many crop-related factors\nsuch as crop traits by genetic engineering\
    \ and biotechnology for advanced agriculture [73].\nMoreover, an automated production\
    \ site-controlled program was established to continue\nthe generation of data\
    \ by this program. Machine learning modeling and feature analysis\nalgorithms\
    \ are given to exploit the association among phenotypes, growth environments,\n\
    and genotypes.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n11 of 31\n \nfor agronomical and\
    \ physiological aspects, as described in Figure 4. In the last few dec-\nades,\
    \ several modifications have been made in the field of genetic engineering and\
    \ bio-\ntechnology. However, many factors such as grain weight and disease resistance\
    \ have not \nbeen dealt with yet due to a lack of efficient techniques. \n \n\

    \ Machine learning modeling and feature anal-\nysis algorithms are given to exploit\
    \ the association among phenotypes, growth environ-\nments, and genotypes. \n\
    5. Major Equipment and Technologies \nIn traditional agriculture, most farming\
    \ measures are applied by heavy machinery, \nincluding harvesters, massive robots,\
    \ and tractors. Several communications and remote \nsensing techniques are used\
    \ to operate these machines. In advanced farming, for many \ncrop-related practices\
    \ such as irrigation, sowing, fertilizer application, and harvesting of \ncrops,\
    \ these machines and equipment are supported by GIS and GPS technologies, which\
    \ \nare very accurate, efficient, and precise. Moreover, other agricultural measures\
    \ (the site-\nspecific management of crops) cannot replace these advanced techniques.\
    \ The develop-\nment of contemporary agriculture needs the efficiency of gathered\
    \ information and gen-\nerally has two parts [9]. First, remote sensing programs\
    \ with multifunctional devices, in-\ncluding UAVs, aircraft, and satellites, are\
    \ needed. Second, many other devices, such as \nground and remote sensors, are\
    \ required for particular functions at different locations. A \nGPS device can\
    \ be used to identify the data collection spot’s location, which can be used \n\
    for location-specific processing.  \nOver the past few decades, agriculture has\
    \ shifted from small and medium-sized ag-\nriculture to highly industrialized\
    \ and commercial agriculture. This shift plays an im-\nportant role in advancing\
    \ the agricultural industry like other developed industries be-\nFigure 4. The\

    \ the agricultural industry like other developed industries because,\nin agriculture,\
    \ data, control, and measurement are signiﬁcant factors in accomplishing\nequality\
    \ among production and cost to enhance outputs. For this purpose, the IoT is a\
    \ fun-\ndamental approach for advancement and beneﬁts in agriculture, which are\
    \ well planned,\nmanaged, and automated. According to this information, between\
    \ 2017 and 2022, the\nworld’s advanced agricultural industry is expected to grow\
    \ by 19.3% in one year and reach\nUSD 23.14 billion in 2022 [33].\n5.1. Smartphone\n\
    Although strong cellular communications coverage is lacking, cellular communica-\n\
    tions are the main communication methods in remote regions. Whenever a contractor\n\
    is needed to update most agricultural communities, smartphones are a powerful\
    \ com-\nmunication technology and the primary method of communication. Recent\
    \ advances in\nthe smartphone industry have led to a sharp drop in prices, which\
    \ has made the sector\nmore attractive, especially for small farmers in rural\
    \ regions. According to the global\nsystem assessment for mobile communications,\
    \ this proportion is almost eight percent [74].\nMoreover, features and ﬂexibility,\
    \ including GPS, microphone cameras, accelerometers,\nproximity, and gyroscopes,\
    \ have attracted IT technicians who are creating more attractive\nsmartphone functions\
    \ to satisfy many demands of farmers [75–78].\nDue to advancements in the research,\
    \ experts have developed various new tools and\napproaches strategically to implement\
    \ smartphone technology in agriculture. Several\ndeveloping countries, such as\
    \ Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, Mali, and Zimbabwe, are\nadopting advanced tools\
    \ and techniques in agriculture [79–82]. Moreover, smartphone\ntechnology is used\
    \ in many countries, such as China, Turkey, India, and several African\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4883\n12 of 31\ncountries, which are listed above. These countries\
    \ are implementing this advanced tech-\nnology to increase agriculture production\
    \ and boost their economies [83–86]. The use\nof smartphones in the agricultural\
    \ sector signiﬁcantly depends upon numerous aspects.\nFor this purpose, studies\
    \ were conducted to determine smartphones’ usage for several\nagriculture measures\
    \ [87].\nTable 1 presents the classiﬁcation of smartphone-related sensors that\
    \ have attracted\nexperts to use them for different agricultural purposes. Table\

    \ and reporting of information are considered to be the\ncentral part of advanced\
    \ agriculture. The strong connection and participation of many\nfactors are needed\
    \ to retrieve efﬁcient and signiﬁcant purposes. Telecom operators play\nan essential\
    \ role in disseminating communication reliability in agriculture development.\n\
    Moreover, expanding the advancement of the IoT and widespread knowledge to improve\n\
    the advanced agricultural industry needs a highly efﬁcient management system.\
    \ Many\nfactors, including coverage, energy consumption, reliability, and cost,\
    \ are signiﬁcant and\nnecessary before selecting a communication method.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Cellular Communication\nDepending on the purpose and bandwidth requirements,\
    \ a cellular communication\nmode increase from 2G to 5G might be appropriate.\
    \ Besides, the reliability and even\naccessibility of cellular networks is a key\
    \ factor in rural areas. To solve this major problem,\ninformation transmission\
    \ through satellite is another important option. Still, in this case,\nthe price\
    \ of this communication mode can be very high, which makes it inappropriate for\n\
    small and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication model also relies on\
    \ the\nrequirements of the application. For example, some farms require sensors\
    \ to operate at a\nlow data rate, but they need to work for a long time and require\
    \ a longer battery life. In\nthis case, the new series of the low-power wide area\
    \ network (LPWAN) is considered to be\nan excellent answer for cellular networks.\
    \ The LPWAN has a longer battery life and has\na more massive connection range,\
    \ and an affordable price (2 to 15 USD) [103]. Currently,\ncrop and pasture management\
    \ are the two main applications where LPWAN networks\nare very suitable, and due\
    \ to their success, they can be used for many other agricultural\napplications\
    \ [104]. Generally, wireless sensors used in agricultural applications are divided\n\
    into three main categories according to the communication information rate and\
    \ power\nconsumption (Table 3).\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n14 of 31\nTable\

    \ wireless communication mode that links small-sized devices\nover short distances.\
    \ There are many IoT agriculture devices that are Bluetooth enabled,\nsuch as\
    \ Farm note Air gateway and Color sensor work with Bluetooth-enabled sensors.\n\
    Bluetooth has an ubiquitous nature, due to which it is studied as suitable equipment\
    \ for\nmulti-tier farming functions [105].\n5.2.3. Zigbee\nZigbee is mainly created\
    \ for a comprehensive range of applications, particularly\nto replace non-standard\
    \ equipment. According to application needs, devices based on\nthis etiquette\
    \ can be one of the three categories: router, coordinator, and end-devices.\n\
    Besides, Zigbee networks support three different topologies, namely Cluster Tree,\
    \ Start, and\nMesh [106]. Based on these traits and contemplating the needs of\
    \ agricultural applications,\nZigBee can perform a signiﬁcant role, particularly\
    \ for the environments of greenhouses\nthat often require short-range transmissions.\
    \ During different parameter observations,\nactual-time information from the sensor\
    \ nodes is transmitted to the terminal server via\nZigbee [107,108]. For applications\
    \ such as fertilizers and irrigation, the ZigBee module can\nbe used for transmission,\
    \ such as in drip irrigation, to check the soil moisture content.\n5.3. Sensor\
    \ Devices\nAmong all the devices used in advanced agriculture today, sensor devices\
    \ are highly\ncritical and perform a crucial role in collecting crop status and\
    \ other information. Sensor\ndevices can be utilized separately or in the group\
    \ as needed. Moreover, sensor devices\nare used for advanced farming because of\
    \ their robust technology. Next, the discussion is\nbased on the working process\
    \ and purpose of the main sensor types and their beneﬁts. The\nmajor sensor devices\
    \ used in advanced agriculture are listed in Table 4.\nTable 4. Types of sensor\

    several factors, such as forecasting, monitoring, yield assessment, crop evaluation,\
    \ land\ndegradation, and pest management (e.g., using LiDAR, satellite, UAVs).\
    \ For example, the\nArgos sensor can be used for processing, disseminating, and\
    \ collecting global-based data and\nis compatible with smartphone platforms.\n\

    Employment\nReferences\nAcoustic Sensor\nAcoustic sensors provide other tools\
    \ for farm management, such as weeding and fruit\nharvesting. The major advantage\
    \ of this advanced technology is its low price with quick\nresponse capabilities,\
    \ particularly when considering convenient devices.\n[33,117,118]\nLight Detection\n\
    and Ranging\n(LIDAR)\nThis technology is utilized in different agricultural applications,\
    \ including segmentation, land\nmapping, farm 3D models, determining soil types,\

    \ utilized to monitor dynamic measurements, such as leaf\narea and fruit.\n[119–124]\n\
    Optical Sensor\nThese sensors use the phenomenon of light reﬂection to help measure\
    \ soil organic matter, soil\nmoisture, and color, the presence of minerals and\
    \ their composition, clay content, etc. These\nsensors can be used to evaluate\
    \ the soil’s ability to reﬂect light based on different parts of the\nselector’s\
    \ magnetic ﬁeld.\n[125,126]\nUltrasonic Ranging\nSensor\nThis type of sensor can\
    \ be one of the best choices in various agricultural applications because\nof\
    \ its low price. It is easy to use, and its sampling rate can easily be adjusted/modiﬁed.\n\
    Frequent uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (for example, boom\
    \ height\nand width control for uniform spray reporting, object detection, and\
    \ collision avoidance), and\ncrop canopy monitoring.\n[127–129]\nOptoelectronic\n\
    Sensor\nOptoelectronic sensors can distinguish plant types; hence, they help to\
    \ detect weeds, and\nother plants, particularly in wide-row crops. Optoelectronic\
    \ sensors are also capable of\ndifferentiating between vegetation and soil from\
    \ their reﬂection spectra.\n[130]\nElectromagnetic\nSensor\nElectromagnetic sensors\
    \ are used to record conductivity and transient electromagnetic\nresponses, identify\

    \ Sensors based on this technology use electrical circuits to measure the ability\
    \ of\nsoil particles to conduct or accumulate charge, which is mainly accomplished\
    \ by two\nmethods; contact or non-contact.\n[131]\nElectrochemical\nSensor\nThis\
    \ is used to assess soil characteristics to analyze the soil’s nutrient level,\
    \ for example, pH.\nStandard chemical soil assessment methods are often time-consuming\
    \ and expensive and can\nbe simply replaced with these advanced sensors. These\
    \ sensors are used to measure macro\nand micronutrients, salinity, and pH in the\
    \ soil precisely.\n[132,133]\nMechanical\nSensors\nMechanical sensors evaluate\
    \ the mechanical resistance (compaction) of the soil to indicate\nvariable compaction.\
    \ Mechanical sensors enter or pass through the soil and record forces\nevaluated\

    \ the soil’s permeability and moisture content and identify the soil\nstructure\
    \ to distinguish different soil types. Measurements can be made in a single position\
    \ or\ndynamically during movement, for example, in a ﬁxed position or mobile mode.\n\
    [135]\nMass Flow Sensor\nThis sensor is used for yield monitoring because it provides\
    \ yield information by measuring\nthe amount of grain ﬂow (for example, when passing\
    \ through a combine harvesting).\n[136,137]\nEddy\nCovariance-Based\nSensor\n\
    This sensor can be utilized to quantify the exchange of water vapor, carbon dioxide,\
    \ methane,\nand other hydrologic and climatic parameters. This eddy covariance\
    \ technique provides a\nrobust technique to quantify the gas ﬂuxes among soil,\
    \ vegetation, and atmosphere, which\nare essential for most agricultural applications\
    \ in various ecosystems.\n[134,138]\nSWLB Sensor\nSoft water level-based (SWLB)\
    \ sensors are utilized in advanced agricultural watersheds to\nmonitor hydrological\
    \ behavior, including flow and water level, inflexible time-step acquisitions.\n\
    [9,136]\nNote: This list is an effort to compile most of sensors used in the advanced\
    \ agriculture. It is not meant to be a comprehensive list as many\nmore sensor\
    \ devices are used in agriculture.\n5.4. Advanced Machines Used to Advance Agriculture\n\
    As technology advances, most manufacturers provide tractors with automatic drives.\n\
    This equipment is not advanced because self-driving tractors were already on the\
    \ market\neven before semi-autonomous vehicles. One of the major beneﬁts of self-driving\
    \ tractors is\nthe capacity to prevent re-entering in a similar area or a similar\
    \ row via decreasing overlaps\nwith less than an inch. Moreover, they can create\
    \ extremely accurate turns without a\ndriver. The device provides higher accuracy\
    \ and reduces errors, especially when spraying\npesticides or target weeds; these\
    \ are almost impossible when people control the machine.\nAlthough there are no\
    \ fully automated tractors/machines in the market today, many\nscientists, researchers,\
    \ and manufacturers are working to develop the new equipment.\nBased on the future\
    \ needs of high-tech new tractors, it is expected that about 700,000 new\ntractors\
    \ outﬁtted with features such as tractor guidance or automatic steering will be\
    \ sold\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n16 of 31\nby 2028 [5,139]. Further, it\
    \ is expected that about 40,000 unmanned driving, completely\nautonomous cars\
    \ (level 5), and tractors will be sold by 2038 [109].\nHowever, most farmers cannot\
    \ afford such advanced farming machines, and most\ntractor service providers and\
    \ manufacturers operate far below their potentials. Considering\nthese challenges,\
    \ for example, Hello Tractor has developed a solution to these problems.\nThe\
    \ company has developed a low-cost monitoring device that can be installed on\
    \ any\ntractor, providing powerful software and analysis tools [113,140]. The\
    \ beneﬁts of this\ndevice are twofold: it ensures that most growers can afford\
    \ the tractor’s total cost while\nmonitoring the condition of the tractor and\
    \ reports if any problems occur. The software\nconnects tractor owners to farmers\
    \ who need tractor services, just like Uber’s tractors.\nAnother major example\
    \ is Case IH’s Magnum series tractors, which use on-board cameras\nand light detection\
    \ and ranging (LiDAR) sensors to detect the object that helps avoid\ncollision\
    \ and control accidents caused by agricultural vehicles [141].\n5.5. Cloud Computing\n\
    Growers can use cloud facilities to access data from predictive analytics agencies\
    \ so\nthat they can ﬁnd the right products based on their exact needs. Cloud computing\
    \ offers\ngrowers a knowledge-based repository that contains valuable information\
    \ and experience\nrelated to farming methods and equipment options available on\
    \ the market. The scheme\ncan be further extended to include access to consumer\
    \ databases, supply chains, and billing\nsystems to make it more active.\nObviously,\
    \ cloud-based services offer ample opportunities but also bring new chal-\nlenges.\
    \ First, various sensors are being developed and utilized in smart farming, each\n\
    with its unique data format and semantics. Second, most decision support systems\
    \ are\napplication-speciﬁc. On the other hand, farmers may need access to various\
    \ systems for\nspeciﬁc applications, such as soil monitoring. Considering these\
    \ two situations, cloud-\nbased decision support systems not only need to handle\
    \ the diverse data and their formats,\nbut they should also be able to conﬁgure\
    \ these formats for various applications.\n5.6. Harvesting\nIn the agriculture\
    \ sector, harvesting is a crucial phase in the crop production process\nbecause\
    \ this ﬁnal stage determines crop yield and, eventually, the crop’s performance.\n\
    Regarding manpower, it is expected that the US faces USD 3.1 billion worth of\
    \ crop losses\neach year due to manpower shortages [142]. Additionally, according\
    \ to the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), 14% of total agricultural\
    \ costs are spent on wages\nand labor, and as high as 39% on some labor-intensive\
    \ farms [143]. Considering the\nexpense and manpower shortage issues at this stage,\
    \ farm experts hope that the use of\nagricultural robotics technology will not\
    \ only reduce manpower shortage but also provide\nﬂexible harvesting capabilities\
    \ when required. Automatic fruit harvesting requires in-depth\nresearch on sophisticated\
    \ sensors that can collect precise and unambiguous information\nabout speciﬁc\
    \ crops and fruits.\nFor example, strawberries are highly consumed fruits and\
    \ can be purchased all year\nround. However, manpower, particularly during the\
    \ packaging and harvesting stages, is a\nmajor factor for the high-level price\
    \ of this fruit [144]. Because this fruit is mostly cultivated\nin the greenhouses\
    \ system, the harvesting robot can reduce the production cost. A robot\ndeveloped\
    \ by Agrobot is capable of collecting strawberries along the ﬁeld’s strawberry\n\
    plant rows and enhancing packaging through the operator [145]. For example, Agrobot’s\n\
    SW 6010 is a semi-automatic robot for semi-automatic strawberry picking. Tektu\
    \ T-100 is a\nrechargeable electric strawberry harvester that operates multiple\
    \ channels with a net-zero\nemission [144].\n6. Uses of UAVs in Agriculture Advancement\n\
    Currently, the IoT plays an important role in several ﬁelds, such as the agriculture\n\
    industry (e.g., ﬁsh and poultry). There is a limited communication network in\
    \ the agricul-\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n17 of 31\ntural sector, including\
    \ Wi-Fi and base stations, which decreases the coverage of internet\ntechnology.\
    \ Advanced communication technologies are the worst in developing countries,\n\
    which are the major hurdles and challenges for the implementation of the IoT in\
    \ agriculture.\nWithout a reliable communication infrastructure, the information\
    \ collected using sensor\ndevices is not transferred quickly for analysis in developing\
    \ countries [146]. Under these\ncircumstances, UAVs can provide an alternate option\
    \ to gather information for data analysis\nand processing. Moreover, UAVs equipped\
    \ with advanced thermal, multispectral, hyper-\nspectral cameras, and wireless\
    \ sensors can collect data from several hectares of agricultural\nlands in a short\
    \ duration. Currently, the agriculture sector can obtain tremendous beneﬁts\n\
    by deploying UAVs to address several major and long-term issues. We highlight\
    \ some\nimportant areas where UAVs have played a crucial role in assisting growers\
    \ throughout\nthe crop cycle globally [147].\n6.1. Soil and Water Analysis\nNew\
    \ technology such as UAVs can provide accurate data to examine soil and soil\n\
    water before planting crops, which can help determine which crops are best suited\
    \ for a\nparticular land. In addition, it can provide information about the type\
    \ of seed and how it\ncan be grown under particular soils and environments [148].\n\
    6.2. Planting\nToday, millions of acres are not cultivated worldwide due to the\
    \ lack of appropriate\nmanpower or human inaccessibility. The safety issue of\
    \ the rough terrain is the major\nproblem for not utilizing these areas for agricultural\
    \ or forestry purposes. To this end,\ndrone-based sowing methods are being established\
    \ that can reduce sowing expenses by up\nto 85% [149]. Not only is it cost-effective,\
    \ but it even expedites the planting because many\nnewly formed drones can plant\
    \ about 100,000 trees within one day [150]. These systems\nshoot pods comprise\
    \ seed, which are essential nutrients required for plant growth. This\ntechnique\
    \ is very effective for rough terrain; signiﬁcantly, the success rate is more\
    \ than\n75% [151]. Because of the ﬂexibility and success, the recommended drones\
    \ can be excellent\nplantation systems worldwide [152,153].\n6.3. Irrigation\n\
    The beneﬁt of using UAVs are twofold in irrigation applications. First, equipping\n\
    drones with various cameras and sensors can support the identiﬁcation of areas\
    \ under\nwater stress to quantify irrigation water requirements. Second, they\
    \ can also be utilized to\nspray herbicides and pesticides accurately and water\
    \ on crops, particularly in emergencies,\nwhich can save time [154–156]. Besides,\
    \ UAVs can also be utilized to assess crop water\nstress [157]. Because of advanced\
    \ UAVs, these can be applied as water-saving tools. UAVs\nuse not only facilitate\
    \ improving watering efﬁciency but also identify leaks in irrigation\nor possible\
    \ water sinks, such as “JT20L-606” [158] and “AGRASMG-1” [159], which are\nspecially\
    \ developed UAVs that are currently being utilized to serve this purpose.\n6.4.\
    \ Health Assessment of the Crops\nScanning agriculture crops using infrared and\
    \ visible (IR) light sensor technology\nmounted on the UAVs can recognize which\
    \ farming plants may be infested via fungicide\nor bacteria. Detecting any such\
    \ issues in advance helps prevent the disease from spreading\nto other crops or\
    \ plant parts [160].\n6.5. Spraying Pesticides/Herbicides\nUAVs can be utilized\
    \ to spray insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides on crops. Spray-\ning applications\
    \ will beneﬁt current practices of spraying pesticides or herbicides across\n\
    the entire farm that is usually not needed in most cases. If UAVs are used to\
    \ spray the\npesticides or herbicides, they can be directly sprayed on weeds or\
    \ only concentrate on the\ndisturbed area. It can be poured directly on weeds.\
    \ Besides, since UAV spraying is highly\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n18 of\
    \ 31\ntargeted to the objects/plants or weeds, it can be conﬁgured and sprayed\
    \ as required,\nreducing overall expenses. For UAVs, handling sudden environmental\
    \ changes, such as\nwind direction, is problematic, mainly when spraying applications\
    \ [160].\n6.6. Plant Species Detection/Identiﬁcation\nRecently, UAVs have begun\
    \ to identify plant species, particularly those that are\nvery few on the planet.\
    \ UAVs are the best tools for this task, as they can ﬂy in very\nremote places\
    \ with limited physical access. According to the National Tropical Botanical\n\
    Garden (NTBG), Hawaiian calyx Hibiscadelphus woodii was found on a vertical cliff\
    \ face\nusing a drone, which was believed to have become extinct in 2009 [161,162].\
    \ Precision\nfarming desperately requires spatial information on crop density\
    \ when making decisions\nduring several applications. Quantities and plant numbers\
    \ not only reﬂect crop yields,\nbut they can accurately assess outcomes and determine\
    \ the fate of a crop. Gnädinger and\nSchmidhalter [163] counted corn plants digitally\
    \ using drones. Additionally, Jin et al. [164]\nproposed a technique to use UAVs\
    \ to evaluate wheat plants’ density at the seedling phase\nand captured images\
    \ using a Sony ILCEα5100LRGB camera. Crop monitoring is a daunting\ntask and is\
    \ inefﬁcient due to the large coverage area. Compared with satellite images used\n\
    in the past, UAVs provide all farm results by providing real-time monitoring data,\
    \ so\nthey are further accurate and cost-effective. Microdrones’ + m accessory\
    \ kit offers aerial\nimaging capabilities to monitor moisture content, crop nutrients\
    \ status, and other essential\nfactors [165,166].\n7. Food Safety and Transportation\n\

    \ losses of food occurring along the food supply chain (from food \nproduction\
    \ to consumption) at different geographical regions worldwide are depicted in\
    \ \nFigure 5. The highest percentage of calories lost and wastage (61%) in food\

    \ \nIn addition to the WRI, the information released by the FAO of the UN is also\
    \ shock-\ning. It is projected that one-third of all food produced for humans\
    \ globally wasted each \nFigure 5. Losses of food occur along the food supply\
    \ chain [5,167].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n19 of 31\nIn addition to the\
    \ WRI, the information released by the FAO of the UN is also shocking.\nIt is\
    \ projected that one-third of all food produced for humans globally wasted each\
    \ year is\nworth USD 1 trillion [168,169]. Food waste in the US alone accounts\
    \ for 1.3% of its gross\ndomestic product [170]. Based on these numbers, it can\
    \ be assumed that food wastage is\ncritical in food industries, and such loss\
    \ does not exist in non-food industries [171]. Even\nthough food wastage worth\
    \ USD 1 trillion has its economic value, more signiﬁcantly, the\nimpact of these\
    \ losses on the environment is critical. For example, the water wasted on\nproducing\
    \ food that has never been consumed is the same as the water that can meet\nthe\
    \ water demand of all of Africa [167,172,173]. Today, all over the world, only\
    \ 10% of\nperishable foods are properly well-preserved [174]. There is a massive\
    \ opportunity to\nreduce food losses and better distribute food simply via realizing\
    \ temperature-regulated\ntransportation systems. Based on these facts, it can\
    \ be concluded that enhancing food\nproduction is not enough to attain food safety.\
    \ However, many useful actions are needed to\nobtain a better-skilled way of distributing\
    \ existing food effectively. As shown in Figure 5,\nthe IoT can monitor and maintain\
    \ food quality at all stages of the entire supply chain from\nyield to consumption.\n\
    7.1. Compliance\nThe IoT can support the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control\
    \ Point (HACCP) com-\npliance, provide food security, and is an excellent monitoring\
    \ program that continuously\naccumulates the temperature data in kitchen equipment\
    \ and coolers. Its integration with\nthe touch module is utilized to monitor the\
    \ temperature in the cooler and the preparation\nchamber continuously [175].\n\
    7.2. Laird Sentrius\nThe battery-powered remote integrated sensor system takes\
    \ full advantage of Blue-\ntooth Low Energy (BLE) and Low Power Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRaWAN) connectivity. It\nis based on Nordic nRF51 silicon, Semtech SX1272,\
    \ and offers an 868/915 MHz LoRaWAN\noption and provides high nRF51 performance\
    \ at precise humidity temperature. The two\nmost important families consist of\
    \ RG1xx and RS1xx (multi-wireless gateways) to operate\ncollectively to deliver\
    \ cloud-based services. It is highly signiﬁcant and needs cheap end-\npoint radios\
    \ and other complex base stations to handle the network system compared with\n\
    low-power wide-area network technology. If Sigfox network transmission is directed\
    \ from\nthe endpoint to the base station, communication will be better. Although\
    \ it helps to have\nbidirectional capabilities, the power from the station to\
    \ the endpoint is limited because it\ndelivers lower downlink width than the uplink\
    \ width.\n7.3. Tempreporter\nThe HACCP is utilized to monitor temperature 24/7.\

    21 of 31\n8. Current Challenges and Future Prospects\nIn 2015, the UN developed\
    \ strategies that help attain sustainable agricultural develop-\nment by 2030.\
    \ However, the latest statistical data issued by the WHO do not look favorable\n\
    for sustainability. This plan shows that more than 800 million people globally\
    \ face food\nshortages, which is one out of every nine people in the world [185].\
    \ To address these issues,\nthe overall grain production needs to be increased.\
    \ Additionally, cash crops need to be\nincreased to meet industrial requirements\
    \ such as rubber and cotton. Most signiﬁcantly,\nthe demand for bioenergy, such\
    \ as ethanol, will also increase by 2030.\nThis review outlines the main issues\
    \ that agriculture would face by 2050. This review\nessentially addresses two\
    \ main questions. How do the advanced technologies help to: (1)\nfeed about 10\
    \ billion people? and (2) increase agricultural production without occupying\n\
    more agricultural land? Moreover, these issues bring several challenges, such\
    \ as the\nreduction in agricultural manpower, the decreasing arable land area,\
    \ the shortage of water\nresources, the impact of climate change, etc. As the\
    \ world shifts towards urbanization,\nnot only is the population of rural areas\
    \ declining, but it is also rapidly aging. As a\nresult, young farmers are required\
    \ to step up to take liability. Population imbalances\nand generational transfers\
    \ will have a serious impact not only on the rural agricultural\nmanpower but\
    \ also on-farm management. Besides, while arable land is diminishing, many\nlands\
    \ are only appropriate for select crops due to certain geographical and environmental\n\
    constraints. Besides, climate change has begun to affect almost all crops. These\
    \ variations\nare anticipated to intensify many existing long-term ecological\
    \ difﬁculties, such as turf,\nﬂoods, soil degradation, groundwater depletion,\
    \ and more.\nCompared with developed nations, more than 50% of the populations\
    \ of developing\nnations are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture. Still,\
    \ they are far behind developed\ncountries in terms of quantity and quality. The\
    \ population of developed countries, which\nis less than 2%, is performing much\
    \ better. This difference is evident because Australia, the\nUS, and most European\
    \ countries have adopted improved tools and methods. Over the\npast ﬁfty years,\
    \ they have adopted improved instruments and techniques to increase crop\nproduction.\
    \ These differences demonstrate that advanced technology and sophisticated\napproaches\
    \ make the farm more productive and ecologically sound.\nIt is expected that the\
    \ future of agriculture will develop into a progressive sector\nwhen integrated\
    \ systems appreciate artiﬁcial intelligence and big data capabilities. These\n\
    integrated systems will combine several agricultural types of equipment, tools,\
    \ and tech-\nniques applicable for various agricultural management from sowing\
    \ to yield forecasting.\nAdvanced machines, such as robots of agriculture, cloud\
    \ computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nand big data, can usher in a different era\
    \ of super-convergence in the farming sector. Here\nare crucial tools and techniques\
    \ that need to be applied for sustainable agriculture in the\nfuture.\n8.1. Smartphone\
    \ and the IoT\nInformation communication technologies such as smartphones and\
    \ the IoT can change\nagriculture in developing countries by facilitating access\
    \ to markets and providing problem-\nsolving information. These technologies can\
    \ also bridge the rural–urban gap, including the\nnext generation of growers.\
    \ Most agricultural-related smartphone services in developing\ncountries have\
    \ provided simple functions due to the limitations of available delivery\ntechnologies\
    \ [79–81]. Fast-moving smartphones and the IoT may soon change by giving\nmany\
    \ opportunities for developing complex services. Today, users can use a wide variety\n\
    of devices to spread more complex information. Simultaneously, smartphones and\
    \ the\nIoT have become increasingly popular and interconnected through expanded\
    \ smartphone\nnetworks, allowing for the collection and processing of large amounts\
    \ of data to help\nagricultural farming and the establishment of social networks\
    \ for information exchange\nand learning.\nThis article discusses relevant knowledge\
    \ and implications, but further study is\nrequired to assess how the latest tools\
    \ and technologies can be practically used to support\nSustainability 2021, 13,\
    \ 4883\n22 of 31\nagriculture in developing nations. For example, what challenges\
    \ exist and what is needed\nto eliminate them? The smartphone and IoT technology\
    \ developers also need to ensure\nthat their services continue to meet a wide\
    \ range of user needs, rather than concentrating\ntoo much on new machinery that\
    \ may not be available to limited resource underserved\ngrowers.\n8.2. The IoT\
    \ and Wireless Sensors (IoTWS)\nInstalling IoTWS appropriately across farmland\
    \ can provide growers with the latest\nknowledge and information and enable them\
    \ to change accordingly, which helps enhance\ncrop yields. For sustainable agriculture,\
    \ the IoT can be core and forefront for farming\noperations. This comprises the\
    \ efﬁcient use of electricity, water, transportation of crops,\nalerts for the\
    \ maintenance and operation of agriculture machinery, and updated market\nprices.\
    \ It can simplify and streamline these tasks by identifying crop requirements\
    \ at each\nstep. It has proven to be advanced and will provide farmers with unprecedented\
    \ control\nover land and assets, thereby further changing our perceptions of various\
    \ agricultural\nactivities to maximize their efﬁciency and effectiveness. Besides,\
    \ the upcoming Internet\ntechnology can be formed by signiﬁcant improvements in\
    \ wireless sensor networks and 5th\ngeneration (5G) of smartphone communication\
    \ technology, providing growers important\nupdates in real-time and anywhere.\
    \ Based on recent successes, by 2021, it is assessed\nthat there will be more\
    \ than 75 million internet technology-based devices working in the\nagriculture\
    \ sector. Furthermore, the average farm is expected to produce 4.1 million data\n\
    points regularly by 2050 [186].\n8.3. Communication\nThe actual achievement of\
    \ the IoT in farming depends mostly on increased connectivity.\nFrom a telecommunications\
    \ perspective, connectivity and more value-added essential\nservices have a vast\
    \ perspective and can signiﬁcantly affect the whole chain [187]. Almost\nall telecommunication\
    \ operators worldwide provide connectivity facilities, but such public\nservices\
    \ represent only a small portion of the total advanced agriculture market. Given\
    \ its\nworth, especially in remote regions, smartphone operators must offer a\
    \ range of the latest\nservices to fulﬁll growers’ needs. Accepting the truth\
    \ that most people in the community\nare not highly educated, and, therefore,\
    \ they do not fully understand new technologies,\noperators must give end-to-end\
    \ resolutions, not only connectivity. Therefore, it will enhance\nthe market share\
    \ of smartphones and telecommunication operators. Peters [119,188]\nconsidered\
    \ 23 experiments mainly in developing countries and concluded that cellular\n\
    services and smartphone technology had brought a bright future to small farmers\
    \ capable\nof increasing yields. It is very important to give crucial connectivity\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector.\n8.4. Drones and Other Robots\nFarmers and growers\
    \ use UAVs to evaluate crop growth and monitor biodiversity\nand ecological landscape\
    \ features [189]. Additionally, considering the rugged farmland,\nparticularly\
    \ when the farmers have to grow crops on the rugged landscape, UAVs can\neffectively\
    \ be used for water spraying and other pesticides. Compared with traditional\n\
    machinery, with the same propose, robots and drones have conﬁrmed they are worth\n\
    spraying with haste and accuracy. With the latest improvements in swarm technology\
    \ and\ntask-based control, multiple sets of robots and drones armed with diverse\
    \ devices such as\n3D cameras can work together to give growers inclusive land\
    \ management capabilities.\nIn addition to drones, robotics in the agricultural\
    \ sector have increased productivity and\nbrought higher crop production. Robots,\
    \ for weeding and spraying, are decreasing the use\nof pesticides.\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4883\n23 of 31\n8.5. Machine Learning and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are utilized to mine data\
    \ for\ntrend analysis. For example, in agriculture, ML/AI is applied to explore\
    \ which genes\nare very appropriate to produce high-yield crops. This gives farmers\
    \ worldwide better\nvarieties of seeds that are suitable for the location and\
    \ climate. On the other hand, ML/AI\nalgorithms have demonstrated which goods\
    \ are in great demand and which goods are not\naccessible in the market. Thus,\
    \ for growers, this gives valuable information for upcoming\nfarming. The latest\
    \ advances in ML/AI will make it possible for growers to correctly\nclassify their\
    \ crop products and eliminate fewer advantageous products before they start\n\
    planting.\n8.6. Energy Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrid, and Smart Grid\n\
    Despite technological advances in agriculture, advanced farming still faces many\n\
    issues that hinder the extended use of the IoT. One of the notable issues regarding\
    \ en-\nergy/power consumption is that advanced agriculture needs extensive energy.\
    \ The major\nproblems for a large amount of energy consumption include the long-term\
    \ deployment\nof sensors, repeated transmission of sensing information by general\
    \ packet radio service,\nand GPS use. Traditionally, growers in rural areas have\
    \ randomly bought and used renew-\nable energy at high prices, which has largely\
    \ restricted their use for advanced agriculture.\nHowever, to resolve the energy\
    \ problem, in the long run, an in-depth analysis of the power\nsource (such as\
    \ remote information communication) can address the problem to some\nextent. In\
    \ addition, smart grids and microgrids enable the perfect integration of distributed\n\
    energy sources (DER), so they have attracted farmers’ adoption. The advent of\
    \ smart\nmeters has made farmers more conﬁdent in investing in DER, particularly\
    \ because farmers\ncan select full excess electricity to the grid. If a continuous\
    \ energy source is not available for\nusers in remote areas, alternative rechargeable\
    \ devices or thermal/electrical/mechanical\nenergy storage systems should be available\
    \ for them to use. Current advances in energy\nstorage apparatus, heating system,\
    \ and electricity will further make DER smarter to grow-\ners. They will be able\
    \ to store energy and use the heat created via heating and cooling when\nrequired\
    \ [190,191]. Moreover, requirements of healthy investment and public awareness\n\
    are two other obstacles to the success of these resolutions.\n8.7. Vertical Farming\
    \ and Hydroponics\nIn addition to adopting advanced technologies, new agricultural\
    \ practices are also crit-\nical to overcoming geographical and resource constraints.\
    \ While arable land is decreasing,\nit is assumed that 3 million people worldwide\
    \ have shifted to urban areas, putting more\nstress on existing limited city resources\
    \ [192]. Contemplating this quick migration, it is\nprojected that before 2030,\
    \ 60% of the world population will rely on urban areas, and these\nﬁgures are\
    \ expected to increase to 68% before 2050 [3,193]. Considering these two issues,\n\
    food production may be disastrous as soon as current agricultural practices are\
    \ concerned.\nVF solves these problems because it can meet the challenges of shortage\
    \ of water and land\nmanagement, and at the same time, it seems very appropriate\
    \ for adoption near urban\nareas or cities. At least in some parts of the world,\
    \ VF is depicted as the solution to food\nshortages and shrinking arable land.\
    \ Besides, hydroponics can play a very important role,\nas it greatly reduces\
    \ the need for space and water. The rapid growth of technologies has\npromoted\
    \ water and nutrient efﬁcient farming, such as VF, making it more attractive to\n\
    farmers. Alongside hydroponics and VF, the latest and improved solutions are needed\
    \ to\nboost the arable land without disturbing forests and natural animal habitats.\
    \ To accomplish\nthis, it is necessary to focus on the desert, because it covers\
    \ a third of the Earth’s land\nsurface. With Norwegian and Chinese companies/experts\
    \ working in the deserts of Dubai,\nQatar, Jordan, and China, solutions have begun\
    \ to be developed [194–196]. The existence\nof advanced technologies, such as\
    \ the IoT, is critical to achieving this target.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4883\n\
    24 of 31\n9. Conclusions\nDue to the continuous increase in the world population,\
    \ the demand for food in-\ncreases. Consequently, forests and arable lands are\
    \ changing into urban landscapes. In the\ncontext of shrinking arable land area,\
    \ highly efﬁcient and advanced technologies need to\nmeet a growing world population’s\
    \ food demands. At present, people can easily see the\ndevelopment of advanced\
    \ approaches to enhance crop yield and improve other agriculture\nmeasures. Some\
    \ people with a lack of innovative spirit and technology take agriculture\nas\
    \ a profession. Although they have partnerships and collaboration among suppliers,\n\
    farmers, retailers, and buyers, there is a gap between them for proper communication.\n\
    To ﬁll this gap, there is an urgent need for innovative and advanced technologies.\
    \ This\nreview covers multiple aspects of technology used in agriculture and enlightens\
    \ the key\nrole of advanced technologies, particularly the IoT, to advance agriculture\
    \ to meet future\nexpectations. Moreover, other advanced technologies, such as\
    \ UAVs, remote and ground\nsensors, communication technologies, and cloud computing,\
    \ are needed for sustainable\nagriculture. This review provides deeper insights\
    \ into the latest research ﬁndings. Based\non all of the above important information,\
    \ it is concluded that there is a dire need for crop\nproduction and improvement.\
    \ However, implementing these advanced and innovative\ntechnologies, such as the\
    \ IoT, are genuinely indeed not optional. By adopting these ad-\nvanced technologies,\
    \ farmers will improve their agricultural resources and practices. The\nadvancement\
    \ in such advanced technologies will pave the path for sustainable agriculture.\n\

    \ estimation of the soil water balance of the soil-plant-atmosphere system is\
    \ key to determining the \navailability of water resources and their optimal management.\
    \ Evapotranspiration and leaching are the main sinks of  \nwater from the system\
    \ affecting soil water status and hence crop yield. The accuracy of soil water\
    \ content and evapotran-\nspiration simulations affects crop yield simulations\
    \ as well. DSSAT is a suite of field‐scale, process‐based crop models \nto simulate\
    \ crop growth and development. A “tipping bucket” water balance approach is currently\
    \ used in DSSAT for \nsoil hydrologic and water redistribution processes. By comparison,\
    \ HYDRUS-1D is a hydrological model to simulate \nwater flow in soils using numerical\
    \ solutions of the Richards equation, but its approach to crop-related process\
    \ modeling \nis rather limited. Both DSSAT and HYDRUS-1D have been widely used\
    \ and tested in their separate areas of use. The \nobjectives of our study were:\
    \ (1) to couple HYDRUS-1D with DSSAT to simulate soil water dynamics, crop growth\
    \ and \nyield, (2) to evaluate the coupled model using field experimental datasets\
    \ distributed with DSSAT for different \nenvironments, and (3) to compare HYDRUS-1D\
    \ simulations with those of the tipping bucket approach using the same \ndatasets.\
    \ Modularity in the software design of both DSSAT and HYDRUS-1D made it easy to\
    \ couple the two models. \nThe pairing provided the DSSAT interface an ability\
    \ to use both the tipping bucket and HYDRUS-1D simulation  \napproaches. The two\
    \ approaches were evaluated in terms of their ability to estimate the soil water\
    \ balance, especially soil \nwater contents and evapotranspiration rates. Values\
    \ of the d index for volumetric water contents were 0.9 and 0.8 for the \noriginal\
    \ and coupled models, respectively. Comparisons of simulations for the pod mass\
    \ for four soybean and four pea-\nnut treatments showed relatively high d index\
    \ values for both models (0.94–0.99).  \n \nKeywords: System Modeling; Crop Growth;\
    \ Soil water; Unsaturated zone; DSSAT; HYDRUS-1D. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nAccurate\
    \ estimation of the soil water balance is important \nfor determining the availability\
    \ of water resources and their \noptimal management in agriculture, the major\
    \ consumer of \nwater. Process-based simulation models of complex systems \nsuch\
    \ as the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum are invaluable tools \nfor this purpose.\
    \ They may be used to simulate in detail multiple \nprocesses of the real system\
    \ to predict various state variables at \nevery time step during the simulations.\
    \ The processes of evapo-\ntranspiration and leaching are the main sinks of water\
    \ in the \nsoil-plant-atmosphere system affecting soil water status. Their \n\
    correct simulation is a prerequisite for successful simulations of \ncrop growth\
    \ and yield since the accuracy of soil water content \nand evapotranspiration\
    \ simulations affect the accuracy of simu-\nlated plant processes and crop yield.\
    \ Comparing model simula-\ntion results with field observations, or with results\
    \ of other \nmodels based on different conceptual approaches, may provide \ninvaluable\
    \ information on the performance of the model and \nreveal their strong and weak\
    \ parts. This is an essential step also \nwhen selecting appropriate models for\
    \ practical applications in \nwater resources analyses and for estimation of crop\
    \ yield com-\nponents. Comparing a physically-based soil-plant-atmosphere \nmodel\
    \ with a simpler model may provide information on how \nthe models perform compared\
    \ to each other. If a simpler model \ncan simulate the required processes with\
    \ sufficient accuracy, \nthat model should be an attractive alternative to a more\
    \ data-\nintensive, complex simulation model. Using a simple model \nmay also\
    \ minimize the need for a comprehensive data collec-\ntion effort (Ines at al.,\
    \ 2001; Pachepsky et al., 2006). \n \nCrop simulation models usually are based\
    \ on mathematical \nequations that describe the basic flow and conversion processes\
    \ \nof carbon, water, and nitrogen, and that are integrated hourly or \ndaily\
    \ to predict the time course of crop growth, nutrient uptake, \nand water use,\
    \ and to predict final yield and other plant traits \n(e.g., Boote et al., 2010).\
    \ The Cropping System Models (CSM) \nin the DSSAT software (Decision Support System\
    \ for Agro-\ntechnology Transfer) are particularly well suited for simulating\
    \ \nvarious agricultural practices (Jones et al., 2003). DSSAT (ver-\nsion 4.6)\
    \ integrates several crop system models, soil carbon and \nnitrogen models, a\
    \ daily water dynamic model, and a range of \ncrop/land management options to\
    \ simulate crop growth/yield \nand environmental impacts. DSSAT has been used\
    \ widely and \nsuccessfully for crop yield simulations under different \nmanagement\
    \ strategies, for optimizing the use of various \nresources, for yield trend simulations\
    \ under different soil and \nclimate scenarios, for crop yield risk analysis (Gijsman\
    \ et al., \n2002b; Sarkar, 2009), for simulating corn yield and nitrogen \ncycling\
    \ in a 50-year corn production experiment (Liu et al., \n2010), and for many other\
    \ applications. The software has also \nbeen applied to controlled tile drainage-subsurface\
    \ irrigation \nsystems (Liu et al., 2011). Hence, DSSAT is particularly useful\
    \ \nfor predicting the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of \nspecific land\
    \ management practices on crop yield, soil water \nstorage, and nitrate-N leaching\
    \ losses (Boote et al., 2010; \nGheysari et al., 2009; Mullen et al., 2009). \
    \ \nThe DSSAT Cropping System Model (CSM) (Jones et al., \n2003; Hoogenboom et\
    \ al., 2015) is a suite of field-scale, pro-\ncess-based crop models that have\
    \ the capacity to simulate both \ncrop and soil processes. They include the phenological\
    \ devel-\nCoupling DSSAT and HYDRUS-1D for simulations of soil water dynamics\
    \ in the soil-plant-atmosphere system \n233 \nopment of crops and detailed growth\
    \ components from emer-\ngence until harvest maturity on the basis of crop genetic\
    \ coeffi-\ncients, environmental (weather, soil) conditions, and manage-\nment\
    \ options. To simulate soil water flow and root water uptake \nin each individual\
    \ soil layer, DSSAT CSM uses a one-\ndimensional tipping bucket approach (Ritchie,\
    \ 1998) that con-\nsiders the soil profile to consist of a number of soil layers\
    \ that \nare all homogeneous horizontally. The soil water balance model \ncurrently\
    \ uses a tipping bucket approach for simulating soil \nhydrologic cycle and water\
    \ redistribution for all crop models in \nCSM. The time step for the soil water\
    \ balance and evapotran-\nspiration (ET) calculations is daily, which matches\
    \ the timing of \nweather data inputs and daily plant dry matter growth (Ritchie,\
    \ \n1998). Boote et al. (2008) concluded that the tipping bucket soil \nwater\
    \ balance model in DSSAT generally works satisfactorily \nwhen the soil water-holding\
    \ properties (a drained upper limit, \nDUL, and a lower limit of plant-extractable\
    \ soil water, LL) are \nestimated properly, and when the rooting depth and root\
    \ length \ndistribution are predicted adequately. Nevertheless, the ap-\nproach\
    \ is inherently more approximate than the soil water flow \ncalculations used\
    \ in many hydrological models such as HY-\nDRUS-1D, which can estimate soil moisture\
    \ distribution in the \nsoil profile with higher accuracy (Scanlon et al., 2002).\
    \ \nHYDRUS-1D (Šimůnek et al., 2008; 2016) is a widely used \nhydrological model\
    \ that simulates water flow in one-\ndimensional variably-saturated soils using\
    \ numerical solutions \nof the Richards equation. The water flow equation incorporates\
    \ \na sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots. Root \nwater uptake\
    \ and transpiration are calculated using the formula-\ntion of Feddes et al. (1978).\
    \ Evapotranspiration can be calculat-\ned using the Penman-Monteith equation.\
    \ As compared to \nDSSAT, calculations in HYDRUS-1D are more physically \nbased\
    \ by allowing flow to be driven by pressure head differ-\nences, thus allowing\
    \ for capillary flow and hence both upward \nor downward flow in the soil profile.\
    \ The runoff calculations in \nHYDRUS-1D are also less empirical than in DSSAT.\
    \ While \nDSSAT uses the modified curve number method of the United \nStates Department\
    \ of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service \n(USDA-SCS) (Williams, 1991), HYDRUS-1D\
    \ determines \nrunoff as infiltration-excess water that is obtained by the nu-\n\
    merical solution of the Richards equation for specified precipi-\ntation rates\
    \ and soil hydraulic properties. \nHYDRUS-1D has been used widely in many industrial\
    \ and \nenvironmental applications, as well as for addressing many \nagricultural\
    \ problems (Šimůnek et al., 2016). Examples of \nexisting agricultural applications\
    \ include irrigation management \n(Bristow et al., 2002; Dabach et al., 2015),\
    \ drip and sprinkler \nirrigation design (Bristow et al., 2002; Gärdenäs et al.,\
    \ 2005; \nHanson et al., 2008; Kandelous et al., 2012), studies of root \nwater\
    \ and nutrient uptake (Šimůnek and Hopmans, 2009; Vrugt \net al., 2001a,b), among\
    \ many others. \nBoth DSSAT and HYDRUS-1D have been used widely and \ntested separately,\
    \ as well as coupled with other models. Several \ncrop models describing relevant\
    \ crop growth processes have \nbeen integrated successfully with hydrological\
    \ models, such as \nDSSAT-RZWQM (Ma et al., 2006), DSSAT-SWAP (Dokoo-\nhaki et\
    \ al., 2016), SWAT-MODFLOW (Sophocleous et al., \n1999), and WOFOST-SWAP (van\
    \ Walsum, 2011). Similarly, \nHYDRUS have been coupled successfully with existing\
    \ crop \nand root growth models (e.g., Groenendyk et. al., 2012; Han et \nal.,\
    \ 2015; Hartmann et al., 2017; Li et al., 2014; Peña-Haro et \nal., 2012; Wang\
    \ et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2012). For example, \nPeña-Haro et al. (2012) integrated\
    \ WOFOST, a crop growth \nand production model, with HYDRUS-1D as well as with\
    \ \nMODFLOW-2000 (Harbaugh et al., 2000), the latter being a \nsaturated flow\
    \ model. The coupling was done using a combina-\ntion of two different approaches:\
    \ external coupling (through \ninput/output data manipulation) and by using code\
    \ wrapping. \nPeña-Haro et al. (2012) used OMS3 for wrapping WOFOST \nand PYTHON\
    \ to write scripts. Groenendyk et al. (2012) cou-\npled HYDRUS-1D with a generic\
    \ crop growth model based on \nthe plant growth module used in the WEPP model\
    \ and then \nused the Ensemble Kalman Filter for assimilation of soil water \n\
    content observations into the hydrologic model. The coupled \napproach was then\
    \ tested for an irrigated wheat cropping exper-\niment conducted at Maricopa,\
    \ Arizona. Similarly, Hydrus-1D \nwas coupled with MODFLOW-2000 for simulating\
    \ hydrologi-\ncal processes at the large scale (Seo et al., 2007; Twarakavi et\
    \ \nal., 2008). \nThe main objectives of this study were: a) to implement the\
    \ \nflow routines from HYDRUS-1D into the DSSAT CSM crop \nmodels as a new option\
    \ for simulating soil water dynamics, b) \nto evaluate the coupled model using\
    \ field experimental datasets \ndistributed with DSSAT for different environments,\
    \ and c) to \ncompare the performance of the HYDRUS-1D approach with \nthe tipping\
    \ bucket approach in DSSAT CSM using the same \nmeasured datasets. By integrating\
    \ DSSAT with HYDRUS-1D, \ncrop production simulations of DSSAT can be improved\
    \ by \nusing more accurate calculations of actual evaporation, transpi-\nration,\
    \ root water uptake, drainage, and water distributions in \nthe soil profile using\
    \ the Richards equation. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nDSSAT CSM \n \nThe Cropping\
    \ System Model (CSM) within DSSAT V4.6 \n(Hoogenboom et al., 2015; Jones et al.,\
    \ 2003) contains various \ncrop models that are executed under the DSSAT shell.\
    \ The crop \nmodels available are the CERES models for cereals (barley, \nmaize,\
    \ sorghum, millet, rice, and wheat), the CROPGRO \nmodels for legumes (dry bean,\
    \ soybean, peanut, and chickpea), \nand additional models for root crops (cassava,\
    \ potato) and other \ncrops (sugarcane, tomato, sunflower, and pasture). The \n\
    architecture differs from one model to another. Various controls \nand management\
    \ scenarios can be invoked within the shell to \nsimulate crop growth. The crop\
    \ models can simulate single \ncropping, seasonal and sequential cropping systems.\
    \ \nThe soil water balance in DSSAT is based on a formulation \nby Ritchie (1972,\
    \ 1981a,b) using the concept of a drained upper \nlimit (DUL) and drained lower\
    \ limit (LL) for available soil \nwater. The approach applies a simple water accounting\
    \ \nprocedure to each layer in the soil profile (Porter et al., 2004; \nRitchie,\
    \ 1985; 1998). Water from an upper layer cascades to \nlower layers, thereby mimicking\
    \ the process of a series of linear \nreservoirs. Infiltration is calculated as\
    \ the difference between \nrainfall/irrigation and runoff. Drainage between layers\
    \ takes \nplace if soil water present in the layer exceeds its water holding \n\
    capacity. Drainage at the bottom of the soil profile is equal to \nthe drainage\
    \ flux from the bottom layer. Upward flow can be \ncaused by root water uptake\
    \ due to transpiration and by soil \nevaporation. Potential root water extraction\
    \ depends on \navailable soil water and the root length density of each layer\
    \ in \nthe soil. Actual transpiration is calculated using reduction \nfactors\
    \ as a function of the leaf area index and an energy \nextinction coefficient.\
    \ Infiltration and runoff from rainfall or \nirrigation water are calculated using\
    \ the USDA Soil \nConservation Service runoff curve number method (Williams, \n\
    1991). The profile is assumed to be well drained and without \nany interaction\
    \ with groundwater. Ritchie (1998) recommended \nthe use of more appropriate modeling\
    \ approaches for poorly \nVakhtang Shelia, Jirka Šimůnek, Ken Boote, Gerrit Hoogenbooom\
    \  \n234 \ndrained conditions where the oxygen stress may affect crop \ngrowth.\
    \ \nSoil water balance processes include infiltration of rainfall \nand irrigation,\
    \ runoff, soil evaporation, crop transpiration, root \nwater uptake from the various\
    \ soil layers, and drainage of water \nfrom the soil profile below the root zone\
    \ (Boote et al., 2008). \nThe soil is divided into a number of computational layers,\
    \ up to \na maximum of 20. The water content of each layer varies \nbetween the\
    \ lower limit of plant extractable soil water [LL(j)], \nthe drained upper limit\
    \ [DUL(j)], and the saturated soil water \ncontent [SAT(j)], where j is a soil\
    \ layer number. If the water \ncontent of a given layer is above DUL, water will\
    \ drain to the \nnext layer based on the tipping bucket approach, using a \nprofile-wide\
    \ drainage coefficient (SWCON). If available, the \nsaturated hydraulic conductivity\
    \ (Ks) of each soil layer can be \nentered to control vertical drainage from one\
    \ layer to the next. \nThis feature allows the soil to retain water above DUL\
    \ in layers \nthat have a sufficiently low Ks, and which case soil layers may\
    \ \nremain saturated long enough to cause root damage, reduced \nroot water uptake,\
    \ anoxia-induced stress, and lower N fixation. \nWater between SAT and DUL is\
    \ available for root water uptake, \nsubject to the anoxia-induced restriction\
    \ that is triggered when \nthe air-filled pore space falls below 2% of porosity\
    \ (this value \ncan be species-dependent). The DSSAT V4.6 software includes \n\
    pedotransfer functions that compute LL, DUL, and SAT from \nsand, silt, clay,\
    \ soil organic carbon content, and bulk density. \nThe pedotransfer functions\
    \ are mostly those by Saxton et al. \n(1986) as described by Gijsman et al. (2002a).\
    \ \nThe default option for computing potential evapotranspira-\ntion (PET, equivalent\
    \ to ETO) is the Priestley-Taylor method \n(Priestley and Taylor, 1972; Ritchie,\
    \ 1985), primarily because it \nis less demanding for weather data and does not\
    \ require daily \nwind speed or dewpoint temperature data as inputs. The FAO-\n\
    56 Penman-Monteith method is available if wind speed and \ndewpoint temperature\
    \ are provided. The DSSAT crop models \npartition PET into potential plant transpiration\
    \ (EPO) and \npotential soil evaporation (ESO) following Ritchie's (1972, \n1985)\
    \ approach, which considers the portion of net radiation \nthat reaches the soil\
    \ surface and can be used as latent energy to \nevaporate water from the soil\
    \ surface if the soil is wet.  \nActual soil evaporation (ES) and plant transpiration\
    \ (EP) de-\npend on the availability of water to meet potential rates. The \n\
    current DSSAT CSM models allow calculations of ES using \ntwo soil evaporation\
    \ methods: Suleiman-Ritchie (Ritchie et al., \n2009) and the two-stage soil evaporation\
    \ method of Ritchie \n(1985). The first approach is based on an equation derived\
    \ from \ndiffusion theory by Suleiman and Ritchie (Suleiman and Ritch-\nie, 2003).\
    \ The method is currently the default option for ES \ncomputations in DSSAT CSM.\
    \ The two-stage soil evaporation \nmethod computes ES by assuming a constant rate\
    \ during the \nenergy-limited stage (Stage 1) and a falling-rate stage (Stage\
    \ 2) \nthat begins after the first stage loss has been met, during which \nES\
    \ declines with the square root of time. Since neither the \nSuleiman-Ritchie\
    \ method nor the two-stage soil evaporation \nmethod are considered to particularly\
    \ accurate, improvements \nare still being considered. \nRoot water uptake must\
    \ be computed before actual canopy \ntranspiration (EP) is computed. Potential\
    \ root water uptake, \nRWU(j), from each soil layer is a function of the root\
    \ length \ndensity (RLD) and the soil water content of that layer, and is \ncalculated\
    \ using a simplified approximation of radial flow to \nroots (Ritchie, 1985).\
    \ The total soil water content (SWTD) and \nthe total extractable water content\
    \ (SWXD) in the soil profile, \namong other variables, are calculated in the soil\
    \ water balance \nmodule. SWTD is equal to the water contents summed over all\
    \ \nsoil layers, i.e., SWTD = ΣSW(j)×DLAYR(j), where SW(j) is the \nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the jth layer and DLAYR(j) is the \nthickness of the jth layer.\
    \ SWXD is similarly equal to the ex-\ntractable water contents summed over all\
    \ soil layers, i.e.,  \nSWXD = Σ(SW(j)–LL(j))×DLAYR(j). \n \nHYDRUS-1D \n \nHYDRUS-1D\
    \ is a physically-based, detailed hydrological \nmodel that simulates the relationships\
    \ between soil, water, and \nweather, while using a sink term to account for water\
    \ uptake by \nplant roots. The core of the model is the Richards one-\ndimensional\
    \ equation, which combines the Darcy-Buckingham \nlaw for the fluid flux with\
    \ the continuity equation as follows: \n \n( )\n( )\nh\nK h\nK h\nS\nt\nz\nz\n\
    ∂θ\n∂\n∂\n\n\n=\n−\n−\n\n\n∂\n∂\n∂\n\n\n \n(1) \n \nwhere θ is the volumetric\
    \ water content [L3L–3], h is the pres-\nsure head [L], K is the unsaturated hydraulic\
    \ conductivity  \n[LT–1], z is the vertical coordinate positive upward [L], t\
    \ is time \n[T], and S is root water uptake [T–1]. \nHYDRUS-1D simulates soil\
    \ water movement by consider-\ning spatial differences in the soil water potential\
    \ in the soil \nprofile. The governing equation is solved numerically using an\
    \ \nimplicit finite element scheme, which can be applied to both \nsaturated and\
    \ unsaturated conditions. The soil hydraulic func-\ntions are described using\
    \ the analytical functions of van \nGenuchten-Mualem (Mualem, 1976; van Genuchten,\
    \ 1980), \namong other formulations. HYDRUS-1D also considers, as \nneeded, the\
    \ effects of heat on water flow and the fate and \ntransport of solutes in soils.\
    \ Numerical solutions are provided \nfor both flux or pressure head controlled\
    \ boundary conditions at \nthe top and bottom boundaries. The Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation \ncan be used to estimate potential evapotranspiration, ETp. The \n\
    HYDRUS-1D model uses the leaf area index (LAI) or the soil \ncover fraction (SC)\
    \ to separate potential evapotranspiration \n(ETp) into potential plant transpiration\
    \ (Tp) and potential evapo-\nration (Ep) of a partially covered soil. Reductions\
    \ in Tp and Ep \nare calculated using a physically-based approach. Reductions\
    \ in \nTp are obtained by using the Feddes et al. (1978) approach \ninvolving\
    \ stress response functions, which depend on the type \nof crop. Reductions in\
    \ Ep are obtained directly from the numer-\nical solution of the Richards equation\
    \ by switching from a flux \nto a pressure head boundary condition when some limiting\
    \ \nminimum pressure head is reached (e.g., –150 m). The effects \nof salinity\
    \ and water/oxygen stress on actual transpiration can \nbe considered to be either\
    \ additive or multiplicative. Surface \nrunoff is evaluated as infiltration-excess\
    \ water calculated using \nthe Richards equation for specified precipitation rates\
    \ and soil \nhydraulic properties. Alternatively, infiltration-excess water can\
    \ \naccumulate on the soil surface until a specified limit is reached, \nafter\
    \ which surface runoff is initiated. Field drainage to tile \ndrains can be simulated\
    \ using the Hooghoudt or Ernst equations \nfor homogeneous and heterogeneous soil\
    \ profiles, respectively. \nThe bottom flux is calculated according to the selected\
    \ bottom \nboundary conditions. Several water management scenarios can \nbe modeled\
    \ with HYDRUS-1D. For example, irrigation sched-\nuling can be considered at fixed\
    \ times or using a number of \ncriteria that can trigger irrigation, such as its\
    \ timing and depth \nof application. \n \n \n \nCoupling DSSAT and HYDRUS-1D for\
    \ simulations of soil water dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system \n235\
    \ \nCoupling the two models \n \nAccurate simulations of crop growth require proper\
    \ integra-\ntion of models for crop growth and water flow in the unsaturat-\n\
    ed zone. There are at least three different approaches for inte-\ngrating independent\
    \ external programs (Peña-Haro et al., 2012): \n1) One could modify the original\
    \ source code of the two \nmodels in order to have the coupled model within the\
    \ same \nexecutable file. \n2) The models could interact through their input/output\
    \ files. \nHowever, if the variables of interest are not included in the \ndefault\
    \ input or output files, this approach requires modifica-\ntions to the original\
    \ source codes of the two models.  \n3) The original code can be wrapped using\
    \ a specialized \nsoftware such as OMS3 (David et al., 2002), OpenMI \n(Gregersen,\
    \ 2007), or PYTHON (www.python.org). This ap-\nproach allows one to have access\
    \ to all variables stored in a \nmemory that is common to all programs. \nIn order\
    \ to implement the HYDRUS-1D water flow routines \ninto DSSAT, the routines were\
    \ simplified first by removing the \nsource code related to other processes, such\
    \ as vapor flow and \nsolute transport. After some reorganization, the remaining\
    \ \nsource code was then included directly into DSSAT CSM (both \nmodels are written\
    \ in the Fortran language) to obtain one single \nexecutable program. The modular\
    \ structure of DSSAT CSM \n(Jones et al., 2003) requires that all rate processes\
    \ are calculated \neach day based on the state variables from the previous day,\
    \ \nusing a daily time step. Corresponding changes were imple-\nmented to inputs/outputs\
    \ from HYDRUS-1D to DSSAT. Some \nvariables had to be passed between the main\
    \ program and the \nnew subsystem. These data types were defined inside a new\
    \ \nmodule and passed between the models.  \nData transfer between the models\
    \ can be summarized as fol-\nlows (Fig. 1): DSSAT CSM calculates crop growth by\
    \ taking as \ninput the crop parameters and weather data. Among the output \n\
    that DSSAT CSM generates, the following parameters were \ntransferred to HYDRUS-1D\
    \ as input: rooting depth, potential \ntranspiration and evaporation, and irrigation\
    \ and precipitation. \nAlthough DSSAT calculates root length distributions also,\
    \ the \ncurrent version of the coupled model assumes the HYDRUS-\n1D approach\
    \ in which the root distribution decreases linearly \nwith depth from the soil\
    \ surface to the bottom of the root zone. \nHYDRUS-1D then calculates soil water\
    \ contents and actual \ntranspiration and evaporation rates, integrated to a daily\
    \ basis \nusing the variable time-steps of HYDRUS-1D, which are then \nsent back\
    \ to DSSAT CSM. Temporal and spatial discretizations \nare different in the two\
    \ models and thus had to be synchronized. \nWhile HYDRUS-1D uses variable time\
    \ steps and water stress \nperiods are used, the structure of DSSAT CSM allows\
    \ only \ndaily time steps. Consequently, the two models exchange in-\nformation\
    \ on a daily time interval, while HYDRUS-1D carried \nout multiple time steps\
    \ during this interval. Similarly as for the \ntemporal discretization, HYDRUS-1D\
    \ usually uses a much \nfiner spatial discretization than DSSAT CSM. HYDRUS-1D\
    \ \noutputs thus had to be averaged over multiple nodes, before \ninformation\
    \ could be entered into DSSAT CSM. \nThe coupled DSSAT-HYDRUS-1D model is now\
    \ able to \nsimulate water flow using both the original tipping bucket \napproach\
    \ as well as the HYDRUS-1D based numerical solution \nof the Richards equation.\
    \ While HYDRUS-1D still focuses \nmostly on soil water, the Cropping System Model\
    \ (CSM) from \nDSSAT deals nearly exclusively with plant related processes. \n\

    \ with DSSAT V4.6 (Hoogenboom et al., 2015) for soy-\nbean and peanut to evaluate\
    \ the coupled model. The field  \nexperiments were conducted between 1978 and\
    \ 1990 by the \nUniversity of Florida (UF), Gainesville, Florida, and Iowa State\
    \ \nUniversity (ISU), Ames, Iowa. The experimental field at UF \nwas located at\
    \ the campus far, with soil being characterized as a \nMillhopper fine sand soil\
    \ (loamy, siliceous, hyperthemic \nGrossarenic Paleudults). The soil profiles\
    \ in the DSSAT soil \ndataset (the SOIL.SOL file) are identified as IBSB910015\
    \ and \nIBPN910015 for the soybean and peanut experiments, respec-\ntively. Table\
    \ 1 shows the soil physical and hydraulic properties \nof nine layers of the soil\
    \ profile. These data are needed along \nwith other soil properties such as soil\
    \ albedo (SALB, fraction), \nthe evaporation limit (SLU1, mm), the drainage rate\
    \ (SLDR, \nfraction day–1), and the runoff curve number (SLRO) to simu-\nlate\
    \ soil water dynamics in DSSAT. The drainage rate, SLDR, \nrepresents the fraction\
    \ of water between the actual water con-\ntent and the drained upper limit that\
    \ drains from a soil layer in \none day. For the given soil, these values were\
    \ SALB = 0.18, \nSLU1 = 5.0 mm, SLDR = 0.5 day–1, and SLRO = 66. \nBased on the\
    \ particle size distribution and soil bulk density \ndata in Table 1, two soil\
    \ layers 0–15 cm and 15–180 cm were \ndistinguished for the experimental field\
    \ at UF, Gainesville, \nconsisting of sand and loamy sand, respectively. Parameters\
    \ for \nthe van Genuchten-Mualem soil water retention functions (van \nGenuchten,\
    \ 1980) for these two soil textures were taken from \nthe HYDRUS-1D soil catalog\
    \ and then used in the DSSAT-\nHYDRUS-1D coupled model (Table 2). \nThe soil of\
    \ the second experimental field at ISU was \ncharacterized as Nicollet clay loam\
    \ (fine-loamy, mixed, Mesic \nAquic). This soil profile in the DSSAT soil dataset\
    \ was identified \nas IBSB910049. Since the IBSB910049 soil profile contains only\
    \ \ndata necessary to run DSSAT, while lacking data on soil texture \nand the\
    \ saturated hydraulic conductivity, we assumed that the \nentire soil profile\
    \ was homogeneous and used the HYDRUS-1D \ndefault parameters for a clay loam\
    \ soil (Table 2). \nThe soybean varieties “BRAGG” and “Williams-82” were \nused\
    \ in the field experiments at UF and ISU, respectively. Their  \n \ndefault cultivar\
    \ coefficients are given in the soybean cultivar \nfile SBGRO046.CUL in DSSAT.\
    \ The cultivar coefficients for \nBRAGG are shown in Table 3. The peanut experiments\
    \ were \ncarried out using the variety “Florunner”. Its cultivar-specific \nparameters\
    \ as used in the DSSAT CSM and coupled DSSAT-\nHYDRUS-1D simulations are also\
    \ listed in Table 3. Several \nparameters of the soybean and peanut varieties\
    \ had been cali-\nbrated earlier for the DSSAT CSM simulations. Specifically,\
    \ \nthe BRAGG and Florunner cultivar coefficients were taken \nfrom the standard\
    \ DSSAT V4.6 release, as previously calibrat-\ned for DSSAT V4.6 based on a full\
    \ set of 7 and 18 treatments, \nrespectively. The peanut variety Florunner was\
    \ calibrated for \nthe coupled DSSAT-HYDRUS-1D model using data from the \nfield\
    \ experiment conducted at UF in 1989. Modified values of \nseveral cultivar coefficients\
    \ of this variety for the coupled model \nare given in Table 3, together with\
    \ those used for DSSAT CSM. \nThe datasets, distributed with DSSAT V4.6 and used\
    \ for \nevaluation of the coupled model, were from a) soybean \nexperiments UFGA7801\
    \ (1978, treatment 1, irrigated, 206 mm \nin 21 applications, and treatment 2,\

    \ 1991), \nthe index of agreement (d) (Willmott et al., 1985), the Model \nEfficiency\
    \ (EF) (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), and the Mean Error \n(E). \nThe RMSE was computed\

    \ of \nRMSE indicate a good fit between the simulated and observed \nvalues. Since\
    \ EF has no unit, this criterion can be used to com-\npare the accuracy of model\
    \ outputs for different variables. Its \nvalue can range from −∞ to 1. The closer\
    \ the model efficiency \nis to 1, the more accurate the model, with EF = 1 corresponding\
    \ \nto a perfect match between simulated values and observed data. \nA value of\
    \ zero for the efficiency E indicates that the predic-\ntions are as accurate\
    \ as the mean of the observed data, whereas \nan efficiency less than zero suggests\
    \ that the observed mean is a \nbetter predictor than the model. E is an indicator\
    \ of whether the \nmodel predictions tend to underestimate (if negative) or overes-\n\
    timate (if positive) the measured data. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe two\
    \ approaches for soil water modeling in DSSAT were \nevaluated based on their\
    \ ability to accurately estimate the soil \nwater balance, the soil water content\
    \ by soil layer, potential and \nactual evapotranspiration rates and, subsequently,\
    \ crop growth, \nwhich was characterized using both total and individual organ\
    \ \nbiomass accumulation.  \n \n \n \n \nVakhtang Shelia, Jirka Šimůnek, Ken Boote,\
    \ Gerrit Hoogenbooom  \n238 \nSoil water balance \n \nSince coupling added new\
    \ functionality to the soil water \nsimulations in DSSAT, the performance of the\
    \ original and \ncoupled models was evaluated first in terms of their ability\
    \ to \npredict soil water contents (total and extractable) in the entire \nsoil\
    \ profile and particular soil layers during the crop growing \nseason. Both irrigated\
    \ or rainfed treatments were considered in \nthe analysis. \nFor the UFGA7801\
    \ soybean experiment, the initial total wa-\nter content in the soil profile 180\
    \ cm deep was 214 mm (equiva-\nlent to field Capacity in DSSAT-CSM) for both treatments\
    \ \n(treatment 1 was irrigated and treatment 2 was rainfed). Simula-\ntions with\
    \ both models showed a similar tendency of describing \nthe dynamics of the total\
    \ soil water content (SWTD) (Fig. 2a,b). \nSimilar simulated trends can also be\
    \ seen for extractable \namount of soil water (SWXD) (Fig. 2c,d). The extractable\
    \ soil \nwater as obtained with the coupled model was in general higher \nthan\
    \ when simulated with the original model. For example, one \ncan see that the\
    \ SWXDs simulated using both models were \nhigher than those measured in treatment\
    \ 2 of the 1978 soybean \nexperiment (Fig. 2d). Values of the d index were 0.95\
    \ and 0.90 \nand those of RMSE were 26.5 mm and 41.3 mm for the original \nand\
    \ coupled models, respectively. \nThe soybean experiments at Ames, Iowa in 1988\
    \ and 1990 \nincluded data about the Williams-82 soybean variety grown \nunder\
    \ rainfed conditions. The 1988 season showed a major \ndrought, which allowed\
    \ us to contrast its results with the cool \nand rainy season of 1990. Soil water\
    \ contents during the 1988 \nexperiment were measured with a neutron probe. Initial\
    \ condi-\ntions and water content distributions with depth were different \nin\
    \ the 202-cm deep soil profile for these soybean experiments. \nFor treatment\
    \ 1 of the IUAM8801 experiment and treatment 1 \nof the IUAM9001 experiment, the\
    \ total water contents (SWTD) \nwere 628 mm and 574 mm, respectively, with water\
    \ contents in \ndifferent layers being close to the drained upper limit.  \nSimulations\
    \ by both models showed a similar tendency of \ndescribing soil water content\
    \ dynamics for the Iowa experi-\nments (Fig. 3). On 103 DAP (days after planting)\
    \ of the 1988  \n \ngrowing season, a large 142-mm rainfall event occurred (Fig.\
    \ \n3a). The original and coupled models reacted from this by \nincreasing the\
    \ total water content by 80 mm and 136 mm, re-\nspectively (Fig. 3a). While the\
    \ tipping bucket approach limited \ninfiltration as determined by the SCS curve\
    \ number, the water \ncontent of the near-surface soil layer, and the total soil\
    \ drainage \ncoefficient (SWCON) (see Table 2), the HYDRUS-1D ap-\nproach, which\
    \ considers not only gravity but also capillarity, \nallowed larger infiltration.\
    \ Both modeling approaches produced \nsimilar results for the cool and rainy season\
    \ of 1990, while the \ncoupled model slightly overpredicted water contents during\
    \ \nmost of the season (Fig. 3b,d). \nComparisons between volumetric water contents\
    \ measured \nin the different layers during the 1988 soybean experiment and \n\
    simulated using the DSSAT CSM and the DSSAT-HYDRUS-\n1D models are illustrated\
    \ in Fig. 4. In most cases, the d index \nwas approximately 0.9 for the original\
    \ model and 0.8 for the \ncoupled model. The RMSE values for the original and\
    \ coupled \nmodels were 0.08 and 0.05, respectively. The coupled model \nsimulated\
    \ more soil water depletion in the deeper layers during \nthe early part of the\
    \ season. The two modeling approaches \nagain showed different responses to a\
    \ large rainfall amount \n(142 mm) on 103 DAP. The original model failed to re-saturate\
    \ \nthe soil profile because of excessively high runoff caused by \nincorrect\
    \ application of the SCS runoff number to a cracking \nclay soil, while the coupled\
    \ model simulated a much large \nincrease in the total water content on day 103\
    \ due to better \nsimulations of infiltration. \nThe initial total water content\
    \ (214 mm) of the 180-cm deep \nsoil profile, and the water contents at depths\
    \ of 5, 15, 30, 45, \n60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 cm, were the same in all three\
    \ peanut \n(UFGA8401, UFGA8601, and UFGA8701) experiments at \nGainesville, FL\
    \ when the simulations started on 19, 5, and 2 \ndays before planting, respectively.\
    \ The coupled model showed \nlower water contents at the beginning of all simulations\
    \ through \nabout 40–50 days after planting (DAP) in both treatments of the \n\
    UFGA8401 experiment (Fig. 5a,b). This was expected for \nsandy soils that have\
    \ very low water retention properties.  \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Total water contents\

    \ models. The coupled model showed less varia-\ntions in its predictions, although\
    \ the trend was similar compared \nto the original model (Figs. 6c,d and 7c,d).\
    \ For both  \nUFGA7801 soybean treatments during full canopy, evapotran-\nspiration\
    \ values varied between 2.5–5 mm/day and 3–7 mm/day \nfor the coupled and the\
    \ original models, respectively. \nThe coupled and original models produced comparable\
    \ val-\nues for the evapotranspiration rate at the beginning of the grow-\ning\
    \ season (about 3 mm and 3.5 mm, respectively) and at the \nend of the season\
    \ (1.5–2.5 mm and 1–3 mm, respectively), for \nirrigated treatment 1 (Fig. 6c).\
    \ Differences were more signifi-\ncant in the case of the treatment 2 (rainfed):\
    \ about 2.5 mm and \n0.5–1 mm at the beginning of the season and 1–2 mm and  \n\
    0.5–1 mm at the end of the season for the coupled and original \nmodels, respectively\
    \ (Fig. 6d). However, the seasonal patterns \nof the coupled model differed from\
    \ the original CSM. The \ncoupled model had higher evapotranspiration (ETAA) rates\
    \ \nduring the early season when LAI values were still low, but \nlower ETAA rates\
    \ in mid-season with its higher LAI values. \nDSSAT CSM results showed differences\

    \ period \nof 98–114 DAP, while the coupled model simulated more \nevapotranspiration\
    \ for irrigated treatment 1 until 115 DAP.  \nFig. 7 shows results obtained with\
    \ the two modeling \napproaches for the time interval of 25–115 DAP out of 0–143\
    \ \nDAP when differences were found between the irrigated and \nrainfed treatments.\
    \ Similarly as for the soybean example, the \ncoupled model tended to produce\
    \ lower values than the CSM \napproach during much of the season. \n \nCrop growth\
    \ simulations \n \nThe comparison between simulated and observed yield com-\n\
    ponents during the growing season indicated the different per- \n \nformance of\
    \ the DSSAT-HYDRUS-1D and original CSM mod-\nels. Of the three soybean experiments,\
    \ the coupled model per-\nformed worst for treatment 2 of the UFGA7801 experiment,\
    \ \nwhich showed a very low value of the d index (0.47) for pod \nmass, compared\
    \ to 0.91 for the original model (Table 4). \nThe EF values were negative for\
    \ this treatment as well. The \noriginal and coupled models performed well for\
    \ treatment 1, \nproducing relatively high values (0.99) of the d index for pod\
    \ \nand stem mass, and with slightly better d index values for the \noriginal\
    \ model for crop mass and LAI (0.99 and 0.95, \nrespectively) than the coupled\
    \ model (0.98 and 0.95, \nrespectively). The coupled model performed better for\
    \ the \nIUAM9001 experiment (Table 4, Fig. 8d,f) in terms of all \nstatistical\

    \ (c,d) and pod mass (e,f) for the Florunner peanut experiments at Gainesville,\
    \ FL in \n1984, 1986, and 1987. Simulations were carried out using the DSSAT CSM\
    \ model with its tipping bucket approach and the coupled \nDSSAT-HYDRUS-1D model.\
    \ \n \nIn both treatments of the UFGA8401 peanut experiment, the \ncoupled model\
    \ performed better with higher values of both the \nd index and EF, and lower\
    \ values of nRMSE, as compared to \nthe original model (Table 5, Fig. 9a,b). Treatment\
    \ 1 of the \nUFGA8601 peanut experiment showed again better perfor-\nmance of\
    \ the coupled model for crop mass, stem mass, and LAI. \nBut the coupled model\
    \ performed slightly worse for pod mass, \nfor which the d index of 0.98 was a\
    \ fraction lower than 0.99 for \nthe original model, while the EF of 0.91 was\
    \ also lower than \n0.98 for the original model (Table 5, Fig. 9c,e). For treatment\
    \ 1 \nof the UFGA8701 peanut experiment, the original model per-\nformed better\
    \ with higher values of the d index and EF. Both \nmodels had the same d index\
    \ value (0.99) for crop mass, alt-\nhough the RMSE for the original model was\
    \ better as compared \nto the coupled model: 514 kg/ha and 890 kg/ha, respectively\
    \ \n(Table 5 and Fig 9d,f).  \nThe various DSSAT CSM and DSSAT-HYDRUS-1D simu-\n\
    lations of soybean and peanut crop production overall showed \ndifferences when\
    \ applied to water-limiting conditions using \nseveral different datasets for\
    \ two locations. As shown above, \nthe coupled model in general predicted less\
    \ evapotranspiration \nand higher water contents in the soil profile, which resulted\
    \ in \nless water stress, higher LAI values and more biomass than the \noriginal\
    \ DSSAT CSM model. While the simulations as such \nshowed the great potential\
    \ of the coupled model, several im-\nprovements may be possible in the analysis\
    \ of the experiments \ndiscussed in this study. These include getting better soil\
    \ texture \ndata (and hydraulic property information) especially for the \nsoybean\
    \ experiment at ISU, improving root length distribution \ndata, and improving\
    \ the partitioning of potential ET into poten-\ntial evaporation (Ep) and transpiration\
    \ (Tp). Availability of such \ninformation should further improve the reliability\
    \ and accuracy \nof the predictions.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nHYDRUS-1D was coupled\
    \ in this study with the Cropping \nSystem Model (CSM) of DSSAT V4.6 to simulate\
    \ soil water \ndynamics. Simulations with the coupled model were compared \nwith\
    \ results obtained with the original model that uses a tipping \nbucket approach\
    \ for soil water modeling. Performance of the \ntwo models was evaluated in terms\
    \ of simulated soil water \ncontents, evapotranspiration, and various crop yield\
    \ compo-\nnents. Results showed that the coupled model provided satisfac-\ntory\
    \ simulations of soil water content changes as well as the \nplant growth. However,\
    \ the two models provided different \npredictions for crop, pod, seed, and stem\
    \ mass, and the crop \nLAI, especially under water-limited conditions for soybean\
    \ in \nIowa and Florida and peanut in Florida. The coupled model, in \nthat case,\
    \ simulated insufficient yield reductions under drought, \npossibly related to\
    \ its lower evapotranspiration rate during the \nfull canopy phase. The coupled\
    \ model produced significantly \ndifferent results for actual evapotranspiration\
    \ rates, being high-\ner during an early canopy phase, but lower during the full\
    \ cano-\nVakhtang Shelia, Jirka Šimůnek, Ken Boote, Gerrit Hoogenbooom  \n244\
    \ \npy phase when LAI was high. These differences in evapotran-\nspiration rates\
    \ contributed to differences in simulated soil water \ncontents at different times\
    \ of the season, even though the dy-\nnamics of water movement by the coupled\
    \ model was simu-\nlated well. Each of the two approaches to soil water modeling\
    \ \nhas particular advantages and disadvantages, which should be \ntested in further\
    \ studies against more comprehensive datasets \nrelated to the soil and plant\
    \ water regimes. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBoote, K. J., Sau, F., Hoogenboom, G., Jones,\

    Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) has continued to expand in irrigation area within
    the U.S. during the last 15 years. Research with SDI continues for multiple crop
    types (fiber, grain and oilseed, horticultural, forage, and turf). SDI usage on
    many crops has matured through research and development of appropriate strategies
    and technologies Despite some persistent challenges to successful use of SDI,
    important opportunities exist for further adoption. Abstract. Subsurface drip
    irrigation (SDI) offers several advantages over alternative irrigation systems
    when it is designed and installed correctly and when best management practices
    are adopted. These advantages include the ability to apply water and nutrients
    directly and efficiently within the crop root zone. Disadvantages of SDI in commercial
    agriculture relative to alternative irrigation systems include greater capital
    cost per unit land area (except for small land parcels), unfamiliar management
    and maintenance protocols that can exacerbate the potential for emitter clogging,
    the visibility of system attributes (components and design characteristics) and
    performance, and the susceptibility to damage (i.e., rodents and tillage) of the
    subsurface driplines. Despite these disadvantages, SDI continues to be adopted
    in commercial agriculture in the U.S., and research efforts to evaluate and develop
    SDI systems continue as well. This article summarizes recent progress in research
    (2010 to 2020) and the status of commercial adoption of SDI, along with a discussion
    of current challenges and future opportunities. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes)

    Material References Cited By Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT We
    report on findings from seven design workshops that used ideation and sketching
    activities to prototype new situated visualizations - representations of data
    that are displayed in proximity to the physical referents (such as people, objects,
    and locations) to which the data is related. Designing situated visualizations
    requires a fine-grained understanding of the context in which the visualizations
    are placed, as well as an exploration of different options for placement and form
    factors, which existing methods for visualization design do not account for. Focusing
    on small displays as a target platform, we reflect on our experiences of using
    a diverse range of sketching activities, materials, and prompts. Based on these
    observations, we identify challenges and opportunities for sketching and ideating
    situated visualizations. We also outline the space of design activities for situated
    visualization and highlight promising methods for both designers and researchers.

    \ and applications has increased data\nprocessing and storage requirements. The\
    \ Edge computing concept aims to leverage the processing\ncapabilities of the\
    \ IoT and other devices placed at the edge of the network. One embodiment of\n\
    this paradigm is Fog computing, which provides an intermediate and often hierarchical\
    \ processing\ntier between the data sources and the remote Cloud. Among the major\
    \ beneﬁts of this concept, the\nend-to-end latency can be decreased, thus favoring\
    \ time-sensitive applications. Moreover, the data\ntrafﬁc at the network core\
    \ and the Cloud computing workload can be reduced. Combining the Fog\ncomputing\
    \ paradigm with Complex Event Processing (CEP) and data fusion techniques has\
    \ excellent\npotential for generating valuable knowledge and aiding decision-making\
    \ processes in the Internet of\nThings’ systems. In this context, we propose a\
    \ multi-tier complex event processing approach (sensor\nnode, Fog, and Cloud)\
    \ that promotes fast decision making and is based on information with 98%\naccuracy.\
    \ The experiments show a reduction of 77% in the average time of sending messages\
    \ in the\nnetwork. In addition, we achieved a reduction of 82% in data trafﬁc.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; Fog computing; complex event processing\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to [1], the Internet of Things (IoT) environment is composed of physical\n\
    and virtual entities where physical entities turn into virtual things inside a\
    \ cyber-world.\nThese things are embedded with different abilities such as sensing,\
    \ analyzing, processing,\nand self-management capacities. By adopting interoperable\
    \ communication protocols,\nthese smart things should have unique identities and\
    \ virtual personalities. The recent\ngrowth of Internet services and applications\
    \ has contributed to increasing data processing\nand storage requirements. Such\
    \ requirements are diverse in terms of the required resources\nby different applications,\
    \ thus calling for customized solutions.\nEdge computing recently emerged to overcome\
    \ some drawbacks of using Cloud\ncomputing as a back-end platform for IoT. Such\
    \ drawbacks include its unpredictable\nlatency, lack of location awareness and\
    \ user mobility [2]. The Edge computing concept\naims to leverage the processing\
    \ capabilities of IoT devices by using gateways, base stations,\nand other Edge\
    \ devices, providing an intermediate tier between the end-devices (data\nproducers/consumers)\
    \ and the remote Cloud. The presence of Edge devices enables the\nlocal processing\
    \ of requests, reducing the Cloud computing workload and application\nresponse\
    \ time.\nThe Edge computing paradigm has been applied to several emerging scenarios\
    \ and\nadopted by IoT applications that are time-critical and have sensitive data\
    \ (in terms of\nprivacy). One embodiment of this paradigm is Fog computing. Fog\
    \ computing denotes a\ndecentralized computing infrastructure consisting of processing\
    \ nodes placed anywhere on\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21217226\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n2 of 22\nthe continuum\
    \ between the end-devices and the Cloud. According to [3], Fog is a “cloud\nclosest\
    \ to the ground”. It extends the traditional Cloud computing architecture to the\
    \ edge\nof the network, enabling the processing and analyzing of some data at\
    \ that tier. The Fog\narchitecture is generally composed of at least three tiers.\
    \ The low tier consists of IoT devices\nthat collect, pre-process and forward\
    \ data to the Fog nodes. The middle tier comprises Fog\nnodes (with a higher processing\
    \ power than the IoT devices) that perform data processing,\ndecision making,\
    \ and actuation. The Cloud stores information and processes data that Fog\nnodes\
    \ did not have enough computing resources to process in the upper tier.\nFog computing\
    \ bridges the gap between the Cloud and end-devices (e.g., IoT nodes)\nby enabling\
    \ computing, storage, networking, and data management on network nodes\nwithin\
    \ the close vicinity of IoT devices. Consequently, computation, storage, networking,\n\
    decision making, and data management occur not only in the Cloud but also along\
    \ the\nIoT-to-Cloud path as data traverses to the Cloud (preferably close to the\
    \ IoT devices) [4].\nOne of the main differences between Cloud and Fog computing\
    \ concerns the scale of\nhardware components associated with these computing paradigms.\
    \ Cloud computing\nprovides highly available computing resources at relatively\
    \ high power consumption,\nwhereas Fog computing provides moderate availability\
    \ of computing resources at lower\npower consumption [5].\nTo perform raw data\
    \ processing in the Fog and Cloud tier some techniques can be\napplied aiming\
    \ to extract meaningful information, thus generating knowledge. In addition,\n\
    other techniques are often used to perform pre-processing functions, with different\
    \ goals,\nsuch as spurious data ﬁltering and dimensional reduction. Data pre-processing\
    \ techniques\ncan help improve the quality of the data produced while reducing\
    \ the use of resources\nin processing tasks. A widely adopted technique in both\
    \ the steps of sensor data pre-\nprocessing and processing is data fusion. Data\
    \ fusion [6] can be understood as a process of\naggregating and combining data\
    \ from multiple sources to prevent redundancy and reduce\nthe response time. It\
    \ can also improve data accuracy by using data from various sources to\ncompose\
    \ complete information. In addition to data fusion, complex event processing (CEP)\n\
    techniques also contribute to improving the information generated by sensors.\
    \ CEP goes\nbeyond simple data query and transformation and aims to detect patterns\
    \ in the data using\nﬁltering techniques, correlation, and creating new, composite\
    \ events from simple ones.\nIn this context, this work proposes a multi-tier approach\
    \ for complex event processing\nin Fog-based IoT systems. Our approach aims to\
    \ process events based on sensing data\nwith low response time and high accuracy.\
    \ One of the goals of our proposal is to reduce\nthe number of messages exchanged\
    \ between the sensed area and the Cloud. The main idea\nis to identify a simple\
    \ event that triggers the complex event processing, aiming to identify\nthe nodes\
    \ related to the event and extract the characteristics of the sensed location.\
    \ In this\nway, information is processed in different tiers, according to the\
    \ capacity of each device,\noptimizing the use of computational resources and\
    \ decreasing the average response time,\nboth between the sensor and the Fog tier\
    \ and between the Fog tier and the Cloud. The data\nare collected, managed, and\
    \ processed according to the application requirements and in\na decentralized\
    \ way. Different tiers are responsible for the collection, analysis, decision\n\
    making, and support of IoT systems. Aiming to harness the intrinsic capabilities\
    \ of the Fog\ncomputing environment, this approach also explores the typical concept\
    \ of the geolocation\nFog enhanced with an information context to consolidate\
    \ the data in the Fog nodes. Sensor\nnodes are selected and orchestrated using\
    \ their distance to the Fog node and the type of\nsensed data. So, our geographical\
    \ distributed and context-aware approach can help to\nimprove low latency and\
    \ consistent data access.\nThe main contribution of this work is the proposal\
    \ of a hierarchical approach of\na complex event processing (CEP) mechanism aiming\
    \ to (i) reduce data exchange and\nresponse time and (ii) increase information\
    \ accuracy to make timely decisions and support\na complete data processing workﬂow\
    \ for smart agriculture applications.\nThus, among the advantages of our CEP approach\
    \ in three tiers, we can cite:\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n3 of 22\n•\nThe CEP mechanisms\
    \ distributed in the network are capable of load balancing with\nless processing\
    \ power, generating complex events, and processing them in tiers with\ngreater\
    \ processing power;\n•\nA new CEP mechanism can be implemented in the event of\
    \ an increase in data volume,\nchanging only the tier of the hierarchy in question;\n\
    •\nNetwork trafﬁc to transfer information between tiers can be signiﬁcantly reduced,\n\
    sending only the data necessary for processing events at the appropriate tiers.\n\
    We simulated scenarios in precision agriculture to evaluate the proposed approach.\
    \ It\nwas tailored to the requirements of IoT applications from the smart agriculture\
    \ domain.\nThe experiments show a reduction of 77% in the average time of sending\
    \ messages in\nthe network and 82% of improvement in the throughput using the\
    \ proposed approach\ncompared to systems without our proposal. Additionally, tests\
    \ were conducted to validate\nthe proposed complex event processing engine.\n\
    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and discusses the related\
    \ work.\nThe proposed approach is presented in Section 3, and Section 4 covers\
    \ the materials and\nmethods. The results are discussed in Section 5. Finally,\
    \ Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2. Related Work\nManaging data acquired by a\
    \ vast array of heterogeneous sensors remains as complex\nas the knowledge needed\
    \ to make a decision on the practices of an agricultural process.\nThis is mainly\
    \ due to the fact that processing is required in the various temporal and spatial\n\
    dimensions of the acquired data. This task implies that data should become available\
    \ in\na suitable time window and format to be viewed and stored, but also to feed\
    \ decision-\nmaking support systems. Managing data and extracting timely information\
    \ is also quickly\nbecoming a key issue. In this context, the authors in [7] proposed\
    \ a universal CEP mech-\nanism for IoT monitoring using Edge computing. In addition,\
    \ a formalized hierarchical\ncomplex event model is created, including raw, simple,\
    \ and complex events, to reduce the\ncomplexity of event modeling. The model uses\
    \ complex time and space semantics to deﬁne\nﬂexible events through algorithms.\
    \ The authors in [8] use a hybrid approach, in which\ntwo data processing tiers,\
    \ the Edge-tier and Cloud-tier, work together to provide effective\nIoT data analysis.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, raw data are locally collected at IoT devices. Features are\nextracted\
    \ by performing data fusion techniques in devices with greater processing power\n\
    and then sending the result to the Cloud.\nThe work described in [9] addresses\
    \ the hierarchical data fusion in IoT networks that\ncontain Edge devices, network\
    \ and communication units, and Cloud platforms. Different\ndata sources are combined\
    \ at each tier to produce timely and accurate results. The work\npresented in\
    \ [10] proposes utilizing complex event processing and a hierarchical distributed\n\
    architecture for enabling data fusion at various levels. To this purpose, their\
    \ paper intro-\nduces complex event processing (CEP) as a potential way of implementing\
    \ sensor data\nfusion in distributed IoT systems. Aiming to leverage local processing\
    \ capabilities wher-\never possible, or off-load tasks to Edge/Cloud computing\
    \ otherwise—thereby paving the\nway for a multi-layered, hierarchical data fusion\
    \ approach, aiming to reduce the network’s\nresponse time and amounts of transferred\
    \ data. Another work dealing with a large amount\nof data is [11], where a new\
    \ computing paradigm was proposed, designed to process\nBig Data in a collaborative\
    \ Edge (CEE) environment. The work proposed the fusion of\ngeographically distributed\
    \ data, creating shared virtual visualizations of the data exposed\nto the end-users\
    \ through interfaces predeﬁned by the data owners.\nIn [12], the authors proposed\
    \ and analyzed a CEP-based Fog architecture for real-time\nIoT applications that\
    \ uses a publish–subscribe protocol. A testbed was developed with\nlow-cost and\
    \ local resources to verify the suitability of CEP-engines to low-cost comput-\n\
    ing resources. To assess the performance, they analyzed the effectiveness and\
    \ cost of\nthe proposal in terms of latency and resource usage, respectively.\
    \ In [13], a weighted\ncost model is proposed to minimize IoT applications’ execution\
    \ time and energy con-\nsumption in a computing environment with multiple IoT\
    \ devices, multiple Fog/Edge\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n4 of 22\nservers, and Cloud\
    \ servers. In addition, a new application placement technique based\non the Memetic\
    \ Algorithm is proposed to make batch application placement decisions\nfor concurrent\
    \ IoT applications. Due to the heterogeneity of IoT applications, they also\n\
    proposed a lightweight pre-scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of parallel\
    \ tasks\nfor concurrent execution.\nIn [14], the authors proposed a scalable network\
    \ architecture for monitoring and\ncontrolling agriculture in rural areas. Compared\
    \ to the existing IoT-based farming solutions,\nthe proposed solution reduces\
    \ network latency up to a certain extent. In that paper,\na cross-layer-based\
    \ channel access and routing solution for sensing and actuating were\nproposed.\
    \ The work of [15] used innovative platform technology to be applied to the Cloud\n\
    agriculture platform. Cloud integration can be applied to large-area data collection\
    \ and\nanalysis, allowing farmland with limited network information resources\
    \ to be integrated\nand automated. Those improvements, including agricultural\
    \ monitoring automation, pest\nmanagement image analysis, and monitoring can also\
    \ be used to solve the predicament of\nlarge-area automation construction.\nMore\
    \ speciﬁcally on precision agriculture, the authors of [16] proposed a framework\n\
    designed to provide a complete farming ecosystem. The framework facilitates the\
    \ sim-\nulation of custom farming scenarios for users, speciﬁcally to identify\
    \ sensor placement,\ncoverage area, line-of-sight deployment, data gathering through\
    \ a relay mechanism or\nairborne systems, mobility models for mobile nodes, energy\
    \ models for on-ground sensors\nand airborne vehicles, and back-end computing\
    \ support using Fog computing paradigm.\nIn [17], the authors proposed a multi-criterion-based\
    \ resource allocation policy with re-\nsource reservation to minimize overall\
    \ delay, processing time, and service level agreement\n(SLA) violations. This\
    \ process considers Fog computing-related characteristics, such as\ndevice heterogeneity,\
    \ resource constraints, and mobility, as well as dynamic changes in\nuser requirements.\
    \ The authors employed multiple objective functions to ﬁnd appropriate\nresources\
    \ for executing time-sensitive tasks in the Fog environment.\nThe work of [18]\
    \ was a review to identify all relevant research on new computing\nparadigms with\
    \ smart agriculture. They also proposed a new architecture model with the\ncombinations\
    \ of Cloud–Fog–Edge. Furthermore, the authors analyzed the agricultural\napplication\
    \ domains, research approaches, and the applications. Moreover, the survey\ndiscussed\
    \ the components used in the architecture models and brieﬂy explores the commu-\n\
    nication protocols used to interact from one layer to another.\nAll the studies\
    \ mentioned above have contributed to improving Fog computing and\nCEP performance\
    \ in different ways. However, their event model has been abstractly\ndeﬁned, some\
    \ without hierarchical or speciﬁc description mechanisms. Therefore, focusing\n\
    on the event model, data fusion, and information quality remain the unsolved technical\n\
    issues our CEP approach currently addresses. Furthermore, some experiments were\n\
    performed to evaluate our approach performance regarding data trafﬁc, decision\
    \ quality,\nand response time.\nIn our work, the fusion classiﬁcation, as described\
    \ in [19], based on the data type\n(redundant, cooperative, and complementary)\
    \ is used in conjunction with the classiﬁcation\nbased on abstraction tiers (low,\
    \ medium, and high). In addition, the proposal includes the\nintegration of the\
    \ CEP technique in the hierarchy of tiers. The CEP technique detects a\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ number of events with low latency [20]. Our approach is described in Section\
    \ 3.\nAdvantages of the proposed CEP approach on three tiers can be outlined as\
    \ follows:\n•\nThe CEP mechanisms distributed in the network can improve the information\
    \ quality\nby adding information to the observed data;\n•\nA new CEP mechanism\
    \ can be implemented in the event of an increase in the volume\nof data, changing\
    \ only the hierarchy tier in question;\n•\nThe response time of transferring information\
    \ between tiers can be significantly reduced.\nTable 1 lists the main contributions\

    \ Processing Approach\nModern IoT systems tend to go beyond the notion of “bottom–up”\
    \ monitoring. Thus,\nsensing devices are not only in charge of collecting raw\
    \ data and transferring it over\nthe network. They also implemented a “descendant”\
    \ feedback communication between\nthe network tiers (e.g., for decision making\
    \ based on data). The proposed approach\nuses coordination functionality as part\
    \ of this two-way communication responsible for\ncommunication between the tiers\
    \ described. More speciﬁcally, coordination is a two-way\nfunctionality. On the\
    \ one hand, the Fog device receives data from lower-tier devices,\ncollecting\
    \ and dispatching to processors and data fusion engines at the upper tier if\n\
    necessary. On the other hand, the Fog device sends the new processing rules to\
    \ the lower\ntiers according to the changes observed in the data behavior. Thus,\
    \ the proposed conceptual\napproach comprises the implementation and execution\
    \ tiers of complex event processing\nin devices. Figure 1 describes the separation\
    \ conceptual of tasks at all three tiers. These\ntasks have dedicated instances\
    \ of data fusion (DF) mechanisms: low tier (LDF), medium\ntier (MDF), and high\
    \ tier (HDF) data fusion [9]. The two top tiers include coordination\ncomponents\
    \ (LDF and MDF coordinators), responsible for bidirectional communication\nbetween\
    \ the lower and upper-tier nodes and managing requests from the lower-tier nodes.\n\
    The architecture of our proposal (Figure 1) is composed of three different tiers\
    \ which\nprocess simple and complex events from several different sources. The\
    \ low-tier devices\n(IoT devices) collect data from the real world (for example,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature).\nA relatively limited fusion technique (a simple\
    \ aggregation such as simple or weighted\narithmetic averages) was performed at\
    \ this tier. Then, the result was sent to the medium\ntier (Fog node). This aspect\
    \ reduces the data ﬂow in the sensor tier, the network segment\nwith less transmission\
    \ capacity. The Fog node is located close to the IoT devices or along the\ncommunication\
    \ path to the Cloud nodes. Fog node performs a complementary fusion of all\ndata\
    \ received by the sensor nodes using event processing techniques, thus allowing\
    \ local\ndecision making regarding the sensed area with low latency. It is essential\
    \ to highlight that\na Fog node has fewer resources than a Cloud node and just\
    \ local knowledge, unlike Cloud\nnodes. Therefore, a Fog node can apply less sophisticated\
    \ data fusion algorithms than\nthose of a Cloud node. However, a Fog node can\
    \ use more complex algorithms than an IoT\ndevice because it has a broader computational\
    \ capacity to process and fuse information\nand receives a higher amount of data\
    \ from different sources. Furthermore, if necessary,\nthe Fog node can also directly\
    \ act on the sensed area, aiming to reduce latency. Finally,\nthe Fog node sends\
    \ the data transformed by the data fusion and CEP methods to the high\ntier (Cloud\
    \ node), which, according to the application, may be responsible for persistently\n\
    storing the data and creating global inferences.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n6 of\
    \ 22\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture for multi-tier hierarchical CEP approach.\n\
    Our approach is also composed of geolocation and context-aware sensor nodes. In\
    \ this\nway, when a new sensor node connects to the network, it is associated\
    \ with a speciﬁc Fog\nbased on its location and context information. For this\
    \ purpose, the nodes start sending a\nbroadcast message to the Fog nodes which\
    \ includes its coordinates (latitude and longitude)\nand the type of data collected.\
    \ If the Fog node is compatible with a datum type, it calculates\nthe Euclidean\
    \ distance between them and sends the data to the Cloud node. For better\ncomprehension,\
    \ we exemplify a sensor that sends temperature data to only connect to\na Fog\
    \ node that processes temperature data. The Cloud node checks the Fog with the\n\
    lowest distance calculated and returns this information to the corresponding Fog\
    \ node.\nIn turn, the Fog node forwards the information to the sensor node. Then,\
    \ the sensor node\nonly sends the collected data to the corresponding Fog, so\
    \ it is processed according to the\napproach requests.\nOur proposal uses the\
    \ CEP model of rules presented in [20] and according to the\nfollowing mechanisms:\n\
    1.\nA simple event is extracted from the result of the simple fusion of the collected\
    \ raw\ndata; the aggregation was performed on a number N of sensor readings;\n\
    2.\nIn the Fog tier, a rule mechanism describes the events generated from the\
    \ received\nvalue. The aggregation performed at the IoT device tier can trigger\
    \ other different\nevents based on the obtained result. An example in the agriculture\
    \ domain would\nbe a temperature change. If the value has not changed since the\
    \ last data were sent,\nthen an event that results in a message being sent should\
    \ be triggered; if changed,\nthe calculation of a daily irrigation event should\
    \ be triggered;\n3.\nThe set of simple events is aggregated, generating more complex\
    \ events, and the Fog\nprocesses the event according to the deﬁned rules;\n4.\n\
    Depending on the event complexity, whenever an event requires a global view, a\
    \ new\nevent sends the data to be processed in the Cloud.\nAccording to [21],\
    \ these four mechanisms can be denominated: data receiver, rule\nmechanism, event\
    \ executor, and event forwarder. We highlight that the processing of\nseveral\
    \ simple events is complex event processing. Figure 2 exempliﬁes the multi-tier\n\
    CEP mechanism.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n7 of 22\nFigure 2. Example of the multi-tier\
    \ CEP mechanism.\nSensor nodes are associated with a speciﬁc Fog node according\
    \ to their characteristics,\nsuch as location and context. For this connection,\
    \ when a sensor node is added to the\nnetwork, it sends a broadcast message to\
    \ the Fog nodes, including coordinates’ parameters\n(latitude and longitude values)\
    \ and the type of data collected. If the Fog node is compatible\n(same type),\
    \ it calculates the Euclidean distance between them and sends its calculated\n\
    value to the Cloud node. This is necessary because the Cloud is the only tier\
    \ with a\nglobal knowledge of the network since the Fog nodes do not communicate\
    \ with each other.\nThe data compatibility is related to the data type that the\
    \ Fog can process. For example,\nan IoT device sending temperature data will only\
    \ connect to a Fog node that processes\ntemperature data. The Cloud node veriﬁes\
    \ the nearest Fog based on the lowest calculated\ndistance value and returns this\
    \ information to the corresponding Fog node. The Fog node,\nin turn, forwards\
    \ this information to the IoT device.\nUsing the CEP mechanism, we can separate\
    \ the process of knowledge generation into\npartial processing and decision making.\
    \ Thus, not only processing but network latency was\nalso reduced. For example,\
    \ when detecting an “abnormal” temperature, the sensor only\nsends the data to\
    \ the decision-making part, which handles tasks of semantic reasoning,\nsuch as\
    \ correlating the data received. In general, the CEP technique can be seen as\
    \ a\nmethod that receives and correlates a set of simple events generating complex\
    \ events.\nThus, it is responsible for detecting simple events, using a cycle\
    \ of ﬁltering, correlation,\ncontextualization, and data analysis from different\
    \ sources.\n3.1. Description of Application Rules and Events: Precision Agriculture\n\
    In the agricultural sector, achieving maximum crop yield at minimum cost is a\
    \ produc-\ntion goal. In this context, decision-making is complex, as several\
    \ factors affect the entire\nprocess, aiming to save water resources, mainly on\
    \ irrigation.\nThe study of water in the soil is of great interest to agriculture\
    \ because it affects the\ndevelopment and production of crops. A developing plant\
    \ must supply the atmosphere’s\ndemand for water through the amount it can extract\
    \ from the soil. Soil water storage\nis reduced by evapotranspiration and replaced\
    \ by precipitation or irrigation. Thus, soil\nwater storage and availability in\
    \ crop production are valuable, and characterizing the\nsoil properties responsible\
    \ for water retention is crucial. The soil moisture is estimated\nusing three\
    \ tensiometers at different soil depths in each monitoring point, which is used\
    \ to\nestimate the soil matric potential. The matric potential is directly linked\
    \ to moisture; the\nmore humid the soil, the greater its potential [22].\nIrrigation\
    \ helps reserve enough water for the crop in its development stage. Its matric\n\
    potential is used in irrigation management to determine when to irrigate, the\
    \ amount of\nwater, and the type of irrigation. The water distribution is on-demand,\
    \ i.e., when water\nis always available by the irrigation project or pumped by\
    \ the user and used when the\ncrop needs.\nThe irrigation management determines\
    \ irrigation timing by monitoring the soil ma-\ntric potential (ψ) containing\
    \ the highest concentration of crop roots (usually in the most\nsuperﬁcial soil\
    \ tier, monitored by the tensiometer). Another way to determine the time to\n\
    irrigate is through the critical moisture θcr, also called ideal moisture for\
    \ irrigation. This\nparameter is the soil water content from which the crop yield\
    \ starts to be reduced, also\nhaving the possibility of evapotranspiration reduction\
    \ (water consumption by cultivation).\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n8 of 22\nθcr is\
    \ only needed for the most superﬁcial soil tier. The evapotranspiration measures\
    \ the\nwater consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage of the\
    \ crop and weather\nconditions [22].\nAnother important variable to be considered\
    \ in view of the plant’s needs is the\nirrigation water need (IWN). The IWN consists\
    \ of the water provided entirely by irrigation\nto compensate for the water loss\
    \ due to evaporation. It is obtained through a calculation\nconsidering the rainfall,\
    \ water consumption, soil moisture at the crop root zone and the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ the irrigation system placed in the ﬁeld [22].\nSimilarly to the works in [23,24],\
    \ we can also detect anomalies in sensor measures\nby comparing with measures\
    \ from nearby sensors, in order to verify whether there was a\nsensor error, whether\
    \ there is any water leakage, or whether, for some reason, the soil is\ntoo dry.\n\
    Based on these concepts, we deﬁne the rules and events of the case study presented\
    \ in\nthe following sections.\n3.2. Rules and Events\nThe rules deﬁned to manage\
    \ the events are divided into two sets: monitoring rules\nand critical state rules.\
    \ Each rule consists of a set of events that are executed according to\nits pattern\
    \ and transformation primitives. These events are allocated to the tiers according\n\
    to the capacity of the devices so that the approach performance is not affected.\
    \ Thus,\nthey directly inﬂuence the process of decision making by the user and\
    \ also automatically\naccording to the system’s behavior.\n3.2.1. Monitoring Rules\n\
    The ﬁrst set of events of the monitoring rule are based on the primitives of ﬁltration,\n\
    aggregation, and projection. They are performed at the sensor tier. The projection\
    \ is\nresponsible for creating complex events (processed in the Fog tier) using\
    \ a subset of its\nattributes, generated by aggregation (average of values obtained\
    \ by the sensors) and by\nﬁltering (obtaining the maximum and minimum values).\
    \ The rule of this ﬁrst set was\ncomposed of the following events:\n•\nEV1 (Simple):\
    \ low matric potential alert;\n•\nEV2 (Simple): high matric potential alert;\n\
    •\nEV3 (Simple): daily matric potential sending alert + sensor ID.\nThe second\
    \ set is formed by simple and compound events based on the primitives of\naggregation,\
    \ enrichment, and composition performed in the Fog tier. Enrichment is the\nconference\
    \ of the data necessary for calculations. Composition is the computations made\n\
    from the data consulted. The events that compose this rule are:\n•\nEV4 (Complex):\
    \ matric potential variation ;\n•\nEV5 (Complex): daily irrigation water needed\
    \ (IWN);\n•\nEV6 (Complex): daily irrigation frequency veriﬁcation.\nThe outputs\
    \ of these events are messages displayed and sent to the user.\n3.2.2. Critical\
    \ State Rules\nThe critical state rule is composed of events based on the primitives\
    \ of enrichment,\ncomposition, negation and sequence performed at the Fog tier.\
    \ For the use of the sequence\nprimitive, an input control is necessary, which\
    \ can be done through a time window, using a\ntimestamp, or context, using an\
    \ event identiﬁer. This rule consists of the following events:\n•\nEV7 (Complex):\
    \ critical soil moisture (ideal for irrigation);\n•\nEV8 (Complex): maximum water\
    \ deﬁcit.\nThese events result in automatic actions in the monitored area.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 7226\n9 of 22\n3.3. CEP Architecture\nThe proposed complex events\
    \ processing (CEP) model is part of the data fusion\nmechanism to treat, analyze,\
    \ and react to data ﬂows as events. Event ﬂows are the primary\nsources of input\
    \ of the CEP model. The events are created through producers (sensors,\nusers)\
    \ that provide the data. The ﬂow of events is processed through the CEP event\n\
    processing agent, known as EPA. Speciﬁcally, the EPA follows the subsequent steps:\
    \ reacts\nto events, analyzes, and manipulates them according to deﬁned rules,\
    \ and, if necessary,\ngenerates derivative (complex) events for the consumers.\
    \ The EPA acts according to the\nprimitives deﬁned in each example, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3 and 4.\nFigure 3. CEP architecture and primitives.\nFigure 4. CEP\
    \ primitives CEP according with tiers.\nA CEP inference engine allows instantiating\
    \ the presented concepts. In addition, it\nprovides operations to deﬁne the types\
    \ of events (schema and payload) and primitives\nin real-time to express continuous\
    \ queries (PAEs) and interconnect them. The inference\nengines of the events are\
    \ shown in Section 3.3.1.\n3.3.1. Description of CEP Rules and Events\nWe show\

    \ to comple-\nment this set of rules and events. The event-processing programming\
    \ differs from regular\nprogramming and thus needs its own auditing tool. Auditing\
    \ is the ability to investigate\nwhether processes have been properly applied.\
    \ The investigation may refer to whether a\nprocess complies with external regulations\
    \ or internal policies or whether a decision has\nbeen appropriately made.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Auditing\nGiven the rules and events presented in Section 3.3.1, we performed\
    \ the auditing of\nthe CEP model using a static analysis of the network. The auditing\
    \ process for a CEP model\nis based on the event log, a list that retains the\
    \ raw and derived events performed in the\ngiven processing. The audit was made\
    \ based on consultations in this event log. The query\nis similar to the dynamic\
    \ analysis process of the validation process, as it depends on the\namount of\
    \ information from the execution of a given event.\nFor the auditing of the CEP\
    \ model, two primary consultations were performed based\non the concept presented\
    \ in [25]: (i) consult all antecedents of a given event or activation of\nan EPA\
    \ instance (rule); and (ii) consult all the consequences of a given event or activation\n\
    of an EPA instance (rule).\nWe can observe from these two main consultations that\
    \ the objective of the audit is\nto check the background and consequences of a\
    \ given processed event, i.e., to check the\nbackground of the ﬁnalizing events\
    \ and the consequences of the initial events. Thus, for the\nmodel applied to\
    \ the approach proposed in this article, it is necessary to audit the following\n\
    events:\n•\nConsult 1: EV4, EV6, EV7, and EV8.\n•\nConsult 2: EV1, EV2, and EV3.\n\
    Figures 5–7 present the logs of the consulted events. From the logs, we can verify\n\
    that event processing is meeting the application’s needs. Exemplifying the Event\
    \ 1 log\n(Figure 5), the expected performance according to the low matric potential\
    \ is irrigation\nunless a sensor malfunction has occurred. Then, following the\
    \ processing of event 1, it\nends by triggering event 4 in case the rule is activated.\
    \ Now, observing the log presented\nin Figure 6, we veriﬁed that this event ends\
    \ by exactly meeting the need to trigger event 1:\nor ends by sending a message\
    \ to the user informing of the sensor malfunction, or sending\na message to trigger\
    \ manual irrigation, or, ﬁnally, triggering event 8. Event 10 checks\nthe activation\
    \ of the EPA instance, testing the rule, and ends with the triggering of the\n\
    automatic irrigation or requesting that the same be done manually, as we can see\
    \ in the log\nof Figure 7.\nFigure 5. Log of events 1, 2, and 3.\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 7226\n12 of 22\nFigure 6. Log of event 4.\nFigure 7. Logs of events 6, 7,\
    \ and 8.\nThus, based on any consult executed in the logs presented, the application’s\
    \ need is\nsatisﬁed at the end of the processing—starting from event 2 (Figure\
    \ 5) and ending at event\n4 (Figure 6), etc. In this way, the audit of the CEP\
    \ model used in the proposed approach\nwas successfully satisﬁed.\n4. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the performed experiments. We divided them\
    \ into two experi-\nmental groups, with different goals. The ﬁrst group refers\
    \ to the experiments performed to\nanalyze the proposal’s performance using the\
    \ metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score,\ndata trafﬁc, and time to\
    \ send packages. The second group refers to the implementation\nof the rules responsible\
    \ for controlling the irrigation process, the validation of the soil\nmoisture\
    \ management, and the reaction time of the actuators to verify the response time\n\
    and the CEP efﬁciency. Table 2 summarizes the experiments, objectives, and metrics.\n\

    \ ﬁrst performance evaluation, executed to verify the quality\nof the decision\
    \ generated and the performance in terms of data trafﬁc and average sending\n\
    time with the application of the CEP approach. Both aspects are critical to assess\
    \ the\nperformance of the large-scale deployment of wireless sensors. To create\
    \ a proof of concept\n(PoC) of our proposal, we used a real coconut ﬁeld of Embrapa\
    \ Agroindustrial [26] as a\nmodel to simulate an environment for our experiments.\
    \ The experimental ﬁeld is located\nin Paraipaba-Ce.\nExperiment I: Design\nOur\
    \ simulated ﬁeld consists of 25 coconut trees, in which temperature sensors monitor\n\
    ﬁfteen trees, and soil moisture sensors monitor ten trees. In addition, ﬁve Fog\
    \ nodes\ncommunicating with the Cloud were implemented. Furthermore, we simulated\
    \ two other\nscenarios to verify the approach’s scalability by varying the number\
    \ of nodes as follows:\n(i) 50 sensor nodes (25 temperature, 25 soil moisture)\
    \ and 10 Fog nodes; and (ii) 100 sensor\nnodes (50 temperature, 50 soil moisture)\
    \ and 20 Fog nodes.\nWe used a discrete event simulator focused on, but not restricted\
    \ to, Fog environments,\ncalled Yet Another Fog Simulator (YAFS) to run the simulations.\
    \ YAFS was built to ana-\nlyze the application’s design and it incorporates strategies\
    \ for positioning, programming,\nand routing. YAFS has similar characteristics\
    \ to the iFogSim simulator and uses it as a\nreference [27]. According to [28],\
    \ iFogSim is one of the most widely used Fog simulators for\nscenario simulations\
    \ using Fog and Cloud computing. YAFS includes more functionality\nthan current\
    \ simulators for modeling IoT scenarios and is easier to add extensions. We\n\
    highlight the following points of YAFS:\n•\nIt provides a network vision that\
    \ allows the modeling of the communication links\namong machines, users and end-devices;\n\
    •\nEach workload source represents the connection of a user or an IoT sensor or\
    \ actuator\nthat demands a service and can be created, changed or dynamically\
    \ removed, enabling\nthe modeling of the user movements in an ecosystem;\n•\n\
    Custom processes can be invoked at runtime to provide ﬂexible implementations\
    \ of\nreal events;\n•\nIt provides post-simulation data analysis based on two\
    \ types of events: workload\ngeneration and computation, and link transmissions.\n\
    The sensor readings were carried out over a 20-min time frame so that we capture\n\
    the hourly average. Every twelve hours, the sensor node performs a simple aggregation\n\
    function, calculating the arithmetic mean. Then, each sensor sends the value to\
    \ its respective\nFog node. Then, the Fog node transforms the received data into\
    \ information using data\nfusion and CEP techniques such as ﬁltering and composing\
    \ complex events. CEP works\nas an inference engine, ﬁltering, correlating, and\
    \ composing new events based on the\ninformation obtained through the fusion of\
    \ the data. For example, after consecutive\nreadings of temperature values greater\
    \ than 29 ºC, an event is created that exhibits a\ntemperature alert message on\
    \ display. Likewise, a new event is created to send an urgent\nmessage to prevent\
    \ the soil from becoming too dry after displaying ﬁve messages without\nchange\
    \ in the monitored area (without action).\nThe sensor nodes have 16 MB RAM, while\
    \ Fog nodes have 4 GB and Cloud nodes\nhave 8 GB. These values were chosen to\
    \ be realistic, closer to the device’s conﬁguration\noften used. Thus, each sensor\
    \ node is connected to a Fog node, while each Fog node is\nconnected to the Cloud\
    \ node. For simulation purposes, only one Cloud node was used in\nall scenarios.\
    \ The parameters conﬁgured in the experiments performed are summarized in\nTable\

    \ Nodes\nScalability\n20 Fog Nodes\nTo better understanding the metrics of quality\
    \ decisions, the basic knowledge of\neach concept is necessary. False positives\
    \ and false negatives are illustrated utilizing\nthe confusion matrix, a table\
    \ indicating the errors and successes of the evaluated model,\ncomparing them\
    \ with the expected result. In this matrix, the following values are shown:\n\
    •\nTrue positive (TP): values that correspond to the positive of the value read;\
    \ in the case\nof the architecture presented, the value must be within the normal\
    \ temperature range\n(up to 29 ºC) and acceptable humidity (greater than or equal\
    \ to 60 KPa);\n•\nFalse negative (FN): error in which the model predicted a negative\
    \ result (that is,\noutside the normal temperature range or acceptable soil moisture)\
    \ when the real value\nwas within the positive range (described above);\n•\nFalse\
    \ positive (FP): error in which the model predicted a positive result when the\
    \ real\nvalue was within the negative range (that is, temperature > 29 ◦C or soil\
    \ moisture\n< 60 KPa);\n•\nTrue negative (TN): correct classiﬁcation of values\
    \ within the high temperature range\n(greater than 29 ◦C) or dry soil (less than\
    \ 60 KPa) before and after the data fusion\nis applied.\nWhen all the terms (TP,\
    \ FN, FP, and TN) are computed, resulting in the confusion\nmatrices, it is possible\
    \ to calculate the following metrics for assessing the quality of the\ndata: accuracy\
    \ (Ac); precision (P); recall (R); and F1-Score (F1) using the Equations (1)–(4):\n\
    Ac =\nTP + TN\nTP + FP + TN + FN\n(1)\nP =\nTP\nTP + FP\n(2)\nR =\nTP\nTP + FN\n\
    (3)\nF1 = 2 × P × R\nP + R\n(4)\nRegarding these metrics, accuracy provides a\
    \ general analysis of the model considering\nall the data collected; this metric\
    \ indicates the percentage of data that were correctly\nclassiﬁed. The precision\
    \ metric provides a percentage of how many positive instances were\ncorrectly\
    \ ranked, while the Recall metric was used to indicate the relationship between\n\
    positive predictions performed correctly and all data that are actually positive.\
    \ The F1-score\nmetric indicates the overall behavior of accuracy and recall.\
    \ If the F1-score is low, it is\nunderstood that one of the two metrics is low.\
    \ Regarding this last metric, it is important to\nhighlight the harmonic mean\
    \ of accuracy and recall. When the values are close, the result\nis similar to\
    \ the arithmetic mean [29].\n4.2. Experiment 2: Validation of CEP Model Implementation\
    \ and Reaction Time\nThis section presents the implementation of rules directly\
    \ linked to irrigation control\nand the validation of its effectiveness using\
    \ a program that simulates the sensors and the\nsoil matric potential values in\
    \ real time.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n15 of 22\nExperiment 2: Design\nFigure 8\
    \ shows the components implemented for Experiment 2, where sensors and\nactuators\
    \ nodes exchange information with the Fog tier. We used three soil moisture\n\
    sensors and an actuator that controls irrigation in the zone in the ﬁeld. We used\
    \ Python to\nsimulate both components, with soil conditions and moisture progression\
    \ according to the\nirrigation state (on or off). The Fog tier comprises two components:\
    \ a Rabbitmq messaging\nserver containing two queues (data input and output) and\
    \ a module dedicated to the data\nstream and complex event processing (CEP), which\
    \ was implemented using Apache Flink\nthe FlinkCEP library. Communication between\
    \ the Fog tier and the IoT nodes in the ﬁeld\nwas through the MQTT protocol. Rabbitmq\
    \ was chosen as the messaging service because\nthe tool provides a native plugin\
    \ that supports MQTT messages.\nFigure 8. Experiment 2: implementation of Fog\
    \ tier components.\nIn order to validate the effectiveness of the rules implemented\
    \ in Apache Flink in\ncontrolling irrigation, we programmed the sensors to send\
    \ the matric potential values\nevery minute to the Fog tier. Upon detecting event\
    \ 9 or 10, the irrigation was turned on. We\nused the value of 20 kPa as a reference\
    \ for the ideal value of matric potential as a trigger to\nturn off the irrigation.\
    \ We obtained this information from experts in the agricultural area.\n5. Results\n\
    5.1. Experiment I: Results and Discussion\nThis section presents the results of\
    \ the performance evaluation experiment concerning\nthe following metrics: false\
    \ positives, false negatives, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score,\nand data\
    \ trafﬁc. We use three scenarios as described below.\n5.1.1. Scenario A: 25 Sensor\
    \ Nodes, 5 Fog Nodes\nFrom the simulation of scenario A, we generate the confusion\
    \ matrix, presented in\nTable 4. The matrix presents the results regarding VP,\
    \ FP, FN, and VN from the comparison\nof the raw soil moisture data (generated\
    \ in the sensors) to the ﬁnal information provided\nby our fusion proposal. In\
    \ total, during the simulations performed, soil moisture sensors\ngenerate 360\
    \ readings.\nTable 4. Confusion matrix—soil moisture.\nAcceptable Moisture\nDry\

    \ from the 540 temperature data orig-\ninated in the sensor nodes. Similar to\
    \ the soil moisture data, we compared the raw\ntemperature data to the information\
    \ generated after applying the techniques. Based on the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n\
    16 of 22\nvalues found in the confusion matrices (Tables 4 and 5), the other metrics\
    \ were calculated\nand shown in Table 6.\nTable 5. Confusion matrix—temperature.\n\
    Normal Temperature\nHigh Temperature\nNormal Temperature\n429\n0\nTrue Positive\n\

    0.994\nPrecision\n1\n1\nRecall\n1\n0.993\nF1-Score\n1\n0.993\nAccording to the\
    \ results, our CEP approach presented 100% accuracy in the soil mois-\nture data\
    \ and approximately 99% in the temperature data. Accuracy provides information\n\
    about how much the false positive inﬂuences the information generated: the percentage\n\
    of correctness when the soil has a moisture and temperature considered adequate\
    \ for the\nplant, thus preventing the plant from being without its proper irrigation\
    \ and reducing its\nproductivity. Thus, the CEP approach presented a precision\
    \ of 100% for the two observed\ndata sets. Recall informs how the false-negative\
    \ has affected the results obtained. In our\nscenario, the recall informs the\
    \ amount of correctness regarding the need to use water.\nThe approach presented\
    \ a recall above 99% for the observed data, which prevents the plant\nfrom being\
    \ unnecessarily irrigated, thus saving water. The F1-Score is a harmonic mean\n\
    that veriﬁes the disparity between precision and recall, supplying greater credibility\
    \ to\nthe observed values. This metric checks whether the accuracy or recall is\
    \ well below the\nexpected value. The CEP approach obtained an F1-score of 99%,\
    \ thus showing that in all\naspects, our CEP approach provided very coherent information\
    \ when compared to the raw\nvalues generated by the sensors.\nFigure 9 shows the\
    \ data trafﬁc with and without the Fog tier and the processing\nof complex events.\
    \ It can be seen that the trafﬁc data decreases with the complex data\nprocessing\
    \ in the Fog tier.\nFigure 9. Data trafﬁc—scenario A.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n\
    17 of 22\nIn the subsequent scenarios, the scalability of the CEP approach is\
    \ checked for scenar-\nios with a higher density of nodes.\n5.1.2. Scenario B:\
    \ 50 Sensor Nodes, 10 Fog Nodes\nIn scenario B, 1800 raw data were generated,\
    \ with 900 for soil moisture and 900 for\ntemperature. The confusion matrices\
    \ presented in Tables 7 and 8 were obtained from\ncomparing the raw data with\
    \ the ﬁnal information generated using the proposed approach.\nTable 7. Confusion\
    \ matrix—soil moisture.\nAcceptable Soil Moisture\nDry Soil\nAcceptable Soil Moisture\n\

    \ 9, all parameters remain above 99% when the\nnetwork has an average density\
    \ of nodes. Thus, we can say that the CEP approach remains\nreliable when applied\
    \ to a network with average node density.\nTable 9. Evaluation metrics—scenario\

    \ Nodes\nThe experiment in scenario C veriﬁes the approach’s behavior in a network\
    \ with a\nmore signiﬁcant number of nodes. Thus, to validate the scalability of\
    \ the proposal, 3600 raw\ndata were generated: 1800 soil moisture and 1800 temperatures.\
    \ The confusion matrix\n(Table 10) was obtained by collecting the soil moisture\
    \ on the ﬁeld using the proposed\napproach. The matrix (Table 11) shows the true\
    \ and false positives and negatives of the\nmeasured temperature collected on\
    \ the ﬁeld using CEP and fusion techniques.\nTable 10. Confusion matrix—soil moisture.\n\

    \ we calculated the\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. As shown in Table\
    \ 12, all parameters remain above\n99% when the network has a high node density.\
    \ Thus, we can conclude that the approach\nremains reliable when applied to a\
    \ network with high node density.\nTable 12. Evaluation metrics—scenario C.\n\

    Observing the data trafﬁc in the simulated scenario (Figure 11), it is possible\
    \ to verify\nan average reduction of 82% when compared the use of CEP and fusion\
    \ techniques to the\nﬂow of the network without the use of the techniques.\nFigure\
    \ 11. Data trafﬁc—scenario C.\nAnother metric to be analyzed is the average time\
    \ to send a message to its ﬁnal\ndestination. By processing data obtained by the\
    \ fusion and the processing of events, some\ndata that would be initially sent\
    \ to the Cloud are treated and resolved in the previous tiers.\nOur results (Figure\
    \ 12) show that the average message sending time is 77% shorter when\nprocessing\
    \ is performed in the Fog tier without sending all data to the Cloud.\nFigure\
    \ 12. Average message sending time in the 3 scenarios.\n5.2. Experiment 2: Results\
    \ and Discussion\nFigure 13 shows the behavior of the matric potential values\
    \ during approximately\nsixty minutes of simulation. According to Figure 13, we\
    \ can conclude that the objective of\ncontrol in a simulated environment was achieved\
    \ since the value of the matric potential\nremained within the deﬁned limits.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 7226\n20 of 22\nFigure 13. Matric potential (soil moisture)\
    \ control.\nThe second part of the experiment evaluated the response time of the\
    \ irrigation\nactivation in the actuator node by identifying the event in the\
    \ CEP engine. The response\ntime of thirty events was analyzed. Figure 14 shows\
    \ the test results. The average response\ntime obtained was approximately 7.15\
    \ ms on a local network.\nFigure 14. Actuator response time.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    We presented a multi-tier hierarchical CEP approach in Fog focused on the smart\n\
    agriculture domain. Our approach is geolocation and context-aware, in which the\
    \ new\nsensor nodes in a network connect to a Fog node based on the data type\
    \ and the Euclidean\ndistance between them. To evaluate the proposal, we performed\
    \ simulations in different\nscenarios with different network densities and conﬁgurations.\
    \ The experiments achieved\npromising results, such as accuracy, precision, recall,\
    \ and F1-Score which were consistently\nabove 99%. Thus, we can claim that the\
    \ information obtained using the proposed approach\nis reliable and consistent\
    \ with the reality of the monitored environment. In order to\nvalidate the effectiveness\
    \ of the CEP engine (rules and events), we conducted tests using\nan irrigation\
    \ scenario and it was successfully completed.\nOur results show that the objective\
    \ of control in a simulated environment was achieved\nsince the value of the matric\
    \ potential remains within the deﬁned limits. The second part\nof the experiment\
    \ evaluated the response time of the irrigation activation in the actuator\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 7226\n21 of 22\nnode by identifying the event in the CEP engine. The\
    \ average response time obtained was\napproximately 7.15 milliseconds on a local\
    \ network, showing that the CEP engine meets\nthe application’s needs.\nIn future\
    \ work, we intend to investigate the self-conﬁguration of the nodes regard-\n\
    ing the best characteristics to be considered for the choice of the Fog node,\
    \ such as the\nprocessing power. Another point to be explored in future work is\
    \ the use of the data stream-\noriented CEP mechanism, which is similar to SQL,\
    \ instead of rule-oriented modeling.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ Chergui1 and Mohand Tahar Kechadi1,2* \nAbstract \nRecent advances in Information\
    \ and Communication Technologies have a signifi-\ncant impact on all sectors of\
    \ the economy worldwide. Digital Agriculture appeared \nas a consequence of the\
    \ democratisation of digital devices and advances in artificial \nintelligence\
    \ and data science. Digital agriculture created new processes for making \nfarming\
    \ more productive and efficient while respecting the environment. Recent and \n\
    sophisticated digital devices and data science allowed the collection and analysis\
    \ of \nvast amounts of agricultural datasets to help farmers, agronomists, and\
    \ professionals \nunderstand better farming tasks and make better decisions. In\
    \ this paper, we present \na systematic review of the application of data mining\
    \ techniques to digital agriculture. \nWe introduce the crop yield management\
    \ process and its components while limiting \nthis study to crop yield and monitoring.\
    \ After identifying the main categories of data \nmining techniques for crop yield\
    \ monitoring, we discuss a panoply of existing works \non the use of data analytics.\
    \ This is followed by a general analysis and discussion on the \nimpact of big\
    \ data on agriculture.\nKeywords: Digital agriculture, Data analytics, Crop management,\
    \ Big data, Data \nmining, Machine learning\nIntroduction\nDA, (also called digital\
    \ farming or smart farming)1 [78, 105, 130], is a modern approach \nthat uses\
    \ digital and smart devices [sensors, cameras, satellite, drones, the Global Posi-\n\
    tioning System (GPS)] in conjunction with Data Mining (or data analytics) to improve\
    \ \nproductivity and to optimise the use of resources. Digital Agriculture (DA)\
    \ comes as a \nresponse to the increasing demand for improving productivity while\
    \ reducing farming \noperational costs. Moreover, the improvement of productivity\
    \ should not be done at \nany cost, e.g., overuse of natural resources and chemical\
    \ products. DA can, for example, \nmanage crop growth by finding appropriate fertilisation\
    \ program for each farming field \nand can help farmers to reduce their operational\
    \ costs and respect the environment by \nrefining their farming operations based\
    \ on the needs of each part of the farming field.\nSince agriculture has a direct\
    \ and significant impact on the population and therefore \nits economic environment,\
    \ DA in its turn should be viewed as the next natural step to \n*Correspondence:\

    \ the environment, by taking \nadvantage of the recent technological advances\
    \ in digital devices, communications sys-\ntems, and artificial intelligence.\
    \ These allow us to construct multidimensional domains, \nwhere the farms and\
    \ farmers are their central subjects. Figure 1 shows the agriculture \necosystem\
    \ and its direct impact on other sectors of the economy.\nBesides, since DA involves\
    \ the development, adoption and iteration with digital tech-\nnologies [39], and\
    \ Artificial Intelligence (data analytics, ...), these developments and \ninteractions\
    \ should be well-defined (laws, regulations and policies) to guarantee rights\
    \ \nand benefits of all the involved actors (farmers, farm holders’, data owners’,\
    \ developers \nand analysts, technology vendors’,...) [70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146].\n\
    DA can be regarded as a data driven form of farming, in which decision-making\
    \ pro-\ncesses are based on explicit information derived from data collected through\
    \ various \nsources [148]. DA and Precision Agriculture (PA) seem to refer to\
    \ the same thing, how-\never, as stated in [148], DA involves the development\
    \ and adoption of modern technolo-\ngies in both collecting the data and its analysis\
    \ in various farming contexts, while PA \ntakes into account only the in-field\
    \ variability [147]. DA aims to exploit advanced digital \ndevices, ranging from\
    \ a simple sensor to complex robots, to offer the required farmland \ntreatment\
    \ with high accuracy. DA can be applied in almost all agricultural fields. For\
    \ \ninstance, in crop production: DA allows accurate management of crops, which\
    \ includes \nfields, wasteland, crop, pest, and irrigation management, soil classification,\
    \ etc. In Ani-\nmal production: DA allows monitoring the animal over its whole\
    \ life cycle, its food \nquantity, health control and protection from diseases,\
    \ and so on. Fishery, animal Hus-\nbandry, livestock and dairy farming are some\
    \ examples [14]. In Forestry: We can effi-\nciently manage forests by supporting\
    \ the environmental and sustainable decision [36]. \nDA can help in detecting\
    \ unhealthy trees, air pollution, discriminate different tree spe-\ncies, protect\
    \ the wildlife, etc. From the economy point of view, the application of DA for\
    \ \nforest management enhances the wood quality and its production, which can\
    \ augment \nprofits; reduce waste and maintain the environment [138].\nAddressing\
    \ DA from all the above mentioned views is a challenging task and cannot \nbe\
    \ achieved without the participation of specialists from all these sectors. In\
    \ this study, \nFig. 1 The interlocked sectors involved in DA\nPage 3 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nwe focus\
    \ on the use of Big Data in crop management, it is, not only one of the pillars\
    \ in \nagriculture but also it can profoundly affect biodiversity. Moreover, crop\
    \ growth is a very \ncomplex process involving various endogenous and exogenous\
    \ factors. Recent advances \nin digital technologies allow us to collect data\
    \ about all these factors. DA has the ability \nto elucidate the correlations\
    \ and interactions of these factor to help farmers and agrono-\nmists optimise\
    \ the productivity while reducing the side effects on the environment. DA \nexhibits\
    \ several benefits to agriculture as shown in Figure  2. These benefits were dis-\n\
    cussed in [10, 13, 70, 98, 104, 112, 113, 130, 135, 148] and summarised in the\
    \ following:\n• DA provides a farmer with useful information to support their\
    \ decision-making pro-\ncesses, such as soil and weather monitoring and prediction,\
    \ weed and pest monitor-\ning, crop yield dynamic predictions, etc.\n• DA can\
    \ sustain the environment and improve the products’ quality, since it provides\
    \ \nhigh quality information and measurements for optimal farming operations on\
    \ each \nfield.\n• DA can provide farmers advanced management methods against\
    \ climate change and \nother environmental challenges. The farmer can continuously\
    \ monitor crop growth \nand protect them against diseases.\n• DA offers valuable\
    \ feedback to farmers and good assessment of risks, to minimise \nmicrobiological\
    \ or disaster-related risks.\n• DA can provide prediction and assistance to farmers\
    \ against adverse weather inci-\ndence, disasters and market instability by assessing\
    \ the loss at the farm level.\n• Farmers/agronomists can benefit from advanced\
    \ models to understand the market \nand forecast which products could be more\
    \ profitable.\nThe contributions of this study are in the investigation of big\
    \ data analytics applications \nto crop production. Crop farming is a complex\
    \ task, and it depends on many factors that \nshould be taken into account. To\
    \ optimise the operational cost and reduce the impact \non the environment, the\
    \ big data analytics emerges as one of the most cost effective \napproaches nowadays.\
    \ The contributions, therefore, include the following:\nFig. 2 Role of DA in crop\

    \ quality.\n• A highlight of the different types of data used in the existing\

    \ of data analytics and big data on DA based on previous works, we \nconducted\
    \ a systematic review approach that consists of three steps: (1) collection of\
    \ \nrelated work, (2) selection of relevant work, and (3) examination and analysis\
    \ of the fil-\ntered related work.\nIn the first step, we performed keyword-based\
    \ research and We gathered a large \nnumber of studies from well-known and popular\
    \ online sources (Web of Science, Sco-\npus, IEEEXplore, ACM, etc.). We used a\
    \ combination of keywords from the two sets \n(Big data, data mining, data analytics,\
    \ machine learning, Internet Of Things, sensors) \nand (Digital agriculture, smart\
    \ farming, precision agriculture, agriculture, farming). We \ngathered more than\
    \ 327 articles. In the next steps, We selected a small number of arti-\ncles,\
    \ which are considered relevant for further analysis, based on their ideas, methods,\
    \ \ndata types and sources, addressed problems, proposed solutions, tools used\
    \ and quality \nof the results.\nThrough the literature analysis, the study aims\
    \ to find responses to the following \nresearch questions and discuss findings\
    \ in the following sections.\n• What is the process of DA for crop management?\n\
    • What are the various data types generated by farms and used in DA applications\
    \ for \ncrop management?\n• What role does big data analytics play in DA?\n• How\
    \ are big data analytics used for crop management?\n• What are the influences\
    \ of the farm’s scale on the application of DA?\n• How big is the data used in\
    \ the proposed DA solutions’?\n• What are the challenges facing the DA?\nPage\

    Related work\nDespite that DA and Big Data being relatively recent research fields,\
    \ their scientific lit-\nerature is rich and covers several concepts. As DA is\
    \ at the cross boundaries between \nagriculture and ICT, three major dimensions\
    \ have emerged as of a very high importance; \ntechnology, social economics and\
    \ ethics, and decision-making based on Machine Learn-\ning. The first dimension\
    \ focuses on the use of advanced technologies to improve prac-\ntices and productivity\
    \ [56, 124]. In Ref. [124], the authors studied the impact of sensor \nnetworks\
    \ in agriculture, including remote sensing technologies, wireless devices, and\
    \ \nother IoT devices. Ref. [56] reviewed some developments in remote sensing\
    \ within Big \nData processing and management in agriculture. The second dimension\
    \ concerns legal, \nethics, social and economic factors of DA, to provide insights\
    \ into the impact of digit-\nised information and its analysis on the farm management;\
    \ farmer identity, skills, pri-\nvacy, production, and value chains in food systems\
    \ [39, 70, 77, 78, 92, 113, 146, 148]. The \nthird dimension focuses on the application\
    \ of big data analysis and machine learning \n(ML), to optimise and forecast the\
    \ production and the use of resources. In this paper, we \nonly consider this\
    \ dimension.\nVarious studies have been conducted on the application of data analytics\
    \ to crop yield \nmanagement. For instance, [71] presented a systematic review\
    \ on crop yield prediction \nusing ML techniques, and extracted major ML algorithms,\
    \ features and evaluation met-\nrics used in those studies. Ref.[35] discussed\
    \ the yield estimation by integrating agrarian \nfactors in ML techniques. This\
    \ allowed them to show a strong relationship between crop \nyield and climatic\
    \ factors. Ref. [103] Provided a systematic review on the use of com-\nputer vision\
    \ and AI to enhance the grain quality of five crops (maize, rice, wheat, soy-\n\
    bean and barley), disease detection and phenotyping. Ref. [64] reviewed the application\

    \ 9:123 \nof big data analysis in some fields of agriculture. It highlighted solutions\
    \ to some key \nwell-known problems, used tools and algorithms, along with input\
    \ datasets. The authors \nconcluded that big data analytics in agriculture is\
    \ still at its early stage, and many bar-\nriers need to be overcome, despite\
    \ the availability of the data and tools to analyse it. To \nmeasure the level\
    \ of usage of big data in DA, the authors defined big data metrics (low, \nmedium,\
    \ high) for each of its dimensions (volume, velocity, and variety). However, while\
    \ \nit is a very simple model, it is not easy to specify thresholds, as some dimensions,\
    \ such \nas volume and velocity depend on technological advances. Ref. [12] presented\
    \ a review \non the use of ML methods to detect biotic stress in crop protection.\
    \ The authors ana-\nlysed the potential of these techniques and their suitability\
    \ to deal with crop protection \nfrom weeds, diseases and insects. In addition,\
    \ they provided very good instructive exam-\nples from different fields of DA.\
    \ An earlier similar study was presented in [89], where \nthe authors studied\
    \ four very popular learning approaches; Artificial Neural Network \n(ANN), Support\
    \ Vector Machine (SVM), K-means, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). \nRef. [25] presented\
    \ a survey on data mining clustering methods applied to food and agri-\ncultural\
    \ domains. It first described major techniques of unsupervised classification,\
    \ then \nit examined some existing techniques applied to agriculture products;\
    \ like fruit clas-\nsification, wine classification, analysis of remote sensing\
    \ in forest images and machine \nvision.\nThis study is not just an update of\
    \ previous surveys. The main objective is to examine \nthe effectiveness of big\
    \ data analytics in crop yield monitoring and discuss the challenges \nof such\
    \ paradigm shift in the agriculture domain. Moreover, It is important to under-\n\
    stand the sources of datasets, their types, and which ML techniques are more suitable\
    \ to \nanalyse them.\nDA: it’s all about data\nDigital Agriculture (DA) relies\
    \ heavily on the data sources and techniques used to col-\nlect it. This data\
    \ is then organised in agricultural data warehouses and analysed [93]. The \n\
    results of this data analysis provide significant insights to farmers and agronomists\
    \ about \nhow to improve the production, minimise the farming operational costs,\
    \ manage risks, \nand protect the environment. The process of deploying DA is\
    \ derived from data science.\nDigital agriculture process\nFigure  4, adopted\
    \ from the knowledge pyramid DIKW, shows a data-driven process, \nwhich is at\
    \ the heart of DA. This usually shows how data from past experiences and \nmodels\
    \ serve as input to techniques of mining and analysis to help in future decisions\
    \ \nand acting accordingly. The newly collected data will be used to further refine\
    \ the pro-\ncess and adapt it to an ever-evolving agricultural world.\nThis is\
    \ a data-driven methodology derived from the overall knowledge discovery pro-\n\
    cess. The first phase, data collection, is crucial to the validity of the whole\
    \ analysis. One \nneeds to carefully identify the type of data that should be\
    \ collected and the approach \nof gathering it and maintain it through its whole\
    \ life cycle. This is even more complex \nin DA, as the data is issued from various\
    \ and heterogeneous sources, and contains a \nnumber of factors of uncertainties.\
    \ The second phase, data representation and analysis, \nis very sophisticated,\
    \ as there is no common standards in the way the data should be \nPage 7 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nintegrated,\
    \ consolidated, to derive a unified representation that is suitable for its analy-\n\
    sis, and in the choice of the analysis techniques. Finally, the decision-making\
    \ is a labori-\nous task, where the extracted knowledge will be associated to\
    \ the expertise of farmers \nand agronomists, farming constraints and regulations\
    \ to derive new management pro-\ncesses with the view to improve productivity\
    \ and quality of products, reduce and their \nimpact on the environment. Figure\
    \  5 depicts a diagram presenting the DA process for \ncrop yield monitoring,\
    \ as explained below.\n• Data collection and preparation It is important to identify\
    \ the data types and attrib-\nutes based on the problem at hand (e.g., crop management),\
    \ and the level of granu-\nlarity of the data. The required data sources should\
    \ also be identified and assessed for \ntheir data quality. As mentioned above,\
    \ the data is then prepared for analysis. This \nincludes data integration, representation,\
    \ selection, transformation, etc.\nFig. 4 DA– a data-driven process\nFig. 5 Big\
    \ Data Analytics system architecture for crop yield monitoring\nPage 8 of 37\n\
    Chergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n• Data analysis\
    \ the complex nature of the agricultural data requires an elaborative \nanalysis\
    \ approach, ranging from methods of feature selection or extraction to various\
    \ \nlearning algorithms to discover models, patterns (or knowledge in general\
    \ term) for \ndata analysis. These will be evaluated against the expected quality\
    \ of results and their \nsuitability to a decision-making process.\n• Decision-making\
    \ The main goal of the DA process is the decision-making. Any deci-\nsion should\
    \ follow the state-of-the-art practice, be justifiable and scientifically sound.\n\
    Digital agriculture data\nIn agriculture, Very large amounts of data can be collected\
    \ from various sources. These \ninclude sensors, weather stations, satellite imagery,\
    \ drone imagery, and many other \ninstruments. The datasets include weather data,\
    \ farm records, environmental condi-\ntions, soil parameters (nutrients, texture,\
    \ moisture, and so on. The data is usually rich, \nlarge, very complex, and heterogeneous.\
    \ Therefore, its analysis is not straightforward.\nThe heterogeneity is not only\
    \ expressed by the data types and formats, but it can be \ncollected using different\
    \ equipment of different quality. In addition, historical data may \nbe described\
    \ with different sets of attributes compared to very recent data. This can pre-\n\
    sent inconsistencies in naming conventions and measures when the data is collected\
    \ \nfrom different locations and times. Moreover, the data can be static and historical,\
    \ which \nis considered as offline data, and can be online weather data collected\
    \ at regular intervals \n(streams of data values), such as weather data (e.g.,\
    \ every 15 minutes), satellite imagery, \nwhich is characterised of being spatio-temporal,\
    \ such as Geo-spatial data, Moderate-\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ images, etc.\nAs mentioned earlier, the data collection is not well tackled\
    \ in the literature. Most \nof the studies assume that the data is known already,\
    \ and the experimental setup was \nalready in place. Therefore, more effort is\
    \ allocated to the data analysis and interpreta-\ntion rather than on the complete\
    \ environmental parameters and conditions. In the fol-\nlowing sections, we discuss\
    \ the data analysis process. This discussion is structured based \non the main\
    \ categories of the data analysis; classification, and clustering [24]. Note that,\
    \ \nfor high quality results, the data needs to be pre-processed, as discussed\
    \ in the previous \nsection. The pre-processing includes cleaning (dealing with\
    \ missing values, redundant \ndata, noise and outliers), data transformation,\
    \ dimensionality or data reduction, and so \non.\nClassification for crop monitoring\n\
    Big Data analytics system architecture is depicted in Fig.  5. While this system\
    \ is tar-\ngeted specifically to crop yield management, it can be adapted to any\
    \ data-driven appli-\ncation. This architecture implements faithfully what we\
    \ have highlighted in the previous \nsections. In this section, we will focus\
    \ on the data analysis layer of the architecture, \nmoreover, we will pay attention\
    \ to the data types and their sources, techniques of data \nacquisition, the learning\
    \ algorithms. The main objective of the crop management data \nanalysis is to\
    \ get some insights about the crop monitoring problems and show the poten-\ntial\
    \ of DA through big data analytics, also called data mining. Data mining and its\
    \ tech-\nniques are involved in several roles in crop production. Farmers may\
    \ want to know the \nPage 9 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \
    \         (2022) 9:123 \n \nfuture yield of their crop, specific areas of their\
    \ farms suffer from the spread of weeds \nor under-nutrition. Researchers can\
    \ look for information such as plant growth patterns, \noptimum growing conditions,\
    \ best pest and disease control environment and so on. Data \nmining offers panoply\
    \ of sophisticated techniques required to meet all of these needs.\nThere are\
    \ two major categories of data analysis: Classification and Clustering. In the\
    \ \nwork of [24], authors studied applications of data mining techniques in crop\
    \ manage-\nment and proposed a classification of these applications. They found\
    \ that the classifi-\ncation and clustering are the main used categories, where\
    \ the classification includes \nprediction, detection, protection, and categorisation).\
    \ The choice between classification \nor clustering analysis is very simple. If\
    \ the models or classes we are looking for were \nknown in advance and we have\
    \ an annotated data to support the training of the learn-\ning algorithms, then\
    \ classification is the right choice. However, the annotated data is not \nalways\
    \ available and easy to generate, and in many cases we do not know even which\
    \ \nmodels or patterns we are looking for. In these situations, clustering analysis\
    \ is the right \nalternative.\nIn this section, we focus on the studies that use\
    \ classification methods for their data \nanalysis. Clustering analysis will be\
    \ covered in the next section. We structure these clas-\nsification studies based\
    \ on the application objectives or targets which arecategorisation, \nprediction,\
    \ detection, and protection.\nCategorisation\nWhile the classification main objective\
    \ is to assign a given object into one of the pre-\ndetermined classes, in the\
    \ agricultural world, the use of classification process may vary \ndepending on\
    \ the stakeholders interests. In this study, we report four different applica-\n\
    tions (or targets) which are widely used in agriculture categorisation, prediction,\
    \ detec-\ntion, and protection.\nCategorisation aims at defining the classes (or\
    \ class labels) based on the simple recog-\nnition of similarities that exist\
    \ across a set of entities. For example, categorisation can \nbe used to classify\
    \ small fruit from fruit with normal to big size, to make an estima-\ntion of\
    \ yields; which may have an economic impact if the farmer wants to make different\
    \ \npackages or prices for each type of fruit separately. It can also be used\
    \ to classify dam-\naged crops from good ones in order to estimate losses, or\
    \ to prepare for the harvest and \nmarketing. Categorisation can also be applied\
    \ for crop mapping (e.g., poor, average, high \nyield), which aims to provide\
    \ information on farmed fields given a specific type of crops, \nor to identify\
    \ a type of crops that are more suitable for a particular field. Based on the\
    \ \ninput data, categorisation can help improve the farming operations based on\
    \ the mean-\ningful categories (classes) predefined in advance.\nProducing accurate\
    \ crop maps is essential for effective agricultural monitoring [131]. \nCategorisation\
    \ approaches can be applied to study regional crop distribution within or \npost\
    \ growing season. For this purpose, it can offer:\n• A good understanding of how\
    \ crops are distributed at early stage of their develop-\nment; allowing for an\
    \ opportune decision making and management, as well as \nadjusting crop planting\
    \ structure, is crucial. Besides, the timely available of (spatial \nPage 10 of\
    \ 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nor maps)\
    \ distribution of crop types is required for statistical and economic purposes\
    \ \n[131].\n• The availability of crops maps is critical for the diverse agricultural\
    \ monitoring activi-\nties, such as crop acreage estimation, yield modelling,\
    \ harvest operation schedules \n[131, 144], etc.\nMoreover, categorisation has\
    \ been applied for agricultural field mapping [31], to quan-\ntify the cropping\
    \ intensity for small-scale farms [58], to identify and map crops and to \nretrieve\
    \ the area of major cultivation [100] and to classify land-cover and crop [76].\
    \ \nTable  1 highlights the major fields, ideas and tools used for crops categorisation.\
    \ We can \nsee that data issued from satellites and remote sensing, and the features\
    \ with vegetation \nindices especially NDVI and EVI, the RGB colours, are the\
    \ most used.\nCrop yield prediction\nThe estimation of crop yield is crucial in\
    \ DA, as it enables efficient planning of resources. \nEconomically, an early\
    \ and accurate prediction of yields can help decision-makers to \nreact to the\
    \ crops market. Moreover, crop yield prediction permits the study of factors \n\
    that influence and affect the production, such as climate and weather, natural\
    \ soil fer-\ntility and its physical structure and topography, crop stress, the\
    \ incidence of pests and \ndiseases, etc.\nThe prediction of crop yields has been\
    \ the subject of many studies. Ref. [71] presented \na literature review on crop\
    \ forecasting, where the authors highlighted the most used \nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms along with the applied metrics and measures. In this sec-\ntion,\
    \ we examine the learning algorithms that have been used in crop yield prediction\
    \ \nfrom different views: data types, the pre-processing methods, and features\
    \ or the predic-\ntor variables used in each study. Tables  2 and  3 summarise\
    \ some relevant studies.\nThe crop yield forecasting approaches follow two major\
    \ types of sources of data. The \nfirst type is related to the sources that have\
    \ direct impact on the crops. These sources are \nsoil data, weather data, environmental\
    \ parameter data. These are usually used to predict \ncrop yield [27, 34, 42,\
    \ 46, 51, 73]. The second type of sources are the use of advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and tools like satellite multi/hyper spectral images, remote sensing and \n\
    sensors to collect the data [62, 83, 102, 114, 152]. Some advanced studies use\
    \ both types \nof data sources [1, 40, 54, 59, 65, 67, 68, 97, 120, 121].\nThe\
    \ forecasting models based on the first type of data sources provides a pre-season\
    \ \nestimation of the yield, even before the beginning of the crop season. This\
    \ allows farmers \nto decide which strategy to both optimise the farming operations\
    \ and crop production. \nThese decisions include choosing seeds and crop type,\
    \ type of fertiliser and its applica-\ntions. Moreover, This data can also be\
    \ used for some crop monitoring during the grow-\ning season.\nThe monitoring\
    \ systems based on the second type of data analysis - data imagery \nobtained\
    \ from satellite, cameras, scanner, sensors - allow for on-season estimation \n\
    (emergence, detect stress conditions of crop, harvest dates, ...). These models\
    \ are com-\nplex since they have to analyse the data that consists of both spatio-temporal\
    \ and non-\nspacial. While the spatial data is of high resolution, some images\
    \ can be of very poor \nPage 11 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data\

    \ as a major menace for food security in many regions of the \nworld since it\
    \ causes serious crops losses. While the detection of crop diseases correctly\
    \ \nand timely when they first appear is crucial in crop monitoring, this remains\
    \ a difficult \ntask. One of the solutions to deal with this issue is to use data\
    \ analytics approach. This \nwill reduce yield losses and prevent farmers to take\
    \ effective reactive actions. Forewarn-\ning can be seen as the outputs of data\
    \ mining process. Usually, this consists of examining \nthe features of a newly\
    \ presented case and assigning it to a predefined class.\nSeveral interesting\
    \ efforts have been developed to prevent crops losses due to dis-\neases, Tables\
    \  4 and 5 summarise some major studies. Ref. [7] presented an overview of \n\
    ML techniques for crop disease classification. In addition, it presented to a\
    \ case study \nwhere a deep learning algorithm was successfully used. Ref. [45]\
    \ provided a review on \nadvanced ANN techniques to process hyper-spectral data\
    \ for plant disease detection. \nRecently, deep learning approaches have been\
    \ emerged and widely used for plant dis-\nease detection and classification, with\
    \ a variety of network architectures (CNN, AlexNet, \ngoogLeNet, CaffeNet, DenseNet,\
    \ Inception, LeNet, VGGNet,...) and training methods \n(shallow, deep, from scratch)\
    \ [9, 16, 21, 28, 38, 63, 79, 82, 125, 139, 143, 150, 155]. More-\nover, [127]\
    \ presented an interesting study on the potential of the use of deep learning\
    \ for \nplant stress phenotyping.\nCrop protection, that consists of disease,\
    \ stress, and weed detection, aims to offer tools \nthat detect plants disease\
    \ caused by various biotic (pathogen, insect, pest, and weed) \nor abiotic (temperature\
    \ stress, nutrient deficiency, toxicity, herbicide) variables [126]. \nThe earlier\
    \ the stress, disease or their symptoms are detected, the greater the chance of\
    \ \nreducing the disease spread within a field. This has gained significant advantage\
    \ from the \nadvances in image collection and processing and their analysis using\
    \ ML algorithm. The \nstate-of-the-art is very rich. The large majority of studies\
    \ carried out so far were using \nimage processing, consequently image-based data\
    \ and classification techniques. These \nare capable of detecting disease at the\
    \ scale of leaf, canopy or field [126].\nDisease detection at a leaf level uses\
    \ images collected using digital cameras, which are \nstored in data warehouses.\
    \ For instance, PlantVillage database [6, 9, 21, 28, 63, 79, 88, \n106, 125, 129,\
    \ 150] is created for this purpose. The objective of this repository is to build\
    \ \nclassifiers with high accuracy. The basic classifiers can simply assign to\
    \ an unseen image \na label healthy or infected, while more elaborated classifiers\
    \ can identify the disease - in \nother words, classify unseen images to disease\
    \ classes. However, this approach has some \nlimitations. First, it depends on\
    \ the quality of the images, as when taken in natural envi-\nronment, these images\
    \ are subject to different degrees of light, shadow, dust and leaves \noverlapping\
    \ and requires sophisticated image processing, which is not an easy task. Sec-\n\
    ond, usually the datasets sizes are small, which affect the learning phase of\
    \ the classifiers \nPage 16 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data  \

    \ potential of some advanced learning algorithms such as deep \nlearning. Data\
    \ augmentation (rotation, light shade’s variation, colour inversion, transla-\n\
    tion and changes in intensity and so on) is one of the methods used to overcome\
    \ this \nproblem to artificially increase the number of images [6, 9, 21, 63,\
    \ 79, 129, 150], but it \ndoes not always work. Transfer learning is another solution\
    \ to scarce/small data-set, \nwhere the knowledge obtained from solving a task\
    \ in a given domain is transferred to \nthe target domain in which the dataset\
    \ is small [6, 11, 28]. The transfer learning can only \nbe efficient if the source\
    \ and target domains share some similarities in terms of diseases \nand their\
    \ symptoms, for example. Moreover, it is very challenging to transfer knowledge\
    \ \nfrom representations learned using RGB images to a target task using multi-spectral\
    \ \nimages from UAV or satellite [126].\nThird, this approach cannot detect more\
    \ than a single disease at a time, and the detec-\ntion of diseases if the symptoms\
    \ are manifested in another area than leaves. Plant can-\nopy based-image was\
    \ proposed as a solution to this problem. The idea is to collect data \nrelative\
    \ to disease in situations where single-leaf phenotypes alone would not provide\
    \ \nsufficient information. Such features include the size, the height, the structure,\
    \ and \nbranching of canopy [126]. The canopy-based detection uses UAV equipped\
    \ with (multi/ \nhyper) spectral cameras and sensors to collect the data [32,\
    \ 49, 80, 82, 136, 143, 153, \n155]. Then data needs to be processed to extract\
    \ features which are usually related to \nvegetation indices like NDVI and EVI\
    \ or colours like RGB and NIR. The benefit from \nUAV images comes with cost on\
    \ complexity of analysis since images taken by UAV are \nsusceptible to occlusion,\
    \ overlapping, and atmospheric effects. Also, UAV is not able \nto fly at higher\
    \ altitudes, which decreases the quality of the collected images. To cover \n\
    larger zones and fields, satellite-based remote sensing and images has been proposed\
    \ as \na very good alternative [15, 81, 109, 156]. However, the problem with satellite\
    \ remote \nsensing is the revisit time, which is 16 days on average, which makes\
    \ protection applica-\ntions difficult, and some diseases can spread rapidly in\
    \ fields before they are detected. \nMoreover, passive sensors cannot penetrate\
    \ clouds [149]. The integration of these data \nwith additional data sources like\
    \ field surveys, contextual information of field and crop \nrotation can improve\
    \ the accuracy [15, 81, 109].\nDetecting diseases only from one data source based\
    \ on digital images or sensor data is \nnot sufficient. Besides, variations in\
    \ symptoms may lead to false positives due to dynamic \nnature of plant changes\
    \ [126]. Consequently, the appearance-based identification of dis-\neases is not\
    \ reliable enough to accurately detect unhealthy plants, especially in the early\
    \ \ngrowth stages. The use of multi-data sources can improve the accuracy of the\
    \ detection. \nFor instance, the use of physiological features and morphological\
    \ characteristics (growth \nattributes, yield-related features, soil) [66], or\
    \ the employment of satellite-based images \nand canopy-based images [156], where\
    \ the disease can be identified at the plant canopy \nlevel and at the field level.\n\
    Crop maturity monitoring\nCrop maturity is a kind of crop yield prediction, but\
    \ it is based on image data. This tech-\nnique has been used in fruit detection,\
    \ like apples, tomatoes, oranges, etc, and provides \nan early estimation of yield.\
    \ It is also used for crop monitoring to provide information \nto farmers with\
    \ the view to plan their farming operations, adjust management practices \nPage\
    \ 21 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n\
    \ \nbefore harvesting, etc. Such intelligent systems for monitoring crop implement\
    \ the data \nmining process incorporating machine vision and image processing\
    \ methods among \nwith advanced learning algorithms, such as CNN, SVM and ANN.\
    \ Unlike crop yield \nprediction process described above, this process is based\
    \ on a single-data source; digital \nimages [5, 23, 52, 75, 108, 122] or sensor\
    \ based-images [117, 123, 153]. Table  6 summa-\nrises such techniques. The challenges\
    \ of these systems are more or less the same as those \nof systems for crop disease\
    \ detection and protection. For instance, images with differ-\nent illumination\
    \ and lighting angles, complex surroundings and backgrounds, noise, the \npresence\
    \ of clouds, etc.\nClustering for crop monitoring\nClustering techniques are not\
    \ widely employed in DA, few efforts have been deployed to \ninvestigate the potential\
    \ of these techniques for zones’ delineation within a field. There \nare several\
    \ reasons for splitting an agricultural field into zones. Some traditional reasons\
    \ \ninclude crop diversification within a field, crop-rotation, facilitating the\
    \ management \ntasks, and more recently we defined the zones based on yield maps.\
    \ This usually helps \nto improve the overall crop yield of the field, by managing\
    \ the zones more effectively. \nTherefore, delineation of Management zones (DMZ)\
    \ is a very important task for farming \noperations since determining zones of\
    \ low-or-high yields, and understanding the rea-\nsons behind low yields, can\
    \ help come up with specific solution for each zone with the \nview to increase\
    \ the yields. In addition, it has other economic benefits, because we can \ntarget\
    \ each zone with the right amount of fertilisers, water, and other nutrients.\n\
    According to [69], delineation of management zones is an effective way to manage\
    \ the \nvariability of soil within a field, such that each zone will receive specific\
    \ management. In \n[145], a management zone is defined as a subregion of a field\
    \ that has a relatively homo-\ngeneous combination of yield-limiting factors,\
    \ for which a single rate of a specific crop \ninput is appropriate to reach maximum\
    \ efficiency of farm inputs. In [53], it is defined as \na subregion of a field\
    \ that is relatively homogeneous with regard to soil attributes.\nDMZ is a complex\
    \ spatial problem, which is addressed in the literature from several \nperspectives.\
    \ This has attracted interest from many researchers [61, 85, 87, 110, 140]. A\
    \ \nliterature review has been presented in [90], where the authors discussed\
    \ the delineation \nof soil management zones from the variable-rate fertilisation\
    \ point of view. many other \nstudies presented the delineation based on various\
    \ criteria. Some techniques that have \nbeen used include topographic maps, direct\
    \ soil sampling, non-invasive soil sampling by \nelectrical conductivity equipment,\
    \ soil organic matter or organic estimated by remote \nsensing, and yield maps\
    \ built using data collected over several seasons/years [99].\nFigure  6 depicts\
    \ the general process of delineation of management zones designed \naccording\
    \ to methodologies followed by the majority of the literature.\nThe majority of\
    \ problems that are related to crop management imply the management \nof fields\
    \ and zones. Therefore, the collected data is usually characterised by geographic\
    \ \ncoordinates and time associated with each sample, which leads to the use of\
    \ data min-\ning techniques that are more suitable for spatial and temporal datasets.\
    \ It is well rec-\nognised that agricultural datasets are typically spatio-temporal,\
    \ as the data is always \nassociated with location and time. However, these datasets\
    \ contain a significant amount \nof noise, outliers, and even missing values.\

    \ noise, imprecisions, and even outliers in the data. Satellite imagery also faces\
    \ huge \nimprecision and noise (such as clouds, ...).\nBecause of the type of\
    \ the datasets, which is spatio-temporal, it is not surprising \nto notice that\
    \ the majority of the clustering algorithms used are of type partitional. \nK-means\
    \ and Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) are considered among the most popular clustering \ntechniques\
    \ and heavily used to cluster agricultural data [17, 18, 84, 134, 137, 142, 151,\
    \ \n154]. The FCM approach has an advantage over K-means, as it deals better with\
    \ impre-\ncision and noisy data. Moreover, other types of clustering algorithms\
    \ have also been \nproven to be efficient in DA, such as density-based and hierarchical-based\
    \ clustering \ntechniques applied to DMZ [48, 116].\nAs mentioned above, besides\
    \ its huge importance in crop management, delineation \nof management zone (DMZ)\
    \ has received much attention, as the data is now available \nnot only from traditional\
    \ sources but also from refined sources, including advanced data \npre-processing\
    \ techniques. In addition, the recently collected data integrates knowledge \n\
    of experts and farmers experiences on their fields, which improves significantly\
    \ the qual-\nity of the data [84, 141]. Advanced imaging enhancement techniques\
    \ improve further \nthe data quality, and they offer the ability to track the\
    \ development of crops and provide \na Geo-referenced data that can describe the\
    \ spatial and the temporal variability of soil \nand crops variables at high resolution,\
    \ covering large areas [17, 84, 101, 132, 133, 141, \n151].\nSystematic analysis\n\
    In the following we will explore the application of data analytics in DA and its\
    \ extension \nto big data, and illustrate the practical challenges that hinder\
    \ the full adoption of DA by \nfarmers.\nDA in (small /large) scale farming\n\
    Farming can be carried out on a small or large-scale fields depending on several\
    \ fac-\ntors like land size, capital, farmer skills, level of use of machinery\
    \ and technology, etc. \nAccording to FAO3 and Grain4, over 90% of all farms worldwide\
    \ are of small-scale hold-\ning on average 2.2 hectares (from 0.6 to 10 hectares),\
    \ except for Northern America \nwhere small farms have an average size of 67.7\
    \ hectares5. Small-scale farms represent \n25% of the world’s farmland today,\
    \ where 73.12% are located in developing countries.\nFig. 6 The delineation management\
    \ zones process\n3 http:// faost at3. fao. org/ faost at- gatew ay/ go/ to/ home/.\n\

    \ in Nebraska, which defines a small farm in the US as one \nwith an annual turnover\
    \ of less than US$50,000)\nPage 24 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big\
    \ Data           (2022) 9:123 \nIn [10] the authors described three categories\
    \ of smart farming technology, which are \ncomplementary:\n• Data acquisition\
    \ technologies: they are used to acquire the data that is related to the \nfarm.\
    \ These include remote sensing, weather data, etc.;\n• Data analysis and evaluation\
    \ technologies: these technologies usually take as input \nthe data that has been\
    \ collected so far and deliver insight to the farmer. These include \ncomputer-based\
    \ visualisation and decision models, farm management and informa-\ntion systems;\n\
    • Precision application technologies: these are focusing on variable-rate application\
    \ \nand guidance technologies.\nThe application of smart technologies and data\
    \ analytics for crop management are not \nrestricted to one kind of farm. Nowadays,\
    \ every farm should adopt smart technologies, \nas they are needed for variable\
    \ rates applications (irrigation, pesticides, fertilisers) [72, \n102, 154] while\
    \ protecting the environment.\nThe size of the farm determines how these technologies\
    \ will be used. Large farms tend \nto develop their smart technology to monitor\
    \ their farming land, or to afford some of the \nexisting sophisticated systems\
    \ like CropX as they hold the scale and margins. While small \nfarms tend to rent\
    \ sophisticated machinery and smart applications on demand, especially \nwith\
    \ the proliferation of cloud technologies that makes these smart applications\
    \ reason-\nable, the work of [30] is an example among others, of a smart irrigation\
    \ system designed \nfor smallholders. Besides, some technologies are more suitable\
    \ for large-scale farms like \ndrones and aerial vehicles used to monitor crops\
    \ which are not as profitable or efficient \nfor small scales because they have\
    \ less difficulty visualising their crops. On the other side, \nlarge-scale farms\
    \ are responsible for 70% of current deforestation6, the largest share of \nagriculture-related\
    \ greenhouse-gazes emissions, agricultural water use and habitat disrup-\ntion\
    \ resulting in biodiversity loss. Generally, small-scale farms require considerably\
    \ fewer \nexternal inputs and cause minor damage to the environment.\nTable  7\
    \ summarises the main differences between small and large-scale farming from \n\
    several perspectives. However, DA can be applied to any kind of farm without restric-\n\
    tion. Yet, we have found that the number of papers that addressed large-scale\
    \ farms is \nalmost the same as works on large-scale farms.\nTechnologies for\
    \ data acquisition Table  7 can be used to all types of farms, such as \nremote\
    \ sensing, imagery data systems, and so on. The acquired data, over the years,\
    \ can \nlead to the phenomenon of Big Data. If pre-processed and stored properly,\
    \ this will give \na significant competitive advantage to farms that collected\
    \ them, whether they are small \nor large. Some of the applications and data analyses\
    \ that can be performed of the col-\nlected are summarised in the Tables  1,  2,\
    \  3, 4 and  5,  6.\nDA and big data\nBig data is not just characterised by the\

    \ techniques to deal with large volumes of data (volume), various types of data\
    \ \nattributes (variety or heterogeneity), and be able to analyse the new data\
    \ as soon as it \nis collected (velocity) are extremely challenging tasks. Moreover,\
    \ many other character-\nistics can be found in some big data-driven applications,\
    \ these include veracity, value, \nviscosity, veracity, visualisation, etc. In\
    \ this study, we added veracity, as the data, col-\nlected by various instruments\
    \ and sensors, is of different quality, which creates a huge \nchallenge to the\
    \ data pre-processing task, and therefore its analysis. In the following, we \n\
    discuss the impact of Big Data challenges on DA.\n• Velocity: many studies that\
    \ have been examined do not consider the data velocity \nduring their data collection.\
    \ In DA, the frequency of collecting data depends on its \nsource and the problem\
    \ for which the data was collected. Some applications need \nreal-time data and\
    \ others do not. For instance, crop yield prediction does not need \nreal-time\
    \ data or data streams. It is performed at ad-hoc, while crop protection and \n\
    disease detection require high quality sensors and imagery data connected to effi-\n\
    cient methods of data analysis, which need continuous control.\n• Variety: this\
    \ is very common in agricultural datasets, as multiple sources were used \nto\
    \ collect all the necessary information about the farm and farming operations.\
    \ The \ndata values can be a simple number such as temperatures to more elaborated\
    \ such as \nimagery data, NDVI, soil texture, etc. This makes the definition of\
    \ distance measures \nand other parameters of the learning algorithms very difficult.\n\
    • Veracity: Agricultural data contains many missing values and collected from\
    \ various \nsources of varying quality. The data is very noisy, and more importantly\
    \ it contains \nmany missing values. Therefore, it is very challenging to clean\
    \ and prepare it for the \nanalysis. This was the case in the work conducted by\
    \ [37], and also in [93–96, 107] \nwhere data was collected from very large farming\
    \ areas.\nTable  8, summarises a set of representative papers reported in the\
    \ paper according to \ntheir usage of big data. For each paper, we identify the\
    \ type, the size, the heterogeneity \nof data used, and the frequency of its collection.\
    \ Also, we consider the number and type \nof ML algorithms used, the complexity\
    \ of the proposed analysis algorithms and devices \nused to collect data, data\
    \ analysis applied to a given crop and problem to solve. One \ncan notice while\
    \ the data analysis algorithms and techniques were heavily used and var-\nied,\
    \ the rigorous process of knowledge discovery was not followed, usually the data\
    \ is \nrelatively small either in size (small observations) or the data has few\
    \ dimensions (for \ninstance, considering only weather data, or fertiliser, without\
    \ taking into account other \nfactors).\nFrom Table  8, we can extract three classes\
    \ of applications according to their usage of \nbig data: Full usage (the data\
    \ contains all the characteristics of big data), light usage (the \ndata contains\
    \ some characteristics), non-usage (the data does not contain any character-\n\
    istic of big data).\nTo examine the degree of use of the big data concept and\
    \ to figure out which of its \ndimension is more present, we conducted a statistical\
    \ study where we classify works \naccording to their employment of the 4Vs of\
    \ big data.\nPage 27 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data         \

    \  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \n \nFigures  7 and  8 show that\
    \ no work has a full employment of big data (4Vs). One can \nnotice that the agricultural\
    \ data is multidimensional and heterogeneous (variety). More-\nover, we have found\
    \ that the prediction applications display more use of big data, there \nexist\
    \ studies that have used three dimensions such as DMZ applications. It is worth\
    \ not-\ning that these applications, either prediction or delineation of zones,\
    \ have the potential \nto use big data to provide stable and accurate results.\n\
    If we put aside the volume dimension (V1) (see Figure  7, only 7% of the reviewed\
    \ \nstudies used (V2, V3 and V4), and 32% of studies just employed data mining\
    \ techniques \nfor agriculture problems. The most employed data mining techniques\
    \ are for prediction, \nincluding yield prediction, forecasting, prediction of\
    \ fertiliser applications, etc.\nDA practical challenges\nThere exist a number\
    \ of challenges and obstacles impeding the potential benefit of DA. \nIn [104],\
    \ the authors studied the barriers that prevent the adoption of smart farming\
    \ \nin their country, Brazil. Some of these barriers include lack of integration\
    \ and compat-\nibility between different agriculture systems, lack of advanced\
    \ data manipulation of data \nobtained from different equipment, poor telecommunications\
    \ infrastructure on rural \nareas, and finally, the lack of training in deploying\
    \ and using new technologies. These \nbarriers are common to the majority of countries\
    \ in the world.\nFig. 7 Distribution of works according to the used Big Data dimensions’\n\
    Fig. 8 Percent of employment of big data dimensions\nPage 30 of 37\nChergui and\
    \ Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022) 9:123 \nFrom the Table  7, we\
    \ can see that over 73% of crop farms are located in developing \ncountries. So\
    \ that, the investment in high and sophisticated DA technologies is not \nthere.\
    \ Most of the main technologies used in DA systems (GPS, UAV, auto-steering and\
    \ \nvariable rate technology) are designed for relatively large-scale farms located\
    \ in devel-\noped countries [10] or designed by developed countries. Some of these\
    \ technologies are \nbecoming available recently. For instance, since 2018 African\
    \ scientists can have access \nto free and open-source satellite data as a result\
    \ of a deal signed by the African Union \nwith the European Commission’s Copernicus\
    \ programme.\nAs DA is relatively new technology, there is a lack of standards\
    \ and common solutions \nfor data collection, preparation and storage. In addition,\
    \ there is a lack of data for many \nreasons, farmers did not record their data\
    \ and it takes time to build significant historical \ndatasets [20, 39, 77, 78,\
    \ 92, 146]. Another major barrier is that many farmers are relying \nmore on their\
    \ expertise and refusing to adopt these new and complex technologies [10]. \n\
    Moreover, the transition from their traditional practices and farming habits to\
    \ these \ntechnologies comes with a cost and energy (training and learning new\
    \ skills).\n[20] States that the legal and regulatory frameworks around the collection,\
    \ sharing and \nuse of agricultural data contributes to a range of challenges.\
    \ Many laws potentially influ-\nence the ownership, control of and data access.\
    \ Ref. [74] presented a set of socio-ethical \nimperatives associated with the\
    \ use of data in agriculture, including dependency risks, \ndata concentration,\
    \ potential lock-in effects, and the peril of transformation of farmers \ninto\
    \ information tools, in addition to the sustainability challenges.\nFinally, according\
    \ to [47], the real economic value of the use of big data in farming is \nstill\
    \ unknown, especially for small-scale farming. Consequently, it will be hard to\
    \ con-\nvince them to switch from process-driven towards data and machine learning\
    \ driven. \nThis is reaffirmed in [20], where the authors stated that on one side,\
    \ farmers are enticed \nwith promises of increased profits and farming efficiency,\
    \ on the other hand the proofs \nare not there yet.\nConclusion\nDigital agriculture\
    \ (DA) is a data-driven approach that exploits the hidden information \nwithin\
    \ the collected data to gain new insights; transforming the farming practices\
    \ from \nintuitive-based decision-making to informed-based decision-making. DA\
    \ relies on effi-\ncient data collection practices, efficient data preparation\
    \ and storage techniques, effi-\ncient data analytics, and efficient deployment\
    \ and exploitation of the gained insights to \nmake optimal farming decisions.\n\
    In this study, we presented a systematic review of the potential use of the data\
    \ mining \nprocess in crop production and management and highlighted serious gaps\
    \ which can be \nconsidered in future studies. The majority of the current practices\
    \ were dominated by \nstatistical analyses and small machine learning systems.\
    \ However, these can only give \nsome ideas within a very limited view of the\
    \ overall system. Agricultural data-driven \napplications collect a significant\
    \ amount of data from various sources. This constitutes \nan excellent opportunity\
    \ to the field to answer numerous research and practical ques-\ntions that were\
    \ not possible before. Nevertheless, despite all the advantages that can \nbe\
    \ gained from DA, there are several other challenges and obstacles that need to\
    \ be \nPage 31 of 37\nChergui and Kechadi  Journal of Big Data           (2022)\
    \ 9:123 \n \naddressed, among them lack of data, lack of skills, and lack of maturity\
    \ and standards so \nthat it can be adopted and deployed quickly and easily.\n\
    In this study, we cover approaches that deal the entire process of data mining;\
    \ from \ndata collection to knowledge deployment. We cover this process from big\
    \ data view, \nwith more focus on crop monitoring and management in an attempt\
    \ to understand the \nchallenges that DA is currently facing. We defined the research\
    \ questions addressed by \nthe study and provided a classification of data mining\
    \ techniques used in the field. For \neach class, a set of representative existing\
    \ works have been reviewed, and an analytical \nstudy has been provided to highlight\
    \ the category of machine learning method applied \nand for which purpose. We\
    \ discussed the big data concepts and its current impact on \nDA, and showed that\
    \ from the data analyst’s view, the transition towards DA is ready \nto embrace\
    \ big data analytics concepts. This provides new opportunities of investment \n\
    into these challenges and allows for a efficient ways of managing crops. Besides,\
    \ it will \nprovide farmers with new insights into how they can grow crops more\
    \ efficiently, while \nminimising the impact on the environment. It also promises\
    \ new levels of scientific dis-\ncovery and innovative solutions to more complex\
    \ problems.\nAbbreviations\nANN \n Artificial Neural Network\nBC \n Bayesian classifier\n\

    \ more unreliable, variable and expensive, \nthe water-related implications of\
    \ sustainable agriculture practices such \nas cover cropping are drawing increasing\
    \ attention from California’s \nagricultural communities. However, the adoption\
    \ of winter cover \ncropping remains limited among specialty crop growers who\
    \ face \nuncertainty regarding the water use of this practice. To investigate\
    \ \nhow winter cover crops affect soil water and evapotranspiration on \nfarm\
    \ fields, we studied three systems that span climatic and farming \nconditions\
    \ in California’s Central Valley: processing tomato fields with \ncover crop,\
    \ almond orchards with cover crop, and almond orchards with \nnative vegetation.\
    \ From 2016 to 2019, we collected soil moisture data (3 \nyears of neutron hydroprobe\
    \ and gravimetric tests at 10 field sites) and \nevapotranspiration measurements\
    \ (2 years at two of 10 sites) in winter \ncover cropped and control (clean-cultivated,\
    \ bare ground) plots during \nwinter months. Generally, there were not significant\
    \ differences in soil \nmoisture between cover cropped and control fields throughout\
    \ or at the \nend of the winter seasons, while evapo-transpirative losses due\
    \ to winter \ncover crops were negligible relative to clean-cultivated soil. Our\
    \ results \nsuggest that winter cover crops in the Central Valley may break even\
    \ in \nterms of actual consumptive water use. California growers of high-value\
    \ \nspecialty crops can likely adopt winter cover cropping without altering \n\
    their irrigation plans and management practices.\nW\nater usage for agricultural\
    \ production has \nbecome a focus of attention among re-\nsearchers, growers,\
    \ policymakers and the \ngeneral public as the combination of climate change \n\
    and population growth threatens the availability of \nfreshwater resources (IPCC\
    \ 2014). For irrigated ag-\nriculture to be sustainable, land use decisions must\
    \ \nconsider water as a limiting factor; however, empiri-\ncal data on water implications\
    \ of many sustainable \nagricultural practices is lacking (Iglesias and Garrote\
    \ \n2015; Rodriguez et al. 2009). The lack of such informa-\ntion can lead to\
    \ low adoption of sustainable agricul-\ntural practices, such as with winter cover\
    \ cropping in \nCalifornia (Carlisle 2016). \nAlthough winter cover crops — a\
    \ wide variety of \nplants that includes native grasses or seed mixes of \nannual\
    \ grasses and legumes — have emerged as a sus-\ntainable agricultural management\
    \ practice, they are \nnot yet commonly adopted in the semi-arid Western \nstates\
    \ and are grown on less than 5% of farmland in \nCalifornia (Soil Health Institute\
    \ 2019), potentially due \nto uncertainties about the water required to establish\
    \ \nand maintain a cover crop and the costs associated \nwith cover cropping.\

    \ cycles \n— when the land would otherwise be left fallow — and \n http://calag.ucanr.edu\

    \ \nerosion control) for agriculture in many climates and \nproduction systems\
    \ (Delpuech and Metay 2018; Keating \net al. 2010; Lu et al. 2000; Pieters and\
    \ McKee 1938; \nShackelford et al. 2019). \nTwo of the most prominent crops in\
    \ California in \nterms of acreage, processing tomato and almond, are \nproduced\
    \ amidst a combination of pressures that affect \ntheir management decisions (California\
    \ Department \nof Food and Agriculture 2018). Growers must manage \nwater resources\
    \ to meet the unique agronomic require-\nments of their crops within a highly\
    \ engineered system \nof surface water deliveries, while complying with envi-\n\
    ronmental regulations, and under a changing climate \nthat is creating increasingly\
    \ variable, more expensive \nand often unreliable water supplies (Aguilera et\
    \ al. \n2013; Hanak et al. 2019; Pathak et al. 2018). To com-\npound the situation,\
    \ major institutions responsible for \ndesigning and implementing agricultural\
    \ management \npolicies, such as government agencies that manage \nwater or promote\
    \ land conservation, may push farmer \npriorities in opposing directions if their\
    \ recommenda-\ntions are not in agreement with each other.\nPrevious research\
    \ suggests that cover crops may \ncause increased soil moisture depletion and\
    \ calls for a \nmore comprehensive analysis of the impacts of winter \ncover cropping\
    \ on soil moisture and evapotranspiration \nin California’s specialty crop industries\
    \ (Mitchell et al. \n2015; Mitchell et al. 2008). However, past research is \n\
    often dated or has been conducted in temperate regions \nof the United States\
    \ not facing similar agricultural \nchallenges as California (McVay et al. 1989;\
    \ Prichard \net al. 1989). While growers anticipate benefits from \nwinter cover\
    \ cropping, they lack concrete information \nto decide if the potential water\
    \ footprint is worth the \noperational costs and potential hurdles associated\
    \ with \nthis practice (DeVincentis et al. 2020; Sarrantonio and \nGallandt 2003).\n\
    As a result of recurrent drought conditions in \nCalifornia, there is a need to\
    \ quantify how winter cover \ncropping affects soil moisture and evapotranspiration\
    \ \non agricultural production fields across specialty crop-\nping systems and\
    \ climate gradients in California. This \nis a critical step in understanding\
    \ the water-related \nimplications of winter cover cropping and barriers to \n\
    adoption of this sustainable farming practice in semi-\narid irrigated systems.\
    \ Our findings have implications \nfor growers, water resource planners and managers,\
    \ \nand policy makers working at the interface of agri-\ncultural production and\
    \ resource conservation in the \nwater-limited context of California and other\
    \ western \nU.S. states.\nQuantifying water budget \ncomponents\nWinter cover\
    \ crops may affect the water budget on \nfarms in the short-term through improved\
    \ infiltration \nand rainfall capture, soil erosion control, changes in \nactual\
    \ evapotranspiration losses, dew capture, and soil \ncooling; or in the long-term\
    \ through increased organic \nmatter content that improves soil-water dynamics\
    \ (Bas-\nche et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2000; Tautges et al. 2019; Ward \net al. 2012).\
    \ Our goal was to assess how winter cover \ncrops affect two of these components,\
    \ i.e., soil moisture \nand field evapotranspiration, during the period from \n\
    late fall to early spring on irrigated tomato and almond \nproduction fields in\
    \ California’s Central Valley. To \nquantify these parameters, we established\
    \ comparative \nplots of winter cover crops and bare ground (clean-cul-\ntivated\
    \ soil), serving as control, in the two crop systems \nacross California’s broad\
    \ climate gradient. Study sites \nwere located in the northern Central Valley\
    \ near Chico, \nan area that has an average annual precipitation of 30 \ninches,\
    \ and the southern San Joaquin Valley, where pre-\ncipitation is about 5 inches\
    \ per year. Our research team \nfirst analyzed the soil water content using soil\
    \ moisture \nmeasurements, and then determined water losses due \nto actual evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETa) using the residual of \nthe energy balance (REB) method on a subset of\
    \ fields \n(fig. 1). The resulting data sets were then analyzed and \ninterpreted\
    \ to estimate the impacts on soil water con-\ntent and water losses by comparing\
    \ cover cropped and \ncontrol plots at each study site.\nExperimental design\n\
    The study was conducted over a 3-year field campaign \non commercial production\
    \ farms and research sites \nthroughout the Central Valley from 2016 to 2019.\
    \ We \nestablished 10 field sites through partnerships with \neight commercial\
    \ farms (in Orland, Chico, Durham, \nDixon, Merced, Firebaugh, Shafter and Arvin)\
    \ and \ntwo experimental facilities located at University of \nCalifornia Agricultural\
    \ Experimental Stations (Davis \nand Five Points) to represent the diversity of\
    \ tomato \nand almond operations within the Central Valley (fig. \n2). Variables\

    \ or perennial (al-\nmond) cropping system. \nTo represent the distinct priorities\
    \ and manage-\nment preferences between processing tomato and \nalmond orchard\
    \ systems, we selected sites that manage \nthree types of winter cover crop systems:\
    \ (1) cover crop \n(usually a mix of peas and oats) planted in fields where \n\
    processing tomatoes are grown in rotation with other \nannual crops, referred\
    \ hereafter to as annual rotation \nfields, (2) cover crop planted in the tree\
    \ inter-rows of \nalmond orchards and (3) native vegetation (grasses) \nallowed\
    \ to grow in tree inter-rows in almond orchards, \nwhich represents the simplest\
    \ orchard floor manage-\nment practice. \nA replicable experimental design was\
    \ implemented \nat each study site while working within the grower’s \ncapacity\
    \ and means to accommodate the data collec-\ntion process. On-farm experimental\
    \ design included \na cover cropped area to be compared with a control \narea\
    \ (clean-cultivated) of at least 4 acres in the annual \nrotation fields, and\
    \ at least four rows in the almond \norchards (table S1 in the online technical\
    \ appendix). \nVegetative growth in the control areas was suppressed \nwith herbicide\
    \ application once in the fall at most sites.\nData collection\nThe soil moisture\
    \ data collection process generally \nstarted in late fall for all sites (as early\
    \ as October) \nand continued until early spring (as late as March) for \nthe\
    \ annual rotation fields and early summer (as late \nas June) for almond orchards\
    \ from 2016 to 2019. We \nused a neutron hydroprobe (Campbell Pacific Nu-\nclear,\
    \ Martinez, Calif.) to measure seasonal changes \nin soil moisture between winter\
    \ cover cropped and \ncontrol plots at all sites with replications in time to\
    \ \nvarying degrees. A minimum of four neutron hydro-\nprobe access tubes were\
    \ installed in each treatment \narea at each study site to enable soil moisture\
    \ readings \nbetween 0.15 meter [m] below the soil surface and \n2.7 m deep at\
    \ 0.30-m increments if site conditions \npermitted. Soil samples were taken during\
    \ the instal-\nlation of the access tubes and sporadically throughout \nthe field\
    \ campaign (Grismer et al. 1995). Analytical \ndeterminations of the gravimetric\
    \ water content were \nconducted on 2,755 soil samples to validate results \n\
    from the neutron hydroprobe readings. \nThe ETa of the winter cover cropped and\
    \ control \nplots was determined for two sites (Davis and Five \nPoints) for a\
    \ period across 2017–2018 with the REB \nmethod using the surface renewal (SR)\
    \ technique and \nequipment. The REB method calculates the latent \nheat flux\
    \ (LE) as the residual of the surface energy \nbalance, which is then used to\
    \ determine ETa. Further \ninformation on the methodology and equipment \nused\
    \ to collect data on changes in soil moisture and \nevapotranspiration are provided\

    \ 2022 39\nData processing\nThe substantial set of experimental data provided\
    \ an opportunity \nto estimate the effects of cover cropping on soil moisture\
    \ and ETa \ndespite its inconsistencies in time and space, which were due to \n\
    the inherent challenges faced in a field research study covering a \nlarge geographic\
    \ area and involving dozens of on- and off-farm \ncollaborators. \nAnalyzing soil\
    \ moisture. We analyzed (1) statistical differences \nbetween soil moisture for\
    \ each individual day and depth of data col-\nlection, (2) trends in a study site’s\
    \ soil moisture ratio and (3) trends in \nthe change of fractional soil moisture\
    \ over the winter season for each \nwinter cover cropping system.\nData sets were\
    \ first analyzed to determine the percent of time \nand depth along the soil profile\
    \ when soil moisture content differed \nbetween winter cover crop and control\
    \ plots at each study site. This \nwas done using two measurement methods: neutron\
    \ hydroprobe \nand gravimetric soil moisture. A series of t-tests were conducted\
    \ us-\ning R software package (version 3.6.0; R Foundation for Statistical \n\
    Computing, Vienna, Austria) to evaluate the significance of the treat-\nment factor\
    \ (i.e., winter cover crop versus control) on soil moisture \nusing all measurements\
    \ collected on a given day and at a given depth \nfor a particular site. We conducted\
    \ a total of 3,755 tests from the neu-\ntron hydroprobe and 323 tests from gravimetric\
    \ soil determination of \nsoil samples.\nBased on the results of our analysis,\
    \ the neutron hydroprobe data \nwas used to analyze trends in soil moisture over\
    \ time. Neutron hy-\ndroprobe counts were first aggregated by study site, day,\
    \ depth and \ntreatment. The counts were used to calculate soil moisture ratios\
    \ by \ndividing the average neutron hydropobe count from each depth of \nthe winter\
    \ cover cropped plot by the average count from the corre-\nsponding control plot.\
    \ A soil moisture ratio greater than 1 indicated \nrelatively more water in the\
    \ cover cropped plot compared to the \ncontrol.\nThen, fractional soil moisture\
    \ was calculated for the top 1.2 m of \nthe soil profile to identify trends in\
    \ cover crop systems. To calculate \nfractional soil moisture at each site and\
    \ each day of data collection, \nwe normalized the average neutron hydroprobe\
    \ count by the maxi-\nmum soil moisture measured at the corresponding treatment,\
    \ site \nand season. The maximum soil moisture was determined separately \nfor\
    \ each treatment to account for potential differences in soil hydrau-\nlic properties\
    \ between the individual plots. This process identified a \npoint of relative\
    \ saturation, i.e., the day when soil in each treatment \nplot reached its maximum\
    \ moisture content and allowed us to see \nhow the soil moisture content in each\
    \ treatment changed over the \nseason. The resulting data set of fractional soil\
    \ moisture was used \nto compare the percentage of peak soil moisture retained\
    \ by cover \ncropped and control plots at the end of the winter season, providing\
    \ a \nmethod to identify trends in a heterogeneous data set.\nAnalyzing evapotranspiration.\
    \ Data sets of the surface energy \nbalance parameters collected using micro-meteorological\
    \ measure-\nments were analyzed and the REB method was used to quantify the \n\
    actual water losses (ETa) in winter cover cropped and control plots. \nWe compiled\
    \ and used three data types for the analyses: weather, pre-\nflux and energy balance\
    \ data (Paw U et al. 1995; Snyder et al. 1996). \nFurther information on the methodology\
    \ used to quantify the ETa is \nprovided in the technical appendix. Additional\
    \ information on the \nSR and sonic anemometer analysis used in this research\
    \ are fully dis-\ncussed by Shapland et al. (2012). \nTo compare ETa of cover\
    \ crop and control fields with reference \ngrass surface, reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) values were ob-\ntained from the nearest weather stations of the California\
    \ Irrigation \nManagement Information System network (https://cimis.water.\nca.gov/):\
    \ number 6 (Davis) and number 2 (Five Points). \nSoil moisture\nSoil moisture\
    \ was generally not statistically different (P-value < 0.05) \nbetween cover cropped\
    \ and control plots at individual sites during the \nwinter season (table 1, fig.\
    \ 3). Of the 3,785 unique depth-day combina-\ntions from the neutron hydroprobe\
    \ data set, 520 (14%) were statisti-\ncally different; of the 337 unique combinations\
    \ from the gravimetric \nsoil water content data set, 39 (12%) were statistically\
    \ different. The \ntrend of minimal difference in soil moisture from the neutron\
    \ hydro-\nprobe data set was confirmed with results from the gravimetric soil\
    \ \nmoisture determination (fig. 3); therefore, the remainder of analyses \nwere\
    \ based on the neutron hydroprobe data set, which is more exten-\nsive and detailed\
    \ in time and space.\nWe found different patterns of soil moisture trends for\
    \ each cover \ncropping system (fig. 3). Annual rotation fields with a winter\
    \ cover \ncrop showed the widest range of soil moisture, with percentage of time\
    \ \nwhen soil water content differed ranging from 2% to 29% with respect \nto\
    \ control plots. This high variability may be a function of the specific \nmanagement\
    \ history on each field, which differed among the four an-\nnual rotation field\
    \ sites, as well as the soil- and crop-specific impacts \non soil moisture and\
    \ evapotranspiration of winter cover cropping. \nAlmond orchards with winter cover\
    \ crop showed a more consistent \nbehavior, possibly because almonds are grown\
    \ on a narrower range of \nsoils than processing tomatoes in California with low\
    \ to no soil dis-\nturbances. The soil moisture at these almond sites was not\
    \ statistically \ndifferent (P-value < 0.05) between the winter cover cropped\
    \ area and \nthe control over 95% of the time. These sites had the fewest depth-date\
    \ \ncombinations to analyze (959) and did not grow winter cover crops \nbefore\
    \ the present experiment. Almond orchards that allowed grow-\ning native vegetation\
    \ as a winter cover crop showed differences in soil \nCo-author Alyssa DeVincentis\

    \ with a slightly higher frequency, i.e., an aver-\nage of 20% of the time.\n\
    In this study, rootzone depths for cover crops vary \ndue to the different types\
    \ of cover crops grown. Despite \nthis variation, there are interesting trends\
    \ in the in-\nstances where soil moisture differed between winter \ncover cropped\
    \ and control plots. Difference in soil \nmoisture occurred most often in the\
    \ cover crop active \nuptake water zone between 0 cm and 120 cm, averaging \n\
    83% across the study sites (table 2). Future studies may \nonly need to look at\
    \ this part of the soil profile to fur-\nther investigate the soil moisture and\
    \ evapotranspira-\ntion impacts of winter cover crops over time.\nFor almond orchards,\
    \ the instances when soil \nmoisture differed reveal contrasts between the use\
    \ of \nwinter cover crop and native vegetation. Orchard plots \nwith winter cover\
    \ crop show infrequent differences \nrelative to the control plots (fig. 3). These\
    \ sites had not \nused winter cover crop before the present study and \nmay provide\
    \ insight into what growers can expect dur-\ning the transitional period when\
    \ a farm starts imple-\nmenting this practice. When native vegetation was \nused\
    \ as a winter cover in almond orchards, the soil \nmoisture in the control area\
    \ is often greater. During \nthe data collection campaign, we noticed that during\
    \ \nintense winter precipitation events, water pooled on \nthe surface of those\
    \ orchard rows in control plots more \nthan in cover cropped plots. Pooled water\
    \ creates unfit \nfarming conditions that could prevent or complicate \nthe use\

    \ • JANUARY–MARCH 2022 43\nA closer look at the individual sites within a single\
    \ cover crop \nsystem reveal important differences between sites that are similar\
    \ \nin cover cropping practice, location and precipitation patterns. The \naggregated\
    \ soil moisture ratios for seasons 1 and 2 show that winter \ncover crops or native\
    \ vegetation can impact soil moisture on neigh-\nboring production fields in different\
    \ ways (fig. 4). Examining sites \nwith similar pedoclimatic conditions shows\
    \ significant differences \nbased on vegetative growth and diversity of cover\
    \ crop mix. For \ninstance, in the almond orchards the plots with thicker vegetation\
    \ \nshowed a lower ratio (i.e., more water in the control plot), while in the\
    \ \ntomato fields the plots with a mixture of over a dozen cover crop seed \n\
    species showed a higher ratio (i.e., more water in the cover crop plot) \nthan\
    \ the plots with a three-seed mix (technical appendix).\nGiven the differences\
    \ between study sites, in particular sites in \nsimilar climates and soils as\
    \ previously discussed, there are not sig-\nnificant differences in soil moisture\
    \ at the end of the winter season \nwhen results from all seasons and sites are\
    \ aggregated (fig. 5). On \naverage, the production fields in this study never\
    \ lost more than 15% \nof fractional soil moisture from peak soil moisture by\
    \ the end of \nthe winter cover crop season, for either winter cover crop or control\
    \ \ntreatments. This result reveals that soil moisture retention was not \nobservably\
    \ different between treatments in aggregate.\nEvapotranspiration\nOur research\
    \ team measured ETa over the course of two winter cover \ncrop seasons from 2016\
    \ to 2018. The measurements conducted during \nthe first year of data collection\
    \ provided a proof of concept for moni-\ntoring ETa over a winter cover crop and\
    \ allowed the research team to \nrefine the data collection protocols and data\
    \ management system. We \nreport ETa values determined from the data collection\
    \ period of the \nsecond year (November 2017 to February 2018), where a ten-fold\
    \ dif-\nference in precipitation between the two sites, Davis (125 millimeters\
    \ \n[mm]) and Five Points (12 mm), allow for a climatic comparison from \nNovember\
    \ 15, 2017, to February 20, 2018.\nThe difference in seasonal cumulative ETa between\
    \ winter cover \ncropped and control ground is negligible in both Davis (3 mm)\
    \ and \nFive Points (18 mm) (fig. 6). The cumulative ETa in Five Points is \n\
    greater than the amount of precipitation in the same time period, but \nmay have\
    \ been fed by preceding rainfall and some stored soil mois-\nture, and these differences\
    \ in evapo-transpirative water use can be \nconsidered insignificant in the scheme\
    \ of annual water requirements \nfor processing tomatoes, which are between 450\
    \ mm and 500 mm. \nThe bi-weekly cumulative ETa values in Davis reveal that during\
    \ \nperiods of abundant precipitation, such as in January 2018, con-\nsumptive\
    \ water losses are actually greater in the control plot and are \nmainly due to\
    \ soil evaporation from bare ground. During wet years, \nit would be advantageous\
    \ to have a winter cover crop to slightly \nreduce evapo-transpirative water losses\
    \ from the top soil layers. In \nthe drier climate in Five Points, the bi-weekly\
    \ ETa from the winter \ncover crop was always slightly higher than the control;\
    \ however, this \nmeasured ETa may also include condensed moisture that the cover\
    \ \ncrop captured from dew and fog and the cumulative water losses are \nminimal\
    \ overall.\nApplications and limitations\nThe findings from this study may be\
    \ useful for specialty crop grow-\ners in the Central Valley for several reasons.\
    \ Growers with annual \nfields in rotation with processing tomatoes may experience\
    \ a variety \nof changes in soil moisture resulting from winter cover cropping\
    \ \ndepending on their unique characteristics, such as soil type or man-\nagement\
    \ history. Their fields may experience some extra consumptive \nwater losses through\
    \ evapotranspiration during dry winters, but the \nwater used by winter cover\
    \ crops amounts to less than a single ir-\nrigation event (1 inch) and less than\
    \ 10% of field ETo. This small cost \nmay be offset by the possibilities of increased\
    \ soil moisture, increased \norganic matter content, reduced erosion and nutrient\
    \ losses, and im-\nproved soil health after cover cropping for multiple years,\
    \ which this \nstudy did not capture.\nAdditionally, cover crops can improve the\
    \ effectiveness of ap-\nplying water during the dormant season to refill the soil\
    \ profile and \nleach salts. These combined potential management implications\
    \ \ncould incentivize winter cover cropping for specialty growers of an-\nnual\
    \ crops that are concerned with late winter rains delaying cover \ncrop termination,\
    \ thereby preventing complications with contractual \nobligations (DeVincentis\
    \ et al. 2020).\nAlmond sites showed slightly more frequent differences in soil\
    \ \nmoisture due to winter cover, but the inter-row cover and almond \ntrees mostly\
    \ occupy different spatial niches. Growers with young al-\nmond orchards (fewer\
    \ than 3 years old, before they produce almonds) \ncan take advantage of the soil\
    \ health benefits of winter cover crops \nwhile their orchards are not yet producing\
    \ almonds without expe-\nriencing any changes in soil moisture due to winter cover\
    \ cropping. \nGrowers with almond orchards who lease their farmland can allow\
    \ \nnative vegetation to grow as a winter cover crop to enhance their \nrhizosphere\
    \ ecology without incurring costs that may impact their \nbusiness schemes. However,\
    \ it is important to note that timing of \nwinter cover crop termination is key\
    \ to having these benefits realized, \navoiding delays in normal farming operations,\
    \ and preventing soil \nmoisture depletion due to extra ET when the temperature\
    \ increases.\nBecause the research sites included commercial production fields,\
    \ \nthese findings are representative of the reality that farmers experi-\nence\
    \ in California. However, our study is limited by the inherent \nchallenges of\
    \ field-based agricultural research. There are limitations \nto the extent of\
    \ control in the experimental design when conduct-\ning research on commercial\
    \ farms. Additionally, our sites differed \nin management history, years of cover\
    \ cropping, motivations for \ngrowing cover crops, operational resources, type\
    \ of cover cropping, \nlocation, rainfall, timing of cover crop termination, and\
    \ soil char-\nacteristics, just to name a few variables. Despite these limitations,\
    \ \nhowever, collecting data at each of these sites allowed researchers to \n\
    create a diversified data set with thousands of measurements and to \ndesign a\
    \ careful data analysis process. \nThe aforementioned limitations can be addressed\
    \ in future studies \nthat will benefit from the analytical results obtained and\
    \ the lessons \nlearned during our field research. Future research efforts aiming\
    \ to \nbetter understand soil moisture changes that result from winter cover \n\
    cropping could target only soil depth up to 1 m (estimated maximum \nactive rootzone\
    \ for cover crops), and at the same time increase the fre-\nquency of data collection,\
    \ including before and after rain events. Such \nresearch should look into the\
    \ rain response impacts of winter cover \ncrops that could be captured with in-situ\
    \ soil moisture sensors, which \ndo not require the regular site visits that are\
    \ necessary when using \nneutron hydroprobes.\nFuture research efforts to monitor\
    \ how winter cover crops affect \nactual field ET are necessary to build on the\
    \ initial conclusions drawn \nin this paper. The ET data presented here is limited\
    \ in its scope of \n44 CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE • VOLUME 76, NUMBER 1\nReferences\n\

    Chapter 1\nNature and Role of Water Institutions — Implications to\nIrrigation\
    \ Water Management in Zimbabwe\nK. Nhundu, A. Mushunje and F. Aghdasi\nAdditional\
    \ information is available at the end of the chapter\n \n1. Introduction\nAbout\
    \ 60% of the Southern African region is semi-arid or arid and suffers from periodic\n\
    droughts [1]. This is compounded by the scarcity and poor management of irrigation\
    \ water\nresources. The challenges of water scarcity for agricultural purposes\
    \ present negative conse‐\nquences on the general populace, more particularly\
    \ in the rural areas. It is in these areas that\nthe majority practise agriculture\
    \ for their livelihoods with regards to food and incomes [2].\nThis has led to\
    \ a decline in agricultural productivity. Declining agricultural productivity\n\
    among smallholder farmers in Africa remains a major bottleneck in the development\
    \ of the\ncontinent [3]. Agricultural production is dominated by rain-fed agriculture\
    \ and irrigation\nsystems are limited [4].\nTo this effect, management of agricultural\
    \ water particularly in rain-fed systems remains\nimperative for improved farm\
    \ level yields because the bulk of the food comes from rain-fed\nagriculture [2,\
    \ 3]. Yet, evidence of the problems of water management is found throughout\n\
    history [5]. Effective management of agricultural water requires continuous backup\
    \ from\npolicies and institutional frameworks [2, 3, 6]. Scholars have argued\
    \ that institutions are very\nimportant to improve management problems [7, 8].\
    \ How to incorporate and sustain institu‐\ntional innovations to ensure efficient\
    \ use and management of irrigation water under diverse\necological, economic,\
    \ social, and political constraints is an on-going debate on irrigation water\n\
    resource development [9]. Efficient use and management of irrigation water require\
    \ changes\nin institutions and new institutions [10].\nIn light of the above,\
    \ a series of institutional arrangements have been presented as panaceas\nto improve\
    \ water management: strong government agencies, user organizations, and water\n\
    markets [5]. These approaches have conversely failed to achieve the required outcomes\n\
    basically because of the variability of local situations and the difficulty associated\
    \ with\n© 2015 The Author(s). Licensee InTech. This chapter is distributed under\

    \ one context to another were not considered [5]. Moreover,\nresearch has confirmed\
    \ that lack of enabling policies and effective institutional frameworks\nare a\
    \ major contributor towards poor management and utilisation of agricultural water\
    \ in Sub-\nSaharan Africa [3, 6].\nIn light of the above, it is therefore important\
    \ to understand that addressing the challenges\nthat are associated with water\
    \ management, there is need to consider the localised rules and\nnorms and the\
    \ authorities that therefore enforce them. This is over and above implementing\n\
    appropriate and relevant technologies [11]. Therefore, there is need for instituting\
    \ effective\nlocalised governance the effective application of community rules.\
    \ Thus, this chapter seeks to\ninvestigate the nature and role of water management\
    \ institutions to foster sustainable agri‐\ncultural water resources management,\
    \ particularly in Zimbabwe after the “fast” track land\nreform programme. The\
    \ subsequent section discusses the major water reforms in Zimbabwe.\n1.1. Redressing\
    \ past water injustices in Zimbabwe\nFor close to two decades after independence\
    \ water resource management continued to be\ngoverned by the 1976 Water Act. The\
    \ need for water reform eventually emanated from the\nneed to ‘redress colonial\
    \ injustices in the water sector’ [12, 13, 14]. Increased continual\nprivileged\
    \ access to water by the white large-scale commercial agriculture for commercial\n\
    interests called for an urgent need to reform the irrigation water sector in Zimbabwe.\
    \ This was\nto be augmented by establishing a legal framework that would also\
    \ guarantee an equal access\nto water for all Zimbabweans. Ensuring equitable\
    \ access to water for rural people for produc‐\ntive uses contributes to the improvement\
    \ of their livelihoods derived from the use of water.\nThe water reforms that\
    \ culminated in the 1998 Water Act began as a reaction to the 1991/92\ndrought,\
    \ the worst in the country’s history [15]. Within this context, the 1976 Water\
    \ Act was\nrepealed by the 1998 Water Act and the Zimbabwe National Water Authority\
    \ (ZINWA) Act.\nThe Water Act of 1998 set the parameters of access and use of\
    \ water as well as the establishment\nof Catchment and Sub-catchment areas based\
    \ on hydrological boundaries.\n1.2. Institutions: Nature and role\nThis chapter\
    \ adopts a definition of institutions that encompasses both [16] and [17]. [17]’s\n\
    definition implies that interactions with the environment are secondary to political,\
    \ economic\nand social interactions whereas [16] notes that institutions are rules\
    \ that can be used at multiple\nlevels of analysis and such a definition does\
    \ not seem to place priority of one factor over\nanother. The major role of institutions\
    \ in a society is to reduce uncertainty by establishing\nstructure to human interaction\
    \ [18].\nThe difference between formal and informal institutions is one of degree,\
    \ not of kind, and in\nmany cases some informal institutions gradually become\
    \ part of their formal counterparts and\nsome formal institutions take informal\
    \ forms. Informal institutions are also considered\nextensions and local-level\
    \ translations of formal institutions and are not purposively designed\nbut evolve\
    \ through spontaneous interaction, whereas formal institutions can be purposively\n\
    designed [18, 19].\nIrrigation and Drainage - Sustainable Strategies and Systems\n\
    2\n2. Effectiveness of institutions: A critical review\n2.1. Formal institutions\n\
    A survey was conducted by [20] based on a technical and institutional evaluation\
    \ of the Geray\nirrigation scheme in West Gojjam zone, Amhara region, Ethiopia.\
    \ The results indicate that the\nscheme had been managed by the Water Users Association\
    \ for four years, despite the fact that\nit had existed for 27 years. The overall\
    \ performance of the Water Users Association in terms\nof managing the schemes\
    \ was very poor. Water Users Association had no legal authority to\nenforce its\
    \ by-laws.\nIn Harayana, India, [21] employed descriptive analysis to argue that\
    \ the fact that the poorer\nhouseholds participated in water projects, this did\
    \ not however, protect their interests.\nCommunity based organisations did not\
    \ basically provide efficient irrigation services com‐\npared to the services\
    \ provided by private organisations. Allocation of water, collection of\nirrigation\
    \ service fees, and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure by contractors was\
    \ more\neffective than by the community. In contrast, an almost similar study\
    \ by [22] evaluated the\nperformance of smallholder irrigation systems in Zimbabwe.\
    \ The results showed that the\nfarmer managed irrigation system performed better\
    \ consistently than the government\nmanaged irrigation system.\nIn Sri Lanka,\
    \ a study by [23] revealed that there were many problems in agency managed\nirrigation.\
    \ Poor maintenance of irrigation facilities under public provision is a salient\
    \ feature\nin many countries. There was heavy subsidisation of the irrigation\
    \ management in Sri Lanka\nwhich had a poor record of cost recovery. Less than\
    \ 50 percent of the maintenance costs have\nbeen collected from farmers at any\
    \ time [24]. Similarly, as observed by [25], another major\ndeficiency has been\
    \ the pricing policies in irrigation. Pricing is not related to scarcity or the\n\
    cost of delivery. Flat rate pricing means the marginal cost is zero which created\
    \ inefficiency in\nwater use.\n2.2. Informal institutions\nSeveral studies have\
    \ acknowledged the fact that informal local level institutions can make a\ndifference\
    \ in water management [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. However, the majority of practi‐\n\
    tioners and policy-makers advocate for the formal state-based water rights in\
    \ water manage‐\nment issues, while avoiding consideration of the localised informal\
    \ norms and rules. On the\nother hand, the researchers who were pro-informal arrangements\
    \ seem not to put their support\non advocating for adoption of the localised best\
    \ practices, rather, they opt for amalgamation\nof the (new) formal and (existing)\
    \ informal arrangements. However, acknowledging the local\nrules and norms as\
    \ legitimate by the formal law, the way they are implemented will suppress\nthe\
    \ dynamics that are fundamental of local arrangements and thus negatively affects\
    \ local\nrights, hence poor irrigation water management.\nIn efforts to fully\
    \ understand the importance of informal rules, [33] examined gender issues\nand\
    \ women’s participation in irrigated agriculture in Carchi, Ecuador, using a combination\
    \ of\nqualitative and quantitative methods of analyses. The findings showed that\
    \ women’s partici‐\npation in water user associations is low, and culture plays\
    \ a strong role in terms of their\nNature and Role of Water Institutions — Implications\
    \ to Irrigation Water Management in Zimbabwe\n3\ndecision-making power. In addition,\
    \ women tried to solve their irrigation-related problems\nthrough informal ways\
    \ where they had more decision making power.\n3. Conceptional framework: Institutional\
    \ Decomposition Analysis (IDA)\nIn this study, and as employed by [34], the Institutional\
    \ Decomposition Analysis (IDA) for\nmeasuring the effectiveness of water management\
    \ institutions was decomposed into informal\nand formal institutions components.\
    \ The later was further decomposed into three institutional\ncomponents; irrigation\
    \ water law, irrigation water policy, and irrigation water administration. The\n\
    institutional facets were decomposed further to identify their institutional aspects\
    \ (Figure 1).\nThis framework provides a basis for a quantitative evaluation of\
    \ both the institutional and the\ninstitution performance linkages.\n \n \n \n\

    \ study was carried-out in Mashonaland East Province, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is\n\
    divided into five broad Natural Regions (NR) in which the dominant natural factor\
    \ condi‐\ntioning agricultural production is climate; mainly rainfall.\nStratified\
    \ sampling was done to categorise irrigation schemes into the three strata:\n\
    • A1 landless people;\n• A2, commercial settlement schemes - small, medium, and\
    \ large scale; and lastly\n• Communal/resettled farmers.\nFrom each stratum, random\
    \ sampling was done to select the target irrigation schemes1 in the\nprovince.\
    \ The sample population for the study is depicted in Table 5. A total of 120 question‐\n\

    \ Legal variables\nWater rights are mechanisms through which a user can access\
    \ water for a particular use\nwithout jeopardising another user’s right [35].\
    \ The descriptive statistics reveal that most users\nNature and Role of Water\
    \ Institutions — Implications to Irrigation Water Management in Zimbabwe\n11\n\
    had little or no access to water rights (mean value = 0.37). During the colonial\
    \ history of\nZimbabwe, black indigenous farmers were disadvantaged because they\
    \ had not applied for\nwater rights [36] and when they applied for water rights,\
    \ most of the water was committed to\nrights held by white farmers, which were\
    \ issued in perpetuity and could not be revoked.\nSmallholder farmers were also\
    \ disenfranchised because the legal systems introduced in the\ncolonial and post-colonial\
    \ states failed to acknowledge traditional water management\npractices [37]. In\
    \ addition, [38] also report that the water rights of the indigenous population\n\
    which predated the settler claims, were disregarded, thus leaving most farmers\
    \ without water\nrights. Farmers’ rights are found to be unclear/scattered or\
    \ absent as shown by a mean value\nof 1.34, skewed towards the worst situation.\
    \ Lack of clearly defined and well-enforced property\nrights significantly increase\
    \ risks [39]. Unclear rights increase risks of farmers mismanaging\nwater resources\
    \ because they do not have a sense of ownership.\nA mean value of 0.31 for the\
    \ awareness of the existence of water law suggests that most users\nare not fully\
    \ aware of the existence of the water law. The “Fast-Track Land Reform Pro‐\n\
    gramme” (FTLRP) brought in producers who may not have been aware of the existence\
    \ of the\nwater law. Human actors have bounded rationality (Simon, 1957) rather\
    \ than perfect knowl‐\nedge. Human actors lack complete knowledge to assess their\
    \ decision alternatives due to their\ncognitive limitations, time and information\
    \ constraints [40, 41].\nThere were weak provisions for conflict-solving within\
    \ the water law (mean value = 3.64),\nsuggesting that users may seek arbitration\
    \ from legal courts. However, formal courts tend to\nnullify the rulings of informal\
    \ arbitration [41]. This may imply perpetuation of conflict,\neventually leading\
    \ to poor irrigation water management.\nThe results reveal an irrelevant irrigation\
    \ water law for current and future users (mean value\n= 2.41). This result can\
    \ imply a lack of enforcement of the 1998 Water Act, despite the Act being\nregarded\
    \ as technically sound, with a solid base for sustainable and efficient utilisation\
    \ of water\nresources. Vital sections of the Act have not been fully enforced;\
    \ hence, its founding principles\nare not supported. For example, the Water Fund\
    \ has collected insufficient revenue to support\nstatutory functions.\nIn the\
    \ theory of economics of institutions and economic growth, [42] argued that institutions\n\
    need continual adaptation in the face of changing environment of technology to\
    \ promote\neconomic growth, particularly in Zimbabwe where there has been an emergence\
    \ of new\nirrigation farmers as a result of the land reform programmes. The results\
    \ also reveal a weak\nrelationship between irrigation water law and other economic\
    \ laws (mean value = 4.34) such\nas environmental and energy laws, suggesting\
    \ a lack of co-ordination of the laws, hence poor\nirrigation water management.\n\
    The water law provided for private sector participation in irrigation water resources\
    \ manage‐\nment (mean value = 5.27). This can be explained by the fact that water\
    \ reforms in Zimbabwe\nintroduced radical changes regarding the participation\
    \ and representation of users in the\nmanagement of water. The 1998 Water Act\
    \ provided a legal basis for the participation of\npreviously excluded water users,\
    \ namely communal, resettlement and small-scale commercial\nIrrigation and Drainage\
    \ - Sustainable Strategies and Systems\n12\nfarmers. This inclusiveness has encouraged\
    \ local level participation in water management at\nsub-catchment council levels.\n\
    5.1.2. Policy variables\nThe descriptive statistics indicate that the project\
    \ selection criterion was not economic-\norientated (mean value = 0.21). In Zimbabwe,\
    \ challenges exist in prioritisation of the develop‐\nment of water/irrigation\
    \ projects according to well defined criteria [43] based on proper\nassessments\
    \ of irrigation investments and projects, including their financial feasibility.\n\
    Generally, the purpose of paying for water use is to ensure sustainability of\
    \ services, water\nconservation, and mitigation of damages [44]. However, the\
    \ results depict non-commitment\nor non-payment of user fees (mean value = 0.38).\
    \ Even the creation of the Water Fund embed‐\nded in the 1998 Water Act with the\
    \ objectives of collecting levies, fees, government contribu‐\ntions and other\
    \ support towards water service provision did not help as financial inflows have\n\
    been minimal [45]. Similarly, new users are reluctant to pay for water use as\
    \ water rights had\nnot been paid previously. There is not a culture of paying\
    \ for commercial use of water by water\nusers [43]. Moreover, many farmers stopped\
    \ paying for irrigation water after their farms were\ninvaded during the FTLRP\
    \ [44]. In addition, most farmers in Zimbabwe have refused to pay\nfor water use,\
    \ arguing that water is a natural resource that comes from “God”, and even if\
    \ they\npay, the revenue is not re-invested back into their schemes. In response,\
    \ many governments\nhave moved away from imposing the full costs upon water users\
    \ of irrigation for political\nreasons because farmers resist charges [45].\n\
    The findings reveal that payment of water was done on a partial recovery basis\
    \ (mean = 1.36).\nThis could emanate from political interference in pricing of\
    \ water in Zimbabwe where\npoliticians, in a bid to retain popularity, aim to\
    \ keep the price of water as low as possible [43].\nEven if users pay for irrigation\
    \ water, a challenge lies on ensuring that at least part of the water\nrevenue\
    \ is re-invested in water management so as to improve and make the irrigation\
    \ water\npolicy an effective tool in irrigation water management [43].\nAs revealed\
    \ by the results, the new irrigation policy did not fully provide for private\
    \ sector\nparticipation (mean value = 3.15). After FTLRP, challenges existed in\
    \ determining respective\nroles of the private and public sectors in irrigation\
    \ [43]. The existing gap in roles played by the\nprivate and public sectors negatively\
    \ affect irrigation water management objectives. Moreover,\nthe results indicate\
    \ poor participation of the private sector in water management issues (mean\n\
    value = 3.27). As such, the irrigation water policy should provide for effective\
    \ private sector\nparticipation on water management issues.\nUser groups, or Water\
    \ Users Associations (WUAs), can play a crucial role in the management\nof irrigation\
    \ water resources as most people feel a stronger sense of identity and belongingness.\n\
    However, the results indicate that fewer farmers are organised into water user\
    \ groups (mean\nvalue -0.32). This could be explained by the fact that it is difficult\
    \ to identify and classify water\nuser groups from which the representatives are\
    \ chosen to constitute the sub-catchment. This\nis basically the challenge in\
    \ spite of the 1998 Water Act provisions. For instance, the Water Act\nactually\
    \ provided for the involvement of the farmers at communal level, however, the\n\
    Nature and Role of Water Institutions — Implications to Irrigation Water Management\
    \ in Zimbabwe\n13\ncommittees that are constituted at a local level hardly function\
    \ and barely get recognition at\ncatchment council meetings.\nThe current water\
    \ policy lacks clear user participation provisions (mean value = 3.65). Re‐\n\
    gardless of the 1998 Water Act having the provisions for involvement and active\
    \ representation\nof water users, the law has been overwhelmed by challenges.\
    \ A good example is a case where\nnew water users who lack financial resources\
    \ to travel and attend sub-catchment council\nmeetings, thus inhibiting them to\
    \ attend the important meetings. In addition, the farmers\nindicate that other\
    \ economic policies have an impact on the irrigation water policy (mean value\n\
    = 6.52). Thus, water policy should clearly define how other policies are related\
    \ with regards to\nwater management objectives.\nA weak relationship is revealed\
    \ between water policy and water law (mean value = 2.02). After\nthe FTLRP, no\
    \ water law and/or policy reforms were put in place to address the needs of the\n\
    new farmers introduced by the FTLRP. Irrigation water policy should link with\
    \ the irrigation\nwater law, so that the two work together in the management of\
    \ irrigation water resources.\n5.1.3. Administration variables\nThe surveyed farmers\
    \ indicate the existence of capacity to manage irrigation water resources\nmanagement\
    \ (mean value = 6.61), in the form of users’ associations, irrigation scheme consti‐\n\
    tutions, etc. Farmers indicate that water users groups or WUAs are fairly effective\
    \ in ensuring\neffective management of water resources (mean value = 4.73). However,\
    \ [46] revealed that\nirrigation schemes were poorly managed due to a lack of\
    \ well-established organisational and\ninstitutional conditions and WUAs were\
    \ not well organised. In addition, as noted by [36],\nIrrigation Management Committees\
    \ formed to improve coordination between irrigators and\nwater management have\
    \ not been able to take over the management of schemes because of\nstate-applied\
    \ technical measures.\nAs revealed by the surveyed farmers, private sector participation\
    \ presents an opportunity to\nreduce the burden on irrigation water management\
    \ (mean value = 5.15). Effective participation\ncan be achieved if supported by\
    \ administrative issues that accommodate water user groups.\nWater administration\
    \ can ensure active participation of private sector in irrigation water\nresources\
    \ by creating an active role for the private sector players and by reducing the\
    \ burden\non irrigation water management.\nThe survey reveals a lack of updates\
    \ and maintenance mechanisms (mean value = 0.23). When\nirrigation systems dilapidate,\
    \ it can lead to poor irrigation water management, for example,\nthrough water\
    \ loss in case of burst pipes. Constant and regular monitoring of irrigation systems\n\
    is needed. Irrigation schemes need mechanisms of collecting irrigation water updates\
    \ and\ndoing maintenance of irrigation water. However, where updates and maintenance\
    \ schedules\nexist, farmers have indicated they are not adequate, relevant and/or\
    \ reliable. Lastly a disparity\nbetween water administration issues and the water\
    \ law and policy is revealed (mean value =\n3.16). The disparities or lack of\
    \ co-ordination among the formal institutions affect the effec‐\ntiveness of water\
    \ administration to manage water resources.\nIrrigation and Drainage - Sustainable\
    \ Strategies and Systems\n14\n5.2. Informal institutions\nThe evolution of institutions\
    \ and their performance implications are affected strongly by their\npath-dependency2\
    \ nature. Because of their path-dependent characteristics, institutions are the\n\
    ‘carriers of history, ’ reproducing themselves well beyond the time of their usefulness\
    \ [47, 48].\nSince informal institutions play an important role in the incremental\
    \ way in which institutions\nevolve, they remain a major source of path dependence\
    \ [18]. In addition to informal institu‐\ntions, there are such self-reinforcing\
    \ mechanisms as network externalities, learning effects, and\nthe historically\
    \ derived subjective modelling of issues. Since all these mechanisms reinforce\n\
    the current course of the development path, reversing the course of that path\
    \ becomes\nextremely difficult or costly [18]. This is also reiterated in the\
    \ utility of social theory to address\nhuman problems [49], and is concerned with\
    \ explaining how to improve economic perform‐\nance, and hence welfare, by comprehending\
    \ human incentives, preferences, perceptions,\nbeliefs and learning [49]. Table\
    \ 3 presents the perceptional-based informal irrigation water\ninstitutions and\
    \ performance variables.\nAs revealed by the CPR studies, it is difficult to implant\
    \ uniform institutional arrangements\nfrom locality to locality and situation\
    \ to situation as the challenges that they face vary de‐\npending on physical\
    \ and community conditions [50]. While effective institutional arrange‐\nments\
    \ may deviate across settings, the CPR studies have identified common ideologies\
    \ of long-\nenduring and self-governed CPR institutions. According to [7, 51],\
    \ the first design principle\nassociated with sustainable CPR governance institutions\
    \ is the establishment of clearly\ndelineated boundaries around the resource and\
    \ resource users.\nA mean value of 0.314 was revealed, suggesting clearly defined\
    \ boundaries to withdraw\nirrigation water from CPRs clear boundaries not exist.\
    \ This implies that any benefits the\ncommunities produce, by their efforts, will\
    \ be gained by the other users who would not have\ncontributed to the cause. [7].\
    \ However, [52] argues that there is a finite amount of water that\nmust be shared\
    \ in common over a variety of uses and over geographic areas, based on the fact\n\
    that water falls in the form of rain, flows and evaporates with no regard to any\
    \ boundary.\nIn addition, some CPR studies have identified general principles\
    \ of long-enduring, self-\ngoverned CPR institutions by establishment of clearly\
    \ delineated boundaries around the\nresource and resource users [7, 51]. It is\
    \ therefore important that informal institutions be\nstructured in a way that\
    \ will ensure CPRs users coordinate their actions to solve supply and\ndemand\
    \ dilemmas [7, 50, 53, 54]. However, [7, 51, 55] highlights that CPRs exhibit\
    \ varying\ndegrees of two key characteristics, one of which is the difficulty\
    \ in excluding users, as such; it\nwill be difficult to exclude other users from\
    \ accessing water resources, thus leading to free-\nriding problems or insufficient\
    \ maintenance of water resources. Nonetheless, there should be\neffective conditions\
    \ in place to ensure that water, as a CPR is effectively managed through the\n\
    use of informal rules.\nThe informal local rules that are formulated are participatory,\
    \ implying that the behaviour of\nall the users in the community or locality must\
    \ customarily live in harmony with them. In\n2 Path dependency means that history\
    \ does matter: the direction and scope of institutional change cannot be divorced\n\
    from its early course or past history.\nNature and Role of Water Institutions\
    \ — Implications to Irrigation Water Management in Zimbabwe\n15\naddition, they\
    \ are rules that govern human behaviour usually at no cost and they basically\
    \ are\nenforced by the locals themselves [35]. In some cases, local rights could\
    \ also be sensitive to the\nvulnerable, e.g. widows and the poor. Customary local\
    \ practices and structures can also\ncontain or help avoid conflict. A mean value\
    \ of 0.421 was revealed, suggesting a lack of such-\nor fewer local rules. The\
    \ FTLRP ushered in new water users who needed time to establish their\nown local\
    \ rules, given that they take time to evolve. Violations of rules and water use\
    \ may go\nunnoticed and unpunished. Existence of informal rules based on local\
    \ condition means that if\nthe informal codes are violated, punishment may be\
    \ enforced [7]. On the other hand, however,\n[56] warns on viewing any particular\
    \ institutional arrangement as a panacea for solving natural\nresources (especially\
    \ CPRs) problems due to heterogeneity and complexity of problems facing\ndifferent\
    \ resources, hence, the need for local-based institutions. The local institutions\
    \ at\ninterplay within a local community regulate the users who have access to\
    \ the CPRs, the\nresource units that the authorised participants can make use\
    \ of at any given time, including\nwho will monitor and administer the rules [55].\n\
    Regulation and governing mechanisms, e.g. constitutions at scheme level assist\
    \ in the man‐\nagement of irrigation water resources. A mean value of 0.204 suggests\
    \ a lack of these man‐\nagement mechanisms. A study by [57] revealed that often,\
    \ there was no consensus on rules\namong farmers and monitoring and management\
    \ mechanisms were absent. The new benefi‐\nciary farmers of the FTLRP were still\
    \ not aware of the importance of informal management\nmechanisms. Thus, it is\
    \ important to ensure the new farmers understand the importance of\ninformal management\
    \ mechanisms at scheme levels to promote effective irrigation water\nmanagement.\
    \ Where informal management mechanisms existed, their effectiveness was\ncrucial\
    \ to ensure efficient management of water resources. A mean value of 4.184 suggested\n\
    that these mechanisms were not effective enough. The FTLRP beneficiaries did not\
    \ have\nmanagement mechanisms and had not organised themselves into user groups,\
    \ where they\nwould formulate some management mechanism.\nEffectiveness of management\
    \ mechanisms depends on factors like effectiveness of monitoring\nconditions,\
    \ behaviour of appropriators, regulation sanctions, etc. A mean value of 3.881\n\
    suggests that monitoring conditions were not effective enough to assist in the\
    \ management of\nwater. Therefore, there is need to ensure the effective monitoring\
    \ conditions and the behav‐\niours of the appropriators to ensure all users behave\
    \ accordingly and promote sustainable\nwater management.\nExistence of regulation\
    \ sanctions can be an effective mechanism of irrigation water manage‐\nment as\
    \ users who rebel, default and/or fail to behave accordingly can be possibly punished.\n\
    A mean value of 0.508 was revealed, suggesting some existing regulation sanctions\
    \ at some\nschemes. However, existence of regulation sanctions does not denote\
    \ effective irrigation water\nmanagement, unless they are effective. It is therefore\
    \ important to ensure effective local\nregulation sanctions to ensure irrigation\
    \ water management issues.\nIn addition to existence of regulation the sanctions,\
    \ rapid access mechanisms to conflict solving\nwithout following long procedures\
    \ or protocols can effective in the management of water\nresources. A mean value\
    \ of 0.381 suggests non-existence of rapid conflict conflict-solving\nIrrigation\
    \ and Drainage - Sustainable Strategies and Systems\n16\nmechanisms. Lack of rapid\
    \ conflict-solving mechanisms in a low-cost and local setting could\nhave an adverse\
    \ effect on irrigation water management. This encourages local users to by-pass\n\
    traditional mechanisms in hope of achieving a winner-takes-all decision [35].\
    \ However, formal\ncourts seem to have tendencies to overturn informal court decisions,\
    \ in turn, may exacerbate\nconflict at local level rather than resolve it. In\
    \ addition, these channels maybe costly and users\nmay not be able to afford the\
    \ expensive and lengthy procedures to solve conflicts, as such, may\nleave some\
    \ of the conflicts unsolved and this negatively impacts on irrigation water manage‐\n\
    ment objectives.\nAccording to the transaction cost theory, functioning of institutions\
    \ depends on the costliness\nof enforcement [18]. Users need to create their own\
    \ cheap set of rules that govern how they\nmanage local water resources. Users\
    \ will have confidence in their own rules and thus effec‐\ntively implement them\
    \ to ensure users behave accordingly. Development and creation of\ninstitutions\
    \ or rules aid to creating more socially acceptable (and so economically acceptable)\n\
    outcomes [58]. In addition, informal rules also differ from community to community,\
    \ hence,\nthe need of local, low-cost set of rules for water users. A mean value\
    \ of 0.215 was revealed,\nsuggesting that users were not in a position to create\
    \ their own set of rules to govern water\nmanagement. Institutions are not necessarily\
    \ or even usually created to be socially efficient;\nrather, they are created\
    \ to serve interests of those with bargaining power to create new rules\n[59].\
    \ Furthermore, creation of institutions that so structure the rules and their\
    \ enforcement as\nto alter pay-offs induces the cooperative solutions.\nAbility\
    \ to challenge the rights of appropriators to create own institution based on\
    \ local set-ups\npromotes effective water management, and depends on the extent\
    \ of challenge. A mean value\nof 3.587 suggested the extent of challenging the\
    \ appropriators’ rights was low. Users were\nweak in challenging the rights of\
    \ appropriators. As such, users could not create their own\neffective set of rapid,\
    \ low cost and locally-based informal institutions. As such, users need to\nbe\
    \ empowered in creating their own set of rules.\nAs discussed in section 2.2,\
    \ pro-informal arrangements scholars are not pushy to support the\nenforcement\
    \ of informal institutions, rather opting for combining the new formal and existing\n\
    informal arrangements in water management. As such, overall relationship and influence\
    \ of\nthe informal institutions and the formal irrigation institutions becomes\
    \ important as the former\nguide the day-to-day management of water resources,\
    \ yet, the latter tend to over-rule the\ninformal rules. If the formal irrigation\
    \ institutions are used to govern water management,\nfarmers still have their\
    \ own set of rules which determine their behaviour in a given context. A\nmean\
    \ value of 4.499 suggested a lack of influence of the informal institutions on\
    \ the formal\ninstitutions manage irrigation water management. Nonetheless, the\
    \ formal institutions draw\nheavily from the informal institution [59]. Lack of\
    \ coherence between the informal and formal\ninstitutions potentially leads to\
    \ ineffective water resources management. In addition, users\nalso originate from\
    \ diverse social communities where a set of rules vary, as such, the formal\n\
    rules structures should thus consider these differences to achieve irrigation\
    \ water management\nobjectives.\nNature and Role of Water Institutions — Implications\

    6.1. Formal institutions\n6.1.1. Legal variables\nA positive regression coefficient\
    \ of 0.151 at the 5% significance level suggests that access to\nirrigation water\
    \ rights significantly strengthens the irrigation water law in the management\n\
    of water resources. Private property [39, 60] Coase, 1960), just like water rights,\
    \ is the most\nefficient system of land use. Similarly, North & Thomas (1977)\
    \ support such an inference by\narguing that property rights provide incentives\
    \ to encourage development and cultivation.\nA positive relationship between the\
    \ water law and the format of water rights was revealed\n(regression coefficient\
    \ of 0.083) at the 10% significance level. Unclear/scattered or lack of format\n\
    rights, for example, may result in the water law failing to effectively manage\
    \ irrigation water\nwhich can increase risks and transaction costs [39].\nIn his\
    \ critique of instrumental rationality to further support the importance of institutions,\
    \ [61]\nargued that the human mind fails to deliberately and analytically process\
    \ all available\ninformation to choose an action that maximises utility. The study\
    \ revealed that knowledge of\nthe existence of the water law positively and significantly\
    \ strengthens the effectiveness of the\nIrrigation and Drainage - Sustainable\
    \ Strategies and Systems\n20\nirrigation water law (regression coefficient of\
    \ 0.728) at the 1% significance level. Lack of knowl‐\nedge implies individuals\
    \ have incomplete information and limited capacity to process\ninformation [59],\
    \ thus it is necessary to educate farmers about the water law and its existence.\n\
    Farmers may also choose an alternative that maximises their personal preferences\
    \ and make\ndecisions that lead to efficient outcomes [62].\nThe research findings\
    \ reveal that if the water law provides for conflict resolution, it positively\n\
    and significantly strengthens the effectiveness of the water law in the management\
    \ of water\nresources. This is explained by a regression coefficient of 0.475\
    \ at the 10% significance level.\nEffective conflict-solving provisions within\
    \ the water law can ensure that certain protocols are\nfollowed without bias towards\
    \ the parts concerned.\nA positive relationship, (regression coefficient of 0.208)\
    \ at the 1% significance level implies that\nprovisions for private sector participation\
    \ significantly strengthen the irrigation water law.\nClear provisions that allow\
    \ effective private sector participation in agricultural water man‐\nagement can\
    \ lead to effective water management. Water law should provide for private sector\n\
    participation to be an effective institution in managing agricultural water.\n\
    6.1.2. Policy variables\nThe study findings revealed that the irrigation water\
    \ policy is positively related to the criteria\non how irrigation projects are\
    \ selected (regression coefficient of 0.098 at the 10% significance\nlevel). This\
    \ suggests that project selection criterion significantly strengthens the effectiveness\n\
    of the water policy to manage irrigation water resources. For example, if the\
    \ irrigation water\npolicy clearly defines selection of projects based on economic\
    \ growth and development\nobjectives, the water policy will become an efficient\
    \ and effective water management institu‐\ntion.\nThe results of this study revealed\
    \ a negative relationship between the effectiveness of the\nirrigation water policy\
    \ and users paying for irrigation water, as shown by regression coefficient\n\
    of -0.079 at the 10% significance level. The implication is that if the irrigation\
    \ water policy has\nclearly specified clauses on users pay principles, then it\
    \ can significantly lead to effective\nirrigation water management. The negative\
    \ relationship implies that failure of farmers to pay\nfor water use negatively\
    \ affects the effectiveness of the irrigation water policy to manage\nagricultural\
    \ water, hence, can lead to poor irrigation water management.\nThere is a positive\
    \ relationship between the effectiveness of the irrigation water policy and\n\
    availability of provisions promoting private sector participation (regression\
    \ coefficient of\n0.091) at the 10% significance level. Unfavourable provisions\
    \ may discourage private sector\nparticipation and in the long-run, may lead to\
    \ ineffectiveness of the water law to manage water\nresources.\nOrganisation of\
    \ farmers into Water User Associations (WUAs) positively and significantly\nstrengthens\
    \ the effectiveness of the irrigation water policy to manage irrigation water\n\
    (regression coefficient of 0.657) at the 1% significance level. As such, favourable\
    \ clauses within\nthe irrigation water policy promoting and supporting users to\
    \ organise themselves into users\nNature and Role of Water Institutions — Implications\
    \ to Irrigation Water Management in Zimbabwe\n21\ngroups has the potential of\
    \ sustaining efficient irrigation water use as WUAs may have the\nopportunity\
    \ to enforce the use of restricted rules and regulations.\nThe results revealed\
    \ a negative relationship (regression coefficient of -0.181 at the 10% significance\n\
    level) between the effectiveness of the water policy and the extent to which WUAs/user\
    \ groups\nparticipate in water management. The negative relationship revealed\
    \ in this study implies that\nthe WUAs have not been effective in irrigation water\
    \ management. If the irrigation water\npolicy promotes organisation of the farmers\
    \ into user groups and/or WUAs, and allows for\ntheir extensive participation,\
    \ it can lead to an effective and sustained irrigation water man‐\nagement. In\
    \ addition, a positive regression coefficient of 0.128 at the 5% significance\
    \ level implies\nthat policy provisions that favour farmers’ participation leads\
    \ to effective irrigation water\nmanagement.\nThe results of this study revealed\
    \ a negative and significant relationship between the irrigation\nwater policy\
    \ and its relationship with other economic policies (regression coefficient of\
    \ -0.121 at\nthe 10% significance level). Lack of enabling policies and effective\
    \ institutional frameworks are\nmajor contributors towards poor management and\
    \ utilisation of irrigation water [3]. Moreover,\nthe linkage between the irrigation\
    \ water- policy and law revealed a positive and significant\nregression coefficient\
    \ of 0.201 at the 1% significance level. If the water law relates well to the\
    \ water\npolicy, it will lead to an effective irrigation water policy that will\
    \ ensure efficient and sustained\nwater resources management.\n6.1.3. Administration\
    \ variables\nThe results revealed a positive relationship between overall irrigation\
    \ water administration\nand administration capacity at scheme level (regression\
    \ coefficient of 1.106) at the 1% significance\nlevel). If administration capacity\
    \ exists at irrigation schemes, it strengthens the overall\nirrigation water administration\
    \ as a water management institution. Thus, capacitating farmers\nwith administration\
    \ roles, e.g. promoting organisation of farmers WUAs at scheme level can\nlead\
    \ to effective irrigation water management.\nThe results revealed a negative relationship\
    \ between overall irrigation water administration\nand the effectiveness of user\
    \ groups or WUAs in the administration of irrigation water\n(regression coefficient\
    \ of -0.063 at the 10% significance level). Thus, administration conditions\n\
    should promote effectiveness of users to manage water resources. WUAs, for example\
    \ can\nformulate farm plans for the area, market local produce, distribute farm\
    \ inputs, formulate rules\nfor the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure, devise\
    \ procedures for the distribution of water,\nand impose and collect irrigation\
    \ fees (Samad, 2005). The observed negative relationship\nimplies that currently,\
    \ water users are not effective in the management of water resources.\n6.2. Informal\
    \ institutions\nAccording to [5], a series of institutional arrangements have\
    \ been presented as panaceas to\nimprove water management: strong government agencies,\
    \ user organisations, and water\nmarkets. This is based on the fact that it is\
    \ difficult to transplant institutions from one context\nIrrigation and Drainage\
    \ - Sustainable Strategies and Systems\n22\nto the other due to diversified and\
    \ different local situations. As such, this paper also analysed\nhow significant\
    \ some of these arrangements are with regards to irrigation water management.\n\
    Informal irrigation water institution can be an effective water management tool\
    \ if local\nappropriation rules related to local conditions exist. [63] argues\
    \ that people will co-operate for\ntheir common good without provision of external\
    \ (state) coercion. A positive coefficient of 0.186\nat the 5% level was revealed\
    \ between the effectiveness of informal irrigation institution and\nthe existence\
    \ of localised appropriation rules. An increase by one unit point in the explanatory\n\
    variable increases the effectiveness of the informal institution in managing water\
    \ resources.\nThe significant relationship suggests that creating locally-based\
    \ rules makes informal irriga‐\ntion institution effective in water management.\
    \ Institutions contain an element of predictability\nas institutionalised rules\
    \ and norms hold a certain level of stability [64]. In addition, as\ninstitutions\
    \ change, societies adjust themselves accordingly to adapt to the changes [30,\
    \ 65].\nLocalised appropriation rules ensure that users behave according to defined\
    \ rules and\nregulations, failure of which punishments will be effected upon the\
    \ offenders as may be\ndefined by the rules. However, these appropriation rules\
    \ or conditions need to be strongly\nmonitored to promote effective water management.\
    \ This has been revealed by a coefficient of\n-0.163 at the 10% significance level.\
    \ A one unit point increase in the explanatory variable results\nin a decrease\
    \ by 0.163 in the effectiveness of the informal institutions in managing irrigation\n\
    water if the local rules are not monitored effectively. This implies that the\
    \ informal institutions\nbecome effective water management institution if the\
    \ created local rules are effectively\nmonitored. Effective rules encourage members\
    \ to co-operate towards a group strategy because\nthey provide certainty about\
    \ expected actions of others [63, 66].\nSome management mechanism, e.g. constitutions,\
    \ can be effective tools of implementing and\nmonitoring localised appropriation\
    \ rules. In light of this, the analysed empirical results\nrevealed a positive\
    \ regression coefficient 0.783 at the 5% level. The relationship implies that\
    \ a\none-point increase in the explanatory variable leads to a 0.783 increase\
    \ in the effectiveness of\nthe informal institutions in managing irrigation water\
    \ through effective constitutions. Man‐\nagement mechanisms ensure localised rules\
    \ are effectively implemented. The relationship also\nsuggests that the informal\
    \ rules become effective water management tools if regulation\nmechanisms are\
    \ existent and effective. Effectiveness of management mechanisms significantly\n\
    strengthens the effectiveness of informal rules in managing water resources. This\
    \ has been\nrevealed by a regression coefficient of 0.319 at the 1% significance\
    \ level. A one unit increase in\nthe effectiveness of management mechanisms increases\
    \ the effectiveness of the informal\ninstitutions by 0.319. The results suggest\
    \ that the more effective the management mechanism,\nthe more effective the informal\
    \ rules.\nEffectiveness of management mechanisms can be explained by existence\
    \ of regulation\nsanctions. Effectiveness in internal governance is needed for\
    \ the effective application of\ncommunity rules [11]. A significant relationship\
    \ has been revealed between effectiveness of\ninformal irrigation institutions\
    \ and existence of regulation sanctions, as shown by a coefficient\nof 0.689 at\
    \ the 1% level. Existence of regulation sanctions increases the effectiveness\
    \ of the\ninformal institutions by 0.689 given a one unit point increase in the\
    \ explanatory variable.\nNature and Role of Water Institutions — Implications\
    \ to Irrigation Water Management in Zimbabwe\n23\nExistence of regulation sanctions\
    \ ensures implementation of informal rules as an effective tool\nin managing water\
    \ resources.\nExistence of rapid access to conflict-solving in a low-cost and\
    \ local setting significantly\nstrengthens the effectiveness of formal rules to\
    \ manage water resources. A coefficient of 1.418\nat the 1% significance level\
    \ suggests that a one-point increase in the existence of rapid access\nto conflict-solving\
    \ results in a 1.148 increase in the effectiveness of the informal water institu‐\n\
    tions. This suggests that farmers simply solve their conflicts at scheme level\
    \ than attempting\nto follow the formal channels to courts, which may take long\
    \ to solve such conflicts. However,\nformal courts tend to nullify the rulings\
    \ of informal arbitration [35]. This may imply perpet‐\nuation of conflict, eventually\
    \ leading to poor irrigation water management.\n7. Conclusions\nThe main thrust\
    \ of institutional change within the irrigation water sector is to enhance the\n\
    capabilities and increase the readiness of policymakers to solve the current and\
    \ future\nagricultural water resources challenges with regards to their development\
    \ and management.\nGiven this thrust, the major goals of institutional initiatives\
    \ in the water sector include: treating\nwater as an economic good where prices\
    \ are attached to use of irrigation water; inculcating a\npayment culture; and\
    \ promoting effective, sustainable, decentralized decision structures.\nInstitutional\
    \ reform of the magnitude required to achieve these goals is a daunting challenge\n\
    in Zimbabwe, particularly with the ineffective, irrelevant and poorly functioning\
    \ irrigation\nwater institutions. The issue of how to achieve irrigation water\
    \ institutional change within the\nconstraints and opportunities of political\
    \ economy continue to remain elusive to both re‐\nsearchers and policymakers as\
    \ most smallholder irrigation farmers still remain disadvantaged\nwith regards\
    \ to irrigation water resources development and management.\nIt is important to\
    \ note that institutions typically change incrementally rather than in discon‐\n\
    tinuous fashion [11]. Even if some change is anticipated by a new policy or law,\
    \ it is fairly\ncommon that the society adopts it slowly. The main reason for\
    \ this incremental change is that\nthere are many institutional elements which\
    \ are interconnected, and a change gets cushioned\nby many other established institutional\
    \ elements. Nonetheless, the important issue for policy\nmakers is to ensure recommended\
    \ polices are put on the table for consideration, especially in\nZimbabwe where\
    \ policy changes are imminent due to new users in the irrigation sector.\nWith\
    \ regards to informal institutions, there were no clear boundaries to withdraw\
    \ water\nresources from the CPRs, compounded by lack of local appropriation rules\
    \ to regulate water\nmanagement. Some management mechanisms did not exist at schemes,\
    \ and where they\nexisted, they not effective in managing water resources. Monitoring\
    \ conditions and the\nbehaviour of appropriators at scheme levels was not effective,\
    \ owing to lack of effective\nmanagement mechanisms and regulation sanctions.\
    \ Rapid conflict-solving mechanisms were\nnon-existent at schemes. Users had little\
    \ capacity to challenge the rights of appropriators to\ncreate own local rules\
    \ and the extent to which they challenge was not effective. The informal\nIrrigation\
    \ and Drainage - Sustainable Strategies and Systems\n24\ninstitutions were not\
    \ effective enough to influence how the formal institutions manage water\nresources\
    \ owing to the fact that the informal institutions are ignored and neglected,\
    \ yet they\nguide the day-to-day water management activities. They are not regarded\
    \ as instruments for\neffective irrigation water management, hence the lack of\
    \ influence of the informal institutions\non formal institutions. Lastly, the\
    \ paper also noted the role and significance of the informal\nwater management\
    \ institutions in the effective management of water resources.\n8. Policy recommendations\n\
    This research indicates that attempts to reform the water sector with the view\
    \ to improve\nproductive uses of water in rural areas, must confront the historical\
    \ legacy of inequalities of\naccess to land and water, which has continued under\
    \ the FTLRP. One way of attaining\nimprovement is to promote wide-scale participation\
    \ of all stakeholders in the debate about the\nwater reform over a long period\
    \ of time. This will also entail seeking policy suggestions from\nall stakeholders,\
    \ particularly the poor, on how water policy can be improved. Such an approach\n\
    will break the stranglehold that government and donors have on the water policy-making\n\
    process. In addition, issuance of water permits to water users will promote sustainable\
    \ and\nefficient use of irrigation water resources. Water rights give farmers\
    \ the sense of ownership\nand sense of belonging to water user groups which provides\
    \ incentive to use water in a\nsustainable and efficient manner. The irrigation\
    \ water law should provide clear provisions for\nthe issuance of water rights.\n\
    In the Zimbabwean context, this study suggests that water reform must be linked,\
    \ in innovative\nways to the FTLRP, which aimed at providing access to productive\
    \ land to rural people for\nlivelihood improvement. It is the combined access\
    \ to productive land and water, that water\ncan be productively used to alleviate\
    \ poverty and contribute to economic growth. Although\naccess to fertile land\
    \ is crucial to productive uses of water, new water users need access to a\nbroad\
    \ portfolio of other assets central to the productive use of water such as functioning\n\
    irrigation technology and infrastructure. A new water policy should focus the\
    \ development,\nprovision and maintenance of relevant low-cost irrigation technology\
    \ to communal farmers.\nWater policy should provide greater local control of water\
    \ charges. Revenue raised can be used\nto fund water development projects and\
    \ maintain irrigation infrastructure within communal\nirrigation schemes. A policy\
    \ that inculcates a culture of paying for commercial irrigation water\nand ensuring\
    \ water revenue is re-invested in water resources development and management\n\
    is needed along with the establishment of a water pricing structure that is consistent\
    \ with cost\nand social efficiency.\nThere is a need to strengthen WUAs so these\
    \ institutions can undertake the complex tasks\nof financial management and technical\
    \ support to irrigation communities. These capaci‐\nties are weak in most WUAs.\
    \ Government can provide education to enhance local admin‐\nistrative, managerial,\
    \ and financial capacities of participants. Water administration should\nencourage\
    \ better coordination between public-public and public-private sectors. In areas\n\
    where there is inadequate local revenue, government, private sector, NGOs and\
    \ other\nNature and Role of Water Institutions — Implications to Irrigation Water\
    \ Management in Zimbabwe\n25\ndevelopment agencies can fund water development\
    \ and the functioning of decentralised\ninstitutions  of  water  management. \
    \ There  is  need  for  information  dissemination  cam‐\npaigns where the regulation\
    \ of water users is undertaken.\nInterventions to strengthen the capacity of the\
    \ informal systems in managing water resources\nshould be formulated and implemented\
    \ effectively. This is because the formal institutions\ndraw heavily from the\
    \ informal institutions if they are to effectively work. Some local ar‐\nrangements\
    \ such as one-to-one conflict resolution mechanisms are more efficient, more cost-\n\
    effective, longer-lasting and more widely accepted among local water users than\
    \ most top-\ndown state-driven institutions. When considering formal state-based\
    \ institutions, water users\nshould not think that they are a panacea to all water\
    \ management challenges. In this regard,\nlocal informal water institutions should\
    \ not be discarded as primitive and obsolete tools. Local\nwater management arrangements\
    \ need to be given time to evolve, with limited interference\nfrom external agencies,\
    \ as they seek to address emerging water management imperatives\nespecially in\
    \ an environment that has been overwhelmed by new users in the irrigation sector.\n\

    • The air temperature estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis predictions.
    • Climate reanalysis provided reliable reference evapotranspiration estimates.
    • Different performances were obtained by ERA5 and ERA5-L for some variables.
    • The accuracy of the reanalysis products was influenced by the climatic conditions.
    Abstract Study region The study region is represented by seven irrigation districts
    distributed under different climate and topography conditions in Italy. Study
    focus This study explores the reliability and consistency of the global ERA5 single
    levels and ERA5-Land reanalysis datasets in predicting the main agrometeorological
    estimates commonly used for crop water requirements calculation. In particular,
    the reanalysis data was compared, variable-by-variable (e.g., solar radiation,
    Rs; air temperature, Tair; relative humidity, RH; wind speed, u10; reference evapotranspiration,
    ET0), with in situ agrometeorological observations obtained from 66 automatic
    weather stations (2008–2020). In addition, the presence of a climate-dependency
    on their accuracy was assessed at the different irrigation districts. New hydrological
    insights for the region A general good agreement was obtained between observed
    and reanalysis agrometeorological variables at both daily and seasonal scales.
    The best performance was obtained for Tair, followed by RH, Rs, and u10 for both
    reanalysis datasets, especially under temperate climate conditions. These performances
    were translated into slightly higher accuracy of ET0 estimates by ERA5-Land product,
    confirming the potential of using reanalysis datasets as an alternative data source
    for retrieving the ET0 and overcoming the unavailability of observed agrometeorological
    data. Graphical Abstract Download : Download high-res image (208KB) Download :

    Weather ground-based observationReanalysis datasetData-processingModelling and
    simulationWater managementIrrigation 1. Introduction The quantitative estimation
    of the evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes exchanged within the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum is a precondition for rational irrigation scheduling, crop yield forecasting,
    and hydrological modelling applications (Hupet and Vanclooster, 2001). Nowadays,
    the crop reference ET (ET0) formulation, proposed by Penman-Monteith (P-M) and
    popularized by the FAO-56 paper as a reference methodology for calculating crop
    water requirements (Allen et al., 1998), is still largely used for practical purposes
    (Pereira et al., 2015). The use of the P-M approach calls for the necessity of
    having a reliable and complete set of site-specific agrometeorological data. In
    fact, the P-M approach calculates the ET0 for a standard surface, requiring a
    complete set of ground-based agrometeorological data, such as the air temperature
    (Tair), the wind speed (u2), the solar radiation (Rs), and the relative humidity
    (RH), to parameterize the surface and aerodynamic resistances. Commonly, agrometeorological
    variables are measured by automatic weather stations. Their data integrity is
    ensured by proper data quality assessment and control procedures (De Pauw et al.,
    2000). However, ground-based observations could be affected by several errors,
    mainly due to the sensor properties, such as their accuracy, settings, instrument
    drift or temporal data sampling frequency (Beven, 1979, Hupet and Vanclooster,
    2001, Meyer et al., 1989). Other shortcomings are related to the agrometeorological
    time-series consistency. The time series can suffer from substantial time gaps
    (Capra et al., 2013) and often protocols for correcting and/or estimating poor
    quality or missing data need to be applied (see, e.g., Pereira et al., 2015).
    Moreover, the agrometeorological data representativeness of well-watered conditions
    needs to be checked before implementing them in the ET0 approach (Pereira et al.,
    2015). Despite the utmost importance of observed agrometeorological data for agriculture
    purposes, the agrometeorological networks are often sparse over the territory,
    especially in arid zones (De Pauw et al., 2000). Sometimes, data access is another
    critical point for end-users because data is managed and distributed by different
    regional services at the National level (Pelosi et al., 2021). To compensate for
    the lack of spatial and temporal distributed information, other weather data sources
    have steadily developed, such as the use of interpolation methods from gauge-based
    observations, the adoption of satellite-based datasets, or the creation of gridded
    datasets obtained by adjusting the spatial interpolation estimates with satellite
    observations (Pelosi et al., 2020). Moreover, during the last century, great advances
    have been reached in agrometeorological data forecasting using global and regional
    numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Several studies have already exploited
    their potential for supporting sustainable irrigation management (e.g. Negm et
    al., 2017; Chirico et al., 2018; Longo- Minnolo et al., 2020; Medina et al., 2018;
    Pelosi et al., 2016; Vanella et al., 2020). As an example, Vanella et al. (2020)
    showed that the use of forecast agrometeorological estimates provided by the Consortium
    for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO, http://www.cosmo-model.org) opens promising
    perspectives for assessing the ET0 in different agriculture contexts, particularly
    under conditions of water scarcity, instead than using past agrometeorological
    data. Besides the NWP models, the use of atmospheric reanalysis is another alternative
    weather data source. Atmospheric reanalysis has generated increasing interest
    in the recent decade, due to its ability to provide complete and consistent time-series
    of multiple meteorological parameters at a global scale by covering several decades
    (Tarek et al., 2020). From a theoretical point of view, the reanalysis process
    is a retrospective analysis of past historical data. This process makes use of
    the ever-increasing computational resources, recent versions of NWP models and
    assimilation schemes. In general, the reanalysis approaches assimilate a wide
    array of atmospheric and ocean measured and remotely sensed information within
    a dynamical–physical coupled numerical model (Poli et al., 2016). One of the recognized
    advantages of using reanalysis approaches is that their outputs are not directly
    dependent on the density of ground-based observational networks. Thus they have
    the potential to provide variables in areas with little and/or no surface coverage
    (Tarek et al., 2020). Moreover, Pelosi et al. (2020) reported that reanalysis
    data can represent an efficient data source for planning and design studies applied
    to irrigation water management. Currently, several modelling centres provide reanalysis
    products at variable spatial and temporal scales (Lindsay et al., 2014, Chaudhuri
    et al., 2013). As an example, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
    (ECMWF) periodically applies its forecast models and data assimilation systems
    to reanalyse archived observations for generating global data sets describing
    the recent history of the atmosphere, land surface, and oceans. The latest released
    ECMWF reanalysis products are ERA5 single levels (ERA5) and ERA5 Land (ERA5-L),
    which are being produced within the Copernicus Climate Change Service and freely
    distributed since 2019. The first dataset, ERA5, covers the entire globe from
    1979 at a spatial resolution of about 30 km (depending on latitude). The second
    dataset, ERA5-L, has been produced by replaying the land component of the ERA5
    climate reanalysis, with a horizontal spatial resolution of 9 km. Specifically,
    ERA5-L uses air temperature (Tair), air humidity and air pressure, in a process
    of atmospheric forcing, as input to control the simulated land fields. These atmospheric
    variables are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid
    of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-L (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019).
    A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art associated with the use of ERA5-L
    for land and environmental applications is presented by Muñoz-Sabater et al. (2021).
    They demonstrated the added value of ERA5-L reanalysis products, in comparison
    to ERA-Interim and ERA5, for estimating a wide range of in situ observations,
    even if they have not evaluated the performance of the reanalysis products in
    predicting ET fluxes. The specific objective of this study was to explore the
    effectiveness of using the most advanced global ECMWF reanalysis data (ERA5 single
    levels and ERA5-L) as a potential data source for predicting the main agrometeorological
    variables and estimating the ET0 in different climate contexts within the Italian
    territory, at daily and seasonal scales. In addition, visual Geographic Information
    System (GIS) based user-friendly tools have been developed in this study for guiding
    the users in the reanalyses data pre-processing steps. 2. Materials and methods
    The methodological approach proposed in this study was carried out in the framework
    of the research project INtegrated Computer modeling and monitoring for Irrigation
    Planning in Italy (INCIPIT). The general aim of the INCIPIT project is to identify
    a shared set of modelling tools and monitoring techniques for the assessment of
    irrigation water uses in seven irrigation districts distributed over the Italian
    territory. In this context, time series of daily values of the agrometeorological
    variables registered in 66 weather stations, referred to as the INCIPIT irrigation
    districts (Table 1 and Fig. 1), were collected. The use of the new generation
    ECMWF reanalysis datasets was then evaluated in comparison to the retrieved ground-based
    agrometeorological data for the ET0 estimation. Table 1. Denominations and locations

    full-size image Fig. 1. Location of the weather stations selected over the investigated
    irrigation districts within the Italian peninsula: (1) Lombardy; (2) Emilia-Romagna;
    (3) Campania; (4) Apulia; (5) Sardinia; and (6) Sicily (Eastern and Western sides).
    2.1. Ground-based agrometeorological variables at the study sites The observed
    agrometeorological data was acquired on a daily scale from 66 weather stations
    located in six different Italian administrative regions (Campania, Emilia-Romagna,
    Lombardy, Apulia, Sardinia, and Sicily), within the reference period 2008–2020
    (from January 1st 2008 to December 31st 2020). Due to the trans-regional component
    of this study, the observed agrometeorological data were provided from multiple
    ground-based sources managed by different Regional meteorological agencies located
    in each of the irrigation districts of interest (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The set
    of agrometeorological variables under investigation was composed of solar radiation
    (Rs, W m-2), maximum and minimum Tair measured at 2 m (°C), maximum and minimum
    relative humidity (RH, %), wind speed measured at 2 m (u2, m s-1) and 10 m (u10,
    m s-1), respectively, and ET0 estimates calculated with the P-M approach (mm d-1).
    The selection of the weather stations was based on a twofold criterion. Firstly,
    they were identified by setting a maximum distance (50 km) between the centroid
    of each of the 7 irrigation districts under study (whose coordinates are reported
    in Table 1) and the candidate weather stations. Secondly, the selection was refined
    based on the temporal consistency (i.e. continuous time series) and completeness
    (i.e. the complete set of data) of the available agrometeorological series. Under
    these criteria, more than 50 million records were acquired from 66 weather stations,
    covering a great range of climatic conditions, mainly in terms of the different
    irrigation district geographic locations (i.e., northern, central and insular
    Italy) and elevation features (Table 1). Note that the available dataset for Sardinia
    sites was only composed of the ET0 estimates. In particular, under the improved
    Köppen-Geiger classification, recently provided at 1-km resolution by Beck et
    al. (2018), a number of 7 weather stations located in Apulia are characterized
    by arid, steppe, cold climate (BSk); 24 sites, placed in Campania, Sicily (Eastern
    and Western part) and Sardinia, are featured by dry and hot-summer temperate climate
    (Csa); and 32 sites, located in Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy, are referred to no
    dry season, hot summer temperate climate conditions (Cfa). The quality of the
    ground-based data was checked according to the procedure proposed in Allen (1996).
    Daily ground-based data was aggregated in 4 periods for seasonality analyses on
    the astronomical basis, as follows: winter (1st January–19th March and 21st-31st
    December), spring (20th March–20th June), summer (21st June– 22nd September),
    and autumn (23rd September–20th December). 2.2. Reanalysis datasets description
    The technical characteristics of the used reanalysis datasets (ERA5 single levels
    and ERA5-L) and the related data-processing steps are described in Sections 2.2.1
    and 2.2.2, respectively. 2.3. Reanalysis data collection and characteristics In
    this study, the most advanced global reanalysis data produced in Europe by ECMWF
    has been used: ERA5 single levels (Hersbach et al., 2020) and ERA5-L (Muñoz-Sabater,
    2019). The main technical details of these reanalysis datasets are reported in
    Table 2. Table 2. Main technical details of the reanalysis datasets used in this
    study. Reanalysis dataset characteristics ERA5 ERA5-L Data type Gridded Projection
    Regular latitude-longitude grid Horizontal coverage Global Horizontal resolution
    (atmosphere) 0.25° x 0.25° 0.1° x 0.1° Temporal coverage 1979 to present 1950
    to present Temporal resolution Hourly The ERA5 dataset is the 5th generation of
    ECMWF global reanalysis succeeding ERA-Interim and covering the entire globe from
    1979, at a spatial resolution of about 30 km. The ERA5-L dataset is generated
    for the entire globe with a native horizontal resolution of about 9 km (released
    on a regular 0.1◦ x 0.1◦ grid) by replaying the land component of ERA5 climate
    reanalysis, from 1981 to 2–3 months before the present. Specifically, the atmospheric
    forcing in ERA5-L is provided by land fields of ERA5 atmospheric variables. In
    ERA5, Tair, air humidity and air pressure are corrected to account for the elevation
    difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher-resolution grid of ERA5-L,
    according to the so-called lapse rate correction (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019). Although
    ERA5-L runs at the enhanced spatial resolution, there is a limit that data are
    not provided for numerical grid points falling on the sea surface or in the proximity
    of the coastline (Pelosi et al., 2020). The ERA5 and ERA5-L reanalysis datasets
    were freely downloaded from the Climate Change Service Copernicus platform (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset)
    through the Climate Data Store web interface v.1.0 in Network common data form
    (NetCDF) format for the entire Italian domain (1221.79 ×916.46 km), as for the
    ground-based observations, within the reference period 2008–2020. The hourly agrometeorological
    variables of interest were: the Tair (''2m_temperature'', t2m, °C) and the dew
    point temperatures (Tdew, named as ''2m_dewpoint_temperature d2m, m s-1''); the
    Rs (''surface_solar_radiation_downwards'', ssrd, J m-2) and; the vertical and
    horizontal component of the wind speed (''10m_u_component_of_wind'', U10, m s-1,
    and ''10m_v_component_of_wind'', V10, m s-1). 2.3.1. Data pre-processing steps
    Both hourly ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L data were aggregated at a daily time
    step to be compared variable-by-variable with the ground-based observations. The
    daily minimum and maximum Tair and Tdew values were obtained from the hourly data.
    The daily Tair comparisons were carried out considering the average of the daily
    maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperatures (Tmin). The daily Rs values were aggregated
    on 24 h basis. The daily RH was calculated as the ratio between the actual (ea)
    and the saturation (eo(T)) vapour pressure using the average Tair and Tdew derived
    on 24 h basis as inputs, according to the formula proposed in Allen et al. (1998):
    (1) (2) (3) The daily wind speed at 10 m (u10, m s-1) was calculated using the
    horizontal and vertical components (V10 and U10) retrieved by ERA5 and ERA5-L
    datasets, as reported in Allen et al. (1998). Note that the wind speed comparison
    between the ground-based and reanalysis observations was performed on the u10
    basis. The wind speed at 2 m (u2) was rescaled, from the logarithmic wind profile,
    for being used as input in the ET0 calculation using the P-M approach (see Section
    2.3). The above-mentioned reanalysis datasets data pre-processing steps were performed
    using five ad hoc GIS-based toolboxes developed in ArcPy (ESRI©) (see “Supplementary
    materials” section). The reanalysis post-processed data were extracted from the
    overall domain at the weather stations'' location variable-by-variable (Fig. 1).
    Finally, as for the daily ground-based data, the reanalysis data were aggregated
    in four periods for seasonality analyses using the same time step as used for
    the ground-based data. 2.4. Calculating daily ET0 estimates Although ERA5 single
    levels and ERA5-L provide potential evapotranspiration data (ETp), this variable
    is conceptually different from ET0 estimates as defined in the FAO-56 paper (Allen
    et al., 1998). In particular, ETp is computed in ERA5 based on surface energy
    balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to "crops/mixed farming"
    and assuming "no stress from soil moisture" (Hersbach et al., 2018), whereas,
    ETp in ERA5-L is computed as open water evaporation assuming that the atmosphere
    is not affected by the artificial surface condition (Muñoz 2019). Thus, in this
    study daily ET0 estimates were obtained by implementing the reanalysis of agrometeorological
    data through the Penman-Monteith (PM) method (Penman, 1956, Monteith, 1965), as
    follows: (4) where, Rn is the net radiation at the grass surface and G is the
    soil heat flux density (in MJ m-2 d-1 for a 24-h daily time step); Cn and Cd are
    constants, equal to 900 and 0.34, respectively, which vary according to the time
    step, the reference crop type and daytime/night-time ratio; T is the mean daily
    Tair (°C); γ is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve at Tair (kPa
    °C-1); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C-1); es is the saturation vapour
    pressure at Tair (kPa); ea is the average daily actual vapour pressure (kPa);
    and u2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s-1). Note that the daily
    ET0 ground-based estimates (mm d-1) were provided at all site locations by the
    Regional meteorological agencies (Table 1), except for Campania and Emilia-Romagna
    regions for which daily ET0 values were estimated by Eq. 4 using the agrometeorological
    information measured in situ. 2.5. Statistical indicators The comparisons between
    the reanalysis-based agrometeorological estimations, from ERA5 and ERA5-L, respectively,
    and the ground-based observations were assessed using different statistical metrics,
    such as the slope of the regression line forced by the origin; the coefficient
    of determination (R2); the root-mean-square error (RMSE; Eq. 5); the mean bias
    error (BIAS; Eq. 6); the mean absolute error (MAE; Eq. 7), and the normalized
    root-mean-square error (NRMSE; Eq. 8); calculated as follows: (5) (6) (7) (8)
    where is the simulated value by ERA5 and ERA5-L dataset, respectively, is the
    observed value from the ground-based agrometeorological stations, where and are
    the averages of the data arrays of and , and n is the number of observations.
    The difference in reproducing the agrometeorological variables by ERA5 and ERA5-L
    products, respectively, was assessed by applying the least-squares linear regression
    method and by comparing the outputs of the regression lines in terms of slope
    (for p-values < 0.05). This statistical analysis was conducted using the R software
    (R Core team, 2020). The evaluation of the topographic effect on the agrometeorological
    variables obtained by the reanalysis datasets was assessed by comparing the elevation
    of the selected weather stations (Table 1) with the average elevation observed
    at the cell-size of the ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L datasets (30 and 9 km),
    respectively (see “Supplementary materials” section). In particular, the main
    zonal statistics (count, mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and median
    values) of the elevation values were extracted at the level of the cell containing
    the weather stations (Table 1) from a digital elevation model, with a spatial
    resolution of 75 m, released by the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the
    Protection of the Territory and the Sea. 3. Results 3.1. Agrometeorological variable-by-variable

    and ERA5-L reanalysis agrometeorological estimates (Tair, Rs, u2, RH and ET0),
    respectively, and the relative ground-based variables are reported hereafter variable-by-variable
    for the irrigation districts under study (Table 1), referring to the period 2008–2020.

    linear regression analysis carried out to compare the daily reanalysis datasets
    (i.e., ERA5 and ERA5-L) versus the observed agrometeorological data showed significant
    differences in terms of slopes values for all the variables of interest also at
    the seasonal level. 3.1.1. Air temperature (Tair) 3.1.1.1. Tair: ERA5 versus ground-observations
    Daily average Tair values were estimated with good accuracy by the ERA5 reanalysis
    dataset at all the irrigation districts under study (Table 3), showing average
    RMSE values of 1.46 °C, 1.70 °C and 1.76 °C; and MAE values of 1.15 °C, 1.29 °C
    and 1.42 °C under Bsk, Cfa and Csa climate conditions, respectively. The average
    values of NRMSE varied between 0.09 and 0.14; reaching minimum and maximum values
    under Bsk and Csa-Cfa climate conditions, respectively. The PBIAS values varied
    from 0.38% (in Eastern Sicily study sites) to 6.62% (in Emilia-Romagna study sites)
    and − 9.22% (in Campania study sites); showing average values of − 2.12%, 3.12%
    and 4.14% under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively, with average
    R2 values varying between 0.94 (Csa) and 0.97 (Bsk). The slope values (b) ranged
    from 0.91 to 1.04, indicating a site-specific underestimation of 9% and overestimation
    of 4% in Campania and Emilia-Romagna study sites, respectively (Fig. 2a-f). On
    a seasonal basis, the best Tair performance was observed in autumn, showing average
    RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.61 °C, 1.27 °C, 2.64%, 1.01 and 0.89, respectively.
    Similar performances were obtained in spring-summer seasons (with average RMSE,
    MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.72 °C, 1.35 °C, −0.62%, 0.99 and 0.79, respectively),
    while a slightly lower accuracy was observed in winter (with average RMSE, MAE,
    PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.70 °C, 1.34 °C, 5.14%, 1.00 and 0.72, respectively).
    The same trend was observed in terms of NRMSE values. Specifically, the Tair predictions
    reached the best performance in Apulia study sites during winter and summer (with
    RMSE and MAE values of 1.35 and 1.08 °C, respectively), followed by spring and
    autumn in Eastern Sicily and Lombardy study sites; whereas the lowest Tair performance
    was obtained in Campania study sites during all seasons (Table 3). 3.1.1.2. Tair:
    ERA5-L versus ground-observations Daily average Tair values were predicted with
    acceptable accuracy by the ERA-L reanalysis dataset at all the irrigation districts
    under study (Table 4), resulting in average RMSE values of 1.76 °C, 1.82 °C and
    1.97 °C; and MAE values of 1.44 °C, 1.39 °C and 1.44 °C under Csa, Cfa and Bsk
    climate conditions, respectively. The average NRMSE values varied between 0.08
    and 0.16; with similar values under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions The PBIAS
    values ranged between 1.35% (in Emilia-Romagna study sites) to − 11.75% (in Campania
    study sites); showing average values of − 4.87%, − 2.38% and 2.46% in Csa, Cfa
    and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. The average R2 values ranged from 0.93
    (Csa) to 0.95 (Cfa and Bsk); and the slope values (b) ranged from 0.89 to 0.99,
    indicating a maximum and minimum underestimation of 11% and 1% in Campania and
    Emilia-Romagna study sites, respectively (Fig. 2g-l). Seasonally greater Tair
    predictions were retrieved in summer and autumn seasons, resulting in average
    RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.73 °C, 1.36 °C, − 2.39%, 0.97 and 0.81,
    respectively; whereas, slightly lower Tair performance were observed in spring
    and winter seasons, showing average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.89 °C,
    1.48 °C, − 5.38%, 0.93 and 0.80, respectively. A similar trend was observed in
    terms of NRMSE values. Specifically, the Tair predictions reached the best performance
    at Eastern Sicily study sites during spring and autumn-winter periods (with average
    RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.28 °C, 1.02 °C, −1.31%, 0.98 and 0.92,
    respectively) and in summer in Western Sicily study sites (Table 4); whereas the
    lowest Tair performance was obtained in Campania study sites during all seasons
    (Table 4). 3.1.2. Solar radiation (Rs) 3.1.2.1. Rs: ERA5 versus ground-observations
    ERA5 dataset showed good performance in estimating daily Rs under all the examined
    climate conditions (Table 3), showing average RMSE values of 32.27 W m-2, 32.43 W m-2,
    and 45.03 W m-2; MAE of 23.67 W m-2, 24.20 W m-2 and 30.72 W m-2, and NRMSE of
    0.17, 0.21 and 0.24 in Csa, Cfa and Bsk, respectively. Average PBIAS values ranged
    between 0.83% (Cfa) to 2.93% (Csa) and − 5.21% (Bsk), corresponding to R2 values
    of 0.88, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. The slope terms (b) presented the same trend
    with values from 1.00 to 0.96 and 0.91 under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions,
    respectively. Seasonally, the best Rs performance was retrieved in autumn (with
    average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 27.36 W m-2, 20.34 W m-2, and 1.93%, respectively;
    and b and R2 terms of 0.88 and 0.67, respectively) at all site locations (except
    for Campania locations), followed by winter and summer. Slightly lower Rs performance
    was obtained in spring, resulting in average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values
    of 43.17 W m-2, 32.09 W m-2, 2.20%, 0.96 and 0.48, respectively. In absolute terms,
    the best Rs predictions were reached in Western Sicily study sites during summer
    (also in terms of NRMSE values) and in Emilia-Romagna study sites for the other
    seasons (Table 3); whereas the lowest Rs performance was obtained in Bsk climate
    condition (Apulia study sites) during all seasons and in Campania sites for the
    autumn season in terms of NRMSE (Table 3). 3.1.2.2. Rs: ERA5-L versus ground-observations
    Daily Rs values were predicted with good accuracy by the ERA5-L reanalysis dataset
    at all study sites (Table 4), resulting in average RMSE values of 32.53 W m-2,
    34.33 W m-2 and 44.98 W m-2, and NRMSE values of 0.17, 0.21 and 0.24 under Csa,
    Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. Average MAE values ranged from 23.87 W m-2
    (Csa) to 25.06 W m-2 (Cfa) and 30.67 W m-2 (Bsk); and PBIAS values varied between
    0.96% (Cfa) to 3.09% (Csa) and − 5.29% (Bsk). The R2 values and slope terms (b)
    varied from 0.80 to 0.86 and 0.87, and from 0.91 to 0.96 and 1.00, under Bsk,
    Csa and Cfa climate conditions, respectively (Fig. 3g-l). At the seasonal level,
    the Rs predictions reached the best performance in autumn at all climate conditions
    (except for Campania locations also in terms of NRMSE), with average RMSE, MAE
    and PBIAS values of 27.96 W m-2, 20.73 W m-2, and 2.02%, respectively; and b and
    R2 terms of 0.92 and 0.65. The lower performance was observed in spring under
    all climate conditions, with average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 44.23 W m-2,
    32.57 W m-2, and 2.35%, respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.98 and 0.46, respectively.
    (Table 4). Intermediate Rs performances were observed in winter and summer (Table
    4). Partially different results were observed in terms of NRMSE showing greater
    performances in summer followed by spring and winter-autumn seasons. The Rs predictions
    reached the best performance in Western Sicily during spring and summer periods
    (Table 4) and in autumn and winter seasons under Cfa climate conditions (Lombardy
    and Emilia-Romagna study sites); whereas the lowest Rs performance was obtained
    under Bsk climate condition (Apulia study sites) during all seasons also in terms
    of NRMSE values (Table 4). 3.1.3. Wind speed (u10) 3.1.3.1. u10: ERA5 versus ground-observations
    The performances of the ERA5 dataset in predicting daily u10 values are shown
    in Table 3 and Fig. 4a-f. The ERA5 accuracy shows a specific pattern as a function
    of the climate conditions, resulting in average RMSE values of 1.04 m s-1, 1.21 m s-1
    and 1.57 m s-1 under Cfa, Csa, and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. Similar
    behaviour is observed in terms of average MAE values, ranging from 0.73 m s-1
    (Cfa) to 0.91 m s-1 (Csa) and 1.17 m s-1 (Bsk). Inversely, PBIAS values were equal
    to − 19.43%, − 20.54%, and − 25.21% from Bsk to Csa and Cfa climate conditions,
    respectively. Lower R2 values were obtained at all study sites, with b terms ranging
    from 0.66 and 0.74 in Cfa-Bsk and Csa climate conditions, respectively. A similar
    trend was observed in terms of NRMSE values. ERA5 performance increased in summer-autumn/spring
    periods (with average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, NRMSE, b and R2 values of 1.16 m s-1,
    0.87 m s-1, −22.53%, 0.46, 0.70 and 0.18, respectively). Lower performance was
    observed in winter, resulting in average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, NRMSE, b and R2 values
    of 1.36 m s-1, 0.97 m s-1, − 19.30%, 0.51, 0.71 and 0.22, respectively. In particular,
    relatively better performance was observed in Campania (summer) and Lombardy study
    sites (for the rest of the seasons) (Table 3), whereas, lower performance was
    registered during winter and summer in Apulia study sites, during spring for Emilia-Romagna
    and autumn for Western Sicily study sites, respectively (Table 3). 3.1.3.2. u10:
    ERA5-L versus ground-observations The accuracy and performance indicators of the
    ERA5-L dataset in predicting daily u10 values are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4g-l.
    Similarly to ERA5, the ERA5-L accuracy shows a specific pattern as a function
    of the climate conditions, resulting in average RMSE values of 1.26 m s-1, 1.37 m s-1
    and 1.75 m s-1 in Cfa, Csa, and Bsk climate conditions, respectively; showing
    similar trends in terms of average MAE values, that ranged from 0.96 m s-1 (Cfa)
    to 1.10 m s-1 (Csa) and 1.34 m s-1 (Bsk). Conversely, PBIAS values varying between
    − 23.50% (Bsk) to − 26.40% (Csa) and − 37.17% (Cfa); with R2 and NRMSE values
    varying from 0.06 (Bsk) to 0.25 (Cfa) and 0.45 (Csa) and from 0.64 to 0.62 and
    0.52, under Bsk, Cfa and Csa climate conditions, respectively. The slope terms
    (b) ranged from 0.58 (Cfa) to 0.64 (Bsk) and 0.72 (Csa), indicating an underestimation
    varying from 28% to 36% and 42%, under Csa, Bsk and Cfa climate conditions, respectively.
    At the seasonal level, the u10 predictions reached the best performance in autumn,
    with average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 1.34 m s-1, 1.01 m s-1, and − 20.79%,
    respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.68 and 0.26, respectively. Lower performance
    was observed in winter, resulting in average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values
    of 1.47 m s-1, 1.11 m s-1, − 23.86%, 0.70 and 0.32, respectively. Moderate u10
    performances were observed in the other seasons (Table 4). Slight differences
    were observed in terms of NRMSE values. Specifically, the u10 predictions reached
    the best and worst performance at Lombardy and Apulia study sites, respectively,
    during all seasons (Table 4). 3.1.4. Relative humidity (RH) 3.1.4.1. RH: ERA5
    versus ground-observations Good accuracy was observed in the estimation of daily
    RH values by ERA5 at all study sites (Table 3), resulting in a similar trend of
    RMSE and MAE, with values of these indicators ranging from 8.78% to 9.55% and
    19.02%, and from 6.88% to 7.47% and 15.30% under Cfa, Csa and Bsk climate conditions,
    respectively. Similar behaviour was observed in terms of NRMSE, PBIAS and b values,
    showing better performances from Cfa to Csa and Bsk climates (Fig. 5a-f). The
    slope terms and R2 values ranged from 0.81 to 1.04, and from 0.34 to 0.66, respectively.
    On a seasonal basis, the ERA5 accuracy was better in autumn and winter (average
    RMSE, MAE and NMRSE values of 10.07%, 8.06% and 0.13), followed by spring and
    summer seasons (average RMSE, MAE and NMRSE values of 11.23%, 8.96% and 0.16,
    respectively). In particular, the best ERA5 performance was retrieved at Campania
    (spring-summer), Lombardy (autumn) and Western Sicily (winter) study sites. Lower
    accuracy was obtained at Apulia study sites for all seasons. 3.1.4.2. RH: ERA5-L
    versus ground-observations The daily RH estimates predicted by ERA5-L in comparison
    to the ground-based measurements resulted in RMSE values ranging between 9.63%
    and 9.82% under Cfa and Csa climate conditions, respectively, reaching 15.98%
    in Bsk conditions (Fig. 5g-l). Similar trend was observed in terms of NRMSE values.
    This behaviour resulted in MAE and PBIAS values of 7.57%, 7.85%, 12.03% and 5.55%,
    7.66%, − 11.92% under Cfa, Csa and Bsk conditions, respectively. Similar trends
    were observed for the b and R2 terms, showing values of 1.04–1.06 and 0.86 and
    0.41–0.52 and 0.27 under Cfa-Csa and Bsk conditions, with overestimation of 4–6%
    in Cfa and Csa and underestimation of 14% at Apulia study site (Bsk). At the seasonal
    level, the overall best RH performance was observed in autumn (Table 4), with
    average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS and NRMSE values of 10.24%, 8.17%, 3.07% and 0.13, respectively.
    Similar performances were retrieved in winter and spring, with slightly lower
    ERA5-L accuracy during summer (Table 4). Specifically, the best performance was
    observed at Campania (in summer) and Lombardy study sites (in the other seasons);
    whereas lower performance at Emilia-Romagna (in winter) and Apulia study sites
    (in the other seasons) (Table 4). 3.1.5. Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) 3.1.5.1.
    ET0: ERA5 versus ground-observations Daily ET0 estimates obtained using as inputs
    the agrometeorological information provided by the ERA5 dataset showed good accuracy
    in comparison to the ground-based ET0 estimates (Table 5 and Fig. 6a-m). In particular,
    the daily ET0 estimates reached the best performance under Csa-Cfa climate conditions
    (with average RMSE, MAE and NRMSE values of 0.66 mm d-1, 0.48 mm d-1, and 0.23,
    respectively). Lower performance was observed at Bsk, resulting in average RMSE,
    MAE and NRMSE values of 0.90 mm d-1, 0.67 mm d-1, and 0.31, respectively. Positive
    average PBIAS values were obtained at Bsk (7.90%), whereas negative average PBIAS
    values of − 4.25% and − 9.64% resulted under Csa and Cfa climate conditions. Table

    20.15 0.47 0.61 0.45 12.30 0.44 At the seasonal level, the ET0 performance was
    greater during winter and autumn periods (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and
    R2 values of 0.47 mm d-1, 0.34 mm d-1, 1.98%, 0.93 and 0.58, respectively), and
    lower, but still satisfactory, in spring and summer (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS,
    b and R2 values of 0.85 mm d-1, 0.67 mm d-1, −5.58%, 0.93 and 0.59, respectively).
    Similar values were observed in terms of NRMSE values among the seasons (Table
    5). Better accuracy was obtained at Lombardy (winter-autumn seasons), Campania
    (summer) and Eastern Sicily (spring) study sites; whereas, lower accuracy was
    reached at Apulia study sites for all seasons (Table 5). 3.1.5.2. ET0: ERA5-L
    versus ground-observations Overall, ERA5-L provided daily ET0 estimates with good
    accuracy (Table 5 and Fig. 6h-n). Specifically, the daily ET0 estimates reached
    the best performance under Csa and Cfa conditions (with average RMSE, MAE and
    NRMSE values of 0.63 mm d-1, 0.46 mm d-1 and 0.22, respectively) (Table 5 and
    Fig. 6h-n). The lower performance was observed at Bsk, with average RMSE, MAE
    and NRMSE values of 0.88 mm d-1, 0.64 mm d-1 and 0.30, respectively. Positive
    average PBIAS values were obtained under Bsk (5.86%); whereas under Csa and Cfa
    climate conditions resulted in values ranging from − 2.53% to − 10.81%, respectively.
    At the seasonal level, the ET0 performance resulted better in winter and autumn
    (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and R2 values of 0.50 mm d-1, 0.36 mm d-1, −3.84%,
    0.90 and 0.64, respectively), and lower, but still quite satisfactory, in spring
    and summer (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and R2 values of 0.77 mm d-1, 0.60 mm
    d-1, −3.53%, 0.94 and 0.63, respectively). As for the ERA5, similar values were
    observed in terms of NRMSE values among the seasons (Table 5). Greater accuracy
    was obtained at Lombardy (winter-autumn seasons) and Western Sicily (spring-summer
    seasons) study sites, while lower accuracy was obtained at Apulia study sites
    for all seasons (Table 5). 4. Discussion Climate reanalysis data have been widely
    used for hydrological and meteorological applications. However, it is still difficult
    to quantitatively estimate their accuracy due to their variability both at spatial
    and temporal scales, especially under complex topography and pronounced climatic
    heterogeneity (i.e., the rainfall) (Jiao et al., 2021). Often, ground variables
    are taken into account in the reanalysis process (such as air pressure, Tair,
    RH and u10) to improve the reanalysis data quality. However, if the data assimilation
    approach can improve data accuracy, by adding physically meaningful information
    from the predictive model, this is still subject to uncertainty. The main sources
    of uncertainty are due to numerical simulations, assimilation schemes and errors
    associated with the observation systems (Dee et al., 2011). In this sense, some
    studies showed that it is difficult to completely replace observational data with
    reanalysis information for describing the true state of the atmosphere (Bengtsson
    et al., 2004), e.g., for long-term climate trend studies (Liu et al., 2018) and/or
    for capturing seasonal and inter-annual changes (Jiao et al., 2021). This study
    explored the potential of using the new released ECMWF climate reanalysis datasets
    (i.e., ERA5 and ERA5-L) for proving daily and seasonal agrometeorological information
    (Tair, Rs, RH, u10 and ET0) by determining their performance against measured
    ground-based observations within the Italian territory in the reference period
    2008 – 2020. Moreover, since new user requirements are constantly emerging in
    society (Muñoz-Sabater et al., 2021), ad hoc user-interfaces GIS-based user-friendly
    tools have been developed in this study for supporting the needs of a diverse
    set of users, next to the climate and weather research motivations, within the
    reanalysis data pre-processing steps (Fig. 1.S-4. S). Herein, a generally good
    agreement was observed between the ability of ERA5 and ERA5-L products in reproducing
    the agrometeorological variables of interest (commonly used for ET calculation)
    in comparison to the ground-based observations collected at 66 study sites distributed
    over 7 irrigation districts. Specifically, the daily Tair estimates offered the
    most accurate reanalysis predictions, followed by the RH, Rs, and u10 variables,
    which still provided satisfactory results (Table 3, Table 4, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig.
    5). Similar (i.e., for RH) or slightly improved statistical metrics were obtained
    by ERA5 in comparison to ERA5-L (i.e., showing lower RMSE values than ERA5-L,
    for Tair and Rs, respectively, in 67% and 83% of the total number of the investigated
    irrigation districts). This can be attributed to the fact these variables are
    more homogeneous at the spatial scales provided by ERA5 products in comparison
    to ERA5-L (Fig. 5. S in Supplementary materials section). The u10 performance
    was always more consistent for ERA5 than ERA5-L in comparison to the observations
    at all irrigation districts, most likely because ERA5-L does not consider the
    influence of the sea surface in its products (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019). Altogether,
    the daily Tair, Rs, RH, and u10 estimates were more accurate during the autumn
    season for both reanalysis datasets (Table 3, Table 4). The influence of topographic
    features on the accuracy of the reanalysis data was also investigated, following
    the evidence that it could be significant provided by previous studies. For example,
    Gao and Hao (2014) evaluated the relationship existing between the elevation of
    the climate reanalysis data from ERA-Interim and the observed station’s elevation.
    These authors pointed out that differences in elevation can affect the accuracy
    of the reanalysis data, especially in areas with relatively higher altitudes.
    Analogous considerations are reported by Longo-Minnolo et al. (2022) for a Sicilian
    watershed, with elevation values ranging between 0 and 3313 m a.s.l., for which
    the highest RMSE values were observed in the ERA5-L cells with relatively higher
    variations in altitude. To overcome these shortcomings in mountainous areas, other
    authors suggest applying altitude correction procedures, especially for water
    vapour, precipitation and Tair estimates (Zhao et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2012;
    Hu et al., 2013; Negm et al., 2018). For altitudes below 1000 m (a.s.l.), however,
    Jiao et al. (2021) found a good agreement between climate reanalysis and observational
    data. Similar results emerged from this study, where no specific relationships
    were obtained between the elevation changes and the goodness of reanalysis datasets
    in reproducing the agrometeorological variables of interest, at the site-by-site
    scale, within the seven irrigation districts under investigation (Table 1). These
    findings show that the accuracy of the reanalyses products is strongly connected
    with the climatic conditions rather than the topographic distribution of the selected
    study sites. Due to the above-mentioned explanations and for maintaining the integrity
    of the reanalysis datasets, no topography corrections were applied in this study.
    The performance of reanalysis data strongly depends on the different climate conditions
    characterizing the investigated sites, as shown by Tarek et al. (2020). Specifically,
    these authors observed that Tair and precipitation estimated by ERA5 are systematically
    more performant in comparison to ERA-Interim at all the 13 Northern America climate
    zones under study. In addition, they reported that in situ measurements are higher
    than ERA5 for Cfa and hot-summer humid continental (Dfa) climate zones; elsewhere,
    these differences are less pronounced. In this sense, they did not experience
    the difference in hydrological modelling performance using both ERA5 products
    and observations over 9 of the 13 climate zones. For the remaining regions (Bsk,
    Cfa, Dfa, and warm-summer humid continental climate, Dfb), the use of observations
    resulted in improved hydrological modelling performance. In agreement with Tarek
    et al. (2020), in our study site-specific performance depended on the different
    investigated climate conditions (Table 1). In particular, the major part of the
    variables of interest (Rs, RH, u10 and ET0) resulted in greater and lower performance
    under Csa and Bks climate conditions, respectively, by both reanalysis datasets,
    except for Tair estimates provided by ERA5 that shows an inverted pattern due
    to the influence of the sea temperature in this product (Hersbach et al., 2020).
    Intermediate performance was observed under Cfa climate zones. The good quality
    of the reanalysis data was translated into reliable daily and seasonal ET0 estimates
    (with an underestimation from 2 up to 13% for the climate classes under study).
    Specifically, as for the other variables, ET0 estimates were more accurate in
    autumn/winter than in spring/summer by both reanalysis datasets in terms of RMSE
    values (Table 5 and Fig. 6). In addition, ERA5-L reproduces with greater accuracy
    and higher spatial resolution the ET0 observations at most of the study sites
    even under different climate conditions, i.e., showing lower RMSE values than
    ERA5 in 86% of the total number of the irrigation districts under study. Thus,
    the high accuracy obtained in this study when estimating ET0 by reanalysis products
    (resulting in RMSE and NRMSE values ranging between 0.57 and 0.90 mm d-1 and from
    0.17 to 0.31, respectively) suggests the potential use of this information for
    calculating the daily crop evapotranspiration rates aiming at supporting the irrigation
    scheduling. In this sense, Rolle et al. (2021) have recently estimated the global
    irrigation requirement of 26 crops by implementing the Hargreaves-Samani method
    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to calculate ET0, by using information on Tair and
    Rs retrieved by the ERA5 dataset. Other studies assessed the use of a blended
    set of weather input data composed of ERA5-L outputs and different sources of
    climate data (i.e., reanalysis data and satellite-based radiation data) to evaluate
    the ET0 for the Campania region (Pelosi et al., 2020, Pelosi and Chirico, 2021).
    Pelosi et al. (2021) combined the ERA5-L products with multispectral satellite
    imagery for estimating the past crop evapotranspiration. Under this scenario,
    the results of the present study may contribute to the informed use of reanalysis
    data in water management applications in Italy and elsewhere. 5. Conclusion This
    study explores the performance of the ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L in depicting
    the agrometeorological data from 2008 to 2020 in comparison to observational data
    measured at 66 sites distributed over 7 irrigation districts over the Italian
    territory. Specifically, the main findings that can be drawn from this study are
    the following: – the daily average Tair estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis
    predictions, followed by RH, Rs, and u10 variables. This was translated into reliable
    daily ET0 estimates resulting in RMSE and NRMSE values ranging between 0.57 and
    0.90 mm d-1 and from 0.17 to 0.31, respectively; – similar or slightly improved
    statistical metrics were obtained by ERA5 in comparison to ERA5-L in estimating
    RH, Tair and Rs; whereas the u10 and ET0 performances were more consistent by
    ERA5 and ERA5-L, respectively, when compared to the observations at the majority
    of the irrigation districts under study; – the Rs, RH, u10 and ET0 estimates resulted
    in higher and lower performance under Csa and Bks climate conditions, respectively,
    by both reanalysis datasets; conversely, a reverse pattern was obtained for Tair
    estimates provided by ERA5, being more accurate under Bsk. Intermediate performance
    was observed under Cfa climate zones. These results help to improve our understanding
    of the uncertain sources of reanalysis data under different climate conditions,
    the rational application of these datasets and the potential improvements for
    the next product generation. In addition, they open promising perspectives for
    the use of reanalysis data as an alternative data source to estimate ET0 for irrigation
    water management in different climate contexts, overcoming the limited availability
    of observed agrometeorological data in many areas. CRediT authorship contribution

    on the north-central Apennines where it is underestimated [10]. Anyway, with reference
    to several Italian irrigation districts, a general good agreement was obtained

    In nine of the last 10 years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    has

    reported that the average funds generated on-farm for farm operators to meet living

    expenses and debt obligations have been negative. This paper pieces together disparate

    data to understand why farm operators in the most productive agricultural systems

    on the planet are systematically losing money. The data-driven narrative we present

    highlights some troubling trends in US farm operator livelihoods. Though US farms

    are more productive than ever before, rising input costs, volatile production
    values,

    and rising land rents have left farmers with unprecedented levels of farm debt,
    low

    on-farm incomes, and high reliance on federal programs. For many US farm operators,

    the indicators of a “good livelihood”—stability, security, equitable rewards for
    work—are

    largely absent. We conclude by proposing three axes of intervention that would
    help

    US agriculture better sustain all farmers’ livelihoods, a crucial step toward
    improving

    overall agricultural sustainability: (1) increase the diversity of people, crops,
    and cropping

    systems, (2) improve equity in access to land, support, and capital, and (3) improve
    the

    quality, accessibility, and content of data to facilitate monitoring of multiple
    indicators of

    agricultural “success.”

    INTRODUCTION

    United States (US) agricultural systems excel at producing food, fuel, and ﬁber.
    The pursuit of

    productivity has fostered the development of technologies that increase eﬃciency
    (Tilman et al.,

    spend an average of only 8.6% of their disposable personal income on food—a number
    which

    has trended consistently downward since the 1960s (USDA ERS, 2021b). The focus
    on producing

    calories and consumer goods as cheaply as possible, however, has meant that the
    true costs of

    food production have been externalized—whether through the reduced nutritional

    and poorly documented databases, or in the hands of individuals

    working at federal institutions—to understand why farm

    operators in the most productive agricultural systems on the

    planet are systematically losing money. We construct a data-

    driven narrative that leverages the highest resolution data openly

    available to understand the following imperative questions:

    (1) Who operates US farms?

    (2) What is the state of US farm operator livelihoods?

    (3) Why are US farm operators systematically losing money?

    The goal of this paper is to link the insights and contradictions

    revealed by merging, cleaning, exploring, documenting, and

    sharing clean versions of available federal data with broader

    conversations around the causes and eﬀects of agricultural

    livelihood precarity. We also hope to contribute to important

    conversations about who and what is currently (not) monitored,

    how this reﬂects paradigms and priorities on who and what

    “counts” in US agriculture, and the importance of broadening

    deﬁnitions and metrics of “agricultural progress” to include the

    livelihoods of the individuals engaged in US agriculture.

    BACKGROUND

    One of the oldest questions in rural social science and theory

    has concerned the fate of agricultural producers. Which farmers

    in which contexts continue to farm, and why? This question

    has been pursued theoretically and empirically for decades in

    diﬀerent national settings; these works comprise the backbone

    of agrarian political economy and critical agrarian studies.

    Although a full accounting lies beyond the scope of this paper (for

    excellent reviews, see (Bernstein, 1994; Akram-Lodhi and Kay,

    2010a,b; Watts, 2021 and, for the US context speciﬁcally, Lobao

    and Meyer, 2001), we brieﬂy sketch its lineages here to anchor

    our questions. We pay particular attention to two areas. First,

    we sketch the theoretical roots of agrarian political economy

    to underscore the potential for data science to contribute

    to long-standing debates. Second, we summarize the factors

    underpinning the economic decline of US farm households

    to situate the trends we identify within the scholarship on

    their drivers.

    Critical agrarian studies’ roots lie in late 19th century eﬀorts

    to understand and predict peasant producers’ varied roles in

    diﬀerent processes of national development [Kautsky, 1983

    [1899]; Lenin, 1956 [1899]; Marx, 1995 [1867]]. The key question

    was whether agricultural production would or would not follow

    the trajectory of industry—would the agricultural sector also

    fracture into classes delineated by labor relations, or would

    the particular characteristics—the “dependent autonomy”—of

    peasantries act as a barrier to class polarization (Narotzky,

    2016)? A signiﬁcant thread within these conversations was

    establishing the logics and practices through which family farms

    could reproduce themselves from one generation to the next

    (Chayanov, 1966; van der Ploeg, 2013). After going dormant

    in the ﬁrst part of the 20th century, this question prompted

    renewed scholarly interest during the 1970s and 1980s against

    the backdrop of the Cold War; international work analyzed

    agrarian class evolution not as a universal process but rather as

    dynamics inescapably situated within regional historical contexts

    (Brenner, 1976; Goodman et al., 1987; Mann, 1990; Byres,

    1995). Agriculture’s requisite interface with the natural world

    and its biological cycles (Mann and Dickinson, 1978) and farm

    households’ ability to “self-exploit” family labor (Friedmann,

    1978; Reinhardt and Barlett, 1989) emerged as important

    explanations for how and why agricultural systems resisted class

    polarization in certain contexts.

    This body of scholarship remains the theoretical backbone for

    much critical social science work on the structure of agriculture

    in the US and its impacts on agricultural livelihoods. The

    long-term decline in number of US farms and farmers, the

    concomitant increase in average farm size, and the marginal

    ﬁnancial returns earned by most farms are widely reported trends

    (USDA ERS, 2021a). There is clearly money being made in

    agriculture, but the lion’s share largely accrues to processors,

    input suppliers, distributors, and retailers. Even as US production

    of grain commodities and livestock products have achieved

    record highs in recent years, agricultural livelihoods remain

    precarious. What conditions of US agriculture accounts for these

    trends? Drawing on and adapting the theoretical contributions

    of agrarian political economy, more recent agricultural social

    science scholarship has generated several explanations. First,

    the structure of agriculture changed drastically during the

    20th century. The sector trended heavily toward enterprise

    specialization, intensiﬁcation and over-production, and large-

    scale, monocultural production (Barlett, 1989; Buttel, 2006).

    Livestock and crop production became spatially segregated,

    creating waste disposal challenges for the former and fertility

    challenges for the latter (Berry, 1977). This process also

    created economic conditions opposing the interests of livestock

    producers who purchase feed as an input to grain producers,

    setting the stage for the uneven rewards of the ethanol boom

    (Baines, 2015). Second, these changes were made possible in

    part through the replacement of draft and human labor with

    capital intensive technology and equipment (Fitzgerald, 1991).

    The classic treadmill eﬀect has compelled growers to adopt new

    technologies to maintain competitiveness (Cochrane, 1993); as

    robotics, precision agriculture, and other digital technologies

    have become increasingly common in agriculture (Fraser, 2018;

    Carolan, 2020), the capital investment required to farm has

    risen exponentially (but see Janssen, 2018). Much work has

    also explicated the role that the World Trade Organization and

    other institutions of global governance played in re-writing the

    international trade rules that create the global market context on

    which commodity producers depend (Weis, 2007; McMichael,

    2009; Winders, 2020). Finally, an important through line across

    social science eﬀorts to understand the precarious economic

    situations of agricultural producers in the US has demonstrated

    the drivers and eﬀects of corporate consolidation in the food

    system (Hendrickson et al., 2002; Howard, 2016; Clapp, 2021).

    As food system power concentrates among fewer ﬁrms, farmers’

    economic choices become both constrained and compelled

    (Hendrickson et al., 2005: p. 283).

    Even as brieﬂy sketched here, the breadth and depth of this

    scholarship clearly outlines the structural contexts that create

    US Farm Operator Livelihoods

    growers’ fragile economic positions. The pressures exerted by

    supply-side input providers, market-side agricultural processors,

    and global markets render fragile growers’ autonomy and

    economic power. In response, some farmers pursue capital-

    intensive economies of scale, some stop farming, and some tap

    into the same reserves of family labor that have long reproduced

    agriculture (Kohl and Bennett, 1982; Reinhardt and Barlett,

    1989). Others opt out of the commodity system by pursuing

    direct-market or niche production (Paxson, 2013; Campbell and

    Veteto, 2015; Janssen, 2018), even as the logics of globalized

    industrial agriculture continue to inﬂuence their alternative

    agricultural livelihoods (Rissing, 2021). Yet, critical agrarian

    scholarship is rarely in conversation with the full accounting of

    nationally available data collected by the USDA; its empirical

    evidence is more often rooted in case studies or analyzing

    publicly available data at face value. The USDA, on the other

    hand, publishes an impressive array of statistically rigorous

    reports devoid of an avowed theoretical orientation. In charting a

    preliminary approach to bridging these longstanding bodies of

    disparate agricultural research, we show how data science can

    shed new light on the national patterns, regional contradictions,

    and historical trends of farmers’ livelihoods.

    This paper takes a deep and direct dive into these data,

    informed by the breadth of literature that has examined the

    livelihoods of US agricultural producers. We create a data-driven

    narrative that applies these theories to guide a critical engagement

    with USDA data and tell a more holistic story of who US farmers

    are, how they are doing, and how it has become this way. In

    examining this data, we also highlight the ways in which what

    we measure reﬂects national priorities—and call for an increase

    in the accessibility and coherence of agricultural data collection

    to identify and track the challenges farm operators face.

    DATA OVERVIEW

    We collected, cleaned, and merged multiple public datasets

    that monitor (1) historical descriptions of farm operations and

    operators (USDA Economic Research Service, henceforth ERS,

    compiled by R. Hoppe and provided to the authors), (2) operator

    demographics (USDA Census of Agriculture, or CoA, accessed

    through the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, or

    NASS), (3) indicators of farm management (CoA), and (4)

    production expenditures and revenues (US Bureau of Economic

    Analysis, henceforth BEA; USDA CoA). A full list of datasets,

    including descriptions of their spatiotemporal resolution, unit

    deﬁnitions, and links to tidy data for download can be found in

    Supplementary Table 1.

    These data present several important limitations that we

    cannot overlook. First, while the goal of this paper is to

    start a broader conversation about the livelihoods of those

    engaged in US agriculture, the USDA largely monitors the

    attributes of farm operations—deﬁned as a place from which

    more than $1,000 of agricultural products were produced

    and sold in a year2—and principal farm operators—or the

    2Though the current deﬁnition of farm operation has been in place since 1974,

    thereit was established in 1850 (US Department of Commerce, 1992). Though this

    persons primarily responsible for on-farm decision-making3.

    The majority of the visualizations presented focus on these two

    units of analysis. When this is not the case, we explicitly deﬁne

    the alternative unit of analysis (Supplementary Table 1). We

    readily acknowledge that this focus on farm operations and

    principal farm operators4 excludes, among others, the over 2.5 M

    farmworkers essential to US agriculture not listed as principal

    farm operators (National Center for Farmworker Health, 2020)

    who are, in large part, systemically vulnerable and unprotected

    within the US agriculture system (Calo and De Master, 2016;

    Snipes et al., 2017; Klocker et al., 2020; Soper, 2020). However,

    there are no nationally representative databases analogous to

    the USDA CoA for farm operators available for the mobile and

    diverse population of US farmworkers5. Because this population

    is under-surveyed, they are also understudied—this is an urgent

    limitation of both this research and the broader conversation

    about agricultural livelihoods in the US.

    Second, though we visualize and describe data at the highest

    spatial resolution available, much of the data are only publicly

    available at national or regional scales (Supplementary Table 1).

    When possible, we refer to regional variability using US states,

    counties, or Farm Resource Regions—nine regions delineated

    by the USDA to capture important diﬀerences in climate,

    soil, topography, political-economy, and culture that strongly

    shape cultivation possibilities for US farmers (Figure 1). When

    data are only available at a national scale, it is important to

    note that our descriptions of “average” farm operations or

    operators overlook important spatial diﬀerences in operator

    demographics, operation management, operation typologies,

    and rural livelihoods. In addition, these national data are

    strongly shaped by the commodity crops that dominate many

    limits our assessment of historical data provided by the USDA, we nevertheless

    include available data, noting limitations as relevant.

    3Direct comparisons between 2017 and other CoA years are complicated

    by changing deﬁnitions of farm operators/producers. In 2012, demographic

    information from up to three operators, and one designated principal operator

    were collected. In 2017, “operator” was replaced by “producer”, and the CoA,

    recognizing that multiple people may identify as principal operators, collected
    data

    on up to four producers, multiple of which may identify as principal producers.

    Prior to 2017 the principal operator (n = 1) self-identiﬁed, while in 2017, the

    principal operator equivalent, primary producer (n = 1) was chosen by designating

    either: (1) the person who makes the most decisions on the farm, or, if decisions

    are made equally, (2) the person who worked oﬀ the farm the least. Demographic

    data were not reported for primary producers in 2017, only for principal producers

    (n ≤ 4), thus, statistics for principal producers in 2017 are not directly comparable

    to any statistics in previous CoAs (USDA NASS, 2019, Appendix B pg. 20).

    4Throughout this paper we will use producer and operator interchangeably

    considering “producer” only replaced “operator” in the 2017 CoA. When referring

    to farm producers/operators, all reported farm(er) data refers to the n = 1 principal

    operators per farm operation through the 2012 CoA, and the n ≤ 4 principal

    producers per farm operation in 2017, unless otherwise stated. We recognize that

    changing deﬁnitions impact our ability to report shifts in farm(er) characteristics

    through time, but feel it is important to report all available data, acknowledging

    the data’s limitations.

    5Of the data covering US farm workers, the National Agricultural Workers Survey

    (NAWS), which samples and interviews between 1500 and 3600 workers each year,

    is the most representative survey; NAWS does not, however, cover the population

    of over 250k H-2A farmworker visa holders. (USDL, NAWS).

    US agricultural landscapes and fail to capture the realities of

    operators and operations engaged in specialty crop production.

    Third, the structure of the data seldom allows for exploration

    of

    intersectionality

    across

    indicators

    of

    demographics,

    management, and livelihood. Structural racial (Gilbert et al.,

    2002; Horst and Marion, 2019; Minkoﬀ-Zern, 2019) and

    gendered (Sachs, 1983; Allen and Sachs, 2007; Keller, 2014)

    inequities in access to farmland, capital (Ghimire et al., 2020),

    federal support (EWG, 2021), and professional respect (Snipes

    et al., 2017) have long characterized the US agricultural sector,

    these barriers have systematically limited the diversity of people

    and perspectives in US food production. This is reﬂected in

    data availability. To our knowledge, we cannot currently report

    on major indicators of agricultural livelihoods (see Table 1)

    across race, ethnicity, or gender at a sub-national scale. We have

    searched extensively and have found that intersectional data are

    only reported by the USDA NASS in their summary reports at

    national scales (e.g., USDA NASS, 2019, Chapter 1: United States

    Data, Tables 55–64).

    Finally, we examine operator livelihoods in aggregate, largely

    ignoring the major operational diﬀerences between commodity

    grain (e.g., corn, soy, wheat, rice), specialty crop (e.g., vegetable,

    fruit, nut), and livestock operations6. Importantly, the trend

    toward agricultural specialization over the twentieth century

    created an agricultural sector where one group of farmers

    (grain producers) essentially produce the inputs on which

    another group (livestock producers) depends—conditions which

    oppose their interests and make it diﬃcult to meaningfully

    discuss producer livelihoods in an all-encompassing way. These

    diﬀerences have major implications for agricultural livelihoods;

    for instance, the average per farm net farm income of beef cattle

    ranchers in 2017 was $3,904, compared to $83,065 in oilseed and

    grain, and $389,897 in poultry and egg producers (USDA NASS,

    2019). Our focus on aggregate livelihood outcomes is driven by

    6In 2017, oilseed and grain farming comprised 15.9% of farms, vegetable and

    melon farming 2.2%, fruit and tree nut farming 4.7%, cattle ranging and farming

    31.4%, and poultry and egg production 2.2% (Tables 48 and 75 of USDA NASS,

    2019).

    data availability. To our knowledge, we can only look at the

    main indicators of farm livelihoods by operational category at

    the national level and only for the 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017

    CoA years7. By focusing on coarser operational classiﬁcations,

    we are able to examine available livelihood indicators at higher

    spatiotemporal resolutions and over longer periods of time. This

    focus also allows us, to the limited extent currently possible, to

    visualize the intersection of these indicators of livelihood with

    race, gender, and geography.

    We made three notable adjustments to these data. First,

    when appropriate, data were adjusted for inﬂation using the

    chain type GDP deﬂator provided by the USDA ERS, the

    consumer price index provided by the US Bureau of Labor

    Statistics (BLS), or the price as paid index provided by the

    USDA NASS. Second, in 2002 the USDA began incorporating

    statistical adjustments into oﬃcial CoA estimates and reported

    some adjustments retroactively for 1997; these adjustments are

    meant to correct for systematic biases in data collection that

    may misrepresent particular populations in the farm sector

    (e.g., small farm operations) (see MacDonald et al., 2018,

    Appendix A for more details). Throughout the paper, bar

    graphs show unadjusted numbers through agricultural CoA year

    1992 and adjusted from CoA year 1997 on; line graphs show

    both adjusted and unadjusted values in 1997. Third, in all

    county-level maps, we utilize a quantile binning methodology8

    where we break data into quantiles (e.g., 13, 28, 45, 76)

    and then assign interpretable values (e.g., 15, 25, 50, 75) to

    our bins.

    7State-level NAICS data is only available for the total farms (“Table 44. Farms
    by

    North American Industry Classiﬁcation System”) in each category, not any other

    operational characteristics. Even then, NAICS classiﬁcation cannot be conﬂated

    with what, exactly, growers cultivate/raise on their farms (e.g., “cotton farming

    (NAICS 11192)” growers report corn, wheat, tobacco, etc. sales), or for that matter,

    how they make their livelihoods.

    8Thus, all bins include nearly the same number of observations, ensuring

    equal spatial representation across quantitative categories. Note that this binning

    methodology can place similar features in adjacent classes, or place widely diﬀerent

    features in the same class.

    These terms—which describe US farms, farmers, and farmer

    livelihoods—are currently deﬁned in disparate institutional

    documentation and metadata that is often very diﬃcult to ﬁnd.

    US FARM OPERATOR LIVELIHOODS

    Who Operates US Farms?

    We begin by providing an overview of who currently operates

    US farms and how this has changed through time. Overall,

    the number of farm operations has dropped precipitously since

    the beginning of the century—from 6.8 million at its peak in

    1935 to 2.0 million in 2017 (Figure 2A). The US is currently

    home to an estimated 2.0 million farm operations that cover

    900 million cultivated acres and employ an estimated 2.6 million

    individuals (1.3% of total US employment) (USDA ERS, 2020a;

    USDA NASS, 2020). The average size of these operations has

    increased three-fold over the same period—from 147 acres in

    1900 to 441 acres in 2017 (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 1).

    The number of individuals employed by the agricultural

    sector has dropped by 1.3 million since the 1980s Farm

    Crisis (Figure 2B); however, there are many US regions,

    particularly the Northern Great Plains and Prairie Gateway,

    in which agriculture remains a primary source of employment

    (Supplementary Figures 2, 3).

    Today, US farms are operated overwhelming by white males

    (Figure 4C), with individuals not identifying as white9 currently

    operating <7.1% of farmland and representing only 5.2% of

    operations (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figures 5, 6). According

    to the 2017 USDA CoA, today the “average” US farm operator is

    a 58-year-old white male (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 4).

    While white males have long dominated the US agricultural

    sector, the last century has seen a precipitous drop in the

    relative number of Black operators. Today, only 1.4% of operators

    identify as Black (38 k of 2.74 M total; Figure 3B), and these

    operators are heavily concentrated in the Southeastern US

    (Figure 4A)10. Within the majority of operators identifying as

    white, there is an increasing number of Hispanic operators

    (84 k of 2.6 M white operators), largely along the Fruitful Rim

    9While these categories falsely and problematically collapse multiple racial

    categories into a white-centered binary, the racial categories used across datasets

    included in this paper are inconsistent. Thus, condensing them into “white” and

    “non-white” allows for maximum data usage and comparison. This precedent has

    been set in recent literature (see Horst and Marion, 2019). Racial categories
    listed

    in the 2017 CoA are as follows: Black or African American, Asian, American

    Indian or Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian or other Paciﬁc Islander, White; where

    respondents are able to answer more than one race (USDA NASS, 2019).

    10Operators identifying as Black are now heavily concentrated in the Southeastern

    US (Figure 4A), particularly in Mississippi (12.9% of 36k reporting operators),

    Louisiana (7.0% of 37k reporting), South Carolina (6.7% of 33k reporting), and

    Alabama (6.6% of 54k reporting). Despite this heavy concentration, the raw

    numbers of farmers identifying as Black remains quite small, rising to 5,167 in

    GA, 5,669 in LA, 3,740 in NC, 4,757 in SC, 7,677 in AL, 20, 791 in TX, and 4,237
    in

    FL in 2017. Black operated acres are also strongly concentrated here, with 5.3%

    of acreage in MS, 3.9% in SC, 3.7% in AL, and 2.3% in LA. Black operations

    are also strongly concentrated here, with 13.7% of operations in MS, 7.7% in

    LA, 7.1% in SC, and 4.5% in GA. Black operators also manage more acreage in

    these states than elsewhere in the US, but the operated acreage does not match

    the number of operators. For example, in Mississippi, nearly 13% of operators

    identify as Black, but Black individuals operate only 5.2% of agricultural acreage

    (Supplementary Figure 7A).

    and non-Black, including 46k operators identifying as American

    Indian12 or Native Alaskan.

    Though women’s labor has long been vital to US farms (Sachs,

    1983, 1996; Rosenfeld, 1987), until 2000, the percent of reported

    principal operators identifying as female was consistently below

    10% (Figure 4D; see Supplementary Figure 7D for female

    operated acreage). This number has risen in recent years,

    particularly from 2012 to 2017 when the percent of female

    operators rose from 13.7% (288 k female operators of 2.1 M

    total) to 29.1% (799 k females of 2.7 M total) (Figures 3C, 4D);

    however, this increase largely reﬂects a shift in USDA CoA

    reporting from a “one farm, one farmer” policy to allowing

    reporting of up to four principal operators per farm operation

    (Pilgeram et al., 2020).

    What Is the State of US Farm Operator

    Livelihoods?

    Federal agencies largely monitor livelihoods using indicators

    of farm revenue. Within this narrow conceptualization of

    livelihood, a myriad of terms and metrics are used to capture on-

    farm income. The USDA ERS reports farm household income,

    which includes both income earned on the farm and income

    earned oﬀ the farm, and net cash farm income, which captures

    on-farm income after accounting for production expenses. The

    118.3% (of 70k reporting) of operators identifying as Hispanic in Florida, 23.4%

    (of 44k reporting) in New Mexico, 10.2% (of 110k reporting) in California, and

    9.1% (of 368k reporting) in Texas (Supplementary Figure 7B). Hispanic operated

    acres are also strongly concentrated along the Fruitful Rim, with 5.8% of acreage
    in

    Florida, 12.7% in NM, 8.9% in CA, and 6.1% in TX. Hispanic operations are also

    strongly concentrated along the Fruitful Rim, with 9.4% of operations in Florida,

    24.8% in NM, 12.3% in CA, and 10.4% in TX.

    12These operators operate largely in Arizona (54.9% of 27k reporting operators),

    New Mexico (16.0% of 44k reporting), and Oklahoma (8.9% of 108k reporting).

    BEA reports net income, or the total cash receipts from all farms

    in a county less total production expenses, as well as realized

    net farm income which includes total cash receipts as well as

    government payments. Accessing, navigating, and understanding

    these data (and their metadata) is a challenge. We share these

    deﬁnitions (and source documents describing metrics) in Table 1

    and host clean versions of each dataset at https://github.com/

    blschum/US-Farming-Data-Narrative to facilitate use moving

    forward. In what follows, we explore what these disparate

    deﬁnitions and metrics have to say about US operator livelihoods.

    To the extent possible, we describe how available livelihood

    indicators intersect with gender and race and highlight the ways

    in which this important intersectional data is largely unreported.

    In 2019, residential and intermediate farm operators (see

    Table 1 for deﬁnitions) reported average household incomes

    of $138 k and $69 k, respectively, as compared to the national

    average of $99 k (Schnepf and Rosch, 2020). Commercial farm

    operators, which represent only 8.2% of all US farms, reported

    household incomes of $286 k—nearly three times the US average

    (USDA ERS NASS, 2020a). These numbers initially suggest

    that operating a farm is a potentially proﬁtable livelihood

    choice. A more careful look at the data, however, suggests that

    this is not necessarily true. This metric of farm household

    income includes both on-farm income, or income received

    directly from the farm business, and oﬀ-farm income, which

    includes non-farm business earnings, non-farm wage income,

    dividends, and transfers (Supplementary Table 2). Nationally,

    on-farm production contributes to <25% of farm household

    income, with the remaining 75% earned oﬀ-farm (Figure 5A).

    This has consistently been the case for the last century, with

    13Note these data are biased low compared to USDA estimates because the BLS

    Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages counts only employees covered by

    unemployment insurance (James MacDonald, personal communication on June 2,

    2021).

    on-farm revenues increasing as a proportion of total household

    income in more recent years. Available data indicates that the

    contribution of on-farm work to household income also varies

    by farm type, with an average of only 2.2% of residential farm

    household income earned on-farm as compared to nearly 79% of

    commercial farm household income in 2019 (Schnepf and Rosch,

    2020). We were unable to ﬁnd data describing how on-farm and

    oﬀ-farm income intersect with operator race, however national

    data reported by the ERS suggests that the national mean on-farm

    income generated by females is less than a fourth of what male

    operators bring in ($6,612 for females as compared to $27,354 for

    males) (USDA ERS NASS, 2020b).

    It is important to highlight that the relatively small proportion

    of farm household income coming from on-farm activities does

    not account for production expenses incurred on-farm. This,

    we focus here on what is perhaps the strongest indicator of

    the proﬁtability of farming: net cash farm income, or the funds

    generated on-farm available to meet living expenses and debt

    obligations after accounting for production expenses. In 2017, in

    14.6% of reporting counties, farm operators reported negative

    net cash farm incomes, with some counties reporting average

    annual operational losses as high as $55 k (Woodward County,

    OK) (Figure 6B). The national median farm income generated in

    2017 was negative $1,035 per principal farm operator household

    (USDA ERS NASS, 2021). This implies that the actual revenue

    generated by on-farm activities—or by the act of farming—is

    small or even negative in many parts of the US. Unfortunately,

    net farm income is only available back to 2002 (Figure 6A), but

    this data suggests that even over the short period from 2002 to

    2017, there has been a 6.8% increase in the number of US counties

    reporting negative returns to farming (Figure 6). We were unable

    to ﬁnd data to assess how these indicators vary across gender and

    racial identities.

    To understand the proﬁtability of operating a farm before

    2002, we turned to the US BEA, which reports realized net farm

    income, or the total cash receipts from all farms in a county less

    total production expenses back to the 1960s. This metric is similar

    to the ERS’s net cash farm income metric in that it quantiﬁes

    revenue ﬂows to farm operators after accounting for expenses,

    but diﬀerent in the way it accounts for government payments and

    revenue ﬂows to the operation (see Table 1 for details). The BEA

    data suggest that over the last 60 years, in many agriculturally

    important regions of the US (much of Texas, the Eastern

    Uplands, and the Basin and Range) total production expenditures

    have far surpassed production revenues (Figure 7). From 2015 to

    2019, an average of 28.9% of counties reported negative realized

    net farm income as compared to 1.0% over the period from

    1969 to 1973 (Figure 7, Supplementary Figure 15). This income

    loss is spatially concentrated, with farmers throughout the US

    Heartland and along the Fruitful Rim reporting large positive net

    incomes and those across much of the Southeast, Prairie Gateway

    and Basin and Range reporting signiﬁcant losses (Figure 7B;

    Supplementary Table 2)14. Though we were unable to formally

    14There are large diﬀerences in the number of counties reporting negative net

    incomes across FRRs; for instance, only 5.5% of counties reported net negative

    incomes in US Heartland, while 62.0% reported net negative incomes in the Basin

    and Range in 2017 (Supplementary Table 2).

    and (B) 2019. Net income is deﬁned as total cash receipts from all farms less

    production expenses15 and is analogous to USDA NASS measures of net cash farm
    income. We visualize BEA realized net income data because it dates back to

    1969 while USDA NASS county-level data only dates back to 1997. Counties in which
    net income is negative (red) had average production expenses that surpassed

    total cash receipts. For instance, Parker, TX realized $17M in 1969, but -$67M
    in 2019. Data: US BEAb.

    assess the intersections between BEA data and operator gender

    and race, we note that many regions with signiﬁcant realized net

    farm income losses are also regions with disproportionally more

    non-white farm operators.

    The increase in negative realized net average farm incomes

    is troubling, but what adds to this concern is that both

    the net cash farm income reported by the USDA and the

    realized net farm income reported by the BEA include direct

    payments to farmers from federal programs including federal

    crop insurance indemnity payments and crop subsidies. In

    the mid-1970s, government payments constituted only 8.2%

    of net farm income, which had risen to $1.87B (Figure 5B).

    Today, government payments make up anywhere from 10 to

    25% of net farm income, which has remained at $60–80B

    since 2015. From 1995 to 2020, farm operations received a

    total of $424.4 billion in subsidies ($240.5 billion of which

    was for commodity programs—mostly for corn, wheat, and

    soy) (Schnepf and Rosch, 2020)16. These payments cover much

    of the US, with some of the highest per-acre direct federal

    payments and use of crop insurance in the US Heartland

    (Figure 8). These subsidies also go overwhelmingly to massive

    producers, with the top 10% of commodity payment recipients

    receiving 78% of commodity payments. These disparities can

    be, in part, explained by base acre designations, or acreage

    deﬁned at the farm-level that is eligible for commodity program

    payments based on the historical average acreage of covered

    commodities, not the current acreage, on that parcel of land.

    Historical acreage was set in the 2002 Farm Bill based on

    planted acreage from 1998 to 2001, and farmers could reallocate

    15According to the BEA metadata, production expenses include: purchases of

    feed, livestock and poultry, seed, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and lime,
    and

    petroleum products; labor expenses; machinery rental and custom work; animal

    health costs; and all other expenses including depreciation.

    16In 2020, a near-record year for farm subsidies, government payments supplied

    40% of net farm incomes nationally; That’s double what direct payments represent

    during the average year (e.g., 15.3% in 2017, 16.9% in 2018). These direct

    government payments, which stem mainly from COVID-19 related relief, were

    projected to decrease by over $20B in 2021 compared to 2020. (USDA ERS, 2021a).

    existing base acres (but not add new ones) in the 2014 Farm

    Bill based on 2009 to 2012 planted acreage (Farm Bureau, 2016).

    These designations help incentivize keeping land in commodity

    production, as well as consolidating that land into larger farms,

    to help mitigate the risk of potential loss with adequate subsidy

    payments (Newton, 2017; Spangler et al., 2020). Meanwhile,

    farmers without base acres are not eligible to receive commodity

    payments, even if growing covered commodities. Data describing

    the intersections of base acreage with race and gender are not

    available; however, according to the 2017 CoA, Black operators

    managed 120 acres on average, female operators 331 acres on

    average, while white operators managed 431 acres nationally.

    Available national data suggests that white operators receive

    nearly twice as much as from federal programs (an average

    of $14 k per farm) as Black ($6.4 k per farm) operators, while

    Hispanic ($14.7 k) and Native Indian (12.1 K) operators receive

    comparable average receipts to white operators (USDA NASS,

    2019). Female operators also receive less support than their male

    counterparts ($12.5 k vs. $14.4 k). The concentration of federal

    payments among largely white male large-scale producers reﬂects

    long histories of structural racism that increase challenges for

    non-white farmers in accessing the land, base acreage, labor, and

    capital necessary to operate a farm (Gilbert et al., 2002; Fagundes

    et al., 2020).

    Why Are Operators Losing Money?

    Available data suggests that nationally, many farm operators

    are increasingly losing money and relying on federal payments

    and oﬀ-farm income to support their households. Though data

    availability at a sub-national scale is extremely limited, available

    data describing the intersections of indicators of on-farm income

    with operator demographics suggest that female and non-white

    operators hold less land, receive less federal support, and generate

    less revenue than their white male counterparts. In what follows,

    we review available data describing the potential drivers of this

    revenue loss and (to the extent possible) discuss the intersections

    of these drivers with race and gender.

    agricultural acres were covered by crop insurance (Figure 12). Data: USDA NASS
    QuickStats.

    Rising Input Costs

    The last century has brought major changes to how US farms

    are managed in terms of the composition of input use, the

    eﬃciency with which these inputs are used, and the specialization

    of crops cultivated. Over the last 70 years, labor and land inputs

    declined by 76 and 28%, respectively. Meanwhile, the use of

    other intermediate goods—including energy, fertilizer, pesticides,

    purchased services, seeds, and feed—increased by 133% (USDA

    ERS, 2020c). These major inputs to production are managed

    more eﬃciently than ever before; over the last century, the

    US yields of soybeans and winter wheat roughly tripled and

    maize yields increased 5-fold (USDA NASS, 2020) while the

    total inputs used in agriculture grew only 7% (ibid.)17. However,

    over the last 45 years, farms have consistently spent more than

    75% of earnings on inputs; spending peaked in 1982 during

    the farm crisis at 93.5% and more recently in 2019, at 82.5%

    (Supplementary Figure 9). Per acre costs18 for corn, soy, and

    wheat have tripled since 1990, from $177 per acre to $690 per

    acre in 2020 for corn, from $107 to $500 for soy, and from

    $79 to $323 per acre for wheat (Supplementary Figure 10). In

    2017, the USDA estimated that annual farm expenditures—

    of which labor, machinery, fertilizer, and chemicals comprise

    over 30%—averaged over $176 k, with median (mean) per

    acre costs of $427 ($605) (Figure 9). As evidenced above,

    in several regions—notably parts the Eastern Uplands (TN,

    WV, and KY) and much of Texas—farmers now regularly

    spend more on production expenses than they earn from

    production (Figure 7B, Supplementary Figure 11). Rising input

    costs, equipment costs, and repair costs place signiﬁcant ﬁnancial

    burdens on many farmers and push on-farm expenditures

    17Our discussion of agricultural eﬃciency here examines inputs and yields;

    calculations examining energy inﬂows and outﬂows reach diﬀerent conclusions

    regarding the relative eﬃciency of input intensive production (Akram-Lodhi,

    2021). When accounting for the full suite of agricultural energy inputs (including

    the fossil fuel required to run machines and produce pesticides and fertilizers),

    human-powered agricultural production is much more eﬃcient than the

    mechanized systems discussed here.

    18This includes seed, fertilizer, manure, chemicals, fuel, replacement, nonland

    capital, repairs, capital recovery, paid and unpaid labor, land rent, operating

    capital, general farm overhead, taxes, and insurance.

    beyond on-farm revenues19. Though the USDA provides farm

    loans at competitive rates and supports several programs that

    favor beginning and minority farmer, evidence suggests that non-

    white farmers still face structural discrimination in loan access

    essential to purchase of inputs (Daniel, 2013; Minkoﬀ-Zern and

    Sloat, 2017; Escalante et al., 2018; US CRS, 2021).

    Low Returns on Production

    Another potential driver of declining on-farm incomes is

    price volatility for many widely cultivated commodities. One

    of the overarching trends that deﬁnes US agriculture is

    simpliﬁcation—of cropping regimes, management practices, and

    of the individuals who operate the land. Five crops—corn,

    soy, wheat, hay, and alfalfa—now constitute nearly 80% of

    cultivated US acreage (USDA NASS CDL, 2020). These crops are

    increasingly spatially concentrated (Aguilar et al., 2015; Crossley

    et al., 2020; Spangler et al., 2020; Nelson and Burchﬁeld, 2021;

    Petersen-Rockney et al., 2021), with the average number of

    major commodities produced per farm decreasing from roughly

    4.5 to 1.5 over the last 60 years (Dimitri et al., 2005; USDA

    NASS, 2019)20. The most commonly grown commodity crops—

    wheat, rice, corn and soybeans—now comprise about 75% of

    the caloric content of food production worldwide (Cassman,

    1999; Roberts and Schlenker, 2009) and cover well over half of

    cultivated US acreage (USDA NASS, 2020). The simpliﬁcation

    of farm operations can leave operations over-exposed to market

    ﬂuctuations and decrease livelihood resilience (Abson et al., 2013;

    Perrin et al., 2020; Petersen-Rockney et al., 2021). Indeed, prices

    of the three commodities that dominate US landscapes—corn,

    wheat, and soy—have varied greatly over the last two decades

    (Figure 10), particularly due to trading on the international stock

    market (Hendricks et al., 2014; Bouët and Laborde, 2017; Conger,

    2020), shifts in global biofuel production (Roberts and Schlenker,

    2013; Lark et al., 2015), and increased competition with other

    proﬁtable than sales of original equipment.

    years, the steady increase in per acre production costs for these

    crops has matched or outpaced growth in production values,

    leaving net production value of major commodities low or even

    negative (Figure 11).

    Though programs included in the omnibus legislation of

    reliance on federal support to turn a proﬁt (Ayazi and Elsheikh,

    2015). An increasingly small number of transnational ﬁrms have

    capitalized on and invested in these crops; this strongly inﬂuences

    their bottom lines but exacerbate dependence on high-input costs

    for producers (Vanloqueren and Baret, 2009; Clapp, 2021).

    Land Access

    A common response to growing concerns about the declining

    proﬁtability of managing a farm in the US is that farmers are

    “land rich, cash poor” (Inwood, 2013). It is important to note,

    however, that the negative net incomes reported by the USDA

    are not necessarily for farm owners but for farm operators who,

    in many cases, do not own the land they operate. Indeed,

    access to the most fundamental of agricultural inputs, land,

    remains a major challenge for many farm operators. From

    2015 to 2019, 10% of all US farmland (93 million acres) was

    transferred, most of which (6%, or 55.8 million acres) changed

    hands through gifts, trusts, or wills (Bigelow et al., 2016). In 2015,

    a USDA survey asked farmland owners if they were planning to

    transfer ownership in the next 5 years; only 2.3% of respondents

    anticipated selling to non-family members (Bigelow et al., 2016;

    Bawa and Callahan, 2021). Because of the low turnover in

    farmland ownership, the importance of inheritance, and the high

    cost of land in many markets, access to farmland through tenancy

    is an important means of entering into agriculture or expanding

    existing operations (Bawa and Callahan, 2021). In 2017, only

    35% of farm operators fully owned the land they operated

    (Figure 12A); 55% of farm operators are partial owners—or

    individuals who operate land they own in addition to land rented

    from others—and 10% are tenants—individuals that operate land

    they rent from others or worked on shares for others (USDA

    NASS, 2019, Appendix B pgs. 9–10; Supplementary Figure 12).

    Over 80% of rented land is owned by “non-operating

    landlords” (NOLs) who do not operate farms22. NOLs own over

    40% of all agricultural land, over 50% of which was acquired

    22Though these individuals are not the focus of this study, it is important to
    note

    that though the USDA captures NOLs in their Tenure, Ownership and Transition

    of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) surveys, information on this group of landowners

    is extremely limited. According to the 2014 TOTAL survey, the USs 1.9M NOLs

    owned over 283M agricultural acres. Unsurprisingly, the majority of these NOLs

    are white and male (though 37% of non-operator principal landlords are female),

    and the majority of acres are controlled by someone over the age of 65 (76% and

    through an inheritance or gift (Bigelow et al., 2016). These

    NOL-tenant relationships represent complex power dynamics

    over who primarily makes land use decisions and how these

    decisions are enacted. Some research indicates that tenant

    operators maintain signiﬁcant control over how rented land

    is used, particularly when NOLs are women, of older age,

    do not have a background in farming, or reside far from

    the rented land (Petrzelka and Marquart-Pyatt, 2011; Eells

    and Soulis, 2013; Petrzelka et al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2020).

    Yet, in other cases, NOLs may enact power over their land

    through strict stipulations in their lease agreements that either

    promote or incentivize certain conservation practices, as well as

    increasing cash rent (Ranjan et al., 2019; Barnett et al., 2020).

    Such power dynamics further complicate the assumption that

    operators are “land rich” as they may either not own the land

    63% of land owned by female and male non-operators, respectively) (Bigelow et
    al.,

    2016).

    they operate or have inﬂuential power over how that land can

    be used.

    The challenge of land access is exacerbated for non-white

    operators. Counties with higher rates of tenancy (and thus,

    lower rates of full land ownership) are also those with higher

    proportions of non-white and Hispanic identifying operators.

    For example, the Mississippi Portal, home to the majority of

    US operators identifying as Black, has some of the highest

    rates of tenancy in the US (Figure 12B). This region reports

    an average rate of tenancy of 20.1%, over double the national

    average of 9.5% of operations. The southwestern Fruitful Rim

    and Basin and Range regions, home to many of the operators

    that identify as Hispanic or American Indian, also has some

    of the highest rates of agricultural tenancy in the US23. While

    the national tenancy rate for non-white operators has declined

    23For instance, in San Juan County, NM 67.2% of principal operators identiﬁed
    as

    renters in 2017 and 62.0% of operators identiﬁed as American Indian or Alaskan

    Native.

    the left column shows the proportion of farms owned and rented by non-white

    operators, and the right, by white operators. Due to data limitations (i.e., historical
    lack of intersectionality in data collection) we can only visualize white vs.
    all other

    races. Data: (Haines et al., 2018); distributed by ICSPR.

    through time, tenancy has consistently remained much higher

    for non-white operators than for white operators over the last

    century (Figure 13).24 In 2017, CoA data suggested that on

    average, non-white farmers owned 58.1% of the farms they

    operated as compared to 69.6% of white operators. This same

    data suggests non-white operators fully own 63.3% of non-white

    operated acreage, while white farmers fully own only 32.6% of

    white operated acreage. At the same time, non-white owner-

    operators represent only 10.2% of all land fully owned in farms

    in the US. This suggests that while white operators are more

    likely to own their farm, and non-white operators own a higher

    proportion of their operational acreage, white owner-operators

    control the lions’ share (89.8%) of owned operational acreage in

    the US.

    These rates of tenancy and complex land ownership

    dynamics imply that, for many farm operators, particularly

    those who are non-white, land is not a source of wealth but

    a signiﬁcant production expense. For tenant operators and

    partial owners, agricultural land rent averages $126/acre for

    cropland, $216/acre for irrigated cropland, and $13 per acre for

    pastureland; these costs vary widely however, from an average

    of $35/acre in Oklahoma to $331/acre in California (USDA

    NASS, 2020; USDA NASS QuickStats). Finding farmland can be

    a challenge for anyone without family access to large acreages,

    particularly aspiring, beginning, and socially disadvantaged

    farmers (Ahearn, 2013; Ruhf, 2013; Calo and De Master, 2016;

    Ackoﬀ et al., 2017). Securing long-term, stable access to land

    with infrastructure such as wells and buildings, proximity to

    majority is owned.

    markets and amenities, and with existing housing presents a

    particular challenge (Carlisle et al., 2019; Valliant and Freedgood,

    2020). Productive agricultural land is an increasingly scarce

    commodity, and inﬂation-adjusted values of farmland in the US

    have tripled since the 1970s (USDA ERS, 2020b). In addition

    to systemically excluding aspiring farmers without access to

    suﬃcient relationships or capital (Pilgeram, 2019), these rising

    costs place a continuing ﬁnancial burden on current owner

    operators (Prager et al., 2018).

    Unprecedented Farm Debt

    Taken together, the intersections of rising input costs, stagnant

    production values, commodity specialization, and challenges in

    land access have left farmers with unprecedented levels of farmer

    debt (Figure 14). Average farm debt is now at levels not seen

    since the 1980s Farm Crisis—a period of signiﬁcant agricultural

    ﬁnancial loss deﬁned by plummeting commodity prices and

    export values (Barnett, 2000). According to the USDA ERS, farm

    operator households hold an average on-farm debt of $99 k and

    oﬀ-farm debt of $116 k (USDA ERS, 2021d). Much of this debt

    is related to real estate25 and is ﬁnanced largely by federal loans

    (Figure 14; Supplementary Figures 13, 14).

    Operators can borrow from several existing programs through

    the Farm Service Agency (FSA)—the USDA’s lending arm—

    which provide loans at competitive interest rates. Despite

    25Real estate debt represents loans for the purchase of farmland and buildings

    (i.e., mortgages), and FSA Storage Facility Loans, and excludes all debt for farm

    operators’ dwellings. Non-real estate debt covers all other debt (e.g., production

    loans, loans for machinery and equipment, emergency loans, breeding livestock

    loans). (Carrie Litkowski, USDA ERS, personal communication on August 26,

    2021).

    13, 14 for breakdown of non-real estate and real estate debt. Data: (USDA ERS,

    2021b).

    programs that favor beginning and minority farmers, like the

    DIRECT and GUARANTEE programs, non-white borrowers are

    more likely to borrow lower loan amounts at higher interest

    rates relative to white borrowers (Escalante et al., 2018). Evidence

    suggests that Black farmers are still discriminated against by the

    FSA. Black farmers were denied USDA loans at higher rates than

    any other group in 2020 (25 vs. 8% in White Non-Hispanic

    applicants) (ibid.). A recent analysis of USDA data found that

    in 2020 only 37% of Black applicants were granted loans last

    year in one program that helps farmers pay for land, equipment

    and repairs; however, they accepted 71% of applications from

    white farmers (Bustillo, 2021)26. At the same time, Black-owned

    farmland and Black operators have declined disproportionately

    in the national aggregate over recent decades, which can be

    largely attributed to discrimination by lenders and equitable lack

    of access to government programs (Gilbert et al., 2002; Graddy-

    Lovelace, 2017; Orozco et al., 2018). The Biden administration’s

    recent eﬀorts to provide $4B in debt relief to minority farmers

    meant to address years of ﬁnancial discrimination was met

    with strong resistance from banks concerned about proﬁts

    and investors (Rappeport, 2021). Though this debt relief will

    ultimately help many farmers, access to future loans will likely

    remain a signiﬁcant challenge for those historically excluded

    (Sewell, 2021).

    DISCUSSION

    The data-driven narrative we present in this paper reﬂects the

    steep challenges facing US farm operator livelihoods. Today

    in the US, fewer and fewer people are operating larger and

    26These rates are linked to both property appraisal values and FSA program

    participation; however, to our knowledge data are not publicly available describing

    the intersections of race with these factors.

    increasingly specialized farms (USDA NASS, 2019; Spangler et al.,

    2020). Though these farms are more productive than ever before,

    rising input costs, volatile production values, and rising land

    rents have left farmers with unprecedented levels of farm debt

    and negative median on-farm incomes. Nearly 40% of shrinking

    on-farm income already comes from federal programs supported

    by US taxpayers. As has been recognized and predicted by many

    agricultural social scientists, many operators have turned to oﬀ-

    farm work to secure their livelihoods, with an average of 75%

    of farm household income now earned oﬀ the farm. These

    trends imply that the value being produced by US farms is

    not being captured by the people who operate US farms. For

    many US farm operators, the indicators of a “good livelihood”—

    stability, security, equitable rewards for work—are largely absent,

    as indicated by the data we present on farm household income,

    tenancy, and farm closures.

    Much work must be done to improve the sustainability, equity,

    and resilience of the US agricultural sector. This, of course,

    includes supporting initiatives to relieve debt of those who have

    faced structural discrimination, as well as supporting targeted

    loan programs, farmland trusts, and conservation easements

    for historically underrepresented populations to minimize the

    burden of acquiring suﬃcient capital to invest in land (Johnson,

    2008; Beckett and Galt, 2013). Further, support for beginning

    farmer incubator and training programs (Niewolny and Lillard,

    2010; Schreiner et al., 2018) and food sovereignty initiatives can

    help share important seed saving practices (Campbell and Veteto,

    2015; Hoover, 2017), and promoting the need for agricultural

    social policies can improve crucial access to services such as

    health care and childcare essential to agricultural livelihoods

    (Becot and Inwood, 2020).

    To these important eﬀorts, we add the urgent need (1)

    to critically re-examine what and who we monitor through

    federal agricultural data, (2) to increase the accessibility and

    US Farm Operator Livelihoods

    transparency of this data, and (3) to develop more robust (and

    intersectional) indicators of “livelihoods.” To our ﬁrst point,

    perhaps the most troubling and frustrating aspect of this analysis

    was the lack of data describing the intersections of operator

    livelihoods with operator race, gender, and class. Though the

    USDA produces intersectional data at national scales (e.g., acres

    owned by race, experience diﬀerences by sex) and publishes them

    in CoA summaries, there are limited data available to assess

    the ways that access to land, credit, or government programs

    at state or county-scales intersect across various social identities

    and experiences. These data are essential to understanding and

    mitigating the current inequitable nature of access to land, labor,

    capital, and federal support. Though our focus was on farm

    operators, to this discussion we add that our understanding

    of farmworkers—the population of H2-A visa holders, US

    citizens, and illegal migrants who plant, harvest, and package

    the vast majority of our produce and livestock products—is

    also astonishingly limited. Previously published work (Minkoﬀ-

    Zern and Sloat, 2017; Horst and Marion, 2019) and the work

    of countless advocacy organizations has established that that a

    fair return on agricultural labor is conﬁned to the few people

    whose embodied and geographic privileges enable them to take

    advantage of economies of scale. Our inability to track, monitor,

    and highlight these inequities is a signiﬁcant problem.

    In addition to reporting intersectional data, we call for

    increased eﬀorts to improve data availability. Data availability is

    one of the big challenges facing researchers, practitioners, and

    activists engaged in understanding and supporting sustainable

    agricultural livelihoods in the US. By data availability, we mean:

    (1) open access to clean datasets, linked to (2) clear, informative,

    and thorough metadata describing data collection and statistical

    adjustment methods used in building the ﬁnal data product,

    provided at (3) spatial and temporal scales relevant to policy

    and management. We readily acknowledge that the institutions

    that currently curate and gatekeep our nation’s publicly available

    agricultural data (e.g., USDA NASS, ERS, and US BEA) have

    the daunting task of collecting, aggregating, disseminating, and

    referencing their data products while at the same time managing

    projects and developing policies that address the complex

    challenges faced by the citizens they serve. We also acknowledge

    (and regularly use) many of the high-quality data products

    managed by these institutions such as the USDA’s Cropland

    Data Layer—which provides researchers with high temporal

    and spatial resolution land cover data for the coterminous

    US—as well as the USDA’s Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey

    (FRIS), Water and Irrigation Management Survey (IWMS), and

    Agricultural Surveys, which along with the CoA provide the

    only comprehensive, openly available data on agricultural and

    irrigation activities linked to farm(er) characteristics across the

    US. When taken together, these data provide a fairly detailed

    narrative about US farmers and agricultural operations, but they

    still present important limitations. First, many of these data

    are limited by scale. For instance, FRIS/IWMS data is only

    aggregated and disseminated at the state-scale, but as recent

    studies demonstrate (Schumacher et al., 2022) the spatial and

    temporal variability in US irrigation at sub-state scales make

    state-level recommendations produced from typical aggregations

    erroneous and potentially harmful to farmers. In addition,

    these data products are also gatekept by US institutions, either

    ﬁnancially in the case of the FRIS/IWMS27, or via repository

    infrastructure that is unintuitive at best, and entirely incoherent

    at worst. For instance, the NASSs Quickstats repository, which

    houses all USDA Survey and CoA data, is diﬃcult to navigate

    because the unique codes built into its system are not attached to

    metadata and because of data download limits. This leaves even

    the most skillful data scientist searching across questionnaires

    and disparate USDA NASS publications and metadata28, to

    attempt to establish a clear understanding of the data they are

    accessing, cleaning, and analyzing.

    Finally, these data reﬂect the limited ways in which we

    currently assess and measure agricultural livelihoods in terms of

    revenues, agricultural yield, and eﬃciency (e.g., state and national

    estimates of Total Factor Productivity). This narrow scope misses

    farm/farm worker wellbeing entirely. Although farm families’ oﬀ-

    farm labor keeps many farms aﬂoat, key indicators of family

    well-being, such as access to childcare (Rissing et al., 2021),

    health care (Inwood, 2017, see also Becot and Inwood, 2020),

    and family members’ mental health (Fraser et al., 2005; Henning-

    Smith et al., 2021) remain persistent blind spots. We need more

    robust indicators than yield alone if agricultural futures are to be

    reimagined in truly sustainable and resilient ways (DeLonge and

    Basche, 2017).

    This lack of accessible, intersectional, and inclusive data may

    exacerbate agricultural livelihoods by limiting our capacity to

    identify and track the drivers of livelihood challenges. Moving

    forward, we call for ﬁve speciﬁc axes of intervention:

    1) the express and open (i.e., the elimination of gatekeeping)

    dissemination of fully referenced institutional data via clearly

    built repositories;

    2) the aggregation and dissemination of national- and state-level

    datasets to the county-scale;

    3) the publication of county-level intersectional data on farmer

    identity and farm characteristics;

    4) the design of representative farm worker surveys sampling

    a greater proportion of the 2.5 M US farmworkers than that

    currently captured by NAWS; and

    5) the imagining and building of more robust agricultural

    livelihood indicators.

    This call requires US institutions to invest in personnel

    with the expertise to execute this massive revitalization and

    restructuring of institutionally held and disseminated data.

    It also calls for collaborative eﬀorts between academics,

    policymakers, and agricultural stakeholders to imagine the data

    infrastructures necessary to monitor, support, and understand

    sustainable agricultural futures. Recognizing the work to be

    done, and the barriers to entry faced by researchers without

    a background in data science, we provide all raw and clean

    27Grower-level irrigation data exists behind a literal paywall (1 year of access
    costs

    $5 k).

    28We have had to reach out to multiple USDA employees to clarify deﬁnitions,

    data types, and sources included in this manuscript that we could not ﬁnd in any

    available USDA sources.

    CONCLUSIONS

    The data narrative presented in this paper merges available data

    with related research and theory to paint a picture of the state

    of farm operator livelihoods in the US. Farm operators are

    largely white males over the age of ﬁfty. Though many farm

    households have incomes comparable to the US average, much

    of this revenue comes from oﬀ-farm activities. On-farm revenues

    are often eclipsed by on-farm costs, meaning that in many regions

    of the US, farm operators pay to engage in the labor- and time-

    intensive act of operating a farm. Though data is limited, available

    literature and data indicates that this is only exacerbated for

    non-white, non-male farm operators.

    Based on the data we review, we attribute this to rising input

    costs, shrinking production values, commodity specialization,

    and challenges in land access. Importantly, these factors are all

    connected to what is perhaps one of the most important drivers

    of declining operator livelihoods: a paradigm that prioritizes

    productivity and eﬃciency above other factors. As this narrative

    has shown, eﬃciency and productivity gains do not necessarily

    mean livelihood gains. Measuring and monitoring agricultural

    progress using only metrics of production (e.g., yields), eﬃciency

    (e.g., total factor productivity), and revenue (e.g., net farm

    income) masks the lived realities of the humans operating

    our farms.

    To render this data both more accessible and visible,

    we have cleaned all data described in this paper, clearly

    documented meta-data, and provided links for download at

    our projects’ GitHub repository. This is a ﬁrst step toward

    increasing transparency surrounding the state of US operator

    livelihoods; however, additional work is needed in rethinking

    how we need to monitor and measure US agriculture moving

    forward. Meeting growing food demand while also preserving

    rural livelihoods and ecological integrity in a rapidly changing

    climate will require a signiﬁcant reconceptualization of the

    ultimate goals of agriculture. These reconceptualizations can

    build from the proposed deﬁnition by the USDA of sustainable

    agricultural systems: satisfying human demand while also

    enhancing environmental quality, eﬃciently using natural

    resources, supporting farmer livelihoods, and enhancing quality

    of life for farmers and society as a whole. We applaud this

    and other reimaginings of the end-goal of agricultural systems

    that expand the production-centric paradigm to reposition

    agriculture as a force for positive, regenerative change for both

    people and planet. What is crucial now is to engage diverse people

    and perspectives in larger discussions about how to measure and

    monitor our progress toward these broader goals and crucially,

    how to align these goals with actual policy instruments to support

    a sustainable, adaptive transition.

    \ salinity is a common environmental threat for sustainable development in the\n\
    Keriya Oasis, arid Northwest China. It is mainly caused by unreasonable land management\
    \ and\nexcessive irrigation. The aim of this study was to assess and map the salinity\
    \ risk distribution\nby developing a composite risk index (CRI) for seventeen\
    \ risk parameters from traditional and\nscientiﬁc ﬁelds, based on maximizing deviation\
    \ method and analytic hierarchy process, the grey\nrelational analysis and the\
    \ Pressure-State-Response (PSR) sustainability framework. The results\ndemonstrated\
    \ that the northern part of the Shewol and Yeghebagh village has a very high salinity\n\
    risk, which might be caused by ﬂat and low terrain, high subsoil total soluble\
    \ salt, high groundwater\nsalinity and shallow groundwater depth. In contrast,\
    \ the southern part of the Oasis has a low risk\nof salinity because of high elevation,\
    \ proper drainage conditions and a suitable groundwater table.\nThis achievement\
    \ has shown that southern parts of the Oasis are suitable for irrigation agriculture;\n\
    for the northern area, there is no economically feasible solution but other areas\
    \ at higher risk can be\nrestored by artiﬁcial measures. Therefore, this study\
    \ provides policy makers with baseline data for\nrestoring the soil salinity within\
    \ the Oasis.\nKeywords:\nPSR framework; composite risk index; combination of traditional\

    1. Introduction\nThe arid northwestern China, particularly Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous\
    \ Region (XUAR), is one\nof the most critical areas for agricultural and cotton\
    \ production. The total area of salt-affected cultivated\nland in XUAR is about\
    \ 1.47 M ha, which accounts to 31.1% of the total cultivated land which suffered\n\
    from wide-spread salinized soil [1,2]. The irrigation salinity mainly results\
    \ from unreasonable land\nreclamation and excessive irrigation due to the promotion\
    \ of groundwater salinity moving along\nthe soil capillary pores to the surface\
    \ and a lack of enough drainage for the leaching of salts [3–5],\nsupposing that\
    \ groundwater salinity moves to the surface due to the replacement of native vegetation\n\
    with shallow rooted crops, then dry land salinity occurs [6,7], they both are\
    \ belongs to secondary\nsalinization. They are different from primary soil salinization,\
    \ which occurs naturally when salt stored\nin the soil or groundwater is mobilized\
    \ to the land surface in the natural processes of a landscape [7,8].\nWater 2018,\
    \ 10, 966; doi:10.3390/w10070966\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2018, 10,\
    \ 966\n2 of 24\nThe secondary salinization, especially irrigation salinity is\
    \ common environmental problem in the\narid China.\nIrrigation salinity is an\
    \ important factor threatening agricultural safety and regional stability in\n\
    the arid Oasis. Negative impacts of irrigation salinity on environmental quality\
    \ and human welfare are\nincluding the decrease of food production, deterioration\
    \ of stream water quality, loss of biodiversity,\nincrease of ﬂood risk, increase\
    \ of infrastructure failure risk and desertiﬁcation [9–11]. In the future,\nto\
    \ meet the demand of an increasing world population, more lands will be converted\
    \ into farmland,\nthus expanding the area at risk of irrigation salinity [12].\n\
    The irrigation salinity is a one of the complex environmental problem of sustainability,\n\
    which occurs mainly due to pressures of the anthropogenic activities with the\
    \ interactions between\nclimate, hydrology, topography and geology [8,13–15].\
    \ Apparently, the irrigation salinity is very\ncomplex and a dynamic environmental\
    \ problems [16], including four dimensions of timeframe,\nbiophysical risk, management\
    \ risk and assets. The concept behind the salinity research is very similar\n\
    to the concepts of diagnosis used by physicians for diseases [17]. For this reasons,\
    \ to promote the\nunderstanding and to achieve more effective and accurate estimations,\
    \ many scholars have been\ndeveloped the various concepts of a composite risk\
    \ index of the soil salinity hazards [7,8,10,18,19].\nBut the knowledge of the\
    \ extent, variations and controlling of land salinization is generally poor [20].\n\
    And there are no perfect indicator sets that apply to all region’s environmental\
    \ sustainability\nassessment [21].\nIn the recent decades, the salinization affects\
    \ the 31.1% of the total catchment area, which became\na constant threat for the\
    \ socio-ecological sustainability. Particularly, the land reclamation and land\n\
    abandonment has been common behavior due to drought or salinity events [22]. The\
    \ inefﬁcient\nirrigation and irrational use of water and land resources aggravated\
    \ this crucial problem [1,2].\nPrevious studies about the Oasis have focused on\
    \ monitoring the spatial distribution of salinization [1],\nthe spatial distribution\
    \ of land use, land cover change and its anthropogenic drivers [22], the interaction\n\
    of ground water salinity and top soil salinity distribution [2] and soil quality\
    \ under different land\nuse type [23]. However, those studies either focus on\
    \ surface salt content, or the dynamic relation\nof groundwater and surface salinity.\
    \ Essentially, salinity hazard assessment requires composite\nassessments of multiple\
    \ criteria from anthropogenic and natural systems [13,24]. Thus, previous\nstudies\
    \ are not enough to determine salinity risk map rationally. Consequently, decision\
    \ makers faced\nhuge challenges in salinity management and regional ecological\
    \ designing.\nTherefore, the study was conducted with the following objectives:\n\
    (1) To identify the\nenvironmental composite risk index for irrigation salinity\
    \ using the PSR conceptual framework;\nand (2) to map the spatial distribution\
    \ of salinity risk by using the CRI values and spatial analyst tool\nof Arc GIS10.1.\
    \ Finally provides policy makers with the baseline data for ecological designing\
    \ of land\nand water resources and improving the soil salinity over the area.\n\
    2. Composite Risk Index for Irrigation Salinity Hazard\nIn multiple criteria problems\
    \ as soil salinization assessment, two problems need to be considered.\nThe ﬁrst\
    \ problem is the development of the composite risk index. The ﬁrst composite indices\n\
    were composed of ﬁve risk factors including the current presence and extent of\
    \ salinity, soil drainage,\naridity, topography and land use, later it was modiﬁed\
    \ and updated in the context of assessing soil\nquality and its impact on agricultural\
    \ sustainability in the Canadian Prairies [25]. For example, the nine\nmajor relevant\
    \ indicators for soil salinization were proposed during the study about features\
    \ of soil\nsalinity, land degradation and its global causes [21,26,27]. The eleven\
    \ socio-industrial parameters\nwere determined during the study of soil salinization\
    \ in the Yellow River Delta [28]. The fourteen\nparameters as a composite risk\
    \ index of Irrigation salinization was proposed and employed in the\nassessment\
    \ of salinization in the Yinchuan Plain [8,24]. Although these studies have identiﬁed\
    \ the\nmain anthropogenic and natural causes of salinity and the mechanisms behind\
    \ them [29]. However,\nsustainable development is the holistic approach, including\
    \ the three major divisions of economy,\nWater 2018, 10, 966\n3 of 24\nsocial\
    \ and environment, so there is a huge requirement to excavate the indicators [30–33].\
    \ Therefore,\nscientiﬁc effort should not only be put into scientiﬁc indicator\
    \ sources but should also be directed\ntowards traditional information sources,\
    \ since traditional knowledge may be holistic in outlook and\nadaptive by nature.\
    \ The indigenous groups could offer alternative knowledge and perspectives to\n\
    scientiﬁc knowledge based on their own locally developed practices of resource\
    \ use and monitoring\nthe status of it [34,35].\nThe second problem is that the\
    \ weight determination for every selected factor of CRI is a critical\nstage of\
    \ the whole assessing process. There are two main categories of weight assignment\
    \ as subjective\nand objective. In the subjective weight assignment, the weights\
    \ of relative importance of the parameters\nmay be assigned based on the expert’s\
    \ preferences for the considered application, it has poor sense\nof interdependent\
    \ criteria [36–38]. In the objective weight assignment, the weights of parameter’s\n\
    relative importance can be calculated by means of conventional statistical measures,\
    \ it has poor sense\nof expert’s preferences [33,34]. Therefore, it is rational\
    \ to suppose that the combined use of subjective\nand objective weight assignment\
    \ in soil salinity risk assessment is an interesting attempt.\n2.1. Developing\
    \ a PSR Based Risk Index for Irrigation Salinity\nThe PSR sustainable framework\
    \ indicates the categorization of indicators and mechanism between\nthem, the\
    \ deﬁnition of each PSR component clearly states the concept of each category.\
    \ The pressures\nare consequences of human activities and bio-physical agents,\
    \ which contribute to adverse effects on\nthe environment. The states are the\
    \ quantity of biological, physical and chemical features of ecosystems\nand their\
    \ functions, the response is an action, which attempts to eliminate, prevent,\
    \ compensate, reduce\nor adapt to states and their consequences [39]. Identiﬁcations\
    \ of parameters for each component of\nthe PSR not only rely on these deﬁnitions\
    \ but also depend on the research scale. Taking population\ngrowth as an example,\
    \ it can be categorized into the pressures in the scale of the whole Keriya Oasis;\n\
    but, in the background of village scale for a Keriya County, it can be attributed\
    \ to the responses group.\nIn addition, the biggest advantage of using the PSR\
    \ framework is that it purposely selects a set of risk\nparameters rather than\
    \ randomly selecting and availability, representativeness, understandable and\n\
    measurable was considered during selecting the parameter sets [8].\n2.2. Calculating\
    \ Grey Relational Coefﬁcients for Risk Parameters\nAfter a set of risk parameters\
    \ were identiﬁed for Keriya Oasis under the PSR framework [8],\nweighted linear\
    \ model were used for calculation of the composite risk index (CRI) as below in\n\
    Equation (1) [37,40–42].\nCRIi =\nm\n∑\nj=1\nrij × wj\n(1)\nwhere CRIi represents\
    \ the composite risk index; m is the total number of risk parameters selected;\
    \ wj is\nthe weight assigned to the jth risk variable; and the rij’s are the grey\
    \ relational coefﬁcients between\nthe two normalized sequences Ai0 and Aij. The\
    \ rij reﬂects the closeness between the two sequences,\ncalculated by the gray\
    \ model [43]. In gray model, Ai0 is often termed the parent sequence and Aij is\n\
    called to as the offspring sequence. In the context of this study, Aij is the\
    \ normalized sequence of the\njth risk variable that affected soil salinization;\
    \ Ai0 is the normalized sequence of top soil salinization\n(an impact receptor).\
    \ The rij’s of a grey model are calculated by using Equation (2) [40,44]:\nrij\
    \ = r\n\0Ai0, Aij\n\x01 = miniminj\n\b\f\fAij − Ai0\n\f\f\t + bmaximaxj\n\b\f\f\
    Aij − Ai0\n\f\f\t\n\f\fAij − Ai0\n\f\f + bmaximaxj\n\b\f\fAij − Ai0\n\f\f\t\n\
    (2)\nApparently, the rij’s take values interval of 0 and 1, with higher values\
    \ explaining a stronger\nrelationship between Aij and Ai0. Where distinguishing\
    \ coefﬁcient b taking values between 0 and\n1. Its aim is to weaken the inﬂuence\
    \ of the maximum absolute difference between Aij and Ai0 in\nEquation (2), value\
    \ of 0.5 was used for the b in generally [8,45,46].\nWater 2018, 10, 966\n4 of\
    \ 24\nBefore calculating the rij, these series data can be dealt with by pre-processing\
    \ with normalization\nby maximum value and minimum objective value [8,45,46].\n\
    In this study, according to ﬁeld\ninvestigation, it is recognized that the A1,\
    \ A2, A4, A5, A8, A11, A13, A15 and A16 were related\nto AA negatively and A0,\
    \ A3, A6, A7, A9, A10, A12 and A14 were related to AA positively, for details\n\
    refer to Section 3.3.3.\n2.3. Determining Weights for Risk Parameters\nGenerally,\
    \ the weights of relative importance of the parameters may be determined by three\
    \ kinds\nof approaches, ﬁrst kind is subjective weight assignment, second kind\
    \ is objective weight assignment\nand last kind is comprehensive weight assignment\
    \ from subjective and objective weight, these three\ncases are explained below.\n\
    2.3.1. Subjective Weight Assignment\nThe weights of relative importance of the\
    \ parameters were assigned based on the expert’s\npreferences over the parameters\
    \ for the considered application. They may assign the weights of\nimportance arbitrarily\
    \ as per their preferences or may use any of the systematic methods of assigning\n\
    relative importance such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method [8,36,47],\
    \ this study applying the\nAHP to calculate the weights for parameters.\nTo solving\
    \ the multi-criteria decision making problems as salinization, it is reasonable\
    \ to use\nthe AHP is a decision analysis method, which decomposing a complex problem\
    \ into a hierarchical\nstructure and estimates the relative importance of decision\
    \ criteria (alternatives), a typical AHP has\na three-level hierarchy, pairwise\
    \ comparisons were using for setting priorities at each level [36]. In this\n\
    study, a two-level hierarchy was developed (Figure 1)—the irrigation soil salinity\
    \ risk is level 1 and\nthe selected risk parameters are level 2. Employing AHP\
    \ involves the following steps, for details refer\nto Reference [36]:\nStep1:\
    \ Structuring the issue in to a hierarchical model, this stage includes decomposing\
    \ a complex\nissue into elements based on their characteristics and compose different\
    \ level of model.\nStep2: Making pair-wise comparison and obtaining a judgement\
    \ matrix—at this stage, comparison\nof a pair of elements on each level by applying\
    \ a nine-point scale. Due to some degree of subjectivity,\nthe consistency of\
    \ the pair-wise comparison matrix is checked, called consistency ratio (CR).\n\
    Step3: Aggregate the expert’s judgement, since each expert produce his or her\
    \ own pair-wise\ncomparison matrix, therefore, it is necessary to aggregate them\
    \ into a group comparison by using\nweighted mean of comparisons is expressed\
    \ as below in Equation (3):\neij =\n \nn\n∏\nk=1\nwk × ek\nij\n!1/\nn\n∑\nk−1\n\
    wk\n(i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m)\n(3)\nwhere, the kth expert’s pair-wise comparison\
    \ value is presented by ek\nij, the number of expert is n and\nthe kth expert’s\
    \ weight is wk. In this work, all experts were assumed that they have equal expertise\
    \ in\ntheir judgements. Then the ﬁnal weight of all seventeen elements were obtained.\n\
    2.3.2. Objective Weight Assignment\nIn the objective weight assignment, the weights\
    \ of relative importance of the parameters were\ncalculated based on the curtain\
    \ statistical method [33,48], that gives invaluable information about the\ndata\
    \ distribution. In this study, the maximizing deviation method (MDM) is selected\
    \ to calculate the\nweights for parameters, because of the best reliability than\
    \ method of standard deviation between\nclasses, criteria importance through inter-criteria\
    \ correlation and entropy method. Detailed information\nWater 2018, 10, 966\n\
    5 of 24\nabout this method can be found here [49,50].\nThe attribute weight W\
    \ is equivalent to solving\nEquation (4), where Z is attribute matrix of data\

    \ Area\nThe Keriya Oasis is a County of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Regions.\
    \ The Oasis is located\non the alluvium and diluvium plain area between the southern\
    \ margin of Taklimakan desert and the\nnorthern slope of Kurum (Kunlun in Chinese\
    \ pinyin) mountain (Figure 2). The Oasis is surrounded\nby wide ecotone, which\
    \ referring to the areas that located belt between neighboring deserts and an\n\
    oasis in arid regions (Figure 2C). The ecotone are interactive zones between the\
    \ natural ecosystem\nand irrigation activities [52]. The Oasis is characterized\
    \ by dry warm climate (11.7 ◦C annually),\nscarce precipitation (45 mm annually),\
    \ intensive potential evaporation (2500 mm annually), loose soil,\nhighly mineralized\
    \ underground water, high salt concentrations, lack of soil fertility and relatively\n\
    ﬂat topography [23]. The basin consists of ﬁve major landforms which include,\
    \ in ascending order\nfrom north to south, the high mountains, low hills, piedmont\
    \ gobi, alluvium and diluvium plain area\nand a large desert (Figure 1B). The\
    \ agriculture providing most of the income and employment for\npopulation approximately\
    \ about 250,000, the main crops are wheat, maize, cotton, rice and grapes.\nAgricultural\
    \ activities mainly depends on water resources of the Keriya River, which is supplied\
    \ by\n430 glaciers in the Mountains [53]. The river disappears in the Derya Boyi\
    \ village after approximately\n700 km of ﬂow [2]. Increasing socio-economic development\
    \ have driven the expansion of the Oasis\ndeep into the marginal ecotone zone\
    \ [54,55]. Irrational using of water and land resources has caused\nwater shortages\
    \ in some areas, meanwhile caused soil salinization in others in the Oasis.\n\
    3.1.2. Risk Parameters of Composite Risk Index for Irrigation Salinity\nThe seventeen\
    \ risk parameters were selected from the socio-environmental dimension but the\n\
    economical dimension was ignored, since there is no noticeable difference in economic\
    \ conditions\namong neighbor villages in the Oasis, which was proven by local\
    \ ofﬁcial statistical data. The seventeen\nrisk parameter include sixteen impacted\
    \ factors and one impact receptor; among them, the eleven\nparameters as A0, A1,\
    \ A2, A7, A8, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15 and A16 were identiﬁed from previous\nstudy;\

    \ Distribution of Risk Parameters\nIn this research, we used Arc GIS 10.1 and\
    \ ENVI 5.1 for producing visualized spatial distribution\nof salinity risk parameters\
    \ (in Figure 4); the data sources are presented in Table 1. In detail, the granger\n\
    method was employed for estimating A0, which applied a conventional evapotranspiration\
    \ model,\nestimates daily actual evapotranspiration, further details and steps\
    \ referring to this can be found in\nReference [56]. The A1 is built from freely\
    \ available online data in 3D analysis tool (Table 1). The A0,\nA1 and A15 were\
    \ visualized in the raster calculation tool. For example, the A2 and A8 were visualized\n\
    by following steps: Spatial analyst → distance → straight line. The A3, A4, A6\
    \ were qualiﬁed and\nA5, A7, A9, A10, A16 were quantiﬁed thematic maps. Regarding\
    \ the qualiﬁed maps, the literature\nwas translated into numbers (in A6, strongest,\
    \ strong, moderate and less were represented by 4, 3, 2\nand 1, respectively).\
    \ The kriging method (Spherical model) for spatial interpolation was performed\n\
    with the geostatistical Wizard to calculate the Oasis-wide distribution of A11,\
    \ A12, A13, A14 and\nAA [2], it estimates the value of parameters at unsampled\
    \ locations based on the weighted average\nof the samples around it. In here,\
    \ Gaussian distributions test was conducted for data sets in SPSS\n20 before being\
    \ used in the Spherical model, results that each Sig. of A11, A12, A13, A14 and\
    \ AA\nwere all less than 0.55, statistically acceptable. Then model predictions\
    \ accuracy was estimated by the\nroot-mean-square error (RMSE) which should be\
    \ as small as possible and the standardized mean error\n(ME) which should be close\
    \ to zero, in this work, the each RMSE and ME of A11, A12, A13, A14 and\nAA were\
    \ all less than 6.0 and −0.25, respectively.\n3.3. Calculation of Parameter and\
    \ Weights\n3.3.1. Weights of AHP\nThe pairwise comparison matrix was established\
    \ by interviewing fourteen relevant specialists in\nthe topic ﬁeld and used for\
    \ calculation of the weights of seventeen parameters (Table 2), each of the\n\
    hierarchical level be weighted in terms of an overall criterion in a direct comparison\
    \ between pairs\nof criteria. 1 is the equal signiﬁcance; 2 is somewhat more signiﬁcant;\
    \ 5 is considerable signiﬁcant;\n7 is extremely more signiﬁcant; 9 is absolutely\
    \ dominant signiﬁcance; and 2, 4, 6, 8 were intermediate\nvalues [60]. In this\
    \ study, the issue decomposed into seventeen elements, so sub-points were inserted\n\
    into the nine-point scale (Table 2).\n3.3.2. Parameter Calculation\nWhen spatial\
    \ distribution of each parameter was completed in Arc GIS 10.1 [61], the risk\
    \ receptor\n(total soluble salt of 35 sampling point) were added into the each\
    \ parameter in Arc GIS10.1, then used\nthe extraction tool, calculate the A0,\
    \ A1, A11, A12, A13, A14 and A15; used the distance measuring\ntool to calculate\
    \ the A2 and A8; and the A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A9, A10 and A16 were the thematic\n\
    maps in village level, means all point placed in a village has equal futures but\
    \ during the ﬁeld\nobservation, we witnessed that a village also has diverse features\
    \ of eco-environment, in order to\nmatch to real condition, the 35 sample points\
    \ were assigned the values at by following principle: ﬁrst\nstep was divided the\
    \ 35 sample point in to curtain group by value of thematic map, assign them equal\n\
    value, then according to expert suggestions whose familiar well to the Oasis and\
    \ attended the ﬁeld\ninvestigation, the minor adjustment to sampling point of\
    \ each group were conducted subjectively.\nWater 2018, 10, 966\n12 of 24\nWater\

    \ A0, A3, A6, A7, A9, A10, A12 and A14).\nThe Equation (5) was used in ﬁrst group,\

    \ rij and CRI\nThe values for CRI are shown in Table 3. The evapotranspiration\
    \ (A0), ground water depth (A11),\nground water salinity (A12) and total soluble\
    \ salt in subsoil (A14) have the greatest weight in calculation\nby AHP. Whilst\
    \ aquiculture area (A7), ratio of reused irrigation water (A9) and ground water\
    \ salinity\n(A12) have the greatest weight in calculation by MDM. This differences\
    \ between AHP and MDM may\nbe caused by subjectivity and objectivity of weight\
    \ assignment. In addition, the greatest rij are found\nin total soluble salt in\
    \ subsoil (A14), evapotranspiration (A0), irrigation area (A4), aquiculture area\n\
    (A7), ratio of salt-affected farmland (A10), ground water salinity (A12), subsoil\
    \ salinity (A14), those\nsigniﬁes the irrigation-induced salinity in the Oasis.\n\
    4.2. Scenario Validation\nThe CRI value was calculated using comprehensive assignment\
    \ from the objective and subjective\nweight (Figure 5). Notably, in scenario 1,\
    \ the CRI value was calculated using objective weights, and in\nscenario 7, it\
    \ was calculated using subjective weights. The validation result indicated that\
    \ (Figure 6),\nthe map of scenario 5 reﬂected a higher rij than others, which\
    \ means that it has higher closeness to\nreality of salinity risk distribution.\n\
    Figure 7 displays the spatial distribution of the CRI values of seven scenarios\
    \ calculated using the\ncomprehensive weights methodology for the Keriya Oasis.\
    \ When looking at the spatial distributions,\nit is evident that salinity risk\
    \ of the seven scenarios has regional characteristics of distribution;\nthe general\
    \ trend is similar among them. However, there is an obvious difference in salinity\
    \ intensity\nbetween them. This explains that the salinity risk distribution maps\
    \ are sensitive to changes of variable\nweights; simultaneously, it requires validation\
    \ of these maps for determining the most accurate map.\nThis map of scenario 5\
    \ was most accurate one, characterized by clear grade in distribution of\nCRI\
    \ density, soil salinity is very sensitive to earth surface, it is proved even\
    \ one meter differences in\nsurface can cause huge differences in salt content\
    \ [62]. In addition, during ﬁeld-work it was found\nthat the Keriya Oasis ground\
    \ surface is uneven. Thus, we are conﬁdent to say that the map of scenario\n5\
    \ is the best map. Besides, this result proved that the combination of 40% of\
    \ objective weight and\n60% of subjective weight is the best weight assignment\
    \ approach to salinity risk assessment in the\nKeriya Oasis.\nWater 2018, 10,\

    \ regional features. The northwestern region has highest salinity\nrisk, particularly,\
    \ northern part of Shewol and Yeghebagh village (CRI is 4.985–5.416). The southern\n\
    part of Shewol and the northeast part of Karkey and some areas of Yengebagh have\
    \ a high risk of\nsalinity (CRI is 4.599–4.985). And northern part of Karkey and\

    \ (CRI of 4.291–3.349) has less salinity risk, these regions\nwere characterized\
    \ by the shallowest and constant groundwater table, low and ﬂat enclosed terrain,\n\
    large aquiculture area, lowest NDVI values, highest total soluble salt in subsoil\
    \ and groundwater\n(refer to Figure 3). The southern region of the Oasis has lowest\
    \ salinity risk with CRI of 3.349–1.484,\nwhere has higher relative elevation,\

    \ problem for\nregional sustainability across the full spectrum rather a few individual\
    \ parameters that only explains\na portion of the issue (Table 4) [14,17,19,21,65].\
    \ However, using the PSR framework for risk index\ndevelopment has some limitations\
    \ as well, over simpliﬁcation may fail to indicate how the mechanism\nbetween\
    \ parameters in real multi-level problems [66]. For instance, an irrigation area\
    \ can be considered\nas a pressure if it is perceived to increase the ground water\
    \ table, or a state of salinity hazard when\nit is thought to reﬂect the land's\
    \ favorability for agriculture but these limitations can be solved by\nreviewing\
    \ relevant research results.\nThe employed methodology is that it combines the\
    \ objective weight assignment (MDM) and\nsubjective weight assignment (AHP) to\
    \ derive a weight calculative method for irrigation salinity risk\nassessment\
    \ and mapping. in the AHP, the relative importance of risk parameters perceived\
    \ by expert\npreference subjectively, lack of randomness and objectivity [8] and\
    \ in the MDM, the relative importance\nof risk parameters calculated by curtain\
    \ statistical approach objectively, lack of expert knowledge\nand experience about\
    \ the local salinity problem [49]. Therefore, our proposed method combines the\n\
    knowledge-based AHP and data-driven MDM, attempt to complement one another in\
    \ approaches.\nThe Keriya Oasis’s salinity risk map (Figure 6) developed in this\
    \ study is more reasonable than\nless accurate data derived remote-sensing images\
    \ (Table 4) but this result can be improved if the data\nwere collected in further\
    \ high resolution, for example, Karkey village is so large in area, this may\n\
    produce some bias in risk mapping when using the anthropogenic data. Although\
    \ the salinity risk\nmap of Keriya Oasis (Figure 6) was determined from seven\
    \ maps (Figure 5) by validation approach\nand by actual measured data, result\
    \ shows that the combination of objective and subjective weight\nassignment is\
    \ the best weight assignment approach. However, there is some imparity between\
    \ the\nrisk data and the measured data, it is worth considering further validation\
    \ when the new approaches\nwere available.\nThe salinity risk map provides basic\
    \ data for ecological designing and managing the Keriya Oasis.\nIt is evident\
    \ that different level of salinity risk must be applied different salinity control\
    \ measures.\nOur results demonstrated that the northern part of the Shewol and\
    \ Yeghebagh village have very high\nlevels of salinity (Figure 6) which might\
    \ be caused by a combined inﬂuence of ﬂat and low enclosed\nterrain, shallow groundwater\
    \ table, high total soluble salt in subsoil and groundwater. From above,\nwe can\
    \ conclude that the Oasis had inherent salinity problem, which may pose very big\
    \ challenge\nfor us that it is economically unfeasible to restore the salinized\
    \ lands in this region. In comparison,\nthe region with high salinity risk caused\
    \ by excessive water logging and large aquiculture area\n(Figure 6), the main\
    \ approach is to decrease the water body area by reducing water inlet to the area\
    \ and\nincrease water withdrawing by pumping or build drainage channel. In addition,\
    \ the areas (Figure 6)\nwere mainly subjected to a higher groundwater table, reused\
    \ irrigation water (poor in quality) and\npoor drainage. The best approach may\
    \ be to withdraw water by pumping, building drainage and plant\nsalt tolerant\
    \ plants. Besides, another approach to controlling salinity in this Oasis may\
    \ be to reduce the\nuse of irrigation water quantity, so deep percolation was\
    \ decreased to maintain groundwater table\ndepth whole oasis scale. For example,\
    \ in the rice basin, rice cultivation is the dominant land use, it is\nsuggested\
    \ that alter the basin to dry land crops. In addition to this, according to stakeholders,\
    \ irrigation\nactivities in the southern part of Oasis can increase salinity risk\
    \ to the northern part by water seepage,\ntherefore, it is necessary to implement\
    \ ecological designing plan about irrigation and drainage [52].\nWater 2018, 10,\

    \ distribution of irrigation salinity risk in the Keriya\nOasis by using seventeen\
    \ relative parameters from traditional and scientiﬁc knowledge along with\ninterdisciplinary\
    \ and comprehensive methodology. The northern part of the Shewol and Yeghebagh\n\
    village has a very high salinity risk; this might be caused by a combination of\
    \ ﬂat and low enclosed\nterrain, high total soluble salt in subsoil and groundwater\
    \ and a shallow groundwater level. It is\nsuggested that there is no economically\
    \ feasible solution to this problem. In addition, a few other\nregions in the\
    \ northern part of the Oasis have a relatively higher salinity risk. It is possible\
    \ to restore\nthe salinized area by artiﬁcial measures such as building drainage\
    \ and decreasing the water logging.\nTherefore, the outcome is basic data for\
    \ regional salinity management in the Keriya Oasis. In addition,\nthe southern\
    \ part of the Oasis has a relative low salinity risk and is suitable for irrigation\
    \ agriculture.\nAuthor Contributions: J.S. designed and wrote this paper, performed\

    Water information and data bases are used for addressing environmental, physical,
    social, political, economic, and ecological issues of water supply, consumption,
    availability, and accessibility. Different disciplines of water resources management,
    such as flood risk assessment, water supply management, reservoir operation, and
    water sanitation require incorporation of different types of water information
    for efficient planning and decision making. Therefore, this chapter aims to investigate
    the main features of water information, data sources, water data challenges, water
    data processing, analysis and dissemination which also play a key role in integrated
    and sustainable water resources management. This chapter begins with an introduction
    to the importance of data and information in various water disciplines as well
    as indication of data life cycle. Thereafter, different types of water data and
    sources (measurements, models, remote sensing, and administrative institutes)
    are proposed. Additionally, the challenges and limitation of water data, such
    as poor data quality, lack of integrated water portals, limited funds, and big
    data problems are discussed. This section is followed by indication of water data
    processing key points and steps of water data dissemination. Additionally, the
    World Hydrological Cyclone Observing System (WHYCOS), Global Runoff Data Centre
    (GRDC), and Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) are introduced as examples of important
    water data systems which improve development in delivery and use of water data,
    and evaluation of environmental impacts and risks. Finally, the chapter revealed
    recommendations to improve water data information and portals for the purpose
    of efficient water resources planning and management. Keywords Water data Measurements

    © 2021 3.1 Introduction Limited access to safe water, sanitation, and increased
    demand threatens human health, environmental sustainability, and economic growth,
    while leading to poor water security and supply. The increasing pressure on water
    resources is the result of global drivers such as rapid population growth, industrialisation,
    inefficient water management, water pollution, climate change, serious imbalance
    between supply and demand, but also poor water data (World Bank 2018). Therefore,
    water security, reliable water supply, as well as environment and ecosystem protection
    are directly dependant on the level of efficiency, integration, and sustainability
    of water resources management. Data and information are denoted as the “life blood”
    of a research with the purpose of efficient water management and decision making.
    Hence, data is the foundation for well-informed decisions and sustainability that
    is required by all decision makers. Water data, or in other words measurements,
    is a key element in water resources management projects and planning. Water information
    is generated from water data through a process of analysis, integration, and interpretation.
    In other words, water information is the processed and synthesized form of water
    data. The generated water information should be combined with infrastructure and
    institution in order to reach an efficient water resources planning and management
    for both the current and uncertain future periods (Cantor et al. 2018). Different
    water management disciplines, such as the flood response, drought management,
    water supply systems, reservoir operations, water sanitation, groundwater management,
    and irrigation supply require incorporation of different types of water information
    for better decision making and water planning. Thus, decision makers and water
    organizations need to access water information with proper spatial and temporal
    resolution (Cantor et al. 2018). Additionally, provision of sound data with proper
    quality is essential as it can affect the decisions and management strategies.
    However, there have been debates among organizations and water sector participants
    that some provided data do not meet the need of water users. Additionally, some
    water information is not shared openly. Despite the development of technology
    and modern measuring devices, there are still many gaps in available water data,
    and the quality of some water information is also still unacceptable (BOM 2017).
    Therefore, unmet data needs can interfere the efficient and sustainable water
    management. Figure 3.1 indicates the data life cycle (NSF DataONE project 2017)
    and the required steps from the data need evaluation to the data application.
    The main nine steps of the data life cycle are as follow: Fig. 3.1 Data life cycle
    (Adopted from NSF DataONE Project 2017) Full size image Data need evaluation and
    planning: needs of decision makers are fully evaluated; Data collection: observations
    are performed; Data quality assurance: checks and inspections are required to
    analyse the data quality; Data description and documentation: data should be accurately
    described using the metadata standards and guidelines; Data preservation and archival:
    data should be preserved in a specific archive (e.g., data service and data centre);
    Data discovery: both useful and relevant data information should be obtained;
    Data integration: data from different sources should be combined; Data analysis:
    data should be interpreted; and Data release planning: data should be described,
    managed, and made accessible. Globally, water data and information is essential
    for sustainable planning, policy, management, and prediction. Additionally, water
    data provides decision makers with proper information about water demand, weather
    patterns, hydrologic modelling, infrastructure needs, climate change, and extreme
    events. This book chapter examines the important role of water data and information
    in integrated water resources management. It also provides an in-depth understanding
    of different water data types, sources, challenges, processing, and dissemination,
    which are essential for sustainable planning, policy, management, prediction,
    and decision making. Thereafter, examples of two international information systems
    (WHYCOS and GRDC) and a national water portal (BOM) are proposed to indicate how
    water data organisation can enhance climate trend analysis, water information
    products and services, and sustainable protection of water resources systems through
    regional and international cooperation. Finally, conclusions summarizes focal
    points of this work, and recommendations are proposed to help stakeholders discover
    and overcome limitations of current water data. 3.2 Water Data Type Water data
    is a set of information that can address issues associated with physical, environmental,
    social, economic, ecological, biological, chemical, cultural, and political parameters
    in disciplines such as water use, availability, and accessibility. Additionally,
    water data can consist of a complex mix of different formats, including spreadsheets,
    satellite images, geospatial databases, and photographs (Laituri and Sternlieb
    2014). Generally, water data can be classified in two main categories: (1) Primary
    data and (2) secondary data. Primary data indicates the collection of raw data,
    including the data collected through measurements by technician and/or automated
    sensors. Measurements of water quality parameters, streamflow and precipitation
    are examples of primary data. Secondary data are obtained from models, specific
    methods, and lab experiments under controlled condition. Typically, models and
    methods apply primary data from different sources to compile and analyse them
    for estimating a variable. For instance, precipitation pattern, streamflow condition,
    irrigated area, and crop data can be combined through a model or method to estimate
    the agriculture water demand (Ziman 2016). Climatological models, hydrological
    models, processed remote sensing data or satellite images are some examples of
    secondary data (Laituri and Sternlieb 2014). In addition to these classes of water
    data, 12 extensive groups of water data can be developed based on disciplines
    or sectors where water data is applied (BOM 2017). Detailed classifications of
    water data with respective examples are shown in Table 3.1. Table 3.1 Water data
    types together with data sources and examples Full size table All the stated data
    are essential for efficient decision making in different water disciplines, including
    the sectorial water management, integrated water sector planning, climate change
    adaptation, global and regional reporting, as well as operational and emergency
    management. Additionally, the type of required data for a specific project relies
    on the type of activity and plans. For instance, a flood inundation project will
    not require the same data as a peak flood prediction project. Additionally, the
    temporal and spatial resolution of the required water data should be specified
    for each project. For instance, the hourly river flow is generally applicable
    to peak flow prediction, and estimation of flash flood peak flows requires even
    higher temporal river flow resolution (e.g., minutes), while the daily river streamflow
    is required for analysis of river flow due to changes in land use pattern. Thus,
    the researchers and managers are required to consider the required data type and
    resolution from the beginning of a project. 3.2.1 Water Data Source Different
    distinct types of water data are required to determine water quality and quantity
    to achieve efficient integrated water resources management. Water data is obtained
    through different sources and methods. Basically, the water data comes from four
    sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and (4) administrative
    institutes (BOM 2017). Each of the stated sources will be discussed in the next
    four sections. 3.2.1.1 In Situ Measurements Water resources management constitutes
    a data-driven discipline, which involves consistent measurements of water quantity
    and quality. The measurements are mainly concerned with monitoring meteorological
    and hydrological variables (BOM 2017). In order to measure water variables, including
    physical, chemical, and biological parameters, specific methods and instruments
    are applied. For example, water level can be measured using different techniques
    such as a float and shaft encoder, a radar or an ultrasonic level sensor (NIWA
    2019), turbidity by determining the intensity of light scattered by suspended
    particles in the water column (EHMP 2006–07), and biological contamination using
    E. coli concentration as a marker (Edberg et al. 2000). In addition to the variables
    which come from direct measurement, some other variables are calculated according
    to a mathematical transformation of a direct measurement. For instance, river
    discharge is computed by multiplying the water area in a channel cross section
    by the water average velocity in that cross section (BOM 2017). In situ measurements
    can yield the most reliable water data, provided that the measuring devices are
    precise and properly calibrated. The restriction of direct measurements is the
    high cost of purchasing, installing, calibrating, fixing, and maintaining the
    measuring devices and equipment. Additionally, regular monitoring should be conducted
    periodically to obtain the proper data length and spatial coverage, and therefore,
    constant financial support and effort are required to manage the long and intensive
    monitoring programs (BOM 2017). Due to the discussed high costs, many poor countries
    suffer from improper and inadequate water data, which can directly affect the
    water management planning and strategies. This issue necessitates the provision
    of financial support by international agencies and organizations to improve the
    water monitoring networks in poor countries dealing with critical water supply
    and management problems. 3.2.1.2 Remote Sensing In 1957, the Sputnik 1 was the
    first artificial earth satellite that placed into orbit. This satellite had significant
    impact on humanity’s perception of space, and announcing a new era if earth observation.
    After launching the Sputnik 1, several systems (e.g., Television and InfraRed
    Observation Satellite (TIROS 1), Nimbus 1 etc.) were launched in the following
    year to weather and climate conditions. Such satellite missions led to dramatic
    advances in remote observations and measurements (McCabe et al. 2017). Remote
    sensing refers to the process of inferring surface parameters, which are derived
    from measurements of the emitted/reflected electromagnetic radiations, from the
    land surface (Schmugge et al. 2002). The application of remote sensing in hydrological
    sciences has provided new datasets with high temporal and spatial resolution for
    continuous water resources observations, which addresses the low resolution and
    expensive in situ measurements. Figure 3.2 indicates the earth observing system
    applied in hydrological sciences. The stated system consists of several components,
    signals of opportunity (e.g., cars, mobile phones), Doppler radar, mobile rovers,
    smart phone and citizens science (e.g., simple image capturing, plug-in and Bluetooth
    technologies), cell signals (e.g., antennas), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (e.g.,
    drones), research balloons, airborne vehicles, CubeStas, high definition (HD)
    videos, satellite missions (e.g., Landsat 1–8), sensors aboard the International
    Space Station (ISS), and geosynchronous meteorological satellites (McCabe et al.
    2017). Fig. 3.2 Earth observing system (Adopted from McCabe et al. 2017) Full
    size image There are two types of remote sensing instruments: i) active and ii)
    passive. These instruments are mounted on satellites, drones, vehicles, aircrafts,
    and ground-based structures to measure different water data parameters, such as
    soil moisture, evaporation, water temperature, rainfall rate, sediment concentration,
    flood inundation area, rainfall distribution, surface topography, wind speed and
    direction, cloud composition, and air humidity (BOM 2017). Active sensors provide
    their own source of energy for emitting radiation towards the investigated target,
    and then measure the time of arrival radiation reflected from the target. The
    majority of active sensors are able to perform in the microwave portion of the
    electromagnetic spectrum. Hence, these sensors can potentially penetrate the atmosphere
    under rough conditions. Laser altimeter, radar, Lidar, Ranging instrument, Scatterometer,
    and Sounder are examples of active sensors (NASA 2019). On the other hand, passive
    sensors detect natural energy (light wavelength) which is emitted or reflected
    from the observed scene. The common source of radiation measured by passive sensors
    is the reflected sunlight. Passive sensors include various types of spectrometers
    and radiometers. These sensors are able to perform in the infrared, visible, thermal
    infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Accelerometer,
    Hyperspectral Radiometer, Imaging Radiometer, Sounder, Spectrometer, and Spectroradiometer
    are some examples of passives sensors (NASA 2019). Remotely sensed data provides
    continuous spatial coverage and are typically presented in gridded form. The most
    temporally regular remotely sensed data set is obtained from satellites (BOM 2017).
    Since its advent in the 1960s, satellite remote sensing has been widely used as
    a complete source of information. Satellite sensors can measure almost all components
    of hydrological cycle, such as precipitation, evaporation, surface water, soil
    moisture, lake and river levels, surface and sub-surface water storage, and snow
    storage (Sheffield et al. 2018). However, satellites have relatively coarser spatial
    resolution than in situ measurements due to their large distance from the earth
    in relation to the resolution of the sensor and the attenuation effect of the
    atmosphere between the sensor and the observation point. Low earth orbiting satellites
    present much higher spatial resolution with lower temporal resolution (BOM 2017).
    The only issue that should be carefully considered in remote sensing is the requirement
    of significant information technology infrastructure for data management. Additionally,
    complex image processing tasks are needed to provide the data with suitable format
    (BOM 2017). In summary, remote sensing tools play an important role in improving
    water resources management through provision of large spatial and high temporal
    resolution. 3.2.1.3 Models In order to tackle the shortcomings and costs associated
    with in situ measurements and also to address the poor spatial support of in situ
    point measurements, different types of models and methods can be applied to generate
    water data. Modelling approaches are useful tools to address poor spatial support
    of in situ point measurements. For instance, required spatially distributed water
    surface elevations for flood magnitude, extent and timing estimations are derived
    from hydrodynamic models. Therefore, models and methods are applied for different
    purposes. For example, different rainfall-runoff models have been developed for
    generating the runoff data in ungauged catchments. Conceptual rainfall-runoff
    model applications such as Nedbor-Afstromings Model (NAM) (Makungo et al. 2010;
    Faiz et al. 2018; Zhen-lei et al. 2019), Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning
    (HBV) (Engeland and Hisdal 2009; Osuch et al. 2019), and The Hydrologic Engineering
    Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) (Gumindoga et al. 2017) are examples
    of model applications, which converts the rainfall to runoff in a defined catchment.
    In the field of water resources engineering, data-driven approaches have gained
    popularity for different water modelling purposes (Kim et al. 2013; Jahandideh-Tehrani
    et al. 2019; 2020a). Artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM),
    and random forest (RF) are few examples of data-driven approaches, which have
    been extensively applied in the area if water related modellings such as ground
    water level prediction (Daliakopoulos et al. 2005; Tsanis et al. 2008; Baudron
    et al. 2013), rainfall-runoff modelling (Daliakopoulos and Tsanis 2016; Berezowski
    and Chybicki 2018; Jahandideh-Tehrani et al. 2020b), reservoir operation (Niu
    et al. 2019; Ahmad and Hossain 2019), flood prediction (Zhou et al. 2019; Ahmadalipour
    and Moradkhani 2019). Some models are also used to extrapolate to past (e.g.,
    paleoclimate) and future conditions, such as climate models. Future precipitation,
    evaporation, wind, and temperature can be generated using different climate models,
    such as Hadley Center Coupled Model (HADCM3), Norwegian Erath System Model (NorESM),
    and The Fifth Version Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC5)
    (Randall et al. 2007). In order to summarize a large amount of information, specific
    approaches such as system dynamics (SD) are applied to analyse and interpret information.
    Using flow diagrams and feedback loops facilitate the analysis and conclusion
    for complex information (Ahmad and Simonovic 2004; Jahandideh Tehrani et al. 2014;
    Christias et al. 2020). In summary, models and methods are used for tasks, such
    as making predictions, data assimilation, and interpreting the large amount of
    complex information. The main limitation of applying models is the uncertainty
    resulting from models due to prior assumptions and scale issues. In water resources
    engineering field, analytical techniques (e.g., Mellin transform technique, and
    Fourier transform technique) and approximation techniques (e.g., first-order variance
    estimation (FOVE), probabilistic point estimation (PE) methods, and Monte-Carlo
    simulation) are the two main uncertainty analysis categories that can be applied
    to address hydrologic, hydraulic, structural, and economic uncertainties (Tung
    2011). Many researchers have discussed model uncertainty analysis and proposed
    methods to reduce the amount of uncertainty. For instance, Wagener and Wheater
    (2006) investigated the sources of uncertainty in a rainfall-runoff model by focusing
    on 10 catchments. They identified that the uncertainty is related to local modelling
    (process of selection and calibration of the local model structure) and regionalization
    procedures. To increase the accuracy of model results, many studies have focused
    on analysing uncertainty and reducing the vulnerability. Her et al. (2019) evaluated
    the associated uncertainties with multi GCMs in runoff and precipitation projections.
    In terms of adaptation planning for uncertain climate change impacts, evaluating
    the robust adaptation decisions to climate change uncertainties was studied by
    Dessai and Hulme (2007). They concluded that water resources are sensitive to
    regional climate response uncertainties in climate change impacts. Also, Fletcher
    et al. (2019) developed a new planning framework to evaluate climate uncertainty
    over time for flexible planning strategies. In summary, despite the wide applications
    of models in improving water data, research is still required to improve the accuracy
    of the model results. 3.2.1.4 Administrative Institutes Two types of data, including
    the water rights data and administrative data (mentioned in Table 3.1) are not
    obtained from measurements or models. Data such as water rights, water pricing,
    water infrastructure inventories, water demand in different economic activities,
    water ownership, and basin borders are basically recorded by water management
    agencies as part of their business purposes. Additionally, such data can be collected
    by conducting household and business surveys (BOM 2017). Water rights data and
    administrative data play a critical role in developing, proposing, and evaluating
    the water management strategies and policies as well as decision making. For instance,
    water system governance, which refers to the structure and administrative process,
    should direct and control operations, decision making, legislation, and finance
    as part of their tasks. Therefore, administrative data is required in order to
    determine operational standards and water regulations. A large number of agencies
    and organizations are involved in the establishment and administration of water
    rights in scale of regional, national and international scopes. In Europe, the
    Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the main foundation of European Union (EU)
    water policy that aims to ensure sustainable water use and protect aquatic systems
    through applying legislations to all surface waters (rivers, lakes, transitional
    and coastal waters) as well as groundwater (Carvalho et al. 2019). In Australia,
    the Department of Natural Resources and Mines is involved in water system administration
    in all states (Productivity Commission 2003). While different countries/regions/continents
    have their own administrative institutes to dictate water related policies (e.g.,
    water pricing, water ownerships, river borders, etc.), there are also international
    foundations, which deal with global water issues. For example, World Water Council
    is an international multi-stakeholder organization that enhance political action
    and awareness to deal with critical water issues through developing partnerships
    between countries (World Water Council 2020). Pacific Institute, Clean Water Action,
    and Water.org are other examples of global organizations that aim to solve water
    conflicts, promote legislation for water protection, and deal with water crisis.
    3.3 Key Characteristics of Water Data Type Different types of water data have
    their own characteristics and use. In other words, each type of water data should
    be applied for a specific purpose of water resources management, such as flood
    management, water quality management, sediment control, and water security management.
    The key characteristics of water data together with examples are listed below
    (BOM 2017): Parameter type (e.g., river flow data for reservoir operation; water
    demand data for irrigation management) Measurement location (e.g., water quality
    data for upstream of water offtakes for drinking water supply; groundwater level
    data for heavily utilized aquifers) Spatial coverage (e.g., flood level data for
    flood prone areas; national scale water assessment) Spatial density (e.g., rainfall
    distribution for rainfall pattern assessment) Temporal frequency (e.g., daily
    or monthly river data for regional water security assessment; high frequency river
    and rainfall data for flood forecasting) Longevity of measurements (multi-decadal
    data of continuous rainfall for rainfall IDF analysis; historical river flow data
    for flood frequency and magnitude analysis) Latency (e.g., basin time concentration
    for rainfall-runoff modelling; real-time rainfall and river level data for flood
    forecasting) Precision (e.g., water quality data should be precise in order to
    confirm safe drinking water supply; water pricing should be assessed carefully
    to prevent probable issues between stakeholders). 3.4 Challenges of Water Data
    In most countries, the nation’s water data arrangements cannot satisfy the need
    of water sector participants, and the processes of data collection are limited.
    There is an increasing need for systematic data collection in order to improve
    monitoring and ensure informed decision making (IWRM 2019). Over the next three
    sections, basic challenges of accessing proper and accurate water data will be
    discussed. 3.4.1 Poor Quality of Water Data There are many gaps in the available
    water dataset, and the quality of some water data is poor. Generally, the available
    water datasets are heterogeneous, dispersed, and poor in quality (BOM 2017). Dispersion
    and gaps in water data are mainly the result of poorly calibrated measuring devices
    as well as inefficient equipment maintenance. Apparently, water management will
    be challenging without good water data. Therefore, policy makers and managers
    are unable to make sound decisions as the provided water data are unreliable and
    contradictory (BOM 2017). Additionally, many poor countries, which are facing
    financial problems, are not equipped with modern and efficient measuring devices
    and techniques, which leads to poor measurements, and subsequently poor quality
    datasets (INBO 2018). Lack of homogeneity in water data causes poor data management
    as the data is useless, and massive investments on water infrastructure and data
    collection is wasted. Heterogeneous data mainly occurs when private organizations
    follow their own specific guidelines and procedures for data collection, and there
    is no general adopted rules for all data collector organizations (BOM 2017). 3.4.2
    Lack of Integrated Water Portal Systems One of the main water data challenges
    in many countries is the lack of information about the available water data, and
    also not openly shared datasets. Basically, there is no single established organization/tool/website
    to provide potential users with information about the different available water
    types, and characteristics of the water date sets. Detailed metadata, i.e. information
    on “how the data is produced”, “how the data can be accessed”, “how the data should
    be used”, “who to contact”, and “what the licence of the data is” are not provided
    by institutions in many countries. Thus, researchers and water data users require
    considerable time, effort, and investment to identify stated information. Therefore,
    data users and researchers need to spend time on basic data gathering and transformation
    rather than scientific analysis. This problem is noticeable when data is collected
    by multiple agencies for a specific task purpose. For instance, the required meteorological
    data models and formats for hydrological purposes (e.g., groundwater and catchment
    modelling) are different from the meteorological data formats for atmospheric
    science analysis. As a result of this data difference, a hydrologist should spend
    significant amount of time on learning the file format and visualization tool
    used by atmospheric science community. To address this problem, data should be
    communicated between scientific sub-disciplines systems through standard protocol/web
    services (Goodall et al. 2008). In this context, organizations such as European
    Flood Awareness System (EFAS), Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS), European
    drought observatory (EDO), Watershed Index Online (WSIO), United States Geological
    Survey (USGS) Water Data, BOM climate data online, European Space Agency (ESA),
    Copernicus Space Component (CSC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) have made efforts to provide users with documented, homogeneous, and well-organized
    data set, which can be accessed through web services, and indicate datasets in
    the form of maps, tables, and graphs. 3.4.3 Limited Access to Data According to
    the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principle, the public should
    participate in decision making processes. In order to pave this way, water institutions
    and organization should make the water data and information available and accessible
    to the public. However, much water data is not accessible by the public, or the
    water data type is not understandable by people with no expert knowledge. Thus,
    to ensure the participations of the public, water data should be disseminated
    in an informative and comprehensible way (INBO 2018). In addition to the public,
    openly shared and freely access to most water data is limited for water data users,
    particularly researchers. Regarding the fact that in many countries, funds for
    data collections come from private sectors, institutions are mainly reluctant
    to share the data freely. Additionally, many national organizations have no tends
    to share the collected data with the neighbouring countries or other international
    organizations. This situation is observed particularly when the countries are
    facing critical water scarcity, and the countries under such conflicts deny publishing
    information due to security risks (INBO 2018). Additionally, poor countries, which
    are facing financial problems, are unable to build efficient water information
    systems, manage water data, and develop efficient web portals and tools for data
    sharing. As a result, international organizations and agencies play an important
    role in providing financial support as well as remote monitoring to deal with
    the water problem in poor countries (INBO 2018). 3.4.4 Big Data Problems Regarding
    the increased amount of water data, several challenges can appear for big water
    data management. Big water data is associated with increased data volume, variety,
    and velocity. The amount of measured and processed data is growing rapidly. Additionally,
    the growing formats of data can make data management challenging. Considering
    the increased automation in data measurement process, the biases, abnormalities,
    and noise are also increasing in raw water data. As a result, a suitable and massive
    validation process is required to treat raw water data. Citizen science data is
    another aspect of big data complexity. Citizen science refers to the participation
    of the general public in the process of research design and data collection, which
    leads to the collection of large volumes of data (Buytaert et al. 2014). In the
    field of climate modelling, the spatial and temporal dimensions of data are intensive
    as such data indicates complex process of atmosphere and ocean circulation. Therefore,
    such climate data requires high storage space and large computer processing power
    (Cuntz et al. 2007). High volume data with long time periods can lead to high
    potential of data loss or intrusion. Generally, with high increase in the amount
    of data, many challenges are coupled with the process of big water data management.
    3.5 Data Processing Data processing refers to the manipulation of data obtained
    from in situ measurements or remote sensing, before they can be efficiently stored
    or made available (Hughes 1998). Raw data should be processed and transformed
    into formats to be identified and applied by researchers, data users, and decision
    makers (INBO 2018). Regarding the cost, effort, and high volume involved in data
    collection, proper data processing tools and approaches should be adopted (Hughes
    1998). Many tools are available for data processing, including spreadsheets and
    databases, database management tools, geographic information systems (GIS), Extract-Transform-Load
    (ETL) tools, modelling tools, and statistical data analysis tools. However, the
    selected tools and approaches should meet the requirements of the data users and
    researchers: What data format is required? What is the purpose of using the data?
    What kind of research will be conducted? And which organization will use the data?
    (INBO 2018). 3.5.1 Water Data Processing and Analysis The main purpose of data
    processing is to convert raw data into information, which meets the need of researchers
    and decision makers. Key points of water data processing are (Hughes 1998): Data
    encoding and digitizing; Quality control, consistency checking, and error checking;
    Data storage resolution; Data calibration and stability; Data storage and retrieval
    system. The stated key points will be discussed below: Data encoding and digitizing:
    Converting the measurements to digital is the first step of data processing. Hand-written
    field sheets or automatically penned charts mounted on a rotating drum are simple
    forms of data collection, which is still applied in many areas, particularly for
    collecting rainfall, evaporation, and other meteorological variables. Next, this
    data should be transferred to a computer database. Lost or damaged data is the
    main drawback of this manual data recoding. Therefore, modern telemetry, remote
    sensing, and other modern instruments have been developed to record the data automatically,
    particularly collecting the “real time” data (Hughes 1998). The vast quantities
    of recorded data (in situ measurements and remote sensing data) should be transformed
    into the cloud services in order to be stored and classified and then be accessible
    through portals and web services (McCabe et al. 2017). Data quality control: Data
    collection corresponds with issues such as missing data, recorded data over the
    incorrect time, accumulated data, instrument failure, etc. Additionally, most
    databases are not able to identify poor and incorrect data and inform data users
    of data inconsistency (Hughes 1998). Missing data processing, logical error detection,
    repeated data processing, abnormal data detection, and inconsistent data processing
    are main aspects of hydrological data quality control. Prediction methods (e.g.,
    recurrence neural network (RNN), and support vector machine (SVM)), optimization
    methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), and statistical methods (e.g.,
    adaptive boosting, and statistical control) are some examples of data driven approaches
    for data quality control (Zhao et al. 2018). Data storage resolution: Time resolution
    is of great importance in water data, particularly, the data used in hydrological
    analysis. For example, required time step for analysing the rainfall intensity
    in temperate climate is different from the arid and semiarid climates. Normally,
    the rainfall data with a resolution of one hour should be proper in temperate
    climate, while short-term variation of intensity is more important in arid and
    semiarid areas, and hence, minute should be the proper time step in arid areas
    (Hughes 1998). Therefore, disaggregation methods, such as Hyetos based on Bartlett-Lewis
    process and Marcov chain model should be applied in order to break down the data
    into shorter time steps (Koutsoyiannis 2003), which is considered as an important
    task of data processing. Data value accuracy: Accuracy of observations is a numeric
    value that quantifies the data measurements accuracy based on the closeness to
    the standard value. The stated value accuracy measures the associated uncertainty
    with data measurements, which is the result of errors in bias and precision. The
    value accuracy can be estimated using the knowledge of instrument accuracy and
    measurement method as well as statistical analysis of the records from repeated
    measurements (Horsburgh et al. 2008). Additionally, some instrument calibration
    process (either manual calibration or using table and equations) is required to
    ensure accurate measurements. For instance, the stage-discharge relationship is
    commonly used to convert water level measurements of a flume to flow rate or discharge.
    In the case of a flooding event in a river, calibration process is necessary as
    riverbank erosion and massive sediment transport occur over flood events (Hughes
    1998). Data storage and retrieval system: As describe in Sect. 4.4, big data requires
    massive amounts of data to be stored. Metadata catalogues and data storage systems
    help data users to identify the available datasets and check their characteristics
    (Hughes 1998). Within this context, recorded observations should be stored with
    sufficient supporting information (e.g., the location, date and time and type
    of variable that was observed) about the observations to enable data interpretation
    and cross-dimension data retrieval and analysis (Horsburgh et al. 2008). The databases
    should provide users with helpful information on the type measurements, data length,
    instrument details, the latitude and longitude of measurements, data quality,
    missing data, time zone, etc. Additionally, an efficient database is able to allow
    user to access and download the data in different formats, such shape files, text
    file, and excel files. It is also necessary to design a frequent backup system
    for the databases in order to prevent data lost in a case of system failure (Hughes
    1998). In the scope of data storage and retrieval, Internet of Things (IoT) technology,
    which has been developed rapidly in recent years, is considered as a key approach
    in big data processing. Within this context, cloud computing is a new generation
    of computing architecture that supports big data applications and growing data
    processing (Fan et al. 2018). As an example of such applications, the cloud-computing
    services have been applied to watershed management by enabling watershed partnerships
    for focusing primarily on decision-making activities (Sun 2013). Bürger et al.
    (2012) also developed an intuitive Web interface to create an integrated hydrologic
    simulation platform that enables users to access scientific software through a
    web browser. 3.5.2 Water Data Visualization After the data process step and data
    preparation, the next step is to present the data in an understandable and efficient
    way. Regarding the recent improvements of digital culture and information technologies,
    large datasets become complex to understand. Therefore, visual presentation of
    data has been developed, which presents data in the form of a graph, map, video,
    animation, hierarchy, etc. Data visualization can also improve understanding of
    existing trends, patterns and correlation in the datasets that might not detected
    in text and number-based data. As a result, stakeholders and decision makers can
    easily identify the important issues of water resources management to focus on
    as well as adapting new policies. In the scope of data visualization, the quality
    of data presentation is important as a poor or incorrect type of data visualization
    may cause misleading and hinder smart decision making. The visualization tool
    should be selected based on specific criteria, including i) how data viewers interact
    with data, ii) the information that should be obtained by the viewers, iii) the
    function of the data, and iv) the data composition. The three main types of water
    data presentation are as below (INBO 2018): Maps: They indicate the geographical
    distribution of different parameters, such as evaporation, rainfall, temperature.
    Maps can be produced using GIS software. Key figures: They are generated from
    data processing and document analysis. Key figures are understandable by public.
    Factsheet: They show a regular summary of data analysis, information, and graphs
    on different topics such as global warming, climate change, and drought trend.
    3.5.3 Water Data Dissemination After collecting, verifying, processing, and storing
    the water data, the next important task is to release and disseminate the data
    according to the target group (e.g., the general public, researchers, and decision
    makers) (e.g., before and after a flooding event). Data dissemination consists
    of four main steps (SEQwater 2014): (1) Data value identification: The first step
    is to evaluate the data value and information asset to decide on the price of
    the water data. The data value is conducted by surveying business system, water
    companies, and stakeholders about their needs and interests. Some data can be
    accessible free of charge considering the expenses of data preparation process
    and company’s needs and interests. (2) Data assessment: Over the second step,
    the data suitability for release should be assessed based on relevant guidelines,
    policies, and legislations. Additionally, depending on the target group (e.g.,
    scientific, non-expert purposes), data visualizations, data use instructions,
    and data use policies should be defined. (3) Data publication: Over the third
    step, data should be published based on priority factors such as public interest,
    stakeholder feedback, company and institutes need, and economic values. Additionally,
    given the type of requirements of different target groups (e.g., the general public,
    researchers, and decision makers) and required time of hydrological events (e.g.,
    before and after a flood event, before and after a dam construction), data dissemination
    should be specified. (4) Data management: Over the last step, data quality should
    be improved with regard to data user’s feedback. In order to release the water
    data, different strategies and digital tool are available. Below is the list of
    different water data dissemination plans (INBO 2018): Web portals and websites:
    data resulted from monitoring programs is delivered through portals and website.
    Basically, portals provide organized data, and water data is classified based
    on different criteria such as collected data from open stations, water data type
    (e.g., water level, streamflow, and rainfall), collected data from closed station,
    river type, time periods, water data unit (e.g., mega litre and cubic meters),
    and measured interval (e.g., hourly, daily, and monthly). Factsheets: guidelines,
    water issues (e.g., global warming and climate change), water data change trend
    analysis (e.g., temperature trend, major flood event trend and evaporation change
    trend), monitoring programs (e.g., coastal erosion monitoring), management programs
    (e.g., integrated sub-basin management plans) can be published through digital
    books. Social media networks: In addition to portals, websites, and digital books,
    social media networks also play an important role in water data dissemination.
    Social media networks increase people’s awareness of available water data and
    establish contact with internet and data users. Additionally, social media are
    effective way of transferring news and water data updates to users. Smart apps:
    smart and free apps are favourable, particularly among the public. Smart applications
    can potentially target different water users and improve interaction. For instance,
    “Ma Cons’eau” is a useful free application, which can estimate the people’s water
    consumption through providing a set of simple questions. The amount of water consumption
    is calculated based on the water price of resident locations. 3.6 Practical Examples
    Many organizations, systems and programs have been developed to provide high quality
    data and services of weather, climate, hydrological, and environmental fields
    for the purpose of integrated water resources management. Therefore, multiple
    water data, information, and knowledge should be shared to build cross-functionality
    between stakeholders. One example of the water data system is the World Hydrological
    Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS), launched by the World Meteorological Organization
    (WMO) in 1993 to improve sustainable development in delivery and use of hydrological
    data as well as promoting regional and international cooperation. WHYCOS aims
    to enhance the sustainable protection, use and management of water resources systems
    as well as support decision makers through reliable and data provision. In terms
    of regional water resources management, HYCOS promotes data and information products,
    such as flood forecasts and warning data. At global scale, the WHYCOS International
    Advisory Group (WIAG) was introduced to provide support for policy guidelines
    and future development of the projects (WMO 2019). Another example of global water
    data organization is the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), which was established
    three decades ago. GRDC is an international archive of streamflow data, which
    aims to enhance analysis of global climate trends and evaluate environmental impacts
    and risks. The Global Runoff Data Base (GRDB) at GRDC was built on an initial
    dataset collected in the early 1980s. GRDB is a unique tool for obtaining river
    streamflow data at daily and monthly time step from over 9,500 gauging stations
    in 161 countries. In terms of national scale, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)
    in Australia has developed the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS).
    As shown in Fig. 3.3, the purpose of AWRIS is to receive and manage water data
    and information as well as supporting and disseminating different water information
    products and services. Fig. 3.3 The role of AWRIS in water information in Australia
    (Adopted from AWRIS Information Sheets 2019) Full size image AWRIS is able to
    store and manage information about groundwater levels, river flow, the quality
    of water in rivers and aquifers, water trades, water use and restrictions, and
    water volume in storages in a central database. Next, the stored data is checked
    for quality and standards to ensure that the stored data is consistent with the
    current available data. Over the next step, the Australian Hydrological Geospatial
    Fabric cast the stored water information in a spatial context through encoding
    the spatial connections between Australia’s hydrological features (e.g., rivers,
    lakes, aquifers, dams, channels etc.). As indicated in Fig. 3.3, the final step
    includes analysing, interpreting, and integrating the water data. AWRIS delivers
    variety of water data, reports, and forecasts, such as real-time water reports,
    regular national water resources assessments, improved flood warning systems,
    and seasonal streamflow forecasts. The main advantage of AWRIS is that water users
    are able (i) to identify water resources condition in Australia through integrated
    viewpoint, (ii) to prepare benchmark reports using quality and transparent data,
    (iii) to check the details of standards, (iv) to control the quality of applied
    water data, and (v) to easily use the data for planning, analysis, reporting,
    and modelling (AWRIS information sheets 2019). 3.7 Summary Limited water resources
    and increased demand for the resources leads to growing challenges facing water
    resources systems. This growing pressure on water resources is the result of many
    issues, such as rapid population growth, poor water data, inefficient water resources
    management, and climate change. Therefore, the need to enhance water security,
    sustainable water management, reliable water supply, and environment protection
    necessitate the integrated water resources planning and management. The chapter
    underlines that water data and information are considered as the key components
    of water-based research, which provide decision makers with proper information
    in different water disciplines. Water data can be classified into two main categories,
    primary data and secondary data, where primary data is the collection of raw data,
    and secondary data obtained from models, lab experiments, and specific methods.
    Additionally, water data types can be grouped based on disciplines/sectors that
    water data is used. For instance, hydrometric data, meteorological data, and groundwater
    data are applied in hydrology services, meteorological services, and geological
    and mining institutes, respectively. Different distinct water data is obtained
    from four main sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and
    (4) administrative institutes. The chapter also discuss the limitation of water
    data, including poor quality, lack of integrated water portal systems, limited
    funds for data provision, and big data problems. In order to efficiently store
    and apply data, water data should be processed and analysed through key steps:
    (1) data encoding and digitizing; (2) quality control, consistency checking, and
    error checking; (3) data storage resolution analysis; (4) data calibration and
    stability; and (5) data storage and retrieval systems. After the data processing
    steps, water data should be visualized and presented in an understandable way
    to find our existing climate trend, pattern and correlation for the purpose of
    adapting new policies and management strategies in the realm of water resources.
    Thereafter, water data should be released and disseminated through web portals
    and websites, E-books, media and social networks, and smart apps to be used by
    decision makers, researchers, and policy makers for efficient water management
    planning. In general, the outcomes of the present chapter will benefit different
    water disciplines sectors through provision of discussion on the role, current
    condition, and importance of water data and information in water resources management.
    3.8 Recommendations Regarding the important role of data provision in integrated
    water resources management, it is recommended: (1) To provide public easy access
    to water data with the purpose to serve many different contexts: In order to improve
    decision making strategies, enhance national and international research studies,
    and ensure efficient water resources management, different water data sources
    and types should be highly accessible. Additionally, free provision of some data
    sources can potentially increase people’s awareness about the responsibility and
    importance of different water sectors. As a results of this increased awareness,
    public tends to have interactions and collaborations with experts, which leads
    to efficient water supply and management. (2) To improve collaboration and engagement
    between water data system or portal developers and users: Identification of the
    intended purpose of data provision is a fundamental need for achieving efficient
    data use. Therefore, before providing the data, sound understanding of the need
    of stakeholders and data users is essential to ensure the relevant data collection.
    (3) To develop a single global data system: Despite the availability of many different
    sources, portals and websites for data users, some researchers have challenge
    to identify the most accurate and efficient source of data for their studies.
    In order to address this issue, multiple sources of water data at different spatial
    and temporal resolutions should be consolidated in a single global data system.
    (4) To provide data in different formats and resolutions to target different decisions
    making strategies: Based on the type of decision-making strategy, research project,
    and water management strategy, different temporal and spatial resolutions of data
    should be provided. Hence, an efficient water data system should provide resolution
    flexibility in data as well as ensuring the quality and integrity of data. (5)
    To propose and build a novel water data system for water data format conversion:
    Many researchers and water data users should convert the format of the collected
    water data into the required input data format of different water software packages.
    The process of data format conversion is time and money consuming. Therefore,
    the generation and provision of different water data formats help users to save
    time in running water software and models. (6) To develop efficient water data
    systems, which are able to generate and update information from water data automatically:
    Water data systems should be improved in order to automatically generate some
    illustrations (maps, figures, and tables) from the input data. Additionally, the
    new collected data should automatically update the water data system by providing
    updated illustrations and information. (7) To develop more accurate data gap filling
    methods: Some data, such as future meteorological data under climate change, should
    be estimated. There are also gaps in some data due to different reasons, such
    as defective measuring device. In order to inform decision making and researchers
    with proper data, the stated limitations and gaps should be addressed. (8) To
    integrate different data sources to ensure quality data: Various organizations
    provide water data based on different standards of data measurements, processing,
    and collection. Water organizations and sectors should integrate water data system
    by satisfying specific level of standards in terms of data quality, processing,
    measurements, and documentations. These recommendations will help water data providers,
    modellers, and researchers to detect the limitations of current water data and
    to identify room for improvements. References Ahmad SK, Hossain F (2019) A generic

    \ are characterized by diversity and complexity, which makes crop\nmapping at\
    \ a regional scale a top priority for different purposes such as administrative\
    \ decisions\nand farming management. Project 32194 of the Dragon 4 Program was\
    \ implemented to meet the\nrequirements of crop mapping, with the speciﬁc objective\
    \ to develop suitable approaches for precise\ncrop mapping with combined uses\
    \ of European and Chinese high- and medium-resolution satellite\nimages. Two sub-projects\
    \ were involved in the project. The ﬁrst was to focus on the use of time\nseries\
    \ high-resolution satellite data, including Sentinel-2 (S2, European satellite\
    \ data) and Gaofen-1\n(GF-1, Chinese satellite data), due to their similar spectral\
    \ bands for Earth observation, while the\nsecond was to focus on medium-resolution\
    \ data sources, i.e., the European Project for On-Board\nAutonomy–Vegetation (PROBA-V)\
    \ and Chinese Fengyun-3 Medium Resolution Spectral Imager\n(FY-3 MERSI) satellite\
    \ data, also due to their similar spectral channels. The approach of the European\n\
    Space Agency (ESA) Sent2Agri project for crop mapping was adapted in the ﬁrst\
    \ sub-project and\napplied to the Yellow River irrigated district (YERID) of Ningxia\
    \ in northwest China in order to\nassess its ability to accurately identify crop\
    \ types in China. The goal of the second sub-project was\nto explore the potential\
    \ of both European and Chinese medium-resolution satellite data for crop\nassessment\
    \ in a large area. Methods to handle the data and retrieve the required information\
    \ for the\nprecise crop mapping were developed in the study, including the adaptation\
    \ of the ESA approach\nto GF-1 data and the application of algorithms for classiﬁcation.\
    \ A scheme for the validation of the\ncrop mapping was developed in the study.\
    \ The results of implementing the scheme to the YERID in\nNingxia indicated that\
    \ the overall accuracies of crop mapping with S2 and GF-1 can be high, up to\n\
    94–97%, and the mapping had an accuracy of 88% with the PROBA-V and FY3B-MERSI\
    \ data. The\nvery high accuracy suggests the possibility of precise crop mapping\
    \ with the combined use of time\nseries high- and medium-resolution satellite\
    \ data when suitable approaches are chosen to handle the\ndata for the classiﬁcation\
    \ of crop types.\nKeywords: crop mapping; classiﬁcation; GF; Sentinel; Sent2Agri;\

    \ in remote sensing applications. Precise\ncrop mapping is needed at various scales\
    \ for users from individual agricultural companies\nto national and international\
    \ entities. Crop mapping has therefore become one of the key\nRemote Sens. 2021,\

    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 4641\n2 of 17\nremote sensing applications in agriculture.\
    \ Due to the high diversity and complexity of\nagricultural landscapes, accurate\
    \ identiﬁcation of crop types is challenging. Moreover,\nagricultural ﬁelds are\
    \ often divided into multiple cropping patches with different varieties\nor even\
    \ different crops. Therefore, mixed targets are commonly seen in an image pixel\n\
    when the spatial resolution does not allow for separating the patches. This is\
    \ especially\ntrue in China because farmers have parcels of 0.2 ha on average.\
    \ The number of mixed\npixels decreases as the spatial resolution of satellite\
    \ data improves. However, a high spatial\nresolution also implies increased costs\
    \ and a smaller area being covered by one image. In\naddition, it is crucial to\
    \ acquire frequent images to accurately differentiate the spectral\nproﬁles of\
    \ different crops across the season [1]. All in all, developing precise crop mapping\n\
    methods is still a challenging task in remote sensing for agricultural monitoring.\n\
    Crop type classiﬁcation with satellite image time series is an important tool\
    \ for pre-\ncise and timely crop mapping. A number of open-source, cloud-based\
    \ tools have been\ndeveloped for crop type classiﬁcation in recent years. The\
    \ Sen2Agri system is one such\nopen-source tool available for free download, allowing\
    \ users to generate near-real-time\nproducts tailored to their needs at their\
    \ own premises or using cloud computing infras-\ntructure [1]. A variety of crop\
    \ classiﬁcation methods at different scales and with various\nlevels of accuracy\
    \ can be found in the literature [2–4]. Meng [5] collected all the avail-\nable\
    \ cloud-free Sentinel-2 multispectral images for winter wheat and rapeseed growth\n\
    periods in the study area in southern China and used the random forest (RF) method\
    \ as\nthe classiﬁer to identify the optimal temporal window. Song [6] presented\
    \ an approach\nintegrating object-based image analysis with RF for mapping in-season\
    \ crop types based\non multitemporal GF-1 satellite data at a spatial resolution\
    \ of 16 m. Song [7] proposed a\nmethod to examine a total of 13 spectral variables\
    \ from GF-1 images and three classiﬁers,\nthe Bayesian discriminant (BD), Mahalanobis\
    \ distance (MD), and RF, for classiﬁcation of\nsix LULC types at East Dongting\
    \ Lake, Hunan, China. Li [8] utilized deep learning-based\nframeworks, including\
    \ DenseNet, ResNet, VGG, SegNet, and DeepLab v3+, for cotton crop\nﬁeld identiﬁcation\
    \ with GF-1 high-resolution (16 m) images. Fan [4] reported on crop type\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ with high-resolution satellite data with a wide ﬁeld of viewer (WFV) onboard\n\
    GF-1, the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel 2 (S2), and the Operational\n\
    Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 (L8), and found that these satellite data\
    \ may be\nused for crop type classiﬁcation within the growing season with very\
    \ good accuracy if the\ntraining datasets were well-tuned. A combination of S2\
    \ and L8 for classiﬁcation has been\nconﬁrmed to be suitable for crop type classiﬁcation\
    \ [9–12].\nLow-resolution satellite data have been applied to agricultural monitoring\
    \ in the past\nthree decades. It has been commonly understood that the spatial\
    \ resolution of satellite\ndata is one of the key factors determining the quality\
    \ and accuracy of their applications\nfor crop monitoring. To improve the accuracy\
    \ of crop monitoring, the spatial resolution\nof several types of EO data has\
    \ been steadily evolving. European satellite, the Project for\nOn-Board Autonomy–Vegetation\
    \ (PROBA-V) [13], brought the world a new data source\nfor agricultural monitoring.\
    \ PROBA-V data has a spatial resolution of 100 m and the ability\nto cover the\
    \ entire surface of the globe. Moreover, the data may be downloaded free of\n\
    charge. In addition, PROBA-V provides satellite data with 300 m and 1 km pixel\
    \ scales\nunder nadir. The Chinese meteorological satellite provides 250-m-resolution\
    \ data globally\nand free of charge since late 2008 [14]. FY-3 MERSI [15] is a\
    \ Medium-Resolution Spectral\nImager (MERSI) carried aboard the third FY (“Wind\
    \ and Cloud”) series of meteorological\nsatellites developed in China. FY-3A/B/C\
    \ MERSI has 20 spectral bands, ﬁve bands in\n250 m, and 15 bands in 1000 m, while\
    \ FY-3D MERSI has 25 spectral bands, six in 250 m,\nand 19 bands in 1000 m. The\
    \ 250 m bands of FY3 MERSI are similar to PROBA-V in the\nvisible and near-infrared.\n\
    PROBA-V supports applications such as land use, worldwide vegetation classiﬁcation,\n\
    crop monitoring, famine prediction, food security, disaster monitoring, and biosphere\n\
    studies. The 100-m PROBA-V data has been widely used for landscape classiﬁcation.\n\
    Eberenz [16] demonstrated land cover mapping over West Africa with PROBA-V 100\
    \ m\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4641\n3 of 17\ntime series data for the 2014–2015\
    \ season, using temporal metrics and cloud ﬁltering in\ncombination with in situ\
    \ training data and machine learning, implemented on the ESA\nCloud Toolbox infrastructure.\
    \ Lambert [17] proposed a fully automated classiﬁcation\nmethod to deliver the\
    \ ﬁrst cropland map at a 100 m scale for the Sahel and Sudan region\nusing PROBA-V\
    \ images with an overall accuracy of 84% and an F-score of 74%. Dur-\ngun [18]\
    \ developed a method inspired by spectral matching techniques (SMTs) and based\n\
    on phenological characteristics of different crop types using 100-m PROBA-V normal-\n\
    ized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from the 2014–2015 season for crop\
    \ area\nmapping. Zhang [19] studied crop classiﬁcations based on Iterative Self-Organizing\
    \ Data\nAnalysis Technique (ISODATA) clustering, the maximum likelihood method\
    \ (MLC), and\na similarity analysis. Roumenina [20] assessed the crop mapping\
    \ performance provided\nby the PROBA-V 100 m data in comparison with coarser-resolution\
    \ data (e.g., PROBA-V\n300 m data) in Bulgaria with the maximum likelihood classiﬁcation\
    \ (MLC) and Iterative\nSelf-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). Dimitrov\
    \ [21] presented the results\nof a subpixel classiﬁcation of crop types in Bulgaria\
    \ from PROBA-V 100 m NDVI time\nseries using two subpixel classiﬁcation methods,\
    \ an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), and\nsupport vector regression (SVR). Moreover,\
    \ VITO [22] developed an operational Mission\nExploitation Platform (MEP) to drastically\
    \ improve the exploitation of the PROBA-V Earth\nObservation (EO) data archive.\
    \ FY-3 MERSI data were also made available through the\nresearch cooperation [14]\
    \ and used to make the crop type map in the North China Plain\nwith the decision\
    \ tree algorithm [23] as well as to monitor the crop growth [24–35].\nThe recent\
    \ development of high- and coarse-resolution satellite data in Europe and\nChina\
    \ provides an opportunity to investigate the potential of using both types of\
    \ data\nfor precise crop mapping at a regional scale. In this paper, we present\
    \ the results of the\nDragon 4 project 32194. The aim of the project is to evaluate\
    \ the potential of crop mapping\nwith the combined use of European and Chinese\
    \ satellite data. It was divided into two\nsub-projects, namely, crop mapping\
    \ with (i) high-resolution Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-1 data\nand (ii) medium-resolution\
    \ PROBA-V and FY-3 MERSI data. The main objectives of the\nﬁrst sub-project were\
    \ to (i) compare S2 and GF-1 time series data in a perspective of crop\ntype mapping,\
    \ (ii) develop a crop type mapping method based on both high-resolution\nsatellites\
    \ time series, (iii) validate and extend the crop mapping approach of ESA Sen2Agri\n\
    in an irrigated area in northwest China, and (iv) improve GF-1 satellite data\
    \ processing.\nThe aims of the second sub-project were to (i) develop a method\
    \ for crop mapping with\nboth PROBA-V and FY-3 MERSI data and (ii) improve FY-3\
    \ MERSI data processing and\nproduct generation.\n2. Data and Methods\n2.1. High-Resolution\
    \ Crop Mapping (Sub-Project 1)\n2.1.1. Study Area\nThe study area [4] of the ﬁrst\
    \ sub-project was the Yellow River Irrigation District\n(YERID) in Ningxia Hui\
    \ Autonomous Region, northwest China [36,37]. The YERID has\nlong been appreciated\
    \ as the most important agricultural production region in Ningxia,\neven though\
    \ the annual rainfall is very low in the district. Two-thirds of Ningxia’s total\n\
    grain production and agricultural production value is generated from YERID, even\
    \ though\nit has only one-third of the total farmland in Ningxia. The study area\
    \ also represents a\ntypical irrigated agricultural region in China. Wheat, rice,\
    \ and corn are the major crops in\nYERID. The growing season in YERID is generally\
    \ from May to September.\n2.1.2. Field Data and Training Samples\nIn the middle\
    \ of June 2017, a ﬁeld campaign was carried out for three days with a\nrandom\
    \ sampling approach. In total, ~1500 ground truth photos with spatial reference\
    \ and\nassociated crop or other land cover classes were collected. Another three\
    \ ﬁeld campaigns\nwere carried out again in June, July, and September in 2018.\
    \ A random block sampling\napproach was applied to these three ﬁeld campaigns.\

    accuracy (OA), Kappa, and F1 scores [43,44] were calculated based on the matrix.\
    \ Table 4\nshows a typical confusion matrix, in which i represents the ground\
    \ truth and j the classiﬁed\nresult. Nij is the number of pixels that are in class\
    \ i according to the ground truth but were\nclassiﬁed into class j in the resulting\
    \ image. J is the digital code of each crop type class.\nTable 4. A typical confusion\

    N1J\ni = 2\nN21\nN22\nN2J\n. . .\ni = J\nNJ1\nNJ2\nNJJ\nOA is computed as the\
    \ proportion of correctly classiﬁed pixels:\nOA =\n∑\nJ\ni = 1 Nii\n∑\nJ\ni =\
    \ j = 1 Nij\n.\n(1)\nThe Kappa coefﬁcient is computed as follows:\nKappa =\nM\
    \ ∑\nJ\ni = j = 1 Nij − ∑\nJ\ni = j = 1 NiNj\nM2 − ∑\nJ\ni = j = 1 NiNj\n,\n(2)\n\
    where M is the total number of validation samples. The Kappa coefﬁcient is well\
    \ suited\nto evaluate imbalanced validation samples. The value of Kappa is always\
    \ smaller than 1.\nKappa = 1 implies perfect agreement in the classiﬁcation. Normally,\
    \ a Kappa larger than\n0.8 shows a very good classiﬁcation result.\nRemote Sens.\

    \ the classiﬁed images. Computation of\nthe F1 score requires a computation of\
    \ the precision and recall for each class, given in the\nfollowing equations:\n\
    Precision =\nNii\n∑\nJ\nj = 1 Nij\n(3)\nRecall =\nNjj\n∑\nJ\ni = 1 Nij\n(4)\n\

    \ Algorithm and Validation\nRandom Forest (RF) was also used as a classiﬁer for\
    \ the second sub-project. The\nparameter setting as described in Section 2.1.4\
    \ was applied here as well. As in the ﬁrst\nsubproject, all possible combinations\
    \ of two spectral bands were used to compute the\nNDVI-like index. All NDVI-like\
    \ indices and spectral bands were used as input for the\nrandom forest classiﬁcation.\n\
    The same indices (described in Section 2.1.5), namely OA, Kappa, and F1 score,\
    \ were\nused to validate the medium-resolution classiﬁcation.\n3. Results and\
    \ Analysis\n3.1. Crop Mapping with High-Resolution Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-1\nAs\
    \ mentioned above, the highest accuracy is expected when all the spectral bands\
    \ of\nthe S-2 and GF-1 images and their derived indices are used in the classiﬁcation\
    \ as input\nfeatures. Figure 4 clearly conﬁrms this expectation. GF-1 WFV only\
    \ has four bands, blue,\ngreen, red, and near-infrared [4]. In ref. [45], only\
    \ the NDVI time series were used for\nclassiﬁcation. Previous studies [46,47]\
    \ showed that the normalized difference water index\n(NDWI) and brightness are\
    \ often added as the input features for classiﬁcation. In this study,\nwe compared\
    \ four cases for crop type classiﬁcation with the same suite of training samples\n\
    but different input features. As shown in Figure 4, for both years, classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracies\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4641\n9 of 17\nwere the lowest when only\
    \ NDVI images were used. The accuracy increases as the input\nfeatures increase.\
    \ The most accurate classiﬁcation was obtained using the four spectral\nbands\
    \ of GF-1 and all the derived NDVI-like indices. When using just the four bands\
    \ or\nthe four bands and 3 NDVI-like indices, the OA is slightly lower than with\
    \ all indices (less\nthan 1% difference).\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ features, and \nclassifier algorithms are three key factors that determine the\
    \ quality and accuracy of the \nclassified results. Thus, we made improvements\
    \ for our approach of crop type classifica-\ntion with GF-1 and S2 in this study\
    \ to quickly achieve peak accuracy. \nWe observed that some studies paid more\
    \ attention to the evaluation and comparison \nof various classifier algorithms\
    \ [48–50], while others paid more attention to the selection \nof [5,46,51], or\
    \ adding more [52,53], input features. In general, the RF did perform better \n\
    than other conventional classifiers, like Maximum Likelihood, Neural Network,\
    \ Support \nVector Machine, etc. [49]. The algorithms of various deep learning\
    \ methods also perform \nwell, but the computation time for tuning and implementing\
    \ is often unexpectedly long \nfor the crop type classification of large areas.\
    \ We followed the Sen2Agri system approach \nin our study and used the RF [54]\
    \ as the classifier in this project. We did not intensively \ntest other conventional\
    \ classifiers and deep learning algorithms since the RF worked well \nin our study\

    from the input satellite images, we found in our studies that the classification\
    \ of all NDVI-\nlike indices combined with the input bands gained higher accuracy\
    \ than those that used \nthe same spectral bands and only a few selected indices,\
    \ like NDVI, NDWI, and bright-\nness, that the Sen2Agri system used [1]. The studies\

    \ a few selected indices, like NDVI, NDWI, and brightness, that\nthe Sen2Agri\
    \ system used [1]. The studies [52,53] and the review on crop classiﬁcation [55]\n\
    also concluded that the use of vegetation indices improves classiﬁcation performance,\n\
    but there is no conclusion which indices have positive contributions on the classiﬁcation.\n\
    Therefore, we recommend using all proposed indices if the computation is allowed\
    \ since\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4641\n14 of 17\nRF is able to deal with high dimension\
    \ data arrays and neglect the duplications of input\ndata by the random selection\
    \ of input features.\nThe preparation of the training dataset is the most time-consuming\
    \ task in the process\nof classiﬁcation. A ﬁeld survey is often necessary for\
    \ crop type classiﬁcation, and the\nﬁeld data collection may help the experts\
    \ gain the experience of visually interpreting the\nsatellite images. The spatially\
    \ even distribution and statistical balance of the training\ndatasets for setting\
    \ up the model should be seriously taken into account. It is difﬁcult to\nachieve\
    \ the spatially even distribution for the ﬁeld samples due to access to ﬁelds\
    \ and time\nconsumption, but this can be improved at home in the process of visually\
    \ interpreting\ntraining samples on the images with a grid frame. For the majority\
    \ of crop types, training\nsamples may be identiﬁed as numerously as possible.\
    \ However, the minority crop types\nare difﬁcult to identify, and these classes\
    \ are poorly represented in the training dataset. This\nresults in a statistically\
    \ imbalanced dataset for the training sample. In some cases, we had\nbetter group\
    \ some classes to increase the representativeness. This kind of problem can be\n\
    found after we check the input images and the result from the ﬁrst-round classiﬁcation.\
    \ The\nimpact reduction with the imbalanced dataset for building the classiﬁcation\
    \ model is one\nof the main concerns in the ﬁeld of machine learning. The effects\
    \ of imbalanced training\nsamples for the classiﬁcation in this study were neglected\
    \ and should be investigated in\nfurther studies. There is still another question\
    \ without a clear answer, which is how many\ntraining samples are optimal for\
    \ the classiﬁcation. At this moment, what we can do is to\ncollect training samples\
    \ as numerously as possible.\nIn this study, the classiﬁcation was separately\
    \ conducted with each individual data\nsource. The accuracy of the resulting classiﬁcation\
    \ reﬂected individual performances of\ntargeted satellite data in the given growing\
    \ season. For optical satellite images, the cloud is\na major issue hampering\
    \ the application. This study did not investigate the data fusion or\nsimulation\
    \ to make two similar satellite data sources compatible, and the time series can\
    \ be\nincreased to have more cloud-free images for better classiﬁcation. In a\
    \ further study, the\njoint application of similar satellite data should be enhanced.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nProject 32194 under the Dragon 4 Program was successfully executed\
    \ with a focus on\ncrop type mapping, using high- and medium-resolution European\
    \ and Chinese satellite\ndata for YERID, Ningxia, northwest China. First, the\
    \ Sen2Agri system was conducted in\nthe study area so that the collection and\
    \ processing of S2 satellite data were fully beneﬁted\nfrom the system. The results\
    \ demonstrated the good performance of the Sen2Agri system\nin the fully irrigated\
    \ area of Ningxia. The medium-term report [27] revealed that nine types\nof crops\
    \ were classiﬁed, and the crop type map in 2017 was produced based on 35 S-2A/B\n\
    images. The OA of the crop type map was high, up to 88%. Second, a further study\
    \ was\nconducted with the increased input features of GF-1 WFV, S2, and other\
    \ third-party data\nafter the training dataset was well-tuned with expert knowledge\
    \ and the ground truth\nsamples. The results showed that crop type mapping with\
    \ any of these satellite data types\ncould achieve acceptable accuracy. The lowest\
    \ OA in the tests was 94%, high enough\nto be acceptable. The relatively lower\
    \ accuracy with the GF-1 WFV data was due to the\nlimited spectral bands. Third,\
    \ crop classiﬁcation with medium-resolution satellite data,\n100 m PROBA-V, and\
    \ 250 m FY-MERSI data was implemented. The preliminary results\ndemonstrated the\
    \ promising crop assessment capability using 100 PROBA-V or 250 m\nFY-3B MERSI\
    \ data as the medium-resolution satellite data produced crop type maps with\n\
    reasonable accuracy at a regional scale. Classiﬁcation with these data may produce\
    \ crop\ntype maps early in the season, as desired by many users. With a very high\
    \ revisit rate (twice\na day), the medium-resolution EO satellite can offer more\
    \ valid optical satellite images for\nvarious applications, including agricultural\
    \ monitoring.\nIn this study, Random Forest (RF) was used as the classiﬁer, but\
    \ the training datasets\nand input features were paid more attention and ﬁnally\
    \ improved after we gained the\nexperience from the Sen2Agri system. The results\
    \ proved again that the accuracy of crop\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4641\n15 of 17\n\
    type mapping increases with the number of input features used for the classiﬁcation.\
    \ The\nacceptable and peak accuracy of the crop type map was achieved after all\
    \ the special\nbands, and the potential associate indices (NDVI like) were jointly\
    \ used as input features\nfor the classiﬁcation. The spatially even distribution\
    \ and the statistical balance of the\nreference sample are of importance for building\
    \ a classiﬁer model. Classiﬁcations based on\nindividual images result in varying\
    \ accuracies due to the limited signatures for correctly\nidentifying the crop\
    \ types on each image. Satellite image time series, used together as the\ninput,\
    \ is the best option to produce a good classiﬁcation with high accuracy because\
    \ such\nuse would ensure that all available information for the whole growing\
    \ season is involved\nin the classiﬁcation for crop type mapping.\nFinally, crop\
    \ type mapping is not only useful for agricultural production management.\nThe\
    \ classiﬁed images or crop type maps may also be very useful for purposes such\
    \ as\nenvironmental studies and irrigation management. Results from coarse resolution\
    \ crop\ntype classiﬁcation may, for example, be helpful for the quick running\
    \ of a crop-speciﬁc yield\nmodel or pest diseases forecast. Irrigation management\
    \ is of great importance in Ningxia.\nInformation from the crop type mapping is\
    \ required to accurately compute the water\ndemand for irrigation in speciﬁc growing\
    \ stages of crops at a regional scale. The methods\ndeveloped in this study may\
    \ contribute to making better water management decisions so\nthat the water use\
    \ efﬁciency in the area can be signiﬁcantly improved. Moreover, precision\nagro-meteorological\
    \ services also require crop type maps at a regional scale to create better\n\
    agrometeorological forecasts for the various crop growing stages. In addition,\
    \ crop type\nmapping can also provide useful information for early warning of\
    \ potential agricultural\nor meteorological disasters occurring at a regional\
    \ scale. The combination of high- and\ncoarse-resolution satellite data for crop\
    \ type classiﬁcation would thereby be useful for\nthese research and operation\
    \ services. With this understanding and experience, we are\nable to apply the\
    \ required crop type mapping practices in various ways. Therefore, our\nunderstanding\
    \ and experience of crop type mapping with high- and medium-resolution\nsatellite\
    \ data have been widened and sharpened through the implementation of the Dragon\n\
    4 Program project.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.F., P.D. and Q.D.;\

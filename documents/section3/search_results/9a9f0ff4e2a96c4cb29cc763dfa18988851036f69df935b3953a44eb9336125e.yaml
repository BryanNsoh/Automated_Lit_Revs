    Keywords Metrics Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and
    their adoption in new generation intelligent systems has generated a huge demand
    for wireless bandwidth. This bandwidth problem is further exacerbated by another
    characteristics of IoT applications, i.e., IoT devices are usually deployed in
    massive number, thus leading to an awkward scenario that many bandwidth-hungry
    devices are chasing after the very limited wireless bandwidth within a small geographic
    area. As such, cognitive radio has received much attention of the research community
    as an important means for addressing the bandwidth needs of IoT applications.
    When enabling IoT devices with cognitive functionalities including spectrum sensing,
    dynamic spectrum accessing, circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning, one
    will also need to fully study other critical issues such as standardization, privacy
    protection, and heterogeneous coexistence. In this article, we investigate the
    structural frameworks and potential applications of cognitive IoT. We further
    discuss the spectrum-based functionalities and heterogeneity for cognitive IoT.
    Security and privacy issues involved in cognitive IoT are also investigated. Finally,
    we present the key challenges and future direction of research on cognitive-radio-based
    IoT networks. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics ( Volume:

    SECTION I. Introduction The pervasive adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is
    made possible due to the rapid development of enabling technologies such as consumer
    electronics, cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless communications.
    In recent years, research advancement in cognitive radio network [1] also allowed
    the massive deployment of bandwidth-hungry IoT devices in remote and isolated
    areas. The world has witnessed an explosive growth in adoption of IoT in various
    sectors such as smart cities, smart manufacturing, and many other kinds of cyber-physical
    systems [2]. Such IoT applications typically involve a massive number of IoT devices
    being deployed in field environment, which access some cloud platforms for big
    data analytics or intelligent decision making via a variety of wired and wireless
    networks. The most commonly used IoT devices include video cameras, environment
    sensors, motion sensors, and actuators for mechanical control in the physical
    environment. At the same time, the varieties and capabilities of IoT devices have
    also increased dramatically in recent years. Nowadays, it is very common to see
    high capacity IoT devices which capture high-precision data (or high resolution
    images) in very frequent intervals and upload the data to some cloud computing
    platform via wireless communication networks. In this regard, the evolution of
    IoT devices has generated huge demand for wireless bandwidth in order to meet
    the operational needs of new generation IoT applications. Hence, future IoT networks
    are required to support massive node access and big data transmission, which calls
    for more available communication bandwidth. This bandwidth problem is further
    exacerbated by another characteristics of IoT applications, that is IoT devices
    are usually deployed in massive number, thus leading to an awkward situation that
    many bandwidth-hungry devices are chasing after the very limited wireless bandwidth
    within a small geographic area. At present, IoT can only use very limited authorized
    spectrum, which is likely to be occupied by WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee devices.
    Thus, the constraint of spectrum resource has become a significant bottleneck
    for IoT deployment. By enabling IoT devices with cognitive radio technology, IoT
    devices will be capable of sharing licensed spectrum resource of 4G and 5G, hence
    substantially expands the IoT’s transmission capacity. As such, cognitive radio
    has received much attention of the research community as an important means for
    addressing the bandwidth needs of IoT applications. Specifically, sensing and
    dynamic access of spectrum holes have received much research attention. When enabling
    IoT devices with cognitive functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic
    spectrum accessing, circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning, one will also
    need to fully study other critical issues such as standardization, privacy protection,
    and heterogeneous coexistence. In [3], the authors investigated the use of distributed
    compressive sensing method to realize broadband spectrum sharing in cognitive-radio-based
    IoT. In [4], the authors proposed multibands cooperative spectrum sensing which
    efficiently improves the access probability of IoT. Ejaz and Ibnkahla [5] utilized
    genetic-algorithm-based dynamical spectrum allocation solution to increase the
    capacity of IoT. Han et al. [6] adopted interference technology to combat the
    interference caused by IoT users to primary users. Liang et al. [7] investigated
    the coallocation of time slot and transmit power. Besides, [8] presented an optimization
    method for spectrum sensing in cognitive IoT. In addition, other critical issues
    such as the structural framework for designing IoT application, network topology,
    and applications of cognitive IoT also need to be addressed. In [9], the authors
    discussed the need for cognitive-radio-based IoT and analyzed the desired cognitive
    radio functionalities of IoT, especially spectrum sensing and optimization. Khan
    et al. [10] investigated approaches for enhancing IoT by cognition functionality,
    and proposed an operational framework for cognitive-radio-based IoT systems. Wu
    et al. [11] investigated some applications of cognitive radio networks for IoT,
    and practical solutions for addressing some of the challenges of cognitive IoT.
    Shah et al. [12] discussed how to devise and model the cognitive process in cognitive
    IoT, where cognitive functionalities are designed to autonomously improve IoT
    network performance. Zhang et al. [13] studied the structural framework for designing
    cognitive IoT, which featured minimally a perception layer, a network layer as
    well as an application layer. Shigueta et al. [14] proposed an IoT-based cognitive
    traffic management system. At present, research on cognitive IoT mainly focuses
    on spectrum sensing, transmission resource allocation, and interference mitigation,
    etc [15]. Yet, these research topics are being addressed in a relatively independent
    manner and there is a lack of a optimized approach to address sensing, transmission
    and interference at the same time [16]. Besides, with the rapid development of
    cognitive capability of IoT devices, there is an urging need to study mechanisms
    that integrate artificial intelligence, signal processing, and other cutting edge
    features such as caching networks and flog computing into cognitive IoT. In this
    article, we present the rationale and recent development of cognitive radio technology
    in IoT. We focus on how cognitive-radio-based functionalities, especially spectrum-related
    functionalities, will be helpful for IoT. We also discuss standardization efforts,
    practical applications, security, and cognitive capability of mobile terminals
    in IoT networks. We also consider the extension of traditional cognitive ability
    of spectrum sensing to more sophisticated features such as cognition of scenario
    and environment in IoT networks. Thus motivating further interests in social and
    cognitive mobility modeling, routing protocol, energy allocation, mobile computing,
    cognitive computing, etc. in the IoT environment especially with stochastic layout
    shapes. Therefore, the fusion of cognitive IoT and other new technologies is also
    presented in this article. The rest of this article is organized as follows. In
    Section II, we first discuss the motivation of using cognitive radio in IoT. Then,
    basic framework, standardization efforts, and new applications for cognitive IoT
    are presented in Section III. We investigate techniques for spectrum-related functionalities
    in cognitive IoT in Section III. In Section IV, we present the issues of information
    fusion of cognitive IoT and other emerging technologies. Section V concludes this
    article. SECTION II. Cognitive IoT Architecture and Application International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU) documented a four-stage program for future IoT development
    [2], as shown in Fig. 1. Based on further in-depth research in this field, the
    desired functionalities and service characteristics of IoT have become clearer,
    and suggested that future IoT is expected to own key capabilities in service sensing,
    data sensing, environment sensing, and even intelligent cognition ability in order
    to realize the vision of real smart IoT; thus, raising the target achievement
    of IoT from “Perception” to “Cognition” i.e. cognitive IoT. Fig. 1. IoT development
    trend. Show All A. Cognitive Capabilities Current research on cognitive IoT’s
    framework mainly concentrates on user’s demand on IoT services with autonomous
    and intelligent characteristics by introducing cognitive elements. a three-layer
    cognitive cycle structure is integrated with information sharing mechanism and
    heterogeneous circumstantial sensing interaction to constitute the structure of
    autonomously cognitive IoT [17]. This article offers a basic framework and data
    provision for cognitive decision and optimal learning mechanism in IoT. As shown
    in Fig. 2, we give the architecture framework of cognitive IoT which is based
    on traditional IoT architecture. Wherein, four layers consisting of information
    sensing, network interconnecting, cognitive decision-making, and intelligent service
    define the cognitive IoT. Fig. 2. Architecture framework of cognitive IoT. Show
    All From the perspective of functionality, cognitive IoT can be divided into object
    demand description layer, cognitive decision-making layer, ubiquitous access layer,
    and physical networks layer. The definitions of the four layers do not directly
    correspond to the layers of traditional network protocol. The framework presented
    in Fig. 2 should provide QoS guarantee for D2D users’ various demands. The main
    functionality involved in this framework is to sense QoS requirement and network
    performance objective for users from various cells. Then, properly model the network
    behavior and make corresponding decision according to cognition, feedback, and
    network status in self-learning. At the end, finally identifying the required
    behavior of cognitive IoT in future, while adjusting and allocating network resources
    of physical networks so as to meet user’s real-time demand. In cognitive IoT,
    it is essential to adopt the approach of a cognitive dynamic system as shown in
    Fig. 3, which is a goal-driven autonomous system with a cognitive controller as
    the core to sense and predict external environment. The cognitive dynamic system
    is mainly structured by probabilistic computing, perception, and cognitive controller
    blocks, wherein interaction is performed in a closed loop, noted by perception-action
    cycle. In Fig. 3, the short interval or long interval is the time buffer preserved
    by the system in order to handle time delay caused by cognitive processing. Fig.
    3. Conceptual blocks of cognitive dynamic system and their interaction, adopted
    in [18]. Show All In addition, in the cognitive decision layer, the functionality
    of cognitive decision is one of the key factors that contribute to the intelligence
    of cognitive IoT. It is mainly based on the structure of the three-layer cognitive
    cycle [19]. The structure can be shown in Fig. 4. Through exploring internal framework
    structure, operation mechanism, and cooperative relationship within the IoT, the
    structure aims to achieve massive heterogeneous sensing information with regard
    to network performance objective. It should be noted that the objective needs
    to be unfolded from the perspectives of detecting network environment and sensing
    surrounding information. Meanwhile, use the interconnection mechanism of various
    networks to release and share the sensing information. And, adopt data fusion
    method to perform information analyzing and integrating. The intelligent cognitive
    decision-making is completed on the basis of information fusion and decision knowledge
    base optimum improved by machine learning theory. At last, proper network adjustment
    will be carried out. Three-layers cognitive cycle structure provides strong theoretical
    support for the internal framework, relationship, and cooperative mechanism of
    cognitive IoT. Fig. 4. Three-layers cognitive cycle structure of cognitive IoT.
    Show All B. Applications and Standardization Efforts for Cognitive IoT With the
    capabilities of performing dynamic sensing and cognition of surrounding environment,
    many potential applications and services can benefit from cognitive radio technology.
    In health care domain, cognitive IoT can assist in a smoother real-time monitoring
    in long ranges without any worry of spectrum availability [13]. In social activity
    domain, cognitive IoT has drawn attention recently as cognitive IoT objects for
    commercial purposes can improve smart traffic management. For environment related
    applications, with cognitive radio technology, IoT can be a real potential solution
    for dealing with congested or spectrum scarce network areas [20]. For smart home
    applications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can handle potential heterogeneous
    network interference [21]. In smart grid domain, cognitive IoT can realize the
    goal of enabling consumers to know their energy consumption at any time and any
    place [22]. In smart cities, user data gathering and interaction are critical
    which can be supported by cognitive-radio-based IoT [23]. Besides, for Internet
    of Vehicles (IoV), a significant challenge is the availability of spectrum for
    mobile vehicles wherein cognitive radio networks will play a key role to solve
    the issue [24]. Enormous efforts have been conducted by academia and the industry
    to bring IoT and cognitive radio into real commercial deployment. Numbers of technical
    committees, working groups as well as standardization organizations are working
    to enhance or expand the applications of IoT and cognitive radio. For IoT standardization,
    communication protocols, interference control and data storage services are normalized
    by EPC Global and ITU SG 13, SG 16 technical committee. Information security,
    personal data privacy, and other data protection issues are concerned by STF 396
    and CEN TC 225 working group. The standardization of Spectrum usage and RFID domain
    are performed by ISO and ECMA committees. Besides, IEEE, 3GPP, IP for smart objects
    (IPSO), near field communication forum (NFC), and European Telecommunications
    Standards Institute (ETSI), etc., committees all participated in the related work.
    Cognitive radio is regarded as a promising solution to solve the problem of scarce
    spectrum in the era of blooming wireless applications. Almost every kind of wireless
    application or networks can benefit from cognitive radio to refine its spectrum
    availability and many international organizations or groups have involved in its
    standardization. Specifically, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering
    dynamic spectrum access over unlicensed very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high
    frequency (UHF) TV bands in the US. IEEE 802.11af technical committee is working
    on the modifications of physical and MAC layer during dynamic channel access and
    coexistence. 3GPP is considering the combination of new licensed bands consisting
    of higher frequencies and currently unlicensed bands. The spectrum operation of
    MAC and PHY layers in TVWS band is investigated by ECMA 392. Besides, IEEE institute
    is working on the standardization of dynamic spectrum access networks. ITU, ETSI,
    and ANDSF working groups are also paying efforts on the standardization of cognitive
    radio. At present, cognitive-radio-based IoT framework is still underinvestigated
    and related summary of research works need to be forwarded. It is worthy of consideration
    that the long-range IoT applications can benefit from cognitive radio by introducing
    dynamic spectrum access to meet the spectrum demands of massive IoT devices. In
    addition, short-range or urban IoT applications can better their integration in
    the environment of heterogeneous spectrum by adopting cognitive radio. SECTION
    III. Spectrum-Related Functionalities Spectrum sensing is a fundamental and critical
    functionality for cognitive IoT. IoT objects equipped with cognitive radio module
    should sense spectrum hole in dynamic spectrum environment and detect the presence
    of authorized user. As the cognitive IoT users frequently work in distributed
    networks and heterogeneous spectrum scenario, joint sensing strategy appears significant
    to guarantee sensing accuracy. Besides, compared with other functionalities, the
    time and energy consumed by spectrum sensing block need to be concerned. Thus,
    in the energy-limited IoT objects, fast and efficient sensing solution is called
    for. Many promising spectrum sensing methods including alliance-based sensing,
    clustering-based sensing, and self-learning-based sensing have been investigated
    in cognitive IoT. Dynamic spectrum access is a key point in the process of spectrum
    sharing and optimization for cognitive IoT. Dynamic spectrum access allows IoT
    users to opportunistically access and utilize idle channels authorized to other
    primary users. In a distributed IoT network environment with imperfect sensing
    capability, techniques to decrease access collision and improve spectrum efficiency
    deserve full investigation. In fact, many critical cognitive functionalities including
    spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access, etc., make use of deep learning methods
    to increase sensing or access probabilities. When IoT terminals dynamically access
    the idle spectrum especially in distributed mode, they should often record and
    judge the channel status. Deep learning methods can assist them to better identify
    the optimal channel to access. To combat the limited sensing capability, enforced
    self-learning method has been adopted to smooth the dynamic spectrum access [25].
    From the perspective of whole networks, fully using spectrum reuse to enhance
    spectrum efficiency has drawn extensive attention [26]. Number of mathematical
    tools including graph theory, game theory, and intelligent optimization algorithm
    have been utilized to optimize dynamic spectrum access and allocation [27]. In
    addition, due to the mobility of IoT terminals and the coexistence of various
    kinds of networks, heterogenous spectrum environment as shown in Fig. 5, is a
    main characteristic for the dynamic spectrum access in IoT. In the other specific
    IoT application circumstance, such as IoV as shown in Fig. 6, the strong characteristics
    of IoT terminals’ movement will lead to a very complex spectrum circumstance to
    be addressed. It can be envisioned that traditional methods should be refined
    to better fit in the IoT scenario. Fig. 5. Heterogeneous spectrum environment.
    Show All Fig. 6. Architecture of IoV. Show All Besides, substantial research efforts
    have been spent in enhancing the efficiency of dynamic spectrum access for IoT
    devices. As dynamic spectrum access consists of several significant processes
    including spectrum sharing, spectrum allocation, power control along with spectrum
    switch, many techniques and mathematical tools are adopted to improve its efficiency.
    Due to space constraints, this article will not give full account of the efficiency
    enhancement of dynamic spectrum access. SECTION IV. Information Security and Fusion
    To meet the stringent requirements of anytime, anywhere wireless services, the
    fusion of IoT, Internet, communication networks, satellite networks, etc., becomes
    essential [28]. When the other wireless networks encounter massive IoT terminals’
    access, enhanced capabilities including information processing, security, and
    privacy-preserving are called for wherein cognitive functionalities will be critical
    to smooth the information fusion and guarantee the transmission capacity for IoT
    nodes. A. Information Security and Data Privacy Cognitive IoT devices can sense
    spectrum “holes” and dynamically access the holes to transmit information. During
    the course, sensing spectrum may become a detecting or monitoring behavior for
    other users in local networks. Then, when cognitive IoT devices complete the spectrum
    accessing, it may be considered as an “intruder” and a potential safety flaw for
    authorized wireless networks. On the other side, for the overlay spectrum accessing
    mode in which the cognitive IoT users are authorized to use the idle spectrum
    temporarily, spectrum trading is always performed to efficiently share the band
    and improve the usage. To realize efficient spectrum trading, proper information
    sharing and a cognitive agent are essential. Frequent information exchanging and
    sharing may result in the potential issue in privacy preserving. It is envisioned
    that a full discussion and practical protocol on information security in cognitive-radio-based
    IoT should be conducted so as to constraint the unordered behaviors of cognitive
    IoT users and secure authorized users’ security. In the perspective of privacy-preserving,
    personal privacy is likely to be leaked by the behavior of embedded tagging. The
    data tracking with radio frequency identification will lead to the damage of user
    privacy as well. Also, the information in the progress of sharing and broadcasting
    easily incurs attacking and leaking. Meanwhile, traditional wireless channels
    cannot meet the user requirement of privacy protection and the stream data in
    IoT could be totally stolen if the invasion succeeds. In this condition, it is
    necessary to build a mechanism in IoT to secure a powerful privacy protection
    of IoT data. In cognitive-radio-equipped IoT, cognitive engine can automatically
    detect related system information and network behaviors, then perform self-learning
    process to adapt to the environment and identify malicious attack and invasion.
    It can be envisioned that blockchain technique, trust computation mechanism, enforced
    self-learning, and big-data-mining, will be adopted to upgrade privacy protection
    level. B. Fusion of Heterogeneous Networks When IoT coexists with other wireless
    networks, it requires cognitive capability to sense surrounding spectrum circumstance,
    detect other networks’ conditions. The more elements an IoT user can perceive,
    the more suitable choice it can make. Current cognitive functionalities mainly
    focus on the spectrum sensing and forced self-learning, thus more extensive cognitive
    capabilities are needed to adapt to future complex heterogeneous networks. Many
    specific research works have been conducted to investigate the fusion of cognitive
    IoT and other wireless networks. In [28], the authors raised a novel parallel
    cooperative spectrum sensing solution in heterogeneous IoT environment in which
    the cognitive users’ sensing abilities are always affected by heterogeneous channel
    condition. In [29], the authors proposed a method to enhance the spectrum efficiency
    based on the nonorthogonal multiple access technique for heterogeneous IoT. The
    imperfect interference cancelation and heterogeneous secondary users are mainly
    considered in this article. In [30], a spatial and temporal idle spectrum sensing
    framework was proposed for heterogeneous spectrum IoT. In [31], the authors devised
    an asymmetric asynchronous spectrum selecting mechanism in heterogeneous IoT where
    various cognitive users have different available channels to choose. When cognitive
    radio technology is applied in various IoT environments, it should support different
    kinds of sensing, sharing, or access methods. In ad hoc networks, the fast sensing
    or spectrum switching approaches need to be addressed. In traditional wireless
    sensor networks, distributed spectrum access solutions without any broadcasting
    information should be raised. In IoV, it can be envisioned that the efficient
    spectrum optimization method on the basis of mobility prediction will need to
    be addressed. C. Information Fusion and Mobile Cognition The cognitive and learning
    feature of cognitive IoT endow it some significant capabilities that traditional
    networks do not have. Cognitive IoT can merge various heterogeneous networks,
    shield details of underlaying networks, and provide multiservice transparent transmission
    to users. On the other hand, in current network circumstance, it lacks reliable
    and effective information interaction among various terminals or networks. Inefficient
    communication and cooperation within different nodes will inevitably lead to the
    waste resource or irrational resource allocation in the whole networks, meanwhile
    decreasing network efficiency. The cognitive process not only senses surrounding
    network conditions but also detects other networks’ information, which can change
    the previous selfish and uncooperative behaviors caused by isolated status of
    traditional nodes. Through extensively recognizing the whole networks’ environment
    and elements and building corresponding cooperative relationship, the wireless
    resource between nodes can be shared in an effective way. IoT can be considered
    as an extension of pervasive computing, cyber-physical-systems, and machine-to-machine
    communications from a macro perspective. With constant improvement of perception
    devices in IoT, the ability and approach of achieving sensor nodes’ information
    can be obviously improved by using smart devices such as mobile phone and personal
    digital assistant, etc. The social-relation-based cognitive model and human-oriented
    mobile perception have been investigated and applied to strengthen the basis of
    mobile sensing services in IoT. Many researches have been conducted to reason
    and evaluate the complexity and uncertainty of social relation from various angles
    so as to summarize the social characteristics of mobile nodes [19]. The human-oriented
    mobile perception services can enhance the range of perception and reduce perception
    hole by introducing social computing or mobile computing theory and analyzing
    perception data. Rea et al. devised an embedded action-identified system on the
    basis of mobile perception mechanism, so as to further promote the applications
    of mobile perception in smart circumstance, monitoring, crisis response, and military
    field [32]. In addition, the combination of cognitive radio and other cutting
    edges such as intelligent artificial and Blockchain has drawn growing attention
    from industria to academia [33]–[36]. Even the IoT has been involved into our
    real life from smart city to environment monitoring, the IoT without artificial
    intelligence and cognitive functionality will have limited capability. To achieve
    the actual and full benefits of IoT, it should be intelligent and automatic in
    various environments. Furthermore, in distributed IoT, the promising technology
    of Blockchain can take effect in terms of information security and decentralized
    computing. SECTION V. Research Challenges and Open Issues The full utilization
    of cognitive radio technology in IoT still calls for extensive research and development
    in hardware design, standardization, spectrum optimization, privacy protection,
    and heterogeneous network fusion, etc. This section will summarize the potential
    research challenges and open issues involved in cognitive IoT. A. Standardization
    Challenges Standardization is a key step for the constant and extensive development
    of cognitive IoT networks while providing integral foundation for security-preserving,
    application extension, dynamic spectrum access, and fusion of heterogeneous networks.
    Currently, many standardization efforts have been paid by academia and industria
    in the direction of IoT and cognitive radio, respectively. How to integrate the
    related works from technical committees and working groups together efficiently
    to promote cognitive IoT deserves full intention. On the other hand, a more practical
    way to accelerate the standardization of cognitive IoT is to enrich or refine
    current IoT structure and protocol to enable and standardize the functionality
    of dynamic spectrum access for IoT nodes. B. Spectrum Efficiency Enhancing spectrum
    efficiency is the original intention of introducing cognitive radio to IoT which
    means spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access will be adopted to realize
    the dynamic utilization of idle spectrum. However, in the circumstance of distributed
    IoT networks, how to perform effective spectrum sharing without high overhead
    and energy consumption still needs more investigations. Besides, when the IoT
    is combined with other promising network technologies or modes such as caching
    networks, fog computing, satellite networks, how to refine current techniques
    of dynamic spectrum sharing for IoT to adaptively fit in the new circumstances
    lacks full studies until now. C. Security and Privacy The network heterogeneity
    accompanied by dynamic spectrum access for IoT nodes incurs security problem wherein
    we cannot apply traditional security mode to address the issue. Especially with
    the wider application fields of IoT, when the IoT nodes are equipped with cognitive
    functionalities to sense “spectrum hole” and detect network elements, new security,
    and privacy problems will emerge. More interactions within IoT networks will be
    performed to fully understand the circumstance. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this
    article, we presented the need for IoT to be equipped with cognitive radio functionality.
    Cognitive IoT is a new and promising paradigm to benefit IoT networks in enhancing
    spectrum efficiency and empowering more heterogeneous and intelligent networks.
    This article focuses on the investigation and discussion of applications, standardization,
    spectrum-related functions as well as security-oriented issues of cognitive IoT.
    We also summarized the spectrum-function-related cognitive technology in IoT,
    including intelligent spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access as well as efficient
    spectrum sharing. Besides, the fusion of cognitive radio with other cutting edge
    techniques such as caching networks, flog computing, and social networks are also
    discussed. Finally, this article challenges and potential applications for cognitive
    IoT were analyzed further. Currently, research on cognitive IoT should put more
    emphasis on designing structure framework and standard protocol to realize the
    vision of large-scale IoT applications in important domains such as smart cities,
    smart manufacturing, and cyber-physical systems. Authors Figures References Citations

    \ Spectrum Sensing (SS) plays an essential role in Cognitive Radio (CR) networks\
    \ to diagnose\nthe availability of frequency resources. In this paper, we aim\
    \ to provide an in-depth survey on\nthe most recent advances in SS for CR. We\
    \ start by explaining the Half-Duplex and Full-Duplex\nparadigms, while focusing\
    \ on the operating modes in the Full-Duplex. A thorough discussion of\nFull-Duplex\
    \ operation modes from collision and throughput points of view is presented. Then,\

    \ both local and\ncooperative sensing scenarios. In addition, recent SS applications\
    \ for CR-based Internet of Things\nand Wireless Sensors Networks are presented.\
    \ Furthermore, we survey the latest achievements in\nSpectrum Sensing as a Service,\
    \ where the Internet of Things or the Wireless Sensor Networks may\nplay an essential\
    \ role in providing the CR network with the SS data. We also discuss the utilisation\n\
    of CR for the 5th Generation and Beyond and its possible role in frequency allocation.\
    \ With the\nadvancement of telecommunication technologies, additional features\

    Two decades ago, Mitola introduced a new concept in wireless telecommunication:\n\
    the Cognitive Radio (CR) [1]. CR is mainly based on Soft Deﬁned Radio (SDR) [2],\
    \ where\nspeciﬁc hardware can be replaced by more generic hardware that can be\
    \ conﬁgured via\nsoftware. In addition to being softly conﬁgurable, CR is aware\
    \ and adaptable to the radio\nenvironment, which can be exploited in optimizing\
    \ the use of available frequency bands\nwhile protecting the occupied ones from\
    \ harmful interference.\nMost of the current wireless communication systems are\
    \ based on the concept of ﬁxed\n(or static) frequency allocation. They are designed\
    \ to operate on pre-selected frequency\nbands. This static allocation results\
    \ in a low spectrum utilization especially at low trafﬁc\nperiods. Based on [3],\
    \ the usage of some allocated frequency bands is lower than 15%. In\naddition,\
    \ the development towards 5G and Beyond (B5G) technologies, the exponential\n\
    growth in the number of connected objects via the Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless\
    \ Sensor\nNetwork (WSN) devices and recent wireless applications push the wireless\
    \ communication\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21072408\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 2408\n2 of 29\ncommunity to enhance the utilization of the limited\
    \ frequency resources to satisfy the\nincreasing demand on the wireless communication\
    \ services [4,5].\nCR has been introduced as a potential candidate to perform\
    \ complete Dynamic Spec-\ntrum Allocation (DSA) by exploiting the free frequency\
    \ bands that are aslo called “spectrum\nholes” or “white spaces” [6–8]. Being\
    \ capable to identify these spectral opportunities, CR\nclassiﬁes the users into\
    \ two categories: licensed, i.e., the Primary Users (PUs), and unli-\ncensed,\
    \ i.e., the Secondary Users (SUs). While PUs can access the spectrum whenever\
    \ they\nwant, SUs are restricted by the activities of PUs. In other words, SUs\
    \ should respect the\nPUs’ Quality of Service and harmful interference coming\
    \ from SUs to PUs transmission\nis prohibited. Therefore, three paradigms of CR\
    \ can be distinguished according to the\npossibility of co-existence of SU and\
    \ PU transmissions in the same channel, the permitted\ntransmit power of SU and\
    \ the cooperation between SU and PU. As shown in Figure 1, three\nmain paradigms\
    \ of CR can be distinguished:\n1.\nUnderlay Access: the SU may transmit simultaneously\
    \ with the PU over the same\nchannel. However, the transmitted power should not\
    \ exceed a certain threshold in\norder to keep the interference on PU below a\
    \ tolerable value [4,9].\n2.\nOverlay Access: the SU may transmit simultaneously\
    \ with the PU on the same channel\nup to its maximum power, but at the cost of\
    \ playing a role of relay between two or\nmore PUs [10,11]. In this case, the\
    \ SU sends its data while relaying the PUs. This kind\nof access requires high\
    \ level of cooperation between PUs and SUs, which may expose\nthe PUs privacy.\n\
    3.\nInterweave Access: SU is allowed to transmit using its maximum power only\
    \ when\nPU is absent. This paradigm is also known as the classical CR and it is\
    \ the focus of\nthis paper given its popularity.\nCognitive Radio\nUnderlay \n\

    Figure 1. Cognitive Radio (CR) access paradigms.\nThe main drawback of the underlay\
    \ paradigm is the low transmitted power, which\nadversely impacts the throughput.\
    \ The use of the overlay paradigm is limited to scenarios\nwhere PU and SU have\
    \ a high level of cooperation. Interweave paradigm allows SUs to\ntransmit with\
    \ their maximum power, but at the cost of monitoring the activity of PU.\nIn classical\
    \ interweave systems, the SU activity period is divided into two time slots:\n\
    sensing and transmission. This leads to the so-called Half-Duplex Cognitive Radio\
    \ (HDCR).\nHDCR applies the Listen-before-Talk (LBT) protocol by adopting an alternating\
    \ sensing-\ntransmission fashion. During the sensing slot, the SU only senses\
    \ the channel to detect the\npresence or absence of the PU, and it cannot transmit.\
    \ SU should remain silent if it detects\na transmission from the PU. Otherwise,\
    \ the SU resumes sending its data. Note that the\nsilence of the SU during the\
    \ sensing slot affects its transmission rate. Moreover, periodic\nsensing may\
    \ lead to collisions between the SU and PU as the PU may become active again\n\
    during the SU transmission after being silent during the SU sensing slot.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 2408\n3 of 29\nIn-Band Full-Duplex (IBFD) communication has recently\
    \ been proposed in order to\nincrease the spectrum efﬁciency [12]. Two peers can\
    \ use the same frequency channel to\ntransmit and receive simultaneously. IBFD\
    \ is based on the Self-Interference Cancellation\n(SIC), where the Self-Interference\
    \ (SI) is canceled in order to obtain the signal of interest.\nThe application\
    \ of SIC has been extended to CR providing it with the ability to sense and\n\
    transmit at the same time leading to the so-called Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio\
    \ (FDCR).\nBased on the SIC capability and the ﬂexibility of FDCR, several access\
    \ schemes have\nbeen proposed and various challenges have been treated such as\
    \ the SIC-based modes to\nbe adopted, hybrid mode between HDCR and FDCR and the\
    \ effects of the residual SI on\nthe sensing process since SIC is imperfect.\n\
    As a powerful tool, machine learning techniques are exploited in the domain of\
    \ CR\nto improve the SS performance [13–15]. SS may be formulated as a binary\
    \ classiﬁcation\nproblem related to the presence of PU. Unlike classical SS, the\
    \ learning techniques may\novercome the need to know statistical parameters of\
    \ the channel or the PU signal. More-\nover, these techniques are proposed to\
    \ predict the PU activity, which can enhance the\nspectral efﬁciency of the secondary\
    \ network and protect the primary transmission from the\nsecondary interference.\n\
    The usage of CR is extended to the domains of IoT and WSN [16,17]. This was motivated\n\
    by the huge number of new IoT/WSN devices that require additional frequency resources.\n\
    Although using CR for WSN and IoT seems promising, more investigation is needed\
    \ at\nseveral levels such as the design of the exchange protocols and access management.\n\
    CR for ﬁfth Generation (5G) is expected to play an important role to answer the\
    \ need\nof the increasing number of data hungry devices [18]. Knowing that 5G\
    \ will extend the\nspectrum band to the millimeter-wave range, CR can be used\
    \ to improve the spectrum\nutilization while providing better protection to co-existing\
    \ users. Moreover, CR can be\nused to address interference issues from space,\
    \ frequency and time domain. This is\nimportant knowing that 5G is expected to\
    \ exploit spatial reuse of the spectrum as one of\nthe main features of 5G systems.\
    \ Yet, introducing CR in 5G imposes several challenges that\nneed addressing.\n\
    CR is proposed to be used in various wireless communication technologies, since\n\
    it proves itself as one of the efﬁcient techniques to ensure fair and ﬂexible\
    \ frequency\nallocation [18,19]. CR beneﬁts from the emergence and development\
    \ of learning techniques\napplied to wireless communication [20,21]. Accordingly,\
    \ SS should be ceaselessly improved\nto keep up with the recent technological\
    \ advancements. In this context, several challenges\nare raised such as the need\
    \ for huge frequency resources, sensing of the spatial availability,\nintelligent\
    \ sensing of the spectrum and energy-efﬁcient protocol design.\nIn the literature,\
    \ several papers survey the usage of SS for CR. In [22], the authors\npresented\
    \ many aspects of spectrum sensing from a cognitive radio perspective. However,\n\
    this paper is published more than 12 years ago and did not address the recent\
    \ applications\nand paradigms. [23] surveys FDCR technique by focusing on the\
    \ concurrent transmit–\nsense mode while other techniques, such as transmit–receive,\
    \ were not covered. Ref. [24]\ndetails the challenges of applying CR in IoT networks\
    \ by focusing on the issues related to\nSS. [25] surveys the techniques of SS\
    \ with a focus on wideband and compressive sensing.\nIn [26], the authors survey\
    \ the recent techniques of SS by highlighting the mathematical\nmodels deriving\
    \ the SS metrics (detection and false alarm probabilities). However, recent\n\
    paradigms, such as Full-Duplex, and recent applications, such as the Internet\
    \ of Things,\nare not addressed. The work in [27] is limited to technical issues\
    \ related to the application\nof CR in IoT. Finally, the authors of [18] investigate\
    \ the use of CR for 5G communication\nwithout further explanation of recent development\
    \ in SS.\nThis paper aims at providing comprehensive surveying and analysis of\
    \ the recent\nresearch advancements and emerging applications in the ﬁeld of SS\
    \ for CR. For numerical\nevaluation of SS techniques, the readers are encouraged\
    \ to refer to [22,26]. We explain the\nfundamental concepts of SS and summarize\
    \ the state of the art in the context of SS for CR.\nMoreover, we discuss the\
    \ use of machine learning to enhance SS and the applications of\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 2408\n4 of 29\nCR in IoT/WSN from SS perspective. SS for 5G-based application\
    \ is also discussed in this\nmanuscript. Finally, we propose possible perspectives\
    \ to develop this promising domain.\nThe main contributions of the paper may be\
    \ summarized as follows:\n•\nA state of the art on the classical SS techniques\
    \ is provided\n•\nThe operating modes of CR derived from involving the FD tool\
    \ in CR are detailed and\ninvestigated\n•\nThe role of Machine and Deep Learning\

    \ application of CR, especially SS, in the 5G and the upcoming technologies\n\
    is discussed\n•\nNew trends and challenges related to the future wireless communication\
    \ technologies\nare also discussed and investigated.\nThe rest of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Table 1 presents the list of abbreviations\nused in this\
    \ survey. In Section 2, HDCR is presented by explaining classical SS using the\n\
    traditional detection methods. The silence period of HDCR is also discussed in\
    \ detail at both\nlevels of SU throughput and collision to PU. FDCR is described\
    \ and the related operating\nmodes, as well as the sensing process, are discussed\
    \ in Section 3. In this section, we present\nthe main techniques behind the FDCR.\
    \ Then, we present the popular derived modes using\nSIC, Transmit-Sense and Transmit-Receive\
    \ with thorough analysis and investigation. The\napplication of learning techniques\
    \ for SS is explained in Section 4. Section 5 surveys the\nlatest achievements\
    \ of the CR applications in IoT/WSN networks. The role of IoT/WSN in\napplying\

    \ Before Talk\nListen-Before-Talk (LBT) protocol consists of applying the SS periodically\
    \ [22,28]. The\nactivity period of each SU in LBT is divided into two slots: sensing\
    \ and transmission.\nDuring the sensing slot, SU silently performs the SS to avoid\
    \ affecting its decision reliability.\nLBT refers to the so-called Half-Duplex\
    \ Cognitive Radio (HDCR) due to this silent period\nof transmission. If the PU\
    \ is absent, SU switches to the transmission slot and transmits\nits data without\
    \ being aware of the PU activity. The received signal under HDCR can be\npresented\
    \ as follows [22,29,30]:\ny(n) = ηx(n) + w(n),\n(1)\nwhere y(n) is the received\
    \ signal, η is the channel indicator, i.e., η = 0 if PU is absent and\nη = 1 otherwise.\
    \ x(n) is the PU signal and w(n) is the additive noise at the receiver of SU.\n\
    For active PU (η = 1), SU receives a noisy version of the PU signal. Therefore,\
    \ it should be\naware of the PU channel status by overcoming the noise effects.\
    \ By contrast, when PU is\nabsent, SU receives only the noise w(n). Here, SU should\
    \ be able to detect the presence or\nthe absence of PU to better exploit the channel\
    \ availability. In Equation (1), the received\nsignal y(n) does not depend on\
    \ the SU signal, since we consider that SU remains silent\nduring the SS period.\n\
    The silence period of SU in HDCR is inevitable due to two main challenges. First,\n\
    some detectors like Energy Detector (ED) cannot distinguish between PU and SU\
    \ signal.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n6 of 29\nThus SU must be silent during the\
    \ sensing period so that the sensing process can reliably\ndiagnose the channel\
    \ status. Second, most of the detectors suffer bad performance at\nlow Signal-to-Noise-and-Interference\
    \ Ratio (SNIR). Due to the short distance between the\ntransmit and the receive\
    \ antennas of SU, any transmission of SU during the sensing period\nleads to huge\
    \ SI compared to the PU signal. This SI would lead to an unreliable decision of\n\
    the sensing process.\nDetection Criteria\nTo detect the PU signal, SU evaluates\
    \ a Test Statistic based on the received signal y(n).\nThe aim of evaluating TS\
    \ is to compare it to a threshold to decide on the PU status by\ndistinguishing\
    \ between the noise-only case and the PU-plus-noise case. Many criteria have\n\
    been exploited to distinguish between these two cases. In the following, we discuss\
    \ the\nmost adopted criteria that are used by the SU to detect the presence of\
    \ PU.\n1.\nIncremental Energy\nWhen PU starts to transmit, the energy of the received\
    \ signal will be incremented\ncompared to the noise-only case. By estimating previously\
    \ the power of the stationary\nnoise, and by comparing the energy of the received\
    \ signal to a pre-deﬁned threshold\ndepending on the noise power, SU decides whether\
    \ the channel is occupied by a\nPU signal or not. Many detectors are based on\
    \ this criterion, the most known is the\ntraditional ED [30,31]. Other detectors\
    \ such as the Cumulative Power Spectral Density\n(CPSD) detector [29], cyclo-energy\
    \ detector [32] and generalized ED [33–35] are based\non differentiating between\
    \ the energy of the received signal with and without the\npresence of PU’s signal.\
    \ It is worth mentioning that the generalized ED may use a\npower exponent p ̸=\
    \ 2 in the deﬁnition of it as an extension of the ED Test Statistic,\nwhich is\
    \ based on the energy of the received signal (i.e., p = 2). However, the energy-\n\
    based detectors face the problem of Noise Uncertainty (NU), which occurs when\
    \ the\nnoise power becomes time-dependent. This phenomena adversely impacts the\
    \ SS\nperformance of these detectors [36].\n2.\nPU signal pattern\nThe features\
    \ of the communication signals can be exploited by the SU to distinguish\nthem\
    \ from the noise. Processes, such as the modulation, oversampling, sine-wave\n\
    carrier, adding a cyclic preﬁx (e.g., for the OFDM signal), etc. do not exist\
    \ in the noise.\nSeveral detectors were proposed in the literature by exploiting\
    \ these characteristics\nsuch as the Cyclo-stationary Detector (CSD) [37–39],\
    \ which distinguishes the PU\nsignal from the noise based on the cyclic features\
    \ caused by the modulation, the\nsinewave carrier etc. Other detectors such as\
    \ Auto-Correlation Detector (ACD) [40]\nand Eigenvalue-based Detector (EVD) [41]\
    \ exploit the correlation presented in the\nPU signal due to the oversampling\
    \ and cyclic preﬁx. The main advantage of such\ndetectors is their independence\
    \ of the noise variance, which also overcome the NU\nproblem. Nevertheless, these\
    \ detectors are more computationally complicated than\nthe classical ED. Furthermore,\
    \ cyclic frequencies of the PU signal should be known to\napply CSD. This requires\
    \ cooperation between SU and PU.\nMoreover, some detectors, such as Goodness of\
    \ Fit (GoF) test [42,43] and Kurtosis\ndetectors [44], detect the PU signal using\
    \ the statistics of the communication signals,\nwhich are different from the statistics\
    \ of noise. Thus, the noise’s distribution should\nbe a priori known to the SU.\n\
    3.\nPU signal’s waveform\nSending a pilot signal is widely used by telecommunication\
    \ standards to establish\ncommunication with a receiver by ensuring time synchronization,\
    \ channel estimation,\netc. A known PU pilot signal can be used by the SU to detect\
    \ PU activity. Waveform\nor Matched ﬁlter detector correlates the received signal\
    \ with the known PU pilot\nsignal in order to analyze the channel opportunity\
    \ [45,46]. Even though this detector\nis an optimal one, it requires knowledge\
    \ of the PU signal with perfect time and\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n7 of 29\nfrequency\
    \ synchronization. Therefore, the application of this detector in CR becomes\n\
    challenging, where the SU may deal with a great variety of signals.\nTable 2 compares\
    \ among several SS detectors with respect to the impact of the noise\nuncertainty,\
    \ the need of cooperation between SU and PU and the computational complexity.\n\

    \ factors such as\nthe PU-SU cooperation, the computational cost of the detection\
    \ method and the precise\nestimation of the noise variance. Other criteria can\
    \ be considered such as the required\nobservation time (i.e., the number of received\
    \ samples). A long observation improves the\nSS performance, but consumes more\
    \ energy and reduces the spectral efﬁciency of SU, since\nthe latter should be\
    \ silent during the sensing operation. In contrast, a low observation time\nmay\
    \ increase the collision rate between SU and PU, since a low number of received\
    \ samples\nmay not be sufﬁcient for the detector to reveal the true channel status.\
    \ Thus, choosing\nthe observation time is a trade-off between the spectral efﬁciency\
    \ and the collision rate.\nFurthermore, choosing a period between two sensing\
    \ operations (i.e., transmission period)\nis also challenging in HDCR. On the\
    \ one hand, short periods ensure low collision time with\nPU, but also reduce\
    \ spectral efﬁciency and increase energy consumption due to the sensing\noperations.\
    \ On the other hand, long periods allow SU to consume less power by SS and\nincrease\
    \ the spectral efﬁciency but at the cost of a long colliding time with PU. In\
    \ brief, two\nmajor problems of LBT could be listed:\n1.\nThe SS is not performed\
    \ during the transmission slot, and thus the SU becomes\nunaware of the PU activity\
    \ during this slot. This may lead to harmful interference\nwith PU if the PU starts\
    \ transmitting in this slot.\n2.\nThe secondary throughput is affected by the\
    \ silence duration (sensing time), since the\nSU should stay silent during the\
    \ sensing slot.\nThese two problems can be solved by FDCR as explained in the\
    \ next section.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n8 of 29\n3. Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio:\

    \ Cancellation\nThe key technology behind the IBFD communication, SIC, can be\
    \ divided into two\nsteps: passive cancellation and active cancellation. In passive\
    \ cancellation [53–56], the\nSI is canceled in the analog domain considering several\
    \ parameters such as the distance\nbetween the transmit and the receive antennas,\
    \ the wavelength of the signal, the absorption\nof the material, etc.\nIn active\
    \ cancellations [57–59], the receiver suppresses the SI in the digital domain\n\
    given that the receive and transmit circuits are co-located and that the SI signal\
    \ is known\nat the receiver. Due to the short distance between the transmit (TX)\
    \ and the receive (RX)\nantennas, the SI received power at RX is huge compared\
    \ to the signal of interest (PU\nsignal). Thus, the channel estimation between\
    \ TX and RX should be very precise in order to\nre-generate the SI with high precision\
    \ and to cancel it afterwards. Moreover, the hardware\nimperfections adversely\
    \ impact the SIC performance and should be mitigated, since their\npower becomes\
    \ very high compared to the signal of interest. Note that the hardware\nimperfections\
    \ are due to several factors including oscillator phase noise, the non-linearity\n\
    of the ampliﬁers, the ADC noise, etc. Subsequently, due to the error in channel\
    \ estimation\nand the hardware imperfections, Residual Self-Interference (RSI)\
    \ remains at the receiver.\nRSI is modeled as both linear and non-linear combinations\
    \ of the SI signal due to\nthe ampliﬁcation at both the output of the transmit\
    \ circuit and the input of the receive\ncircuit [60]. Mitigating these imperfections\
    \ has gained a lot of attention during the last\ndecade especially the multiplicative\
    \ noise of the oscillator and the non-linearity of the\npower ampliﬁers [59,61–64].\
    \ In the following, we present the modes of operation of FDCR.\n3.2. Transmit-Sense\n\
    Transmit-Sense (TS) mode is a direct result of applying the LAT protocol. SIC\
    \ is used\nto cancel the SI when the SS is performed. Thus, the sensing performance\
    \ is affected by the\nSIC efﬁciency. In the literature, several models have been\
    \ adopted to represent the received\nsignal considering the impact of the RSI\
    \ on the sensing performance [31,58,65–67]. Among\nthe most used, we consider\
    \ the following [66–68]:\ny(n) = Es(n) + ηx(n) + w(n)\n(2)\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 2408\n9 of 29\nwhere s(n) is the SU signal received at RX, including the channel\
    \ effect and the hardware\nimperfections; E is the SIC efﬁciency, where 0 ≤ E\
    \ ≤ 1; When E = 0, then the RSI\nsuppression is perfect while E = 1 corresponds\
    \ to the case of no RSI suppression.\nAfter canceling the SI, a Test Statistic\
    \ is applied on y(n). Usually, the Test Statistics\nused in HDCR can also be used\
    \ for FDCR. As shown by Equation (2), the received signal in\nFDCR mode becomes\
    \ the same as that of HDCR for ideal SIC (Equation (1)). Therefore,\nthe SS performance\
    \ under HDCR becomes an asymptotic case for FDCR [68]. The last\nstatement is\
    \ true for the case of a single SS operation. However, FDCR can continuously\n\
    perform SS while sensing in HDCR is not applied during the transmission period\
    \ of SU.\nKnowing that the PU can become active at any time, the collision rate\
    \ with PU is highly\nreduced in FDCR compared to HDCR [69].\nFigure 3 shows the\
    \ steps of FDCR and HDCR before making a decision on the channel\nstate. After\
    \ receiving the signal, a Test Statistic is evaluated in HDCR, while SIC precedes\n\
    the Test Statistic evaluation in FDCR in order to reduce the SI effect on the\
    \ reliability of the\nTest Statistic.\nReceiving \nApplying a Test\nStatistc\n\

    \ For LBT, no Self-Interference Cancellation\n(SIC) module is required since there\
    \ is no simultaneous Transmit-Sense (TS), and the Test Statistic\nmay be directly\
    \ applied to the received signal. By contrast, SIC is applied before evaluating\
    \ the Test\nStatistic in LBT to reduce the effect of SI on the Spectrum Sensing\
    \ (SS) performance.\nAnother strategy for the LAT protocol is adopted in [70]\
    \ without using SIC. The\nsensing operation is performed by the receiving SU instead\
    \ of the transmitting one. After\ndecoding the signal received from its peer (another\
    \ SU), the secondary receiver subtracts\nthe signal of its peer from the overall\
    \ received signal. After that, spectrum sensing is carried\nout based on the remaining\
    \ signal in order to decide about the presence/absence of the PU.\nFrom another\
    \ perspective, SIC necessitates additional hardware requirement. Auxil-\niary\
    \ chain is mandatory in SIC-based receivers in order to maintain the synchronization\n\
    with the transmitter and to extract some necessary features to reduce the SI [58,62].\
    \ The\nadditional hardware equipment increases the cost and the required power\
    \ of the FDCR\nsystem compared to the HDCR [66,71]. Moreover, making the SS continuously\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact the energy efﬁciency of the system due to the additional\
    \ power consumed by\nthe SIC circuit and the SS itself [72]. As a compromise,\
    \ the period between two consecutive\nSS operations is conﬁgured based on the\
    \ accepted energy efﬁciency of the system and the\ntolerable collision time with\
    \ PU. Another parameter impacting the period between two\nconsecutive SS operations\
    \ is the probability that the PU returns active [73,74]. When the\nPU is more\
    \ likely to be absent for a long time, continuous monitoring is not efﬁcient.\n\
    3.3. Transmit-Receive\nTransmit-Receive (TR) allows two SUs to establish bidirectional\
    \ communication over\nthe same channel. In this mode, SIC is used to cancel the\
    \ SI in order to obtain the signal\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n10 of 29\nof the peer\
    \ SU, unlike TS where SIC is used to receive the noisy primary signal when PU\n\
    is active. The PU signal sensing is performed by Interference Sensing (IS) or\
    \ SS as we\nexplained in the following.\n3.3.1. IS-Based Transmit-Receive\nEven\
    \ though the SS is not performed by SUs in IS-based TR mode, PU detection\nremains\
    \ applicable by employing IS instead of SS. IS is based on the capability of the\n\
    secondary receiver to decode the message of its peer. When PU becomes active,\
    \ it causes\ninterference to the secondary transmission resulting in the inability\
    \ of the second receiver\nto decode the message of its peer. Thus, if the decoding\
    \ process is successful, the PU is\nassumed absent, while PU is detected as active\
    \ otherwise. The main advantage of TR is\nthat it doubles the spectrum efﬁciency\
    \ since the same band is used for both transmitting\nand receiving data. However,\
    \ it exposes the PU to a high risk of harmful interference as IS\nis not efﬁcient\
    \ at low PU’s SNR [75].\nBefore the secondary system starts with the TR mode,\
    \ it makes a traditional SS period\nin order to detect the vacancy of the primary\
    \ band. This SS operation lasts while the PU\nband is occupied [65,76–78]. Once\
    \ the PU band is identiﬁed as vacant, SUs start commu-\nnicating using IBFD. In\
    \ order to minimize the interference to the PU, an asynchronous\ntransmission\
    \ was proposed [65,76,77]. In asynchronous transmission, one of the two com-\n\
    municating SUs makes a delay of Ts with respect to the transmitted frame of its\
    \ peer. As\npresented in Figure 4, the decisions made by SUs at the end of each\
    \ frame are delayed by\nTs with respect to each other. For an optimal value of\
    \ Ts = T\n2 [65], the CR network makes a\ndecision on the PU status each T\n2\
    \ sec instead of T sec if synchronous transmission is adopted\nbetween SUs. This\
    \ asynchronous transmission helps the SUs to enhance monitoring the\nPU activity\
    \ as the latter may access the channel at any time.\nThe 2nd SU\nmakes decision\n\

    \ mechanism in asynchronous Transmit-Receive (TR) mode. A delay of\nTs is made\
    \ in order to reduce the collision time between the secondary and the primary\
    \ transmissions.\nThe application of IS-based TR provides SU with high spectral\
    \ efﬁciency compared to\nTS. The main drawback of this technique is its weak awareness\
    \ of the PU presence when\nthe latter returns active with a low SNR. Therefore,\
    \ it is recommended to use the IS-based\nTR in the scenarios where PU SNR is high\
    \ at the SUs, so that it prevents SU receivers from\ndecoding the messages when\
    \ active.\n3.3.2. SS-based Transmit-Receive\nEven though TS and IS-based TR are\
    \ the most popular schemes in FDCR, another TR\nmode based on SS has been introduced.\
    \ Performing SS in TR faces the problem of receiving\nthe secondary signal of\
    \ the peer SU in addition to the SI of the SU. The SIC is capable of\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 2408\n11 of 29\nhighly reducing the SI signal. Yet, the signal of\
    \ the peer SU still exists. The received signal\nin SS-based TR is given as follows\
    \ [75,79]:\ny(n) = Es(n) + ηx(n) + r(n) + w(n)\n(3)\nThe variables in Equation\
    \ (3) are similar to those in Equation (2), except for the r(n)\nthat stands for\
    \ the peer SU signal including the channel effect.\nIn [79], a mechanism is proposed\
    \ to apply SS-based TR that exchanges the sensing\nparameters between the two\
    \ communicating SUs. When SU1 sends the signal to SU2, it\nsends concurrently\
    \ the energy amount of the transmitted samples to its peer via a control\nchannel.\
    \ On the other side, SU2 computes the energy of the received samples and subtracts\n\
    the known amount of the energy of its peer. However, this mechanism requires an\
    \ accurate\nestimation of the channel between the communicating SUs. The proposed\
    \ mechanism may\nalso fail to detect the PU when the SU SNR is high.\nThe work\
    \ presented in [75] aims to overcome the problem of PU’s low SNR that\nfaces the\
    \ TR mode by adopting SS instead of the IS. One of the two communicating SUs\n\
    should remain silent only during the SS period in order not to disturb its peer.\
    \ Hence, the\nsensing operation is performed in an alternative manner between\
    \ the two communicating\nSUs. When the ﬁrst SU performs the SS, it continues transmitting\
    \ and canceling its SI.\nMeanwhile, the second SU remains silent. This mechanism\
    \ is regularly alternating between\nthe two SUs.\nIn [80], SS-based TR is proposed\
    \ for OFDM-based FDCR. Two communicating SUs\nshould avoid the use of some dedicated\
    \ sub-carriers (null sub-carriers) in order to detect\nthe PU status. When the\
    \ PU becomes active, it might cover the entire band including the\ndedicated sub-carriers.\
    \ As these sub-carriers do not exhibit any secondary transmission,\nSU may monitor\
    \ PU by evaluating the energy of the received signal on these sub-carriers.\n\
    Note that no SIC is required to be done on the sub-carriers where the SS is applied\
    \ since no\nsecondary transmission is made on them. The cost to pay in this SS-based\
    \ TR mechanism\nis the loss in the frequency resources, i.e., the null sub-carriers.\n\
    Table 3 presents a comparison among the CR operating modes with respect to the\n\
    essential features related to the SU performance and the impact of SU’s transmission\
    \ on\nPU. The IS-based TR presents a poor performance at low PU SNR in contrast\
    \ to other\nmodes. HDCR may lead to a long collision time with PU due to its blindness\
    \ during the\ntransmission, while FDCR modes can perform the sensing continuously.\
    \ The need for SIC\nto perform the SS exists in TS mode and some approaches in\
    \ SS-based TR mode. Note that\nSIC can be used for the sake of establishing bidirectional\
    \ communication between the peer\nSUs in TR modes.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n12\

    \ Sensing\nMachine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are among the most powerful\
    \ tools\nin solving complex classiﬁcation problems. More speciﬁcally, they have\
    \ been employed in\nwireless communication to efﬁciently manage the spectrum and\
    \ the power resources, and\nto ensure high quality of services for the mobile\
    \ users [84–88]. In the CR domain, one of\nthe objectives of using ML and DL is\
    \ to enhance the SS performance. Learning techniques\nusually use two phases:\
    \ learning and prediction. For SS applications, the data provided in\nthe learning\
    \ phase is related to the PU features and the SU sensing parameters (such as the\n\
    Test Statistics, SNR, geo-location, etc.), whereas the prediction phase could\
    \ be related to\nthe sensing outcome, the power efﬁciency, the functioning model\
    \ to be adopted and other\nissues [89].\nIn classical SS, SU has to determine\
    \ the threshold for the Test Statistic before making a\ndecision on the PU presence.\
    \ This threshold may be calculated based on target false alarm\nand detection\
    \ rates. Thus, several statistical parameters related to the noise, the channel,\n\
    and the PU signal should be a priori known. ML and DL can overcome the need for\
    \ the a\npriori statistics knowledge [13,90–94]. In literature, the majority of\
    \ work focuses on tuning\nML or DL systems with numerical statistics of two hypotheses:\
    \ H0, where PU is assumed\nto be absent, and H1, where PU is assumed to be active.\n\
    Hereinafter, we discuss the use of learning techniques in local and cooperative\
    \ spec-\ntrum sensing.\n4.1. Local Spectrum Sensing\nLocal sensing corresponds\
    \ to the case where a single node senses the spectrum and\nmakes its own decision.\
    \ In this context, the work of [95] seeks to discriminate between H0\nand H1 hypotheses\
    \ by being trained with the extracted cyclic features of PU’s signal in low\n\
    SNR conditions. This ensemble classiﬁer is based on decision trees and using AdaBoost\n\
    algorithm [96]. Wideband SS is tackled in [97], where three techniques are presented:\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 2408\n13 of 29\nneural networks, expectation maximization and\
    \ k-means. The techniques are used to detect\nthe presence of one or multiple\
    \ PUs in a wideband spectrum.\nIn order to enhance the accuracy of the ML system\
    \ in making a decision on the PU\nstatus, Hybrid SS (HSS) has been proposed [92,98].\
    \ HSS detects the presence of PU using\nsimultaneously several detectors. HSS\
    \ can compensate the weak points of a given detector\nwith the advantages of another\
    \ one. For instance, ED suffers from the noise uncertainty at\nlow SNR, which\
    \ is overcome by ACD. In return, ACD is adversely impacted by the low\noversampling\
    \ rate of the PU signal, while ED is not [29].\nIn [92,98], artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ have been applied in order to perform HSS.\nTraining is done using the Test\
    \ Statistics of two detectors related to H0 and H1, where ED\nand CSD are used\
    \ in [98], while ED and likelihood ratio statistics are used in [92]. The\nwork\
    \ of [99] extends the HSS-based DL for 6 detectors showing the effectiveness of\
    \ such\ntechniques in detecting PU at very low SNR. HSS is exploited in [100]\
    \ in order to introduce\none-class-based learning. Data of several detectors are\
    \ collected under H0 to learn the\ndetection system of the H0 class. The training\
    \ phase is done using only data related to the\nnoise without the need for PU-related\
    \ data. In the prediction phase, when the predictor\ndetects an outlier of H0\
    \ class, then PU is assumed to be active.\nHowever, these techniques, especially\
    \ those related to DL, have a computational cost.\nSome work deals with the trade-off\
    \ between accuracy and computational complexity when\nusing DL for SS in order\
    \ to ensure high energy efﬁciency such as in [101,102].\nFurthermore, ML and DL\
    \ are used for spectrum perceptions, i.e., prediction of the\noccupancy of the\
    \ PU channels [89,103,104]. For example, a geo-frequency-temporal map\non the\
    \ PU activities can be constructed using learning techniques. This map guides\
    \ the\nspectrum access and enhances the SS performance [105]. Using the prediction\
    \ of the\nspectrum vacancy, SU can wisely select the communication channels to\
    \ reduce handover\nrate and avoid interference [73,106,107]. By contrast, when\
    \ a handover happens, SU may\ntarget a channel where PU is expected to be absent\
    \ to make SS before accessing [108]. This\nmakes the handover safer and faster.\
    \ Moreover, when PU is likely to leave the channel for\na long time, SU may increase\
    \ the period between two consecutive SS operations leading\nto economizing its\
    \ energy and enhancing the spectral efﬁciency. The channel prediction\nmay differ\
    \ from a geo-location to another [109]. Accordingly, a mobile SU would switch\n\
    from a channel to another based on its prediction of the PU behavior. In addition,\
    \ the\nlearning techniques proved their effectiveness in managing the priority\
    \ of the SUs in\naccessing available channels. The SUs may be competitors or cooperatives\
    \ in sharing the\nlimited frequency resources. Thus, an efﬁcient accessing policy\
    \ is required in order to fairly\ndistribute the available frequency resources\
    \ over the SUs [110–112].\n4.2. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing\nIn Cooperative SS,\
    \ several SUs cooperate in order to make a ﬁnal decision on the PU\nstate. Two\
    \ schemes of Cooperative SS can be distinguished [113–115]:\n(1)\nHard Decision\
    \ Scheme, where each SU makes an individual decision on the PU state,\nthen decisions\
    \ of all SUs are combined at a Fusion Center (FC) to outcome a ﬁnal\ndecision.\n\
    (2)\nSoft Decision Scheme, where the FC gathers the Test Statistics calculated\
    \ at the SUs,\nand combines them in order to compare a ﬁnal Test Statistic to\
    \ a threshold and make\na decision on the primary channel.\nML and DL are introduced\
    \ in cooperative SS in order to tackle several problems such\nas the correlated\
    \ results between the cooperating SUs, the malicious results provided by\nsome\
    \ SUs, giving the SUs close to PU more credibility over far SUs, and other issues.\n\
    In [91], ML techniques such as the K-Means and Support-Vector Machine (SVM) are\
    \ used\nto distinguish between the H0 and H1 hypotheses in a cooperative SS. Two\
    \ low-dimension\nprobability vectors related to both H0 and H1 of ED are used\
    \ to train the system. SVM\nis used to set the threshold curve between H0 and\
    \ H1 clusters. K-nearest-based ML is\nadopted in [116] for cooperative SS, where\
    \ the proposed mechanism is divided into two\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n14 of 29\n\
    phases: training and classiﬁcation. The global decision of the PU presence/absence\
    \ taken\nat the end of the classiﬁcation phase takes into consideration the reliability\
    \ of each CR user\nwhen reporting to the fusion center during the training phase.\n\
    A convolutional Neural Network-based cooperative SS is proposed in [15], where\n\
    the outputs of the SUs are combined in Hard and Soft Combining Schemes. Spatial\
    \ and\nspectral correlations of the channels are taken into account in order to\
    \ make the system\nmore robust. The SUs, which are close to each other, may report\
    \ correlated decisions to the\nFusion Center. This negatively impacts the sensing\
    \ performance when these SUs exhibit\nsevere fading [117].\nThe authors in [20,101]\
    \ propose using the learning techniques for cooperative SS in a\nnon-orthogonal\
    \ multiple access context in order to overcome the physical layer complexity\n\
    of such access scheme. Reinforcement learning is adopted in [118] to perform the\
    \ cooper-\native SS. The reinforcement learning scans the PU channels to form\
    \ a dynamic scanning\npreference list. This list helps to reduce the scanning\
    \ overhead and access delay.\nUsing learning techniques in spectrum monitoring\
    \ for CR is still open to investi-\ngation. The switching among the channels to\
    \ sense, the switching between functioning\nmodes (TS, TR, HDCR, etc.), the sensing\
    \ rate, and other features are to be tackled by\nlearning techniques.\nTable 4\
    \ classiﬁes the recent works that apply learning techniques in CR into four\n\

    \ deployment of WSN/IoT can be exploited by the CR in monitoring the PU\nchannel.\
    \ For example, Spectrum Sensing as a Service (SSaaS) emerges as a new business\n\
    model [142]. On the other hand, the huge number of WSN/IoT devices give rise to\
    \ high\ndemand on spectral resources. Here, CR technology can be considered as\
    \ a solution thanks\nto its dynamicity in enabling spectrum sharing [16,17].\n\
    5.1. Spectrum Sensing as a Service\nWhen considering SSaaS, the SS process is\
    \ done by WSN node(s) related to the SSaaS\nprovider and not by the SU in the\
    \ secondary network. The SSaaS provider then informs the\nsecondary network with\
    \ the PU channel status [142]. Accordingly, the secondary network\ntakes the decision\
    \ on transmitting on that channel or not. SU may operate in a wide range\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 2408\n15 of 29\nof frequency channels, therefore, WSN should have\
    \ the necessary electronic circuitry to\nreconﬁgure according to the sensing tasks\
    \ requested by the secondary network.\nMoreover, on-demand responsiveness of the\
    \ WSN network is of high importance,\nsince the SS information on the PU channel\
    \ should be relevant, and SU should be up-to-\ndate continuously [143]. This challenge\
    \ faces the limitation associated to the WSN and\nthe IoT networks protocols such\
    \ as LoRaWAN, since such a network does not support the\non-demand data communication\
    \ [144]. The work of [16,145] suggested some modiﬁcations\non LoRaWAN protocol\
    \ to support the on-demand SS.\nThe selection of the WSN nodes that perform the\
    \ SS is also a serious challenge due to\nthe energy constraint imposed by the\
    \ massive range of battery-powered nodes. Several\nstrategies may be adopted to\
    \ select the nodes responsible for performing the SS: random-\nbased selection,\
    \ SNR-based selection, battery’s energy level-based selection, hybrid criteria-\n\
    based selection [145–148]. Each of the strategies has its impact on the SS performance\n\
    and on the lifetime of the network. For instance, SNR-based strategy ensures high\
    \ SS\nperformance but it may adversely impact the lifetime of the nodes. By contrast,\
    \ the\nbattery’s energy level-based selection does not take into consideration\
    \ the SNR of the\nprimary signal, which may lead to poor SS performance.\nFrom\
    \ another perspective, it is important to study the contract between the secondary\n\
    network and SSaaS provider to ensure the satisfaction of both entities [149–151].\
    \ In this\ncontext, blockchain technology is used to set the required SS parameters\
    \ via smart contract,\nsuch as in [149,150], where the nodes of the WSN are rewarded\
    \ only if they accurately\nperform sensing.\nSSaaS remains an open research topic\
    \ to explore. Several parameters are not studied\nyet, such as the impact of the\
    \ delay of sending the sensing results from the SSaaS provider\nto the secondary\
    \ network on the collision rate between SU and PU. In addition, the cost\nof SS\
    \ in terms of the payment and the collision rate has to be further investigated.\
    \ Large\nnumber of SS operations leads to high protection of PU against secondary\
    \ interference, but\nit may be more expensive for the secondary network. In addition,\
    \ it is important to study\nmobile SU in the context of SSaaS, where the mobile\
    \ SU might leave a WSN to another.\nThis will require handover execution in order\
    \ to keep the SU aware of the PU activity. In\naddition, the SU needs to switch\
    \ to a new vacant channel if PU returns active. Here, an\nefﬁcient and fast cooperation\
    \ strategy between the SSaaS provider and the SU network\nshould be designed in\
    \ order to ﬁnd an available channel and to switch smoothly from one\nchannel to\
    \ another.\n5.2. Dynamic Spectrum Sharing for WSN communication\nThe increasing\
    \ popularity of using WSN/IoT devices requires better utilization of the\nlimited\
    \ frequency resources. Dynamic Spectrum Sharing using CR has been proposed to\n\
    overcome the limitation of the available frequency resources in the context of\
    \ WSN [17,24].\nIn Dynamic Spectrum Sharing for WSN communication, CR considers\
    \ the WSN nodes\nas SUs. By monitoring the PU channel, the WSN nodes bear extra\
    \ energetic burdens, since\nmore energy consumption is needed to accomplish the\
    \ SS task. In fact, energy consumption\nis of high importance for the IoT/WSN\
    \ networks, since the nodes are operating under\nprotocols to extend their lifetime\
    \ to several years. For instance, in Low Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN) IoT\
    \ networks, the lifetime of a sensor may exceed 5 years [152] due to\nthe transmission\
    \ speciﬁcations, especially the small duty cycle of less than 1% as in LoRa\n\
    networks [153].\nAdapting the CR mechanism to the WSN/IoT networks is challenging\
    \ due to several\nissues such as providing the nodes with the available frequency\
    \ bands, deploying the SS\ncapability, selecting the nodes responsible of spectrum\
    \ sensing, etc. Several studies tackle\nthe implementation of CR in an IoT network\
    \ and the standardization of the CR-based\nIoT [17,24,24,154,155]. They explain\
    \ the additional features required to perform the CR\nmechanism such as implementing\
    \ hardware and protocols. This includes switching from\none frequency band to\
    \ another depending on the sensing process. Indeed, multiband access\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 2408\n16 of 29\nbecomes necessary due to a large number of WSN/IoT\
    \ devices, and having several available\nfrequency channels makes the channel\
    \ switching simpler and more efﬁcient [156,157].\nThe energy-throughput optimization\
    \ of the CR-IoT is investigated in [158] where\ncooperative SS is adopted. Cooperative\
    \ sensing necessitates the participation of several\nSUs/nodes in the SS. Despite\
    \ the sensing improvement, cooperative sensing may impose\nadditional energy consumption\
    \ challenges for the participating SUs related to the contin-\nuous SS and reporting\
    \ operations. The adoption of local sensing or cooperative sensing\nis discussed\
    \ in [159] under different sensing conditions and applied to CR-based NB-IoT\n\
    technology with slotted-ALOHA protocol. The study of [159] concludes that it is\
    \ more\nconvenient to use local SS when SNR is relatively high and limits the\
    \ use of cooperative SS\nto the situations of low SNR.\nGiven that the CR functionality\
    \ is implemented, new challenges emerge such as in-\ncreasing the throughput and\
    \ the spectrum efﬁciency and reducing the energy consumption\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes. Dynamic licensed-unlicensed access is proposed in [16], where the\nCR-based\
    \ nodes may access both licensed and unlicensed bands in a dynamic mechanism.\n\
    Such a mechanism may lower the demand on the unlicensed bands (where the WSN/IoT\n\
    nodes operate usually) by sharing available licensed bands.\nIn [158], an energy-throughput\
    \ trade-off of wireless sensor network is proposed in the\ncontext of cooperative\
    \ SS and dedicated low-power devices. The latter study focuses\non minimizing\
    \ the consumed energy while satisfying the requirements of secondary\nthroughput\
    \ and primary signal detection.\nTo compensate the additional energy consumed\
    \ by the CR functionalities, such as\nSS and spectrum sharing, Energy Harvesting\
    \ has been proposed in order to enhance the\nenergy efﬁciency of the CR-based\
    \ IoT system [160].\nCR seems a promising mechanism to address the high demand\
    \ of the WSN/IoT\nnetworks on the frequency resources. Yet, CR-IoT should prove\
    \ its energy efﬁciency as\nwell as the spectral efﬁciency especially for industrial\
    \ applications [161]. The deployment\npattern and the transmission protocol play\
    \ an essential role to minimize the energy con-\nsumption and reduce the interference\
    \ between nodes [162] leading to enhance the energy\nefﬁciency of the CR-IoT network.\
    \ However, several challenges are to be investigated such\nas suitable protocol\
    \ to exchange the data in two ways: central entity-sensing SUs and\ncentral entity-transmitting\
    \ SUs. First, the central entity should inform the sensing SUs of\nthe channel\
    \ to be sensed. Then these SUs should respond back by their decisions. This\n\
    mechanism imposes time and frequency synchronization, e.g., control channel. Second,\n\
    after identifying the available channel, the SUs/nodes, which need to transmit,\
    \ should\nbe informed by adequate available channels to conﬁgure their circuit\
    \ accordingly. This\nconﬁguration necessitates the proper electronic circuitry\
    \ that is able to meet the dynamic\nreconﬁguration. In addition, efﬁcient resource\
    \ management by the central entity is required\nto fulﬁll the node demands in\
    \ terms of data transmission and interference reduction.\n6. Cognitive Radio Application\
    \ for 5G and Beyond 5G\nThe 5th generation (5G) of mobile technologies is expected\
    \ to provide users with Gbps\ncommunication, very low latency and high reliability.\
    \ 5G networks are designed to operate\non two types of channels: the licensed\
    \ channels and the unlicensed channels [19].\n6.1. 3GPP Technologies\nReaching\
    \ 5G requirements is challenging especially those related to the massive\nconnectivity\
    \ and the Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC) [163]. CR\nis a\
    \ potential candidate to help to enhance the utilization of the spectrum while\
    \ protecting\nusers in dense and heterogeneous networks [164].\nIn Release 13\
    \ of the 3GPP, LTE are provided with the ability to operate on the unli-\ncensed\
    \ band such as 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz in order to open new spectral resources [165].\n\
    Two types of unlicensed LTE can be distinguished: LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U), developed\
    \ by\nLTE-U Forum and used in USA, Korea and India, and LTE-Licensed Assisted\
    \ Access (LTE-\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n17 of 29\nLAA), developed by 3GPP and\
    \ used in Japan and Europe [166]. The use of unlicensed LTE\nis envisaged to extend\
    \ to essential 5G applications such as the enhanced mobile broadband\n(eMBB),\
    \ massive machine-type communication (mMTC), and URLLC [167]. LTE-U and\nLTE-LAA\
    \ may cause severe interference to the technologies operating on the unlicensed\n\
    bands, especially WiFi. Thus, an efﬁcient mechanism is essential to manage the\
    \ resource\nallocation and to protect the technologies from interfering with each\
    \ other [168,169].\nTo protect WiFi against LTE interference, both LTE-U and LTE-LAA\
    \ adopt Dynamic\nChannel Selection (DCS) by targeting the least interfering channels\
    \ of the unlicensed bands\nto transmit over them [170]. However, DCS is not always\
    \ applicable since no clean channel\nmay be available. LTE-U uses Carrier Sensing\
    \ Adaptive Transmission (CSAT), which is\nbased on observing the channel for a\
    \ certain time (usually between 0.2 to 10 sec) in order\nto deﬁne a time cycle.\
    \ Then, LTE-U system transmits in a fraction of the cycle and turns\nthe transmission\
    \ off in the remaining duration [171]. Besides, CSAT, LTE-LAA uses LBT to\naccess\
    \ the channel [172,173]. Even though LBT is a SS technique and is applied in CR,\
    \ more\ndeveloped CR-based mechanisms have been proposed to be adopted by the\
    \ unlicensed LTE\nin order to protect WiFi from the interference [168,174,175].\
    \ In such models, WiFi nodes\nare considered as PUs while the LTE-U users are\
    \ considered as secondaries. In [175] a CR-\nbased framework is proposed to construct\
    \ the spectrum availability map. Idle LTE nodes\nperform SS on the unlicensed\
    \ channels and send the channel status to the LTE base station\nperiodically.\
    \ Accordingly, the WiFi access-points locations and transmitting powers can be\n\
    obtained and exploited later on to serve LTE-U. Joint spectrum sharing and aggregation\
    \ is\nproposed to utilize the TV white spaces, licensed spectrum and LTE-U bands\
    \ [176]. TV and\nWiFi systems are considered PUs in the TV white spaces and the\
    \ LTE-U bands respectively.\nA co-existence strategy is developed to fairly utilise\
    \ and access the TV and the LTE-U\nbands based on the sensing capability of the\
    \ LTE network. In [177,178], sensing is used to\nreduce interference in ultra-dense\
    \ small-cell deployment scenario, which introduces CR as\na helpful technique\
    \ for the planning of 5G and B5G networks.\n6.2. Compressive Sensing\nWith the\
    \ existence of various applications that require high spectral resources in 5G\n\
    such as smart cities, smart agriculture, monitoring purpose, etc, the need for\
    \ frequency\nresources becomes extremely high. This need will continue growing\
    \ with the coming of\nthe B5G and the Internet of Everything (IoE) [179,180].\
    \ In this regard, SS that focuses on\none narrow channel, such as ED and CSD,\
    \ may not be sufﬁcient. Instead, Wide Band\nSensing (WBS) [181–183], which is\
    \ able to explore a wide frequency band, will be a good\ncandidate to meet the\
    \ frequency needs of the CR network. From the CR point of view, WBS\nensures a\
    \ high data rate for the SUs since the data rate is directly related to the bandwidth.\n\
    In addition, WBS provides CR with the ability to satisfy multiple SUs requirements\
    \ at\nthe same time. A large available band for a CR makes the handover operation\
    \ simpler\nand faster.\nHowever, WBS imposes several challenges at the hardware\
    \ complexity level [184].\nIn classical WBS that respects the Nyquist rate, the\
    \ wideband is divided into a set of\nnarrowband channels using ﬁltering blocks.\
    \ Then, a SS technique is concurrently applied\non each channel to diagnose its\
    \ availability. Despite the low delay in making the decision\non the channels’\
    \ availability, this approach is very costly from a hardware point of view\nsince\
    \ it needs high ﬁltering capability [185]. As an alternative, wavelet techniques\
    \ have\nbeen proposed to perform the WBS. They are used to detect the irregularities\
    \ of the\nwideband, in which the available channels are located. However, this\
    \ approach suffers\nhigh computational complexity [186,187].\nTo overcome the\
    \ Nyquist rate constraint, Compressive Sensing (CS) has been proposed\nto perform\
    \ the WBS [181,188,189]. CS consists of three phases: sensing measurements,\n\
    signal reconstructing, and ﬁnally performing SS on the reconstructed signal.\n\
    Recently, CS gained a lot of attention as in the case of joint communication and\
    \ radar\nsensing in 5G mobile networks [190,191]. As for the SS, the use of CS\
    \ focuses on the IoT\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n18 of 29\napplications, where the\
    \ number of devices is huge [159]. Although CR solves the problem\nof the high\
    \ sampling rate, it may suffer from the NU problem at the performance level [192],\n\
    and power and complexity limitations at the implementation level. Low-cost systems\
    \ and\nbattery-powered devices, such as the IoT devices, may not afford the high\
    \ complexity\nand hardware requirements of CS. For this reason, many studies focus\
    \ on analyzing and\nlowering the cost of applying the CS in IoT networks [27,193–195].\n\
    6.3. Beamforming-Based Communication\nMassive MIMO and Ultra-dense Network deployment\
    \ are key enablers of 5G aiming\nat maximizing the spectrum reuse [196]. In this\
    \ context, the base stations adopt tight\nbeamforming techniques looking to maximize\
    \ the transmit power in the direction of the\nreceiver. Moreover. Cell-free networks\
    \ have recently been proposed to serve a high number\nof users in a cellular network.\
    \ A key enabler of this technology is the beamforming tech-\nnique [197,198].\
    \ Here, CR may exploit a new dimension for its opportunistic transmission\nin\
    \ addition to the time-frequency dimension: the spatial dimension. An example\
    \ of new\nspatial dimension of CR is illustrated in Figure 5. SU becomes provided\
    \ with the ability to\ntransmit the data concurrently with PU but under the constraint\
    \ that the SU transmits the\ndata in a different beam than that of PU.\nWhen the\
    \ transmission beam of the PU is well identiﬁed, SU may exploit the remaining\n\
    space in order to transmit the data on a non-overlapping beams base [125,199,200].\
    \ SUs,\nin this case, should be equipped with a multi-antenna system in order\
    \ to adjust their\nbeam far from the primary receiver to avoid interference. In\
    \ this context, joint sensing and\nlocalization of PU becomes of high importance\
    \ since the localization of PU transmitter\nmay facilitate the mission of SUs\
    \ in identifying the beam and thus to diagnose the spatio-\ntemporal availability\
    \ of the spectrum [200,201]. Recently, some work has been introduced\nto enable\
    \ spatial SS by identifying the PU’s location and adjusting the SU’s beam using\
    \ the\nreceived power at SUs surrounding the PU [200,202]. In this regard, estimation\
    \ techniques\nhave to be more developed in order to estimate the PU beam blindly\
    \ or in the case where\nlittle information about PU transmission is available\
    \ [203–205]. Nevertheless, identiﬁcation\nof the PU transmission remains a complicated\
    \ task for the SUs, especially where no\ncooperation is available between secondary\
    \ and primary networks. In addition, interference\ncaused by the secondary transmission\
    \ should be carefully controlled since it is inevitable\neven though the transmission\
    \ is beamforming-based. The interference level depends on\nthe number of transmit\
    \ antennas at the SUs, the distance between SU and PU and the angle\nof arrival\
    \ of the secondary signal at the primary receiver. Accordingly, the transmit power\n\
    and the beam of SU transmission should be adjusted.\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n\

    \ able to exploit the spatial dimension by\ntransmitting in a non-overlapping\
    \ direction with the PU transmission. Here, SU should be able to\nestimate/know\
    \ the PU beam in order to avoid the interference.\n7. Future Challenges\nThe main\
    \ philosophy of CR is to dynamically share the spectrum among different\nwireless\
    \ communication technologies. Accordingly, SS for CR is highly impacted by the\n\
    advancement and growth of these technologies. Wireless communication is undoubted\n\
    evolving in many ways including infrastructure deployment (e.g., massive deployment\n\
    of small cells), system operation and management (e.g., self-organized networks),\
    \ new\nconcepts (e.g., cell-free systems), new technologies (e.g., intelligent\
    \ reﬂecting surfaces)\nand many other techniques. Thus, SS should keep up with\
    \ the evolution progress. In the\nfollowing, we present several future challenges\
    \ related to applying and developing SS for\nthe new trends of CR.\n1.\nChannel\
    \ Coding for Interference Sensing:\nIS is mainly applied in the TR mode of the\
    \ FDCR. Being able to use only one available\nchannel to establish bidirectional\
    \ communication between two SUs, TR becomes\nvery attractive since it doubles\
    \ the frequency efﬁciency compared to TS mode and\nHDCR [65,78]. TR uses signal\
    \ decoding to reveal the PU status, which depends on\nthe adopted channel coding\
    \ technique. The weak technique may deteriorate the\nperformance of the secondary\
    \ network, while the strong technique may allow SU to\ndecode the received signal\
    \ even if PU is active. Here, the challenge becomes how to\nchoose the optimal\
    \ channel coding technique that matches the quality of service of\nSUs and, at\
    \ the same time, does not prevent SU from detecting PU.\n2.\nSwitching protocols\
    \ between CR functioning modes:\nExisting techniques for switching from a CR mode\
    \ to another only take into account\nPU statistics [72,76,78]. However, other\
    \ parameters may be taken into consideration\nsuch as the energy and frequency\
    \ resources, since each mode has different require-\nments. Modes that are based\
    \ on SIC, such as TS and TR, require more hardware and\nenergy resources. This\
    \ is not always available, especially for the battery-powered\ndevices, which\
    \ are planned to serve for several years such as the LPWAN IoT devices.\nThe adoption\
    \ of a mode depends on the available frequency resources: TR may be\none of the\
    \ good choices since it requires only one channel to establish bidirectional\n\
    communication between two peer SUs, but it suffers poor sensing performance at\n\
    low PU SNR. Thus, both frequency and energy efﬁciencies are important factors\
    \ that\nshould be taken into account to make a suitable choice of the mode to\
    \ adopt. With this\nSensors 2021, 21, 2408\n20 of 29\nlarge number of parameters,\
    \ learning techniques can be extremely useful to indicate\nthe most suitable mode\
    \ to adopt by the SUs.\n3.\nAccess Strategy for IoT/WSN networks:\nIn IoT applications,\
    \ contention between SUs is high due to the large number of\nsensors. Thus, the\
    \ adopted spectrum sharing strategy in such application becomes\nof high importance\
    \ to effectively manage the access of different types of sensors\n[206–208]. This\
    \ strategy may be related to the data type to be sent by the sensor,\nthe redundancy\
    \ of the data (redundant data could be ignored or compressed) and\nthe criticality.\
    \ Sensors looking for transmitting critical data, especially those related\nto\
    \ natural disasters and e-healthcare, may be prioritized over the other sensors.\
    \ A\nstrategy giving the sensors a weight is a common approach in WSN to alleviate\n\
    interference [209]. Such a strategy may be useful in CR-IoT applications to manage\n\
    the access of the nodes on the available frequency channels and maximize spectral\n\
    efﬁciency.\n4.\nExchange Protocol of SS data for IoT/WSN\nDeveloping adequate\
    \ protocols for CR-IoT systems is essential to manage the ex-\nchange between\
    \ the central entity of the IoT network and the nodes [145,210,211].\nThis includes\
    \ requests for nodes to sense a given channel and informing the concerned\nnodes\
    \ with the channel availability updates. For sensing requests, the energy need\n\
    of the IoT nodes should be highly considered especially when the nodes are battery-\n\
    based. In this regard, selecting the sensors to sense the channel, the number\
    \ of sensing\nprocesses per day and the maximal sensing observation time of the\
    \ sensor should\nbe determined by the central entity of the IoT/WSN network to\
    \ ensure effective\nutilization of the resources. Moreover, the nodes that want\
    \ to send data should be\ninformed by the central entity about the available channels\
    \ a priori. Thus, effective\nprotocols should be designed to ensure the time and\
    \ the frequency synchronization\nbetween the end-nodes and the central entity.\n\
    5.\nUse of Intelligent Reﬂecting Surfaces:\nSS may beneﬁt from the emerging Intelligent\
    \ Reﬂecting Surface (IRS), which is ex-\npected to play an essential role in 5G\
    \ and B5G technologies [212,213]. IRS can passively\nreﬂect the signal towards\
    \ a target receiver. IRS is a potential candidate to help to\novercome the hidden\
    \ PU problem by reﬂecting the PU signal towards the SUs, which\nsuffer from low\
    \ PU SNR. Several challenges are expected in using IRS to assist SS,\nsince the\
    \ optimal conﬁguration of the IRS system depends on the channel between\nPU and\
    \ IRS, IRS and SU, and PU and SU. In a context, where no cooperation is avail-\n\
    able between SU and PU, channel estimation becomes hard to apply. Blind channel\n\
    estimation and cascaded-channel estimation could be a good candidate to help the\n\
    IRS application for SS assistance [214].\n6.\nSensing the Spatial Dimension for\
    \ CR\nBeam-based sensing of PUs becomes more and more important for SUs since\
    \ it\nprovides the SU with the spatial availability of the spectrum. However,\
    \ the PU’s\ntransmission beam estimation remains challenging for SU especially\
    \ where no coop-\neration is available with PU [200,215]. Even when the PU beam\
    \ is known, adjusting\nthe SU beam is challenging too due to the inevitable interference\
    \ caused by the SU\ntransmitter to the SU receiver. Thus, the transmit power,\
    \ the beam direction, and the\nnumber of transmit antennas should be carefully\
    \ adjusted. However, due to the need\nfor multiple antennas to adjust the SU beam,\
    \ applying beam-based CR is challenging\nfor low-cost IoT/WSN devices.\n7.\nTowards\
    \ Intelligent Spectrum Sensing:\nWith the massive small cell deployment and Massive\
    \ Machine-Type Communication\nin 5G and B5G, the binary decision of the SS may\
    \ not be efﬁcient. In such a deployment\nthe SS output may be vulnerable to a\
    \ high false alarm rate due to the inter-cell\ninterference, i.e., a given channel\
    \ is free in the cell where SU exists, but SU may falsely\ndetect the presence\
    \ of PU due to the inter-cell interference coming from another\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 2408\n21 of 29\ncell [216]. For this reason, a more intelligent and ﬂexible\
    \ SS technique should be\nadopted to overcome the homogeneity assumption of the\
    \ PU coverage [129]. This\nmeans that the SU should be able to diagnose the channel\
    \ as free even though PU\nis detected in some circumstances. Moreover, SS should\
    \ be extended to deal with\nspectrum perception and environment dynamics learning.\
    \ This is extremely important\nespecially for battery-power devices to enable\
    \ joint channel sensing and access.\n8. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we presented\
    \ the fundamental principles and motivations of applying\nspectrum sensing in\
    \ cognitive radio networks. The concepts of half-duplex and full-duplex\ncognitive\
    \ radio are presented. The main criteria exploited by SU to make the PU signal\n\
    detection are presented and discussed. Different modes of operation for the case\
    \ of full-\nduplex are described. Moreover, the use of learning techniques are\
    \ discussed at both local\nand cooperative levels. Then, the potential of applying\
    \ spectrum sensing in WSN/IoT\nnetwork is investigated, in addition to the essential\
    \ role of IoT/WSN in the Spectrum\nSensing as a Service. We also discuss the use\
    \ of cognitive radio in 5G and B5G from\nspectrum allocation and frequency efﬁciency\

    Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected objects,
    in which every object in the world seeks to communicate and exchange information
    actively. This exponential growth of interconnected objects increases the demand
    for wireless spectrum. However, providing wireless channel access to every communicating
    object while ensuring its guaranteed quality of service (QoS) requirements is
    challenging and has not yet been explored, especially for IoT-enabled mission-critical
    applications and services. Meanwhile, Cognitive Radio-enabled Internet of Things
    (CR-IoT) is an emerging field that is considered the future of IoT. The combination
    of CR technology and IoT can better handle the increasing demands of various applications
    such as manufacturing, logistics, retail, environment, public safety, healthcare,
    food, and drugs. However, due to the limited and dynamic resource availability,
    CR-IoT cannot accommodate all types of users. In this paper, we first examine
    the availability of a licensed channel on the basis of its primary users'' activities
    (e.g., traffic patterns). Second, we propose a priority-based secondary user (SU)
    call admission and channel allocation scheme, which is further based on a priority-based
    dynamic channel reservation scheme. The objective of our study is to reduce the
    blocking probability of higher-priority SU calls while maintaining a sufficient
    level of channel utilization. The arrival rates of SU calls of all priority classes
    are estimated using a Markov chain model, and further channels for each priority
    class are reserved based on this analysis. We compare the performance of the proposed
    scheme with the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes in terms of the
    SU call-blocking probability, SU call-dropping probability, channel utilization,
    and throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed priority scheme outperforms
    the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a new computing paradigm,
    in which heterogeneous devices with interesting services and applications are
    connecting to each other at an unprecedented rate [1]. These applications include
    patient monitoring, real-time health status, remote personnel monitoring, cardiac
    monitors, surveillance cameras, disaster management, response planning, resource
    management and distribution, real-time traffic monitoring, smartphones, utility
    meters, kitchen appliances, televisions, cars, thermostats, industry monitoring,
    noise monitoring, air pollution, waterways, banking, security, and almost anything
    imaginable [2], [3]. According to Gartner research findings, by 2020 approximately
    63 million of IoT devices will connect to the enterprise networks per second [4].
    McKinsey predicted that IoT has great potential for creating a large economic
    impact of 2.7−6.2 trillion dollars annually by 2025 [5]. Thus, in accordance with
    these statistics, it is expected that in the next decade Cisco will make approximately
    14.4 trillion dollars profits from IoT projects worldwide [6]. Similarly, GSMA
    predicted approximately 1.3 trillion dollars profit for mobile network operators
    from the IoT industry [3]. However, accommodating exponentially increasing new
    applications and services over limited available spectrum band poses new communications
    challenges [7]. Due to recent advancements in cognitive radio networks (CRN) and
    IoT, it has been visualized that the junction of cognitive radio (CR) and IoT
    will become the vital need of future communications. IoT devices would be equipped
    with CR technology to enable them to think, learn, and make decisions via awareness
    of both physical and social environments. Additional specifications include the
    perception action cycle, intelligent decision making, semantic derivation, on-demand
    service provisioning, knowledge discovery, and massive data analytics. According
    to Khan and Rehmani, all versions of IoT (e.g., Internet-oriented, semantic-oriented,
    and things-oriented) are insignificant without the CR facility [8], [9]. Hence,
    CR technology has emerged as a key enabling technology for IoT. Since the beginning
    of spectrum regulation, static and fixed spectrum allocation schemes have been
    adopted to allocate wireless spectrum bands. However, statistics prove that most
    of the allotted wireless resources remain unused most of the time all around the
    world [10]. Therefore, if the free slot/white space of already-allocated spectrum
    bands can be used opportunistically, the spectrum scarcity issue can be resolved,
    and new emerging IoT services and applications can be accommodated [11]. CR technology
    has emerged as a promising technique that identifies and utilizes spectrum opportunities
    opportunistically. In CR-enabled IoT networks, two types of spectrum users exist:
    1) primary users (PUs) or legitimate users, who actually own the spectrum bands
    and have exclusive rights to use them for specific wireless applications, and
    2) secondary users (SUs) or CR-empowered IoT users, who identify spectrum opportunities
    and utilize them. Why do we Need Differentiated Priority for Multi-Class Traffic?
    The recent trends in IoT communication systems have introduced a variety of IoT
    services and applications. Hence, it is a challenging task to allocate the wireless
    spectrum to the enormous number of CR-IoT users [8], [9]. However, among a variety
    of IoT services and applications, a few classes of traffic (e.g., traffic related
    to disaster management, response planning, banking, healthcare, and security)
    are more important than others. However, if all the SU calls are considered equal
    in priority under a heavy traffic load and dynamic channel availability, then
    a high blocking rate of more important SU calls occurs, resulting in low performance
    for CR-IoT networks. Therefore, the priorities of all the traffic classes are
    not considered to be equal due to their corresponding traffic profile and quality
    of service (QoS) requirements. Moreover, important traffic classes should be given
    higher-priority than other traffic classes. Hence, it is preferable to block the
    low-priority traffic calls rather than high-priority traffic calls under dynamic
    resource availability and high-traffic-load scenarios. What are the Challenges
    to Enable Differentiated Priority in Multi-Class CR-IoT Networks? With a high
    traffic load of diverse IoT services and applications, because the number of available
    resources is limited in CR-IoT networks (e.g., licensed channels), there are two
    challenges to enable differentiated priority for SUs’ multi-class traffic: 1)
    First, how to design an efficient call admission control scheme that ensures low-blocking
    probability to high-priority traffic? 2) How to combine the priority-differentiated
    admission control with a channel allocation scheme without sacrificing the channel
    utilization? Our Contributions. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce
    a priority-based call admission and channel allocation scheme using traffic-aware
    dynamic channel reservation to lower the higher-priority SU call-blocking probability
    with efficient channel utilization. To ensure guaranteed SU transmissions, we
    estimated licensed channels using two important factors: 1) PU idle probability
    during SU transmission and 2) receipt of ACK at the transmitter SU. The SU calls
    are classified into multi-priority classes. We allocate channels from the pool
    of available channels to a particular prioritized SU based on the call arrival
    rate of specific types of SU requests, which changes with the variation in arriving
    requests. The number of allocated channels from the pool of available channels
    for each priority class is computed based on the traffic arrival rate estimation,
    which is based on queuing analysis and the Markov chain model. Our main contributions
    are summarized below. First, we propose a priority-based traffic-aware dynamic
    channel reservation scheme using queuing analysis and estimation of SU arrival
    rates of all priority classes. Second, we propose a priority-based SU call admission
    and channel allocation scheme, which is further based on a dynamic channel reservation
    scheme for lowering the higher-priority SUs call-blocking probabilities while
    maintaining a sufficient level of channel utilization. Third, we analyze the performance
    of the proposed scheme and compared it with other proposed greedy non-priority
    and fair proportion schemes. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated
    in terms of the SU call-dropping probability, SU call-blocking probability, channel
    utilization, and throughput. The rest of the article is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we discuss the existing state of the art. Then, we present the system
    model including the traffic and primary channel selection models in Section 3.
    In Section 4, we describe the proposed priority-based dynamic channel reservation
    scheme, which further based on queuing analysis and SU call arrival rate estimation.
    In Section 5, we present the proposed priority-based SU call admission and channel
    allocation scheme that is based on a priority-based dynamic channel reservation
    method. In Section 6, we present the performance evaluation. Finally, we propose
    some applications of our proposed scheme and conclude the paper in Sections 7
    and 8, respectively. SECTION 2 Related Work Among a variety of IoT services and
    applications, a few classes are critical and more important than others. Therefore,
    these important traffic classes should be given higher-priority than other traffic
    classes while allocating channel resources. Hence, it is preferable to block the
    low-priority traffic calls rather than high-priority traffic calls under dynamic
    resource availability and high-traffic-load scenarios. Hence, the issue of dynamic
    spectrum allocation and call admission control for heterogeneous IoT services
    and applications in accordance with their traffic profiles in cellular CR-IoT
    networks is an important research topic. In the following, we discuss the existing
    state of the art on dynamic channel allocation and call admission control techniques
    in CR-IoT, and conventional CRNs in brief. In [12], the authors proposed an “energy-centered
    and QoS-aware service selection algorithm (WQSA)” for IoT applications. In the
    WQSA scheme, QoS satisfaction for IoT applications is ensured by using a lexicographic
    optimization technique. Moreover, to reduce energy consumption, the best service
    is selected from the set of services based on QoS attributes, such as the user''s
    preference and energy profile. Similarly, a unifying architecture for energy-efficient
    scheduling and optimization for IoT-based smart cities was presented in [13].
    The authors proposed a new energy-harvesting-based framework for increasing the
    lifetime of IoT-based low-power devices. In [14], another wireless energy harvesting
    scheme was proposed for CR-IoT. In the proposed scheme, CR-IoT devices sense the
    licensed spectrum before using it and also harvest the wireless energy transmitted
    by the nearby access point (AP). The main objective of the study was to optimize
    the energy efficiency on the basis of parameters, such as PU interference, energy
    causality, data rate fairness, and buffer occupancy of IoT devices. In [15], Debroy
    et al. proposed a multi-hop routing technique called “SpEED-IoT: Spectrum aware
    Energy-Efficient multi-hop multi-channel routing scheme for D2D communication
    in IoT mesh network.” The proposed scheme finds the best routing path, optimizes
    transmission power, and selects the best available channel for each hop by using
    the radio environment map. In order to improve the throughput and to optimize
    the energy for CR-IoT, Qureshi et al. used the concept of reliable channel selection
    [16]. The reliability of licensed channels is measured, and channels are ranked
    based on free/used time tracking method proposed in [17]. In [18], Zhu et al.
    proposed a Q-learning algorithm by using deep learning technique for improving
    the throughput of cooperative CR-IoT networks. The authors used the “Markov decision
    process (MDP)” model to formulate the packet transmission strategy from various
    CR-IoT devices under multi-channel CR environment. Another solution to increase
    the end-to-end throughput for multi-hop CR-IoT was proposed in [19]. In the proposed
    scheme, a concurrent transmission model was introduced, in which a link channel
    allocation problem was formulated with the help of a genetic algorithm. Similarly,
    in [20], Salameh et al. proposed a probabilistic channel allocation scheme to
    maximize packet transmission rate for CR-IoT networks under reactive and proactive
    jamming attacks. The proposed scheme selects the secure licensed channel for delay-sensitive
    IoT device based on the channel fading conditions and information on PU activities.
    In order to improve QoS degradation for IoT networks an autonomic QoS-aware middleware
    was introduced in [21]. In [22], an adaptive and QoS-aware architecture was introduced
    for wireless sensors networks based IoT by using a modular approach. This architecture
    helps in implementing QoS models for various IoT applications by using historical
    data captured in physical network. In [23], C. S. Shih et al. proposed a QoS-aware
    meta-routing protocol for cyber physical system-based IoT applications. The proposed
    routing scheme determines the best routing paths for IoT applications based on
    QoS parameters, such as reliability and timeliness. Moreover, node mobility and
    link failure parameters were also considered to ensure the better quality of transmissions.
    In order to optimize energy cost, a “discontinuous reception/transmission (DRX/DTX)”
    scheme for IoT applications was proposed in [24]. This scheme studied various
    sleeping patterns for IoT devices to save energy while ensuring QoS in terms of
    the packet delay, bit rate, and packet loss rate. Several prior research efforts
    [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33] deal with different schemes
    for call admission control (CAC) and channel allocation while guaranteeing QoS
    to SUs. An auction-based SU admission control and channel allocation scheme for
    CRN-based hotspots has been studied in [25]. Spectral resources for different
    SUs have been allocated according to their advertised pricing policy. In [26],
    Alshamrani et al. studied the channel assignment and CAC scheme for two different
    types of SUs: 1) non real-time, and 2) real-time. In the proposed scheme, first,
    the licensed channels are sensed based on the statistical information and then
    detected idle channels are assigned to both types of SUs for maintaining QoS between
    them in terms of call dropping and call blocking probabilities. In [27], He et
    al. proposed a channel assignment method with prime objective to maximize the
    overall user satisfaction by considering various types of SU''s applications and
    services. In [28], Tran et al. introduced an auction theory-based spectrum allocation
    scheme for delay-sensitive SUs. Li et al. investigated the impact of dynamic channel
    availability on smooth video delivery under the CRN environment [29]. The authors
    primarily focused on channel allocation optimization while minimizing playback
    frozen probability. Moreover, they used the receiving buffer state information
    for analyzing the video quality. In [30], a spectrum access regulatory framework
    was proposed to regulate wireless spectrum access among SUs based on time slotted
    medium access control (MAC) structure and dynamic IDs. Huang et al. proposed a
    CAC scheme with soft-QoS based spectrum handoff for CRNs [31]. The proposed scheme
    mainly focuses on improving spectrum utilization and balancing the tradeoff between
    SUs call-blocking and call-dropping probabilities. Similarly, Jiang et al. also
    proposed a CAC scheme for CRNs called “guard channels and restricted channels
    (GC&RC) ” in [32]. In the GC&RC scheme, licensed channels are classified into
    three categories, such as guard, restricted, and shared. Moreover, another CAC
    scheme for CRNs was introduced in [33]. In this scheme, a random access method
    called “VX (virtual-xmit-if-busy)” was used for channel allocation. Moreover,
    the SU collision probability, and channel capacity parameters were observed by
    the PU. To the best of our knowledge, there is no algorithm that jointly considers
    QoS provisioning of heterogeneous multimedia applications and services in accordance
    with their traffic profiles (e.g., priorities), spectrum sensing that is based
    on PU activities (e.g., traffic patterns), spectrum access decision, channel allocation,
    and CAC in cellular CR-IoT networks. Moreover, the objective of our study is to
    reduce the blocking probability of higher-priority SU calls while maintaining
    a sufficient level of channel utilization. SECTION 3 System Model In this section,
    we first present our network and traffic models, and then discuss our PU-traffic-pattern-based
    primary channel selection model. Network Model. Spectrum sensing is an essential
    function in CR-IoT networks to utilize licensed channels by avoiding interference
    with the PUs. Traditionally, the SUs sense and utilize the PU channels by assuming
    a predefined idle time distribution [34], [35]. However, in practice, the idle
    time distribution of licensed channels is PU-traffic-specific [36], [41]. For
    example, two different channels with different PU traffic patterns (i.e., PU activities)
    may have the same channel occupancy probabilities, but they still may have different
    idle/busy frequencies. Therefore, spectrum opportunity identification based on
    PU activities is an efficient way to exploit the licensed spectrum. In this study,
    we consider an infrastructural CR-IoT network with one secondary base station
    (SBS) and M SUs. As shown in Fig. 1, each SU generates different applications,
    which are categorized into P different priority classes. Each SU requests channel
    allocation from the SBS for its transmission. The SBS decides either to assign
    the channel or block the requesting SU based on its priority class and total number
    of channel accessible by that specific priority class SU. The SBS also detects
    the K idle channels from the total available licensed channels N , and orders
    the K available idle channels (i.e., 1≤K≤N ) based on PU idle probability at the
    time of SU transmission. The Key notations and symbols are presented in Table
    1. Fig. 1. Cognitive radio-enabled cellular IoT architecture. Multiple CR-empowered
    IoT users with heterogeneous applications accessing the primary channels opportunistically.
    Show All TABLE 1 Key Notations SUs’ Traffic Model. We assume that there are two
    major categories of radio users: 1) PUs and 2) SUs or CR-empowered IoT users,
    which are further classified into P different priority classes based on their
    applications. We make the following assumptions: A.1: PUs always have the highest
    priority to use the licensed channels and can occupy licensed channels being used
    by any SU. A.2: Each SU can allocate a maximum of one channel at a time for its
    service. A.3: The arrivals of each priority class p (1≤p≤P) SU call requests follow
    the Poisson process with λ p rate, where the priority class 1 SU calls have the
    highest priority, and SU calls of priority class P have the lowest priority in
    terms of their running applications. A.4: The call holding time of each priority
    class is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with expectation of 1 ω
    p . Assumptions A.1–A.3 are standard technological assumptions in CR-IoT networks
    [17], [37], [38]. A.4 is widely used to model the service rate in communication
    networks [39], [40]. In this study, we assume that an SBS knows the licensed channel
    traffic patterns, which are computed based on Bayesian nonparametric traffic clustering
    approaches given in [36], [42]. Primary Channel Selection-Based on PU Traffic
    Patterns. We discuss our licensed channel selection criteria, which is based on
    the PU traffic patterns. Suppose t is the time required for a PU to switch its
    state from busy to idle. The probability of interference with the PU when the
    SU senses the licensed channel at time t under traffic pattern κ is given by [42]
    as follows: ρ S t = 1− F x (t+ Γ S ) 1− F x (t) . (1) View Source Similarly, ρ
    T t represents the probability of PU interference during the SU transmissions
    at time t under traffic pattern κ , which is as below: ρ T t = 1− F x (t+ Γ T
    ) 1− F x (t) , (2) View Source where F X (.) is a cumulative distribution function
    of the PU idle time, and Γ S and Γ T are the SU sensing and transmission times,
    respectively. Let γ 0 and γ 1 represent the probabilities of receiving Negative
    ACKnowledgment (NACK) due to channel conditions (e.g., fading, multi-path loss,
    etc.) and receiving NACK due to the PU collision, respectively. Let θ t represent
    the SU action space, such as θ t ∈{1:transmit, 0:sense} . The sensing observation
    denoted by o S t ∈{idle, busy} , and similarly o T t ∈{ACK, NACK} , represents
    the transmission observation. Let σ t denote the conditional probability that
    a PU is idle at time t , given action-observation o t based on the history for
    a traffic pattern κ . The licensed channel''s idle probability σ (t+ Γ o S S )
    and transmission probability σ (t+ Γ o T T ) at θ t =0 given in [35] are updated
    using observation o t , which is obtained from θ t as follows: σ (t+ Γ o S S )
    = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ σ t ρ S t (1− P f ) σ t ρ S t (1− P f )+(1− σ t ρ S t )(1− P d
    ) , σ t ρ S t P f σ t ρ S t P f +(1− σ t ρ S t ) P d , if   o S =idle; if   o
    S =busy, (3) View Source σ (t+ Γ o T T ) = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ σ t ρ T t (1− γ 0 ) σ t ρ
    T t (1− γ 0 )+(1− σ t ρ T t )(1− γ 1 ) , σ t ρ T t γ 0 σ t ρ T t γ 0 +(1− σ t
    ρ T t ) γ 1 , if   o T =ACK; if   o T =NACK. (4) View Source PU detection cannot
    be guaranteed 100 percent through sensing. Therefore, sensing error is included
    in (3). P d and P f are the detection and the false alarm probabilities, respectively.
    Similarly, successful SU transmission is based on the fact that the channel must
    remain idle for the duration of transmission and ACK is received at the SU transmitter,
    which is dependent on γ 0 and γ 1 , respectively. SECTION 4 Priority-Based Dynamic
    Channel Reservation Scheme In this section, we propose a priority-based dynamic
    channel reservation scheme that is based on queuing analysis and the SU calls
    arrival rate estimation. Priority-Based Dynamic Channel Reservation Scheme. The
    radio resource management module in CR-IoT networks ensures efficient utilization
    of licensed channels while guaranteeing the required QoS to various type of SUs
    in accordance with their traffic profiles. Therefore, in a non-QoS adaptive CR-IoT
    network environment, where spectrum channels are time and PU activity dependent,
    it is crucial to give the higher-priority to more important classes of traffic
    calls. Thus, we exploit a QoS-provisioning-based dynamic channel reservation scheme
    for QoS adaptive CR-IoT networks for reducing the call-blocking probability of
    higher-priority CR-IoT calls and ensuring efficient utilization of licensed channels.
    In this scheme, the number of total licensed channels available to accept the
    SU traffic call of any priority-class p changes with the variation in call arrival
    rates; this concept is shown in Fig. 2. We consider P different SU traffic priority-classes,
    where λ p represents the arrival rate of calls with priority class p . The total
    arrival rate of all SU traffic calls is as follows: λ T = ∑ i=1 P λ i . (5) View
    Source N represents the number of total licensed channels in the vicinity of the
    SBS from which K channels are available to an SBS at time t for SU reservation.
    The number of reserved channels for priority class p is computed as follows: Y
    p (t)= λ p λ T ×K, p=1,…,P. (6) View Source Hence, K can be alternatively represented
    as follows: K= ∑ i=1 P Y i (t). (7) View Source Consequently, the total number
    of accessible channels for the p th priority class from K vacant channels is calculated
    as below: K p =⌊ ∑ i=p P Y i (t)⌋, (8) View Source Fig. 2. System model for traffic-aware
    dynamic channel reservation for CR-enabled IoT network. Show All In the proposed
    scheme, if the priority of the SU traffic is high, then it is allocated a greater
    number of licensed channels to minimize its call-blocking probability. However,
    a traffic call of any priority class p is only accepted if reserved channels for
    that class are not already occupied. Moreover, we use a queuing analysis model
    to compute the SU call-blocking probability with the help of traffic arrival estimation
    of SUs. Queuing Analysis Using Markov Model. The SBS calculates the number of
    accessible channels for any priority class p based on its traffic arrival rate.
    The traffic queue of the SBS is modeled as M/M/K/K queuing system [43], which
    we analyzed based the Markov chain method. The SBS blocks any traffic call of
    priority p when the request''s queue is in the K p state. The SU of any priority
    class p can hold an allocated channel only for the duration 1 ω p . The probability
    that the scheduler queue is in state i is denoted by β i and is computed as follows[45]:
    ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ i β i ω= λ T β i−1 , i β i ω=( λ T − λ P ) β
    i−1 , i β i ω=( λ T − ∑ P j=p λ j ) β i−1 , i β i ω=( λ 1 + λ 2 ) β i−1 , i β
    i ω= λ 1 β i−1 , 0≤i≤ K P , K P <i≤ K P−1 , K p <i≤ K p−1 , K 3 <i≤ K 2 , K 2
    <i≤ K 1 . (9) View Source Thus, any new highest-priority SU call will only be
    blocked if all the available channels (i.e., K 1 ) are already occupied. The call
    blocking probability η 1 of priority class 1 SUs can be computed by using queuing
    analysis as follows: η 1 = β 1 = λ K P T ω K K! β 0 ∏ j=1 P−1 ∑ i=1 P−j ( λ i
    ) K (P−j) − K (P−j+1) , p=1. (10) View Source Similarly, the call-blocking probability
    of priority classes 2 and higher is as below: η p = ∑ i= K p K β i = η p−1 + β
    0 ∑ i= K p K (p−1) −1 λ K P T ω i i! ∑ i=1 p−1 ( λ i ) i−( K p ) ∏ j=p M−1 ∑ i=1
    j ( λ 1 ) ( K j )−( K (j+1) ) , 2≤p≤P, (11) View Source where β 0 is given [45]
    as β 0 =[(1+ ∑ i=1 K P λ i T ω i i! + ∑ j=2 P ∑ k= K j +1 K j −1 ( λ K P T ∑ j−1
    i=1 ( λ i ) k− K j ω k k! ∏ l=j P−1 ∑ i=1 l ( λ i ) ( K l )−( K (l+1) ) ) ] −1
    . (12) View Source Interestingly, we observe that the proposed Markov chain model
    can be effectively applied for any number of priority classes for queuing analysis.
    Arrival Rate Estimation of SU Calls.To estimate the call arrival rate, we observe
    the last n+1 calls of all priority classes and measure the inter-arrival time
    Δ t p i between two successive calls, (i−1) and i , of any priority class p .
    Hence, to calculate the average inter-arrival time denoted by Δ t p ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ , between two successive calls, we take n samples of each priority class
    and compute Δ t p ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ as follows: Δ t p ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ = 1 n ∑ i=1
    n Δ t p i . (13) View Source For unbiased estimation, we take the expectation
    with respect to Δ t p ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ , given in [44] as follows: E[ Δ t p ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ]=E[ 1 n ∑ i=1 n Δ t p i ]=Δ t p , (14) View Source where Δ t p denotes
    the true value and proves that the Δ t p ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ is an unbiased estimation.
    Thus, the average call arrival rate of priority class p , λ p , is computed based
    on the last n+1 observations as follows: λ p = 1 Δ t p ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ = 1 1 n
    ∑ n i=1 Δ t p i . (15) View Source Therefore, λ p is an unbiased estimation that
    helps in estimating the arrival rate of priority class p traffic calls. SECTION
    5 SU Call Admission and Channel Allocation Schemes This section first describes
    our proposed priority-based SU call admission and channel assignment scheme. It
    then presents the performance analysis of our proposed scheme and compared it
    with the proposed greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes. 5.1 Priority-Based
    SU Call Admission and Channel Allocation Scheme In the proposed priority-based
    SU call admission and channel allocation scheme, the SBS will admit and assign
    the channel to the SU based on its priority class and the corresponding number
    of reserve channels. To provide a certain QoS level to SU calls according to their
    traffic profile, we employ two mechanisms in the SBS: 1) SU resource allocation
    and admission control, and 2) scheduling, as depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Call
    admission control and resource allocation architecture for CR-IoT networks. Show
    All SUs’ Resource Allocation and Admission Control. Upon arrival of a new SU call
    request of priority class p , the resource allocation module computes the number
    of channels to be reserved for this priority class to ensure its QoS; then, based
    on the reserved resources, the admission control module decides whether to accept
    this new SU call request or reject it. The SBS establishes a buffer, for each
    admitted SU, if required. Moreover, the resource allocation module also estimates
    the channel availability and pools the idle detected channels. Thus, Algorithm
    1 lies in the resource allocation module. Algorithm 1. Primary Channel Estimation
    Procedure input : Global channel set N output : Sorted Set of available channel
    K 1 Initialize channel list with K← null 2 for C h i ←1 to N do 3 /* Estimate
    C h i using Eq. (3)*/ 4 if C h i is Idle then 5 Add C h i to the list of available
    channels K 6 else 7 Ignore C h i 8 for C h i ←1 to K do 9 /* Sort C h i based
    on PU idle probability using Eq. (2)*/ Scheduling. The scheduler schedules the
    admitted SU m over its allocated channel k for the duration 1 ω p . Moreover,
    when a PU arrives on any SU-allocated channel k , the scheduler immediately stops
    the transmission of the SU that was using channel k and finds an alternative channel
    from the list of its accessible channels to reschedule it. If no channel is found,
    the SBS puts the suspended SU into the waiting queue. The SUs appended in the
    waiting queue have higher-priority for being assigned a channel based on their
    priority class when a channel is available to the SBS. Because the PU has the
    highest priority, therefore, when a PU is detected, its corresponding channel
    will be vacated immediately, and the SBS terminates the respective SU. Algorithm
    1 illustrates a concise procedure for maintaining a pool of K idle detected licensed
    channels. Algorithm 2 explains the procedure for the priority-based SU call admission
    and channel allocation method. Algorithm 1 (Primary Channel Estimation Procedure).
    First, the SBS evaluates/estimates all of the licensed channels and identifies
    idle channels (lines 2–3). If a channel is found to be idle, it should be pooled
    into the set of available channels (lines 4–5); otherwise, it is ignored (lines
    6–7). Finally, all the detected idle channels are sorted based on their corresponding
    PU idle probabilities (lines 8–9). Thus, the final set of K available channels
    is sorted, where (1≤K≤N) . Algorithm 2. Priority-Based Call Admission and Channel
    Allocation Procedure input : Available channel set K and total priority classes

    12 Stop immediately S U m p and find some alternative channel 13 if O c p < K
    p then 14 Reallocate channel C h k 15 update residual channel list O c p ←O c
    p +1 16 else 17 Drop S U m p 18 /* Append S U m p into waiting queue */ Algorithm
    2 (Priority-based Call Admission and Channel Allocation Procedure). From lines
    1–4, upon the arrival of an SU call request of any priority class p , the SBS
    estimates the traffic arrival rate λ p for each priority class. At line 5 it computes
    K p , the number of accessible channels by each priority class p . A call of priority
    class p is accepted if the number of already occupied channels, O c p , is less
    than K p (lines 6–8); otherwise, it is rejected. After the SU is admitted the
    SBS reserves the buffer for the admitted SU if required and updates the occupied
    channel index. When the SBS detects a PU arrival on any channel used by an SU,
    the SBS immediately suspends the transmission of the respective SUs and looks
    for an alternative. If an alternative channel is found, the SBS reschedules the
    suspended SU; otherwise, it is dropped and appended to the waiting queue (lines
    11–18). 5.2 Greedy Non-Priority SU Call Admission and Channel Allocation Scheme
    In this section, we discuss our proposed greedy non-priority admission and channel
    allocation scheme. The greedy non-priority call admission and channel allocation
    scheme admits the SU on the basis of First-In, First-Out (FIFO). This scheme does
    not consider the priorities of the arriving SUs. Algorithm 3 represents the concise
    procedures for greedy non-priority call admission and channel allocation for SUs.
    However, similar to Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3 also relies on Algorithm 1 for idle
    channel identification. Algorithm 3. Greedy Non-Priority Based Call Admission
    and Channel Allocation Procedure input : Set of available channels K output :
    Channel allocation to SU 1 for m←1 to M do 2 if !Empty(K) then 3 Allocate C h

    if PU Detection on C h k == True then 8 Stop immediately S U m and find some alternative
    channel 9 if !Empty(K) then 10 Reallocate channel C h k and update residual channel
    list K←K−1 11 else 12 /* Drop S U m */ Algorithm 3 (Greedy Non-priority-Based
    Call Admission and Channel Allocation Procedure). The SBS accepts the incoming
    SU connection requests based on the total available channel resources in a FIFO
    manner. If a channel is available, the SBS will admit the requesting SU m and
    allocate the available channel to that newly admitted SU; otherwise, the requesting
    SU is rejected (lines 1–6). Similar to the priority scheme, the SBS immediately
    suspends the ongoing transmission of an SU in case a PU arrival is detected on
    the any channel. If an alternative channel is available, the SBS reschedules the
    suspended SU; otherwise, it drops it (lines 7–12). 5.3 Fair Proportion-Based SU
    Call Admission and Channel Allocation Scheme In this section, we discuss our proposed
    fair proportion SU admission and channel allocation scheme. The fair proportion
    scheme reserves an equal number of channels for each priority class p based on
    the total number of priority classes. Algorithm 4 also relies on Algorithm 1 for
    channel estimation and pooling of the available K channels. Algorithm 4 (Fair
    Proportion Call Admission and Channel Allocation Procedure). First, the SBS computes
    an equal number of channels for all priority classes based on the fair proportion
    (line 1). The SBS admits the requesting SU connection based on the available channels
    reserved for that SU priority class. If any channel is available for requesting
    SUs, then the SBS admits the requesting SU call; otherwise, the SBS rejects it
    (lines 2–8). Similar to the other two approaches, in this approach, the SBS also
    immediately suspends the ongoing transmission of the SU in case a PU arrival is
    detected on the same channel and reschedules the suspended SU if any alternative
    channels are available for that SU based on its priority class; otherwise, the
    SBS drops it (lines 9–14). Algorithm 4. Fair Proportion Call Admission and Channel
    Allocation Procedure input : Available channel set K and total priority classes
    P output : Channel allocation to SU 1 F P p = K ∑ P i=1 i 2 if Call request of
    priority class p S U m p is arrived then 3 if O c p <F P p then 4 Accept S U m

    list O c p ←O c p +1 7 else 8 Reject S U m p 9 if PU Detection on C h k == True
    then 10 Stop immediately S U m p and find some alternative channel 11 if O c p
    <F P p then 12 Reallocate channel C h k and update residual channel list O c p
    ←O c p +1 13 else 14 /* Drop S U m p */ 5.4 Complexity Analysis In this section,
    we analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithms. Algorithm 1. The time complexity
    from lines 2–7 is ∑ N i=1 C o = C o ×N , and the complexity from lines 8–9 is
    K 2 according to the selection sort algorithm. Thus, the total time complexity
    of Algorithm 1 is calculated as follows: ∑ i=1 N C o + K 2 = C o ×N+ K 2 , (16)
    View Source where C o is a constant that denotes the computing cost of instructions
    from lines 3–7. Priority Scheme. In order to compute the time complexity of the
    proposed priority scheme, we first compute the time complexity of Algorithm 2.
    The time complexity of Algorithm 2 from lines 1–18 is as follows: 1+( ∑ i=1 P
    1)+ C 1 =1+P+ C 1 , (17) View Source Where, C 1 is a constant that denotes the
    computing cost of instructions from lines 6–18. Hence, the final time complexity
    of the proposed priority scheme (T C 0 ) is computed as follows: T C 0 =( C o
    ×N+ K 2 )(1+P+ C 1 ) =( C o ×N+ K 2 )+P( C o ×N+ K 2 )+ C 1 ( C o ×N+ K 2 ). (18)
    View Source We are only interested in computing the worst-case complexity. Therefore,
    we exclude the least significant terms and only count the most significant terms,
    those mainly contribute in the worst-case time complexity of the proposed priority
    scheme. Hence, the Big O time complexity of the proposed priority scheme is O(
    K 2 ) . Greed Non-Priority Scheme. The time complexity of the greedy non-priority
    scheme is also based on the time complexity of Algorithms 3 and 1. The time complexity
    of Algorithm 3 from lines 1–12 is computed as below: ( ∑ m=1 M C 2 )+ C 3 = C
    2 ×M+ C 3 , (19) View Source where C 2 and C 3 are constants denoting the computing
    costs from lines 2–6 and lines 7–12, respectively. Thus, the Big O time complexity
    of the greedy non-priority scheme (T C 1 ) is given as below: T C 1 =( C o ×N+
    K 2 )×( C 2 ×M+ C 3 ). (20) View Source As discussed previously, for the Big O
    time complexity, the least significant values do not play a major role; therefore,
    the final time complexity of the greedy non-priority scheme is O( K 2 ) . Fair
    Proportion Scheme. The time complexity of the fair proportion scheme is also based
    on Algorithms 1 and 4. The time complexity of Algorithm 4 from lines 1–14 is a
    constant value C 4 . However, the Big O time complexity of the fair proportion
    scheme (T C 2 ) is computed as follows: T C 2 = C 4 ×( C o ×N+ K 2 ). (21) View
    Source The Big O time complexity of the fair proportion scheme is O( K 2 ) . Thus,
    the worst-case time complexity of our proposed schemes is linear. SECTION 6 Performance
    Analysis In this section, we first present our selected parameters for performance
    evaluation. We then present and discuss the simulation results. 6.1 Performance
    Evaluation Criteria We define the following metrics to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed call admission and channel allocation schemes. Call-Blocking Probability
    of SUs. A call request of any particular priority class p is blocked when all
    the reserved channels for that particular priority class p are occupied. Thus,
    the call-blocking probability of priority class p (1≤p≤P) is given by (10) and
    (11). Call-Dropping Probability of SUs. When a PU arrives with the intention of
    reusing its licensed channel, then the SU must vacate that licensed channel immediately
    and look for an alternative available channel in the list of its accessible channels
    to resume its service. If no channel remains in the list of its accessible channels,
    then the SU service will be suspended (dropped). Generally, the dropping probability
    is computed by dividing the total number of terminated SUs by the sum of the completed
    and terminated SUs [39]. The dropping probability of SUs is given as follows:
    ω D = ∑ δ( o s t ), i o s t =0, o s t ∈S ∑ K P j=1 (K− K P ) λ j π o s t ∑ P i=1
    (1− η i ) λ i , (22) View Source where i o s t ∈{idle,busy} represents the sensing
    observation state of channel i at time t , π o s t is its steady state probability,
    and δ( o s t ) is the conditional limitation for the given state S( 1 o s t ,
    2 o s t ,…, K o s t ) , which follows K <  K P . K− K P represents the number
    of dropped SUs under K< K P . Thus, the call-dropping probability of priority
    class p is as follows: ω D p = ∑ δ(S), i o s t =0, o s t ∈S ∑ K p j=1 ϕ(p) λ j
    π o s t (1− η p ) λ p ,∀p, (23) View Source where ϕ(p) is the number of dropped
    SUs of priority class p of state S when PUs arrive. Total Channel Utilization.
    Radio spectrum is a scarce resource; therefore, its efficient utilization is an
    important performance parameter. In the proposed scheme, we reserve a specific
    number of channels for each priority class to minimize its call-blocking probability.
    Thus, the total channel utilization U is measured as the ratio of the total number
    of channels assigned to SUs to the total number of available channels, which is
    computed as follows: U= Λ S K , (24) View Source where Λ S and K denote the number
    of total SUs admitted (i.e., assigned channels for their services) and the number
    of total available channels, respectively. Similarly, the channel utilization
    by any priority class p is measured as the ratio of the total number of channels
    assigned to the SUs of priority class p and the total number of channels reserved
    for that priority class, which is computed as below: U p = Λ S p K p , (25) View
    Source where Λ S p and K p represent the number of total SUs of priority class
    p assigned to the channel for their service and the number of total channels reserved
    for priority class p , respectively. Throughput of SUs. In CR-IoT networks, the
    PU arrival affects the ongoing SU, as upon the arrival of a PU, the SU has to
    vacate the channel immediately and look for some other available channel from
    the list of its accessible channels to complete its service. Thus, the overall
    throughput of CR-IoT network, denoted by Ω , is measured as the average of the
    successful SU services per second, given below: Ω= ∑ j=1, o s t ∈S P ε j π o s
    t , (26) View Source where π o s t and ε j denote the steady state probability
    and the transition rate, respectively. Similarly, the throughput of priority class
    p SU, denoted by Ω p , is measured as the total number of successful SUs of priority
    class p per unit time (i.e., second), given as Ω p = ∑ o s t ∈S ε p π o s t .

    evaluation of the proposed priority-based SU call admission and channel allocation
    scheme with the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes. The performance
    of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of the SU call-blocking probability,
    the SU call-dropping probability, channel utilization, and throughput. We consider
    a CR-IoT-based cellular network, in which an SBS is responsible for spectrum sensing
    based on the knowledge of the PUs’ activity, such as PUs’ traffic patterns, spectrum
    access decision, CAC, and channel allocation. The SBS receives heterogeneous multimedia
    SU call requests. We divide all the SU call requests into four different classes
    based on their importance and criticality. Table 2 presents the details of the
    different priority classes for SU call requests. According to our traffic assumptions,
    presented in Section 2.2, every SU call arrival process follows a Poisson distribution
    with an exponentially distributed call holding time, which is 120 s on average.
    The availability of the number of licensed channels is dependent on the PU activity.
    TABLE 2 Priority Classes Hence, we assume that on average 16 licensed channels
    are available to the SBS at any time t for SU reservation. Similar channel availability
    assumptions were made in various previous works in the literature (e.g., [46],
    [47], [48], [49]. Moreover, our channel reservation scheme is dynamic and can
    adapt to any number of available channels. For the SU call arrival rate estimation,
    we use a total of 100 samples for each priority class. In order to fully analyze
    the performance of the proposed schemes from different aspects, we evaluate our
    performance metrics presented in Section 6.1 as follows: First, we analyze the
    performance of the proposed schemes in terms of SUs’ call-blocking probability
    and total channel utilization under three different call arrival ratios: 1) equal
    call arrival rates of all four priority classes, 2) high arrival rates of higher-priority
    class calls, and 3) high arrival rates of lower-priority class calls. Second,
    we analyze the performance of the proposed schemes in terms of SUs’ call-dropping
    probability and throughput under an increased rate of PUs and SUs. However, in
    these two cases, the arrival ratios of all priority classes are equal. Figs. 4a,
    4b, and 4c compares the SU call-blocking probability for the priority scheme with
    the greedy non-priority and the fair proportion schemes under three different
    calls arrival ratios such as (2:2:2:2), (4:3:2:1), and (1:2:3:4). Fig. 4a demonstrates
    that the proposed priority scheme provides a very low SU call-blocking probability
    for higher-priority classes under a light and equal traffic load. Our design,
    which relies on the arrival rate estimation and the maximum number of available
    channels for priority class p ( K p ), can help higher-priority SUs experience
    a better blocking/dropping probability. First, when a call of any priority class
    p arrives, the SBS estimates the call arrival rates of all the priority classes
    and calculates K p . If the number of already occupied channels is less than K
    p , the arrived call of priority class p is accepted. A call of priority class
    p is blocked or rejected if the state of the system calls is greater than or equal
    to K p . Thus, K P and K 1 denote the number of total channels available for the
    lowest and highest-priority classes P and 1, respectively. The priority class
    1 SU calls are blocked only when all available channels K 1 are already occupied.
    This concept is illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 4. Call-blocking probability for equal
    and unequal arrival rates: Priority scheme versus non-priority and fair proportion
    schemes. Show All The greedy non-priority scheme results in a high call-blocking
    probability for the higher-priority class calls. Moreover, the greedy non-priority
    scheme does not guarantee QoS in terms of the call-blocking probability. Similarly,
    the call-blocking probability for higher-priority SU calls is also high in the
    fair proportion scheme due to its static channel allocation mechanism. However,
    the fair proportion scheme provides a certain QoS level to all the priority classes
    by reserving a fix and an equal number of channels for all priority classes. Similarly,
    Fig. 4b demonstrates the higher-priority SU calls blocking probability values
    in a special scenario when a greater number of higher-priority calls arrive. The
    proposed priority scheme only blocks a slightly greater number of calls of the
    lower-priority class to reduce the call-blocking probability of the higher-priority
    class. However, the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes result in
    a very high call-blocking probability for the higher-priority SU calls. Fig. 4c
    presents the higher-priority SU call-blocking probability values in a particular
    scenario when a fewer number of higher-priority SU calls arrive. In this special
    scenario, there are a slightly greater number of licensed channels available for
    lower-priority SU calls. Therefore, the proposed priority scheme only blocks a
    very few number of lower-priority SU calls, and consequently, the lower-priority
    SUs experience better blocking probability values. Under such scenario, the greedy
    non-priority and fair proportion schemes result in high call-blocking probabilities
    for the higher-priority SU calls. Fig. 5a compares the proposed priority, greedy
    non-priority, and fair proportion schemes in terms of call-dropping probability
    for the higher-priority SUs under an increased rate of PUs. The arrival ratios
    of all priority classes are equal. This figure shows that the priority class 1
    has a better call-dropping performance, and the dropping probability of the priority
    class 4 is the highest. This is because all four priority classes can access a
    different number of channels, so that priority class 1 can access the highest
    number of channels, and priority class 4 can access only the fewest number of
    channels. When PUs interrupt the priority class 1 SUs, the SUs try to find alternative
    channels to reschedule their affected connections. If they fail to find alternative
    channels, then the dropping probability of SUs of priority class 1 also increases,
    as shown in Fig. 5a. However, they have more options to reschedule their affected
    connections than the priority class 4 SUs, which have very limited options to
    reschedule their affected connections. Consequently, the dropping probability
    of priority class 4 SUs is higher than that of priority class 1. Fig. 5. Call-dropping
    probability: Priority scheme versus non-priority and fair proportion schemes.
    Show All The greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes result in high call-dropping
    probabilities for the higher-priority SU calls due to their greedy and fixed natures,
    respectively. Similarly, Fig. 5b shows the comparison in terms of the call-dropping
    probability of all three schemes under an increased rate of SUs with equal call
    arrival ratios for all priority classes. The figure shows that with an increased
    rate of SUs, their call-dropping probability decreases. This is because the high
    arrival rate of SUs leads to a low rate of accepted calls due to the limited number
    of accessible channels for each priority class. We defined the SU call-dropping
    probability as the number of dropped SU calls divided by the number of accepted
    SU calls. The SUs’ dropping probability decreases as the number of accepted SU
    calls increases. We found that priority class 1 has the lowest call-dropping probability,
    and priority class 4 has the highest call-dropping probability. This is because
    each priority class has its own number of accessible channels. Priority class
    1 has a higher number of accessible channels, while priority class 4 has a lower
    number of accessible channels. The priority class 1 SUs achieve the best performance
    in terms of the call-dropping probability under increased rates of both PUs and
    SUs, which guarantees a better QoS. Figs. 6a and 6b shows the total throughput
    of all three schemes under an increased rate of PUs and SUs, respectively. Similarly,
    Figs. 7a and 7b shows the throughput of individual priority classes for the priority
    scheme under the same environment. The higher the arrival rate of the PUs, the
    higher the probability that the licensed channel is busy. Therefore, a higher
    SU call-dropping probability and fewer fully completed SU services result in a
    lower SU throughput. Fig. 6a shows that with an increase in the PU arrival rate,
    the total throughput of the SUs decreases. Fig. 6b shows that with an increase
    in SU call arrivals, the SU throughput increases under conditions of constant
    PU arrivals. This is due to the fact that a greater number of arrivals causes
    a greater number of SU call admissions and, consequently, a higher probability
    of successful SU call completions. Fig. 6. Throughput of priority, non-priority,
    and fair proportion schemes. Show All Fig. 7. Throughput of individual SU priority
    classes for the priority scheme. Show All Figs. 7a and 7b presents the throughput
    of each individual SU priority class under an increased rate of PUs and SUs for
    the priority scheme. Fig. 7a shows that an increased rate of PUs, the call-blocking
    probability of all priority classes is affected; however, due to the higher-priority
    of class 1, the SUs belongings to priority class 1 have more opportunities to
    access the available channels and to be rescheduled to complete their services.
    As the priority class 1 SUs have permission to access almost all of the available
    channels, their throughput is not effected much. However, priority class 4 has
    lower priority and can access only very few channels. Moreover, if their calls
    are dropped, they have very few opportunities to gain access to the channel again.
    Therefore, their throughput seriously affected. Similarly, Fig. 7b shows that
    with the increased rate of SUs, priority class 1 achieves a higher throughput,
    and lower-priority classes achieve a lower throughput. Figs. 8a and 8b presents
    a comparison of SU channel utilization for all three schemes under an equal call
    arrival ratio for all priority classes and a higher call arrival ratio of higher-priority
    classes (e.g., [2:2:2:2] and [4:3:2:1]). These figures show that the proposed
    priority scheme performs well and improves the channel utilization significantly.
    Moreover, it significantly reduces higher-priority class SUs’ call-blocking and
    call-dropping probabilities with the help of the dynamic channel reservation method.
    The priority scheme increases the number of reserved channels for the higher-priority
    class if the arrival rate of that class increases. However, if the call arrival
    rate of the higher-priority class SU calls is low compared to that of the lower-priority
    classes of SU calls, then the priority scheme reserves fewer channels for the
    higher-priority class of SUs and maintains efficient channel utilization. It is
    clear from the figures that the greedy non-priority scheme is outperformed, because
    it admits and assigns available channels to the first incoming SU of any priority
    class; therefore, this scheme does not guarantee QoS. The performance of the fair
    proportion scheme is better under equal call arrival ratios, but it does not perform
    well under different call arrival ratios of different priority classes, and it
    also causes channel underutilization due to its fixed and static channel reservation
    method. Fig. 8. SU channel utilization. Show All SECTION 7 Applications Among
    the variety of wireless multimedia applications, a few traffic classes are more
    important than others. However, if all the traffic classes are considered equal
    in priority under a heavy traffic load and dynamic channel availability, then
    there is a high blocking rate of more important traffic calls, resulting in low-performance
    CR-IoT networks. Therefore, the priority of all of the traffic classes is not
    as equal due to their corresponding traffic profile and QoS requirements. Thus,
    the proposed priority-based call admission and channel allocation scheme can be
    directly applied in future for real implementation of the SBS that will provide
    heterogeneous wireless applications and services to cellular CR-IoT networks.
    Similarly, the proposed study can also be successfully applied to other emerging
    communication systems where resources are allocated to multiple traffic classes
    based on their traffic profiles. A few of the promising application areas are
    as follows. CR-IoT-Based Smart Vehicular Networks. This is an emerging communication
    paradigm that is promising for providing various types of multimedia applications
    and services for safe driving, mobile health, and entertainment. Hence, the CR-IoT
    paradigm is of great significance for smart vehicular networks. CR-IoT-Based Smart
    Grid. This term represents the next-generation power grid, which is considered
    a promising technology for providing a multi-class of applications and services,
    such as fault diagnosis, remote home and industry monitoring, equipment and remote
    customer site monitoring, and automatic meter reading. Thus, there is a vital
    need for CR-IoT in the smart grid. CR-IoT-Based Smart Cities. The CR-IoT-based
    smart city is an urban development paradigm that integrates CR-IoT with information
    and communication technology systems. The key objective of the CR-IoT-based smart
    city is to provide e-services, such as smart traffic management, intelligent energy
    management, home automation, mobile healthcare, medical aids, elderly assistance,
    smart gym, smart parks, and smart parking systems and playgrounds to all of its
    inhabitants for their improved quality of life in an eco-friendly style. However,
    in order to provide this facility, continuous connectivity is necessary, which
    is provided through CR-IoT. Moreover, CR-IoT technology plays a key role in user
    interaction and data gathering in smart cities. SECTION 8 Conclusion This paper
    introduced a linear time traffic-aware priority-based call admission and channel
    allocation scheme for cognitive radio-enabled Internet of Things (CR-IoT) by using
    the dynamic channel reservation method. First, we estimate the availability of
    each licensed channel based on its PU activity (e.g., traffic patterns) for optimized
    and guaranteed CR-IoT transmissions. Second, for minimizing the call-blocking
    probability of higher-priority traffic and efficient channel utilization, we divided
    the entire IoT traffic into different priority classes based on their QoS requirements
    in terms of priority and reserved a dynamic number of licensed channels for each
    priority class on the basis of its real-time traffic estimation. Finally, all
    three proposed schemes are evaluated in terms of the call-blocking probability,
    call-dropping probability, channel utilization, and throughput. Simulation results
    show that the proposed priority scheme outperforms the proposed greedy non-priority
    and fair proportion schemes. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by National

    Abstract: The problem of cooperative spectrum leasing to unlicensed Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices is studied to account for potential selfish behavior of these
    devices. A distributed game theoretic framework for spectrum leasing is proposed
    where the licensed users can willingly lease a portion of their spectrum access
    to unlicensed IoT devices, and in return the IoT devices provide cooperative services,
    firstly to enhance information secrecy of licensed users via adding intentional
    jamming to protect them from potential eavesdroppers, and secondly to enhance
    the quality of communication through cooperative relaying. The cooperative behavior
    of the potentially selfish IoT devices is monitored using a reputation-based mechanism
    to enable the primary users to only interact with the reliable IoT devices. The
    simulation results show that using the proposed reputation-based method enhances
    the secrecy rate of the primary users by reducing the possibility of attacks from
    selfish IoT devices. Hence, this model can offer a practical solution for spectrum
    leasing with mobile IoT devices when assuring the required quality of communication
    and information secrecy for the spectrum owners 1 . Published in: IEEE INFOCOM

    HI, USA SECTION I. Introduction Development of new wireless communication technologies
    and skyrocketing demand for new data services, in particular growing Internet
    of Things (IoT) with potentially billions of wireless devices, motivated many
    dynamic spectrum allocation technologies to enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency.
    While current research efforts focus on common spectrum sharing mechanisms where
    the licensed users are unaware of unlicensed users'' presence (e.g. database control
    and spectrum sensing mechanisms), these methods may not be the best choice for
    spectrum sharing with IoT devices. Energy constraint and limited spectrum mobility
    at these often tiny devices restrict their performance in spectrum sensing mechanisms.
    Moreover, having a central controller or enabler to keep a record of licensed
    users'' spectrum usage and allowable interference range as required in database
    control technologies (e.g. TV White Spaces) may not be practical in such large-scale
    IoT networks. Another drawback of the majority of common spectrum sharing models
    is their overly conservative approach to protect the incumbent users against malicious
    and selfish unlicensed entities. Hence, such approaches that enforce a low level
    of transmission power for unlicensed users, or allocate a wide and static protection
    zone around the incumbents, are unable to address the increasing demand for radio
    spectrum from IoT networks. Furthermore, in common model paradigm, the licensed
    users do not usually benefit from allowing the unlicensed users to share their
    spectrum, but even they can suffer due to interference from Secondary Users (SUs).
    That being said, flexible spectrum right models in which the Primary Users (PUs)
    can willingly lease a portion of their spectrum access to unlicensed users (e.g.
    IoT devices) in exchange for remuneration or some sort of compensation (e.g. energy
    harvesting or cooperative relaying service) can offer a win-win solution for both
    parties [1]–[6]. However, one main concern toward enabling shared access techniques
    to the radio spectrum, particularly the federal bands, is security. In addition
    to traditional security threats in wireless networks such as concerns related
    to privacy of the users, authentication, and confidentiality of communications
    among the users in the presence of eavesdroppers, networks with dynamic spectrum
    allocation mechanism are also vulnerable to unauthorized access to the spectrum
    as well as potential selfish behavior of users taking advantage of the ad hoc
    nature of such networks [7]–[9]. Therefore, the cognitive radio networks are prone
    to suffer from various exogenous, malicious, and selfish attacks. Some of these
    attacks are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to deny the unlicensed users from
    spectrum access, sensing data falsification attacks, and primary user emulation
    attacks, only to name a few [10], [11]. Different security mechanisms have been
    proposed to address these attacks, which among these information theoretic secrecy
    methods aim to secure the communication of the nodes from potential eavesdroppers
    by exploiting the physical characteristics of wireless channels [12]. This can
    be achieved by adding artificial noise, using beamforming techniques, or employing
    MIMO techniques [13], [14]. Despite conventional cryptographic methods, information
    theoretic secrecy-based techniques do not rely on encryption keys, and hence do
    not involve key distribution and key management complexities. Cooperative jamming
    in cognitive radio networks has been implemented by employing the SUs to create
    artificial noise [15], or transmit structured codewords to reduce the eavesdropper''s
    capability in decoding the PU''s information. The potentially non-cooperative
    SUs can be encouraged to provide such a service if they are granted with a chance
    of spectrum access for their own transmission, as introduced in [15]. Providing
    cooperative jamming for the primary users, in addition to other previously studied
    compensation techniques such as cooperative relaying and energy harvesting, can
    offer a practical solution for implementation of property-right cognitive radio
    networks without involving money exchange among the parties or other regulatory
    issues [15]. In [14], a Stackelberg game model is defined to model the interactions
    between a legitimate source node and a non-altruistic secondary user in presence
    of an eavesdropper. The secondary user can be compensated with a fraction of the
    legitimate source node''s access time to radio spectrum if it provides cooperative
    jamming to enhance the secrecy rate of the source node. This model is further
    extended to a scenario with multiple potential cooperative jammers where the competition
    among them is modeled as an inner Vickrey auction. The proposed model [14] favors
    the primary user by defining the game in such a way that the time allocation to
    access the spectrum as well as the ratio of the power, which the secondary users
    spend on cooperative jamming and the one they utilize for their own transmission,
    are determined by the primary user. Although the primary user deserves more benefits
    as the spectrum owner, in reality there is no guarantee that the secondary users
    will follow the power allocation ratio requested by the primary user after being
    granted with spectrum access. The authors in [16] study a similar model with the
    objective of enhancing the secrecy rate of both the primary and secondary nodes,
    where the secondary nodes are assumed to be fully trustable. While cooperative
    jamming provided by the SUs can potentially enhance the secrecy rate of the licensed
    users, it involves the assumption of having unconditionally cooperative and trustable
    SUs, as considered in the majority of previously reported studies [14]–[17]. However,
    this assumption is far too optimistic in communication networks, noting the nonaltruistic
    nature of cognitive secondary users (e.g. IoT devices). This frequent assumption
    has been revisited in some work considering different aspects of potential selfish
    or malicious behavior by SUs. The authors in [18], [19] discussed a scenario where
    the relay nodes can potentially act as eavesdroppers and study whether cooperation
    can still improve the secrecy. In this paper, we consider a scenario where the
    secondary users can be selfish but not malicious and propose a reputation-based
    mechanism to identify the untrustable users. It is assumed that the SUs are pre-authenticated
    and the problem of dealing with authenticating intruding/malicious secondary nodes
    is out of the scope of this work. In the majority of previously proposed reputation-based
    methods to enforce cooperation, the users (e.g. relay nodes) self-report their
    reputation [20], [21]. Therefore, such methods are prone to the security and reliability
    of communication channels to report these reputations. Another vulnerability of
    such methods is the possibility of reporting false reputations by selfish/malicious
    nodes that requires an audit unit to identify such misbehaving users [22], [23].
    Also, authors in [24] proposed a weighted cooperative spectrum sensing framework
    for infrastructure-based networks which requires a base station to receive reports
    and updates from secondary users. But, our model does not need any base station,
    so it is compatible with any infrastructureless or ad hoc networks. In [25], a
    reputation-based secure method is proposed for distributed networks that involves
    a heavy overhead for update messages from neighbor nodes. However, in our proposed
    model, the reputation of the potential relay nodes is directly observed by the
    source node (e.g. primary node), hence it can prevent the impact of false reports.
    If such a first-hand reputation of a relay node was not available to a primary
    user, it can inquire this reputation from other primary users in the neighborhood
    (second-hand reputation) as further explained in Section III. Fig. 1. An example
    of spectrum leasing to secondary iot devices in exchange for cooperative jamming
    and cooperative relaying. In this example, S T 4 is the selected trustable secondary
    iot. Show All Let us consider the problem of spectrum leasing to secondary IoT
    devices in the presence of a passive eavesdropper, in which these IoT devices
    provide cooperative relaying and cooperative jamming services to enhance the secrecy
    rate and quality of service of the primary user in exchange for spectrum access.
    Since the IoT devices often have a limited energy, the natural tendency of such
    non-altruistic users can often lead to selfish attacks where they violate their
    commitments to the primary users after they are granted the spectrum access. In
    this paper, we propose a reputation-based method to monitor the cooperative behavior
    of these IoT SUs in terms of the power they dedicate to requested services from
    the primary user including cooperative jamming and cooperative relaying to prevent
    potential selfish behavior. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
    Section II, the system model is described. The formulation of the proposed reputation-based
    Stackelberg game is defined in Section III. The simulation results are presented
    in Section IV, followed by concluding remarks in Section V. SECTION II. System
    Model In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network consists of a single
    primary user (PU), and N secondary IoT users (SUs) who are seeking to obtain spectrum
    access. There also exists a passive malicious eavesdropper, ED , who attempts
    to decode the PU''s message, as depicted in Fig. 1. The PU''s transmitter, PT
    , intends to send a secure message to its receiver, denoted by PR . The transmitter
    and receiver of SU i are denoted by S T i , and S R i , respectively. All transmitters
    and receivers are assumed to have a single antenna. It is assumed that channels
    between the nodes are slow Rayleigh fading with constant coefficients over one
    time slot. These channel coefficients are defined as follows: i) h P S i refers
    to channel coefficients between the PU''s transmitter and i th SU''s transmitter;
    ii) h S i P , h S i , and h S i E denote the channel coefficients between i th
    SU transmitter and the PU''s receiver, the i th SU receiver, and the eavesdropper,
    respectively. We assume that there is no direct link between PT and PR . A common
    assumption of availability of Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitters
    using standard channel state estimation techniques is followed here [14]–[16].
    The noise sources at the receivers are complex and circularly symmetric, i.e.
    n∼CN(0, σ 2 ) . A constant power P P is assumed at the PU, while the maximum available
    energy for each time slot at SU i is E max i . Each time slot of PU''s access
    to the radio spectrum, T , is divided to three phases, as depicted in Fig. 2.
    During Phase I, (1−α)T , the PU broadcasts its message to the available secondary
    users. It is assumed that the eavesdropper is out of the range of direct communication
    from the PU''s transmitter.2 If the transmitted signal at PT is denoted by S ,
    the received signal at SU i th transmitter during the first phase is X ST i =
    P P − − − √ h P S i S+ n ST (1) View Source where n ST ∼CN(0, σ 2 ) denotes the
    noise at S T i . During Phase Π,αβT , the selected trustable secondary user (as
    defined in Section III) participates in cooperative relaying and jamming. If secondary
    user i is selected by the PU, it forwards the PU''s message to PR with power P
    i C , and also adds artificial noise z with power P i j to confuse the eavesdropper.
    A Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying scheme is deployed at the secondary users where
    the received message is fully decoded. We assume that a secure information transmission
    mechanism is in place where the PU''s receiver can obtain a priori knowledge of
    the added artificial noise by the secondary user [16], [26], [27]. One practical
    method to obtain this a priori knowledge of artificial noise is using a pseudo-random
    generator with finite states at the relay and legitimate primary receiver, while
    the state of the pseudorandom generator is sent to the PR via a secure control
    channel. While this mechanism only involves a small amount of overhead, it results
    in enhancing the secrecy of the PU''s transmission since the artificial noise
    creates interference at the eavesdropper but it can be fully removed at the PR
    . Hence, the received signal at PR can be written as X PR = P i C − − − √ h S
    i P S ^ + n PR (2) View Source where S ^ denotes the re-encoded signal transmitted
    by S T i after DF, and n PR ∼CN(0, σ 2 ) is noise at PR . The received message
    at the eavesdropper during Phase II is: X ED = P i C − − − √ h S i E S ^ + P i
    J − − − √ h S i E z+ n ED (3) View Source where z∼CN(0,1) is the artificial noise
    added by S T i . During Phase III, the selected secondary user transmits its own
    message to its corresponding destination with power P i S . If the transmitted
    signal by S T i is denoted S ^ i , the received signal at S R i , X S i R can
    be written as X S i R = P i S − − − √ h S i S ^ i + n S i R View Source n S i
    R∼CN(0, σ 2 ) is the noise at S R i . Fig. 2. System model of proposed spectrum
    leasing scheme between the PU and the selected trustable secondary user. Show
    All Based on this model, if the codewords at the PU are Gaussian inputs, the achievable
    secrecy rate of the primary user, R P SEC , defined as the communication rate
    at which no information is revealed to the eavesdropper can be written as R P
    SEC =[ R P − R E ] + (4) View Source where R P is the accumulated rate at the
    PU''s receiver and R E is the accumulated rate at the eavesdropper (information
    leakage), and [x ] + denotes max(x,0) . For simplicity of notation, we remove
    [. ] + sign from now on. The rate at the PU''s receiver is defined as R P =min(
    R P S i , R S i P ) noting the DF relaying scheme at the selected secondary user
    i [28], hence the secrecy rate at PR can be calculated as: R P SEC =min((1−α)T
    log 2 (1+ P P | h P S i | 2 σ 2 ), αβT log 2 (1+ P i C | h S i P | 2 σ 2 )) −αβT
    log 2 (1+ P i C | h S i E | 2 σ 2 + P i J | h S i E | 2 )) (5) View Source It
    is worth mentioning that to achieve nonzero secrecy rate for the primary user,
    the conditions of | h P S i | 2 >| h S i E | 2 ,| h S i P | 2 >| h S i E | 2 should
    be satisfied for the CSIs, where there is no direct link between the primary users
    and eavesdropper [29]. SECTION III. Proposed Reputation-Based Stackelberg Game
    Model Here, we define a Stackelberg game model to describe the interactions between
    the primary and secondary users in the proposed spectrum leasing scenario. The
    objective of the PU is to enhance its secrecy rate through utilizing the reliable
    secondary nodes while the secondary IoT users aim to obtaining the chance of spectrum
    leasing from the PU and maximize their transmission rate considering the power
    cost of cooperation with the PU. Such cost refers to the consumed power for forwarding
    the PU''s message and adding a jamming signal to it. Despite the previously reported
    works, where the SUs were forced to utilize an equal amount of power for their
    own transmission and service for the PU [14]–[16] we account for the selfish nature
    of the SU''s behavior to allocate a small portion of their power ( P i J + P i
    C ) to the PU''s requested services, in order to maximize their own transmission
    rate by having a larger remained power to themselves, ( P i S ) . It is worth
    mentioning that both services requested by the PU (jamming and relaying) occur
    during the second phase (αβT) , hence the selected SU does not benefit from changing
    the ratio of the power spent on relaying or jamming since its overall cost of
    service to the PU remains as ( P i J + P i C )αβT . Therefore, it is reasonable
    to assume that the ratio of power for jamming and relaying denoted by ρ= P i j
    P i C is requested by the PU and the selected SU has no incentive to change this
    ratio. In the proposed Stackelberg game, the PU as the spectrum owner is defined
    as the game leader to declare its strategies first, and the SUs are the game followers.
    The strategy set of the PU is to: i) select the most reliable secondary user;
    and ii) determine the optimal time allocation among the three phases, i.e parameters
    α and β . A reputation value is assigned to each SU that keeps track of their
    performance in terms of power allocation between their own transmission and requested
    services by the PU. The reputation value of each SU is monitored and maintained
    by the PU, and increases when the SU allocates enough power for cooperation and
    jamming. Let us define R k (n)=( r 1 (n),  r 2 (n), …,  r N (n)) as the reputation
    vector stored at the k th PU at time n , where r k i (n)∈(0,1] denotes the reputation
    of SU i observed by k th PU at time n for i∈{1,2, …, N} . Here, we define first-hard
    reputation and second-hand reputation based on the existence of prior interactions
    between a primary and secondary pair. If PU k has a history of direct interaction
    with candidate SU i , the first-hand reputation at time n, r k i (n) is defined
    as r k i (n)=min( r k i (n−1)+ η 3 ln( ϵ n i ),1) (6) View Source where η 3 is
    the pre-defined factor and ϵ n i is a function of power for individual transmission
    of user i , the power for requested services by the PU , and the channel conditions
    at time n , i.e. ( ϵ n i = P i J | h S i E | 2 + P i C | h S i P | 2 P i S | h
    2 | 2 ) . The reason behind considering the CSIs in this definition is to assign
    a change of reputation proportional to actual channel condition that a secondary
    user is experiencing. With this definition, the reputation of misbehaving secondary
    users declines rapidly due to the characteristic of In function while it would
    take a fairly long time to restore the reputation in case of misbehaving. This
    mechanism can potentially prevent the secondary users from oscillating between
    good behavior and misbehavior due to the long period of time required to restore
    their reputation. If a user recently moves to a proximity of a primary user or
    there does not exist a prior record of interactions between a primary and secondary
    pair, then the primary user can inquire the SU''s reputation from its neighbor.
    In these cases, the second-hand reputation is defined as r k i (n)= Σ j∈ P k i
    r j i (n) | P k i | (7) View Source where P k i is the set of primary users in
    proximity of k th PU. If a secondary user is new in the network and there is no
    prior information about its reputation, then the reputation of this unit will
    be set to the lower bound of reputation range. The utility function of secondary
    user i is defined as: U S i ( P i S , P i C , P i J )=α(1−β)Tlo g 2 (1+SN R i
    ) − η 1 α(1−β)T P i S − η 2 αβT( P i C + P i J ) +ln( P i J | h S i E | 2 + P
    i C | h S i P | 2 − P i S | h S i | 2 +1) (8) View Source where SN R i denotes
    the signal-to-noise ratio at i th SU receiver. The last term in (8) is proportional
    to the change of reputation. Therefore, decision making at secondary user i involves
    a trade-off to increase its own transmission power P i S to obtain a higher transmission
    rate; while it needs to dedicate enough power to cooperation, P ic and jamming,
    P ij to maintain a good reputation in order to be chosen for the next rounds.
    The condition related to limited energy at SU i can be written: αβT P i C +αβT
    P i J +α(1−β)T P i S ≤αT P i max (9) View Source where P i max denotes the maximum
    power available at SU i . Since these secondary IoT users are self-interested,
    they exhaust their available energy that results in β P i C +β P i J +(1−β) P
    i S = P i max . Noting this equality and the requested ratio of power for jamming
    and cooperation by the PU, ρ= P i J P i C , the utility of SU i can be written
    as a function of one of the three power strategies of this user, (e.g. P i S )
    as U S i ( P i S )=α(1−β)Tlo g 2 (1+ P i S | h s i | 2 σ 2 ) − η 1 α(1−β)T P i
    S − η 2 αβT P i max − P i S (1−β) β(1+ρ) − η 2 αβTρ P i max − P i S (1−β) β(1+ρ)
    +ln( P i J | h S i E | 2 + P i C | h S i P | 2 − P i S | h s i | 2 +1) (10) View
    Source where η 1 and η 2 are predefined normalizing coefficients for energy to
    form it similar to transmission rate. The hierarchical interactions between the
    Stakelberg game players are summarized in Fig 3. The PU''s optimum parameters
    ( α ∗ , β ∗ , k), and the corresponding power choice of the SU ( P i S ) , are
    cooperatively considered as the Stackelberg solution that can be obtained through
    a backward induction algorithm. In each iteration of the game, the selected SU
    observed the selected strategy of the PU (i.e. α,β ), and responded to this by
    selecting its optimum power allocation to maximize its utility. Fig. 3. Stackelberg
    game model. Show All Lemma 1 The utility of secondary user, (10) is concave in
    term of P i S . Proof To prove the concavity of secondary utility, the second
    derivative of (10) with respect to P i S is driven as: ∂ 2 U s ( P i S ) ∂ 2 P
    i S = −α(1−β)T ln(2) ( | h s i | 3 σ 2 ) 2 (1+ P i S | h s i | 2 σ 3 ) 2 + − A
    2 ( F i C | h S i P |+ P i J | h S i E |− P i S | h s i |+1 ) 2 <0 (11) View Source
    where A 2 is equal to (−( (1−β) β(1+ρ) )| h S i P |−(ρ (1−β) β(1+ρ) )| h S i E
    |−| h s i | ) 2 . As seen in (11), U S i is strictly concave in terms of P i S
    for given values of α , and β . Theorem 1 The Stackelberg solution of the proposed
    game is the unique Nash equilibrium. Proof During the backward induction process
    to obtain the Stackelberg solution, the strategy of the PU is selected by maximizing
    (5) as α ∗ , β ∗ =argmax R PSEC (α, β) . Then the selected SU observes this strategy
    and selects its optimum power allocation set. According to lemma 1, the utility
    of the selected SU is strictly concave in terms of P i S for any given value of
    the PU''s strategy set, therefore the response of the selected SU is unique. It
    is obvious that the proposed single-leader single-follower Stackelberg game converges
    to the obtained solution as the follower is rational and the PU can fully predict
    the optimal strategy of the selected SU. Moreover, since the strategy of each
    user is obtained through finding the best response to the strategy of the other
    one, the obtained Stackelberg solution is a Nash equilibrium. Fig. 4. Primary
    secrecy rate versus distance of eavesdropper and st Show All SECTION IV. Simulation
    Results In this section, we present the simulation results to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed reputation-based game model in enhancing the secrecy rate of the
    primary user through two scenarios. The channels between nodes i and j are obtained
    from h_{i,j}\sim CN(0,d_{i,j}^{-2}) where d_{i,j} is the distance between nodes
    i and j . The duration of one time slot, T , is assumed to be equal to 1. The
    values of \eta_{1} and \eta_{2} are set to 0.004 and 0.0005, respectively. To
    have a more strict penalization for selfish behavior of the SUs, we assume that
    \eta_{1} is higher than \eta_{2} . The variance of noise (\sigma^{2}) is equal
    to 1mw, \rho is 0.7, and the primary transmitter uses 3mw power for sending its
    packet to the secondary user, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Scenario 1:Single
    Secondary UserIn this scenario, there exists only one SU in the neighborhood of
    the PU. Fig. 4 illustrates the primary secrecy rate for different distances of
    eavesdropper with the relay. As shown in this figure, increasing the distance
    between the relay and eavesdropper results in increasing the PU''s secrecy rate.
    It also results in decreasing the jamming power of the secondary transmitter as
    the communication will be less vulnerable to the presence of the eavesdropper,
    as depicted in Fig 5. Scenario 2:Multiple Selfish and Reliable Secondary UsersIn
    this scenario, we consider 10 mobile SUs, in which 70% of them are selfish in
    the sense that they may assign all their energy to their own transmission if granted
    with the spectrum, and the rest of the SUs are fully reliable. It is assumed that
    the location of SUs changes in every time slot to evaluate the performance of
    the proposed method in a more practical scenario. The SUs are uniformly distributed
    in the neighborhood around the PU. The performance of our proposed reputation-based
    method is compared with random relay selection, and best CSI relay selection methods.
    In all three methods, Stackelberg solution is found as the solution of the mechanism.
    In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method related to existing techniques,
    we considered an extreme case where the selfish secondary nodes are closer to
    the PU compared to the reliable ones. Also, it is assumed that selfish SUs show
    selfish behavior in 20% of time slots, hence it is less likely for the PU to identify
    all selfish nodes using alternative techniques. Fig. 6 demonstrates the probability
    of selecting unreliable nodes for different selection methods. As seen in this
    figure, the best CSI-selection method, which is widely used in many relay selection
    applications, has the worst performance in this scenario because it chooses the
    nearest SUs. For random selection method, the probability of selecting the unreliable
    SUs is close to 70% and does not change over time, as expected. However, our proposed
    reputation-based model is capable of filtering the selfish users over the course
    of time. Fig. 5. Jamming power of secondary versus distance of eavesdropper Show
    All Fig. 7 shows the allocated time to cooperative services, \alpha\beta , determined
    by the PU versus the distance between the eavesdropper and selected SU. The PU
    is encouraged to assign more time to cooperative services when the cooperative
    link is less vulnerable to eavesdropping in order to enhance its quality of communication
    through relaying services provided by the SU. Fig. 6. Probability of selecting
    unreliable nodes over time Show All Fig. 7. Cooperation phase (\alpha\beta) versus
    the distance between eavesdropper and the selected SU for different values of
    \rho Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a practical solution
    for spectrum leasing to unlicensed IoT devices, in which the spectrum incumbents
    are motivated to lease their spectrum through receiving cooperative service from
    the IoT devices as well as enhancing their secrecy rate via a cooperative jamming
    mechanism. The key contribution of this model is to develop a reputation-based
    mechanism that enables the spectrum owners to monitor the behavior of potentially
    selfish IoT devices in terms of their willingness and efforts to participate in
    cooperative services. In the majority of existing spectrum sharing solutions,
    the secondary users are assumed to be fully reliable, hence the spectrum owners
    can often suffer from the selfish attacks performed with self-interested unlicensed
    users. However, our proposed spectrum leasing method gives the spectrum owners
    the possibility of only interacting with the reliable IoT devices and prevents
    the chance of degradation in quality of service due to selfish attacks, as confirmed
    by the simulation results. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF SUPPORT AND DISCLAIMER The authors

    Te Internet of Tings (IoT) is expected to oﬀer advanced\nconnectivity of devices,\
    \ systems, and services that go beyond\nmachine-to-machine communications and\
    \ covers a variety\nof protocols, domains, and applications [1, 2]. It is believed\n\
    that the IoTparadigm will have a strong impact on everyday\nlife in the future\
    \ for assisted living, automation, improved\nlearning, industrial manufacturing,\
    \ logistics, process man-\nagement, intelligent transportation of people/materials,\
    \ real-\ntime monitoring of industrial processes, e-health facilities,\nand more\
    \ [3]. Te IoT has been attracting a great deal of\nattention because of its functions\
    \ to enhance users’ everyday\nlives and behavior. However, there are still a lot\
    \ of challenges\nfor IoT applications. Te large number of IoT objects also\ncreates\
    \ massive amounts of data in a network; the crux of the\nproblem lies in how to\
    \ solve the problem of interference\nbetween diﬀerent IoTdevices. In addition,\
    \ spectrum scarcity\nis also a big issue. IoTobjects are expected to grow into\
    \ large\nnumbers, and it will be very diﬃcult to allocate spectrum\nbands to all\
    \ these objects [4]. To address the above problems,\nrecent trends in research\
    \ are shifting to cognitive radio\nnetworks (CRNs), viewing them as a potential\
    \ solution for\nIoT applications. Tus, a new paradigm of IoT networks\nbased on\
    \ the cognitive radio (CR) system has been proposed.\nCognitive radio can sense,\
    \ learn, and adapt to the sur-\nrounding environment according to inner and outer\
    \ stimuli.\nGenerally, a cognitive radio network is based on a dynamic\nspectrum\
    \ allocation procedure, and licensed primary users\n(PUs) or unlicensed secondary\
    \ users (SUs) have the right to\nshare the spectrum provided they do not cause\
    \ intense in-\nterference. Te success of the network lies in enhancing\nspectrum\
    \ and resource allocation. As mentioned before, for\nsuch a large number of IoTobjects,\
    \ the current ﬁxed spectrum\nutilization policies cannot satisfy their needs,\
    \ and result in\nineﬃcient spectrum utilization. Besides, the cost-eﬀectiveness\n\
    Hindawi\nMobile Information Systems\nVolume 2018, Article ID 4721956, 12 pages\n\
    https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4721956\nissues with spectrum assignment are not\
    \ negligible. Tus,\nCRNs are gaining popularity for addressing these situations.\
    \ In\naddition, it is strongly believed that CR-based IoTframeworks\ncan alleviate\
    \ interference by looking for interference-free\nchannels through a dynamic spectrum\
    \ access capability [5].\nMany researchers have already addressed IoT resource\
    \ allo-\ncation problems by taking advantage of the mentioned\ncharacteristics\
    \ of CRNs. Salameh et al. [6] proposed a prob-\nabilistic spectrum assignment\
    \ algorithm in time-critical IoT-\nbased CRNs under proactive jamming attacks.\
    \ Tey aimed at\nminimizing the packet invalidity ratio of each CR trans-\nmission,\
    \ subject to delay constraints. Shigueta et al. [7] pre-\nsented a strategy for\
    \ channel assignment in IoT networks,\nwhich uses opportunistic spectrum access\
    \ via CR.\nWith the increasing interest in IoT sensor applications\n(e.g., smart\
    \ cities, industrial control, security, and emergencies),\nthe huge number of\
    \ interconnected sensors coupled with the\nincreasing demand and usage of wireless\
    \ spectrum (especially\nin the industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical band) challenges\
    \ the\ndeployment of real-life IoT [8]. Because of CR’s dynamic\nspectrum allocation\
    \ policy, it can provide huge spectrum\nopportunities and improve spectrum utilization\
    \ for IoT sen-\nsors, and this capability provides the possibility of deployment\n\
    for IoTdevices. By applying CR into densely deployed wireless\ndevices (e.g.,\
    \ sensor nodes), the corresponding sensor nodes are\nconsidered SUs. Tey can simultaneously\
    \ transmit data packets\nunder diﬀerent channels and release occupied channels\
    \ to PUs\nthrough a smart handoﬀ. Terefore, this technology can reduce\nenergy\
    \ consumption suﬃciently and greatly improves the ef-\nﬁciency of transmission.\
    \ Li et al. [9] designed a transmission\nscheduling method in cognitive radio\
    \ sensor networks\n(CRSNs) with minimal occupation of channels and high\ntransmission\
    \ eﬃciency, aimed at exploring the performance of\nCRSNs in the industrial IoT.\
    \ A new system that improves\nmultichannel IoT network environments and that could\
    \ be an\nexcellent candidate for low-power cognitive IoT sensor net-\nwork applications\
    \ was proposed by Hong et al. [10].\nAs can be clearly seen from the above research,\
    \ either in\nCR-based IoT networks or in IoT sensor networks, a lot of\nresearchers\
    \ fully use CR’s characteristics of dynamic spectrum\nallocation in order to utilize\
    \ the spectrum and resources to the\nmaximum extent possible. In fact, the CRN\
    \ has been widely\nused in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Bakhsh [11] proposed\n\
    an energy-eﬃcient distributed relay selection technique for\nmultihop WSNs. Energy\
    \ consumption was reduced by selecting\na stable relay and power allocation for\
    \ collaboration. Zhu et al.\n[12] proposed a novel channel access scheme for the\
    \ problem of\nhow to access multiple channels without environment in-\nformation\
    \ on the cognitive users. In an IoT sensor network,\nsensors can be viewed as\
    \ SUs, so the problem becomes how to\nallocate spectrum resources to SUs and reduce\
    \ interference\namong them, while taking full advantage of CRN character-\nistics.\
    \ In fact, how to improve resource allocation using a dy-\nnamic allocation policy\
    \ in a CRN has always been a hot research\narea. Yang and Zhao [13] proposed a\
    \ heuristic, robust, relay\nselection scheme and formulated robust power allocation\
    \ as\na semi-inﬁnite program to maximize capacity while ensuring\nthat interference\
    \ with primary users is below a predeﬁned\ninterference threshold. Tiwari and\
    \ Saha [14] presented a particle\nswarm optimization- (PSO-) based, cochannel\
    \ interference-\nconstrained, eﬃcient, and low-complexity novel spectrum al-\n\
    location scheme with simultaneous power and network ca-\npacity optimization.\
    \ Taking into consideration the energy\nlimitations, many papers have studied\
    \ resource allocation\nschemes aimed at saving energy. For example, Denis et al.\
    \ [15]\ninvestigated the problem of SUs’ energy eﬃciency maximiza-\ntion under\
    \ secondary total power and primary interference\nconstraints. In CRNs, utilizing\
    \ resources without subjecting\nPUs to harmful interference is a crucial problem;\
    \ this means\nthat any method used to assign the resources must guarantee\nthat\
    \ PU transmissions are always prioritized.\nIn a CR wireless network, due to the\
    \ dynamic spectrum\nallocation procedure, PUs can share the spectrum with SUs;\
    \ in\nthis scenario, the success of the network lies in enhancing\nspectrum and\
    \ resource allocation. Establishing methods that\ncan eﬀectively assign resources\
    \ while also protecting PU\nperformance in CR networks is a hot topic in this\
    \ research\narea. Chabalala et al. [16] employed a Lagrangian framework to\nreformulate\
    \ the optimization problem and determine the\noptimal channel selection and power\
    \ distribution for SUs.\nBesides, more and more researchers have found that placing\n\
    the base station at an inappropriate location and/or selecting\nan incorrect channel\
    \ will increase the interference and directly\nminimize the quality of service\
    \ (QoS). Some papers have\ndiscussed minimizing power consumption by obtaining\
    \ op-\ntimal base station positions [17, 18]. Unlike previous in-\nvestigations\
    \ that accounted for positions of base stations in\norder to regulate interference,\
    \ focusing on interference\nmanagement among SUs and PUs can also play a key role\
    \ in\nresource allocation. Te positions of SUs and channel allo-\ncation in CR\
    \ systems have received a great deal of attention\nrecently. Xue et al. [19] presented\
    \ a general resource-allocation\nframework that optimizes power and channel allocation\
    \ for\nSUs; this depended on SUs being aware of their location. Tan\net al. [20]\
    \ proposed a scheduling algorithm to improve the\npriority of SUs for which bandwidths\
    \ are restricted by posi-\ntion. Ozcan and Gursoy [21] investigated channel selection\n\
    based on the lowest channel gain or the highest data channel\ngain. Khan and Yoo\
    \ [22] proposed a dynamic interference\ncontrol in OFDM-based cognitive radio\
    \ network using GA.\nEﬀective resource allocation should satisfy the diﬀerent\n\
    QoS requirements of multiple PUs and SUs without inter-\nrupting higher priority\
    \ transmissions in a CR network, re-\ngardless of power, channel spectrum, PU/SU\
    \ or base station\nposition allocation. However, little attention has been paid\
    \ to\nmethods that combine base station positioning with channel\nselection. In\
    \ fact, these two factors directly impact the overall\ninterference and performance\
    \ of a system. While placing the\nbase stations or selecting the operating channel\
    \ randomly, the\nsubsequent interference among them will increase. Addi-\ntionally,\
    \ in a wireless sensor network (WSN), the base station\nlocation is closely related\
    \ to the lifetime of the sensor network.\nIn our paper, our method derives the\
    \ optimal locations\nof secondary information gathering stations (SIGSs) and\n\
    their operating channels and can be used in IoT sensor\nnetworks, which, to the\
    \ best of our knowledge, has not been\nstudied in the literature. We also consider\
    \ the appearance\nprobability of secondary IoT devices (SIDs) that can be\n2\n\
    Mobile Information Systems\ninstalled in cars, in wearable devices or for other\
    \ monitoring\ndevices. Tis work aims to maximize the secondary IoT\nsystem capacity\
    \ while also guaranteeing an interference\nthreshold for primary users, subject\
    \ to signal to interference-\nplus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, while maximizing\
    \ the\nsupportable number of SIDs. Te contributions of our\nproposed scheme can\
    \ be summarized as follows:\n(1) We propose a scheme that combines optimal posi-\n\
    tioning of the SIGSs with selection of the optimal\nchannel, which has not been\
    \ studied in the literature.\nTis method can improve spectrum utilization and\n\
    maximize system throughout, fundamentally en-\nhancing total system performance.\
    \ Additionally, the\nscheme can be used for IoT sensor networks.\n(2) We propose\
    \ an appearance probability for the SIDs\nthat may be installed in cars and in\
    \ wearable devices\nor for other monitoring devices. Tis can facilitate\nanalysis\
    \ and reduce the complexity of the problem.\nAt the same time, our method can\
    \ also maximize the\nnumber of SIDs in service based on the probability.\n(3)\
    \ We use a PSO algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal positions\nfor SIGSs and the operating\
    \ channel; this has rela-\ntively low complexity and can eﬀectively address\n\
    problems.\nTe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section\n2, the system\
    \ model is described. In Section 3, the proposed\noptimal positions of the SIGSs\
    \ and the operating channel\nselection mechanism for IoT sensor networks are presented.\n\
    In Section 4, the PSO algorithm used to determine the\noptimal SIGS locations\
    \ and channel selection is explained. In\nSection 5, the performance of the proposed\
    \ method is\nevaluated and compared with the results of a random dis-\ntribution\
    \ case. Finally, Section 6 provides our conclusions.\n2. System Model\nTis paper\
    \ considers a scenario where multiple primary links\nand primary base station\
    \ (PBS) are receiving signals from\nPUs on the uplink channel, and SIDs are communicating\n\
    with SIGSs using primary uplink channels. In our scenario,\nwe do not know the\
    \ positions of the PUs, so we consider\nuplink channels for primary systems. We\
    \ also assume that\nsecondary systems already have information about the PBS\n\
    locations and the operating channel. In addition, they will\nuse the primary systems’\
    \ uplink channels. In our model,\nSIDs have information about the interference\
    \ they cause on\nthe primary systems, and they can directly access a part of\n\
    the licensed spectrum as long as the interference is below\na predeﬁned threshold.\n\
    As shown in Figure 1, PBSs will receive interference\nfrom SIDs, SIGSs, and other\
    \ primary systems (including\nPBSs and PUs that use the same channel as the PBS).\
    \ In\nFigure 1, the black line denotes the interference suﬀered by\nthe PBS. PUs\
    \ will receive interference from SIDs, SIGSs, and\nother primary systems that\
    \ use the same channel. Te dotted\nblack line in Figure 1 shows the interference\
    \ received by\na PU. Concerning the secondary systems, SIDs will receive\ninterference\
    \ from PBSs and PUs, as well as other secondary\nsystems (including SIGSs and\
    \ SIDs that use the same\nchannel as the initial SIDs). Similarly, SIGSs will\
    \ receive\ninterference from other SIGSs, SIDs, PBSs, and PUs that\nshare the\
    \ same channel.\nHowever, in our model, we ignore the interference from\nprimary\
    \ systems and assume that they are well controlled by\nthe primary operator; instead,\
    \ we are interested in the in-\nterference suﬀered by SIDs and PBSs. Before determining\n\
    the SIGS positions and the matched channel, we assume that\nsecondary systems\
    \ have information about the PBS positions\nand operating channel. Every base\
    \ station has its own\ncoverage range, which is calculated by the Friis transmission\n\
    equation; this will be explained in detail in the next section.\n3. Optimal Position\
    \ of the Secondary Base\nStation and the Operating Channel Selection\nMechanism\
    \ for IoT Sensor Networks\nAs shown in Figure 2, we divide the whole space into\
    \ small\nequally sized boxes with a numeral in every unit area, which\nranges\
    \ from 0 to 1; this stands for the probability of SID\nappearance in this unit\
    \ area. We assume that no more than\none SID can exist in each unit site. We assume\
    \ that the SID\nPrimary base\nstation (PBS)\nPBS received\ninterference\nPrimary\
    \ user\nPU received\ninterference\nSecondary\nloT sensor\ndevice (SID)\nSID received\n\
    interference\nSecondary IoT\ninformation\ngathering base\nstation (SIGS)\nSIGS\
    \ received\ninterference\nFigure 1: System model.\nMobile Information Systems\n\
    3\nappearance probability at each unit area is known before\ndeploying the SIGS,\
    \ and the probabilities in every unit area\nare independent of each other.\nEvery\
    \ SIGS has its own coverage range, which is cal-\nculated by the Friis transmission\
    \ equation:\nPr\nPt\n\x1F GtGr\nλ\n\x1F4πd\n\x1E\n2\n,\n(1)\nwhere Pr is the receiving\
    \ power available on input at the\nreceiving antenna; Pt is the output power to\
    \ the transmitting\nantenna; Gt and Gr are antenna gains of the transmitting and\n\
    receiving antennas, respectively; λ is the wavelength; and d is\nthe distance\
    \ between the transmitting and receiving antennas.\nWe need to obtain R, which\
    \ is the radius of the base station’s\ncoverage. Tis can be derived by rearranging\
    \ (1):\nR \x1F λ\n4π\n\x1D\x1D\x1D\x1D\x1D\x1D\nPtGtGr\nPmin\nr\n\x1C\n,\n(2)\n\
    where Pmin\nr\nis the minimum decodable receiving power.\nEvery base station has\
    \ its own coverage radius, which is\nreferred to as its service range. From (2),\
    \ it is clear that the\nradius of the coverage range depends on the transmitter\n\
    power when the other factors are fxed; thus, if the transmitter\npower of SIGSs\
    \ and PBSs are fxed, we can assume that every\nSIGS has the same coverage range\
    \ in the same way that every\nPBS has the same coverage range. However, it is\
    \ difcult to\navoid the situation where some SIGSs cover the same area.\nTis means\
    \ that there will be some inevitable overlap between\nthe service ranges of SIGSs.\
    \ For this situation, we put forward\na policy that can efectively solve this\
    \ kind of problem.\nFigure 3 shows the situation where the coverage areas of\n\
    SIGSs overlap. It is clear that SIGS1 and SIGS2 have the same\nuser in their service\
    \ area: SID1. To determine which SIGS\nwill be selected to communicate with SID1,\
    \ two factors will\ninfuence the result: one depends on distance and the other\n\
    on the ID number. For example, if the distance between\nSIGS1 and SID1, referred\
    \ to as D11, is greater than the\ndistance from SIGS2 to SID1 (D21), then SID1\
    \ will choose\nSIGS1 for communication. When D11 is equal to D21, the\nselection\
    \ will be based on the ID number; here, SID1 will\nconnect to SIGS1 because its\
    \ ID is 1.\nTe performance objectives of the CR system are de-\nscribed in terms\
    \ of ftness function or objective function. Te\nresults should consider the balance\
    \ between the ftness and\nobjective functions to meet the QoS requirement while\n\
    enhancing system performance. Te ftness functions are\napplied to fnd the optimal\
    \ solution in the defned search\nspace. We assume that signal propagation is dominated\
    \ by\npath loss efects. Table 1 shows the summary of notations\nused in this paper.\n\
    As mentioned in Section 2, signifcant interference exists\nin CR systems. Since\
    \ secondary systems only use the uplink\nchannel of the primary system, we will\
    \ consider the in-\nterference that PBS and SIDs will sufer. We can calculate\
    \ the\naverage SINR at the ith unit area (SID) on the jth channel\nbelonging to\
    \ the kth SIGS as given in (3).\nS_ESINRj\nk,i \x1F\nPsb hj\n\e\e\e\e\e k,i\n\e\

    Part A of (3) is the average interference from PUs, and\npart\nof (3) represents\
    \ the average interference from other\nsecondary systems that use the jth channel.\
    \ Because we\nassume that only one secondary device (a SIGS or one of the\nSIDs)\

    \ denoted by (11) and (12), in which the\nSINR of every primary base station and\

    \ Additionally, in order to protect primary sys-\ntems, if (12) cannot be satisﬁed,\

    \ Information\nGathering Base Station Using Particle\nSwarm Optimization\nIn this\
    \ work, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algo-\nrithm is invoked to obtain\
    \ an optimized solution; this\nachieves our multiple objectives. PSO is a population-based,\n\
    stochastic optimization technique that is modelled after the\nﬂocking and swarming\
    \ behavior in birds and animals. In\nPSO, the potential solutions are called particles,\
    \ and these\ncandidate solutions are referred to as swarms of particles.\nEach\
    \ of these is characterized by its position and velocity\nbased on its own best\
    \ value (pbest), as well as the best value\nin the whole search space (gbest).\
    \ Ten, every particle ad-\njusts its value (position) toward its pbest and gbest\
    \ at each\niteration. Tis movement is governed by the following\nequations:\n\
    V(t + 1) \x88 wV(t) + C1r1(pbest − X(t))\n+ C2r2(gbest − X(t)),\n(13)\nX(t + 1)\
    \ \x88 X(t) + V(t + 1),\n(14)\nwhere w is the weight inertia; C1 and C2 are the\
    \ learning\nfactors that determines the relative inﬂuence of cognitive\nand social\
    \ component, respectively, in search space; and\nr1 and r2\nare\ntwo\nindependently\n\
    generated\nrandom\nnumbers from [0, 1]; and X(t) and V(t) are the position\nand\
    \ velocity of t second particles, respectively. Te ob-\njective functions described\
    \ in the previous section are\nthen used in the ﬁtness function and optimized\
    \ by the PSO\nalgorithm. For each iteration, every particle is evaluated\nand\
    \ compared with the values of pbest and gbest, and\nevery particle updates its\
    \ velocity and position based on\nthe above equations until a termination condition\
    \ is\nreached.\nFigure 5 shows the particle structure in the proposed\nalgorithm,\
    \ including the SIGS position and operating\nchannel. Te range of the search space\
    \ is composed of two\nparts: the ranges of position and the channel. Each particle\n\
    should search within this range in every iteration. If we\ndivide the total area\
    \ into N × N unit areas and set the\nchannel number to n, then the range of the\
    \ search space for\nthe ﬁrst particle component is from 1 to N × N, and the\n\
    second particle component search space is 1, 2, . . . , n\n{\n}. As\nFigure 6\
    \ shows, the practical implementation of classical\nPSO mainly involves the following\
    \ steps. (1) Parameter\ninitialization: initialize all required particle positions\
    \ and\nvelocities randomly, and then deﬁne the range, number of\nparticles, and\
    \ population size. (2) Evaluate the desired\nobjective function of each particle.\
    \ (3) Compare each\nparticle’s current ﬁtness value with the previous pbest; if\n\
    this value is greater than the previous one, set the pbest\nvalue to the current\
    \ value. (4) Determine gbest of the\nswarm from the total pbest value. (5) Update\
    \ the velocity\nand position of every particle using (13) and (14). (6)\nUpdate\
    \ the generation number using t \x88 t + 1. Check the\ncurrent iteration number;\
    \ if this is less than the total it-\nerations, go back to step 3; otherwise,\
    \ go to step 7. (7)\nOutput the optimal solution. Figure 6 shows the movement\n\

    \ we evaluate the performance of the pro-\nposed SIGS location and operating channel\
    \ selection al-\ngorithm. Simulations were carried out using MATLAB\nsoftware.\
    \ Te best results of the optimal topology of SIGS\npositions and the matched channel\
    \ that were found via PSO\nare shown. In addition, the capacities of the primary\
    \ and\nsecondary systems, the supportable number of SIDs, and\nthe average result\
    \ of the ﬁtness functions for multiple\ntopologies are all compared with the result\
    \ of a random\ntopology. Te parameters used for simulations are given in\nTable\
    \ 2. Gt and Gr are both equal to 1 dBi, and the frequency\nis 10 GHz.\nIn the\
    \ proposed method, which uses the PSO algorithm\nto ﬁnd the best topology for\
    \ the location of SIGSs and\nmatched channel, each candidate solution is referred\
    \ to as a\nswarm of particles. We then divide the total area into 50 × 50\nunit\
    \ areas, so the ﬁrst particle’s (i.e., the position of SIGSs)\nrange is from 1\
    \ to N × N. Here, the range is from 1 to 2500;\nevery number stands for a position\
    \ and will be mapped to the\ncorresponding coordinates. We set ﬁve channels, and\
    \ the\nselection space is C \x88 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n{\n}. Tis means that the\nsecond\
    \ particle (i.e., the channel) only has ﬁve cases from C.\nFrom Table 2, we can\
    \ see that the topology is created by 10\nsecondary systems and 5 primary systems\
    \ that share ﬁve\nchannels, which are generated in cell areas with radii of\n\
    Rs \x88 40 m and Rp \x88 130 m, respectively. Te transmitting\npower of the secondary\
    \ systems is set to 0.2 W, and the PU\ntransmitter power is 2 W [23]. Te population\
    \ size in PSO is\n70, the weight inertia is 0.99, and the learning factors of\
    \ c1, c2\nis 2. We set that SID SINR threshold is 10 dB and PBS SINR\nthreshold\
    \ is 5 dB [24]. Figure 7 shows the multiple objective\nresults that were determined\

    \ 1: Te proposed PSO-based resource allocation algorithm.\nMobile Information\
    \ Systems\n7\nTe fgure shows that PSO found the best result after around\n650\
    \ iterations.\nFigure 8 show the optimal topology for the optimal SIGS\nlocations\
    \ and matched channels. As mentioned in Section 2,\nthe secondary systems already\
    \ have the positions of the PBS\nand the operating channels before they are distributed;\n\
    therefore, we fxed the PBS positions and operating channels\nin the simulation.\
    \ Te red color stands for the PBS position,\nand blue represents the SIGS. We\
    \ obtained a result after 1000\niterations using PSO. As can be seen from the\
    \ fgures, each\nsmall box has four unit areas. In our model, we assumed that\n\
    each base station is located in the center of the unit site, and\nwe obtain the\
    \ base station’s coordinates by combining its\nlocations of x and y axes. Because\
    \ the PBS service range is\nbigger than that of the SIGS, the optimal deployment\
    \ of the\nSIGS position and channel selection should consider\nthe interference\
    \ experienced by the PBS and should protect\nthe PBS as much as possible. Additionally,\
    \ other factors\nshould be taken into account to decrease the interference\namong\
    \ SIGSs and maximize the supportable number of SIDs.\nWe set PBS positions to\
    \ possibly cover most of the entire\narea, and each PBS uses a diferent channel\
    \ in an attempt to\ndecrease interference among primary systems. Additionally,\n\
    channel gain is related to the distances between base stations\nand users so that\
    \ SIGSs that share the same channel with the\nPBS should consider the distances\
    \ between SIGS and PBS.\nFor example, if the PBS is using channel 5, and other\
    \ SIGSs\nwant to share this channel, they must be far from the PBS in\norder to\
    \ avoid causing intense interference to the PBS.\nTerefore, they are deployed\
    \ at locations that are farthest\nfrom this PBS. Te same situation also needs\
    \ to be con-\nsidered among SIGSs that use the same channel.\nIn order to verify\
    \ that our scheme is efective, we\ncompared our proposed algorithm to a random\
    \ resource\nallocation (RRA) algorithm. In the RRA algorithm, each\nSIGS is randomly\
    \ distributed in the area, and the oper-\nating channel is randomly selected without\
    \ considering\nneighboring PBSs or SIGSs; however, it still needs to\n2\n(×1010)\n\

    \ protect\nprimary system. It is worth noting that the appearance\nprobability\
    \ matrix for SIDs should be the same, regardless\nof whether the RRA algorithm\
    \ or the proposed algorithm\nis used. From Figure 7, we can see that PSO found\
    \ the\noptimal result after around 650 iterations. For the RRA\nalgorithm, in\
    \ order to ensure fairness, we also set 650\ncirculations and used the same topology\
    \ as the PBS. After\neach loop, we recorded related data, and then found the\n\
    best result of the multiple-objectives function from all of\nthe recorded results.\
    \ We also recorded the best capacity\nand greatest number of supportable SIDs\
    \ in order to\ncompare them with our algorithm. Figure 9 shows the best\ntopologies\
    \ of the SIGS locations and matched channel for\nthe RRA algorithm.\nDue to the\
    \ fact that the RRA algorithm distributes the\nSIGS positions and the operating\
    \ channel randomly (it is\nonly concerned with satisfying the SINR threshold for\
    \ the\nPBS), some SIGSs can be allocated near the SIGSs or the\nPBSs that use\
    \ the same channel, as shown in Figure 9. Tis\ncauses severe interference between\
    \ SIGSs. In Figure 9, we\ncan see that the positions of SIGSs are more centralized\
    \ than\nthe optimal deployment in Figure 8. Figure 9 shows the\ntopology of the\
    \ best result from all of the recorded results\nafter 650 iterations. To compare\
    \ the two methods in detail,\nwe also compared the capacity, supportable number\
    \ of SIDs,\nand topologies.\nFigure 10(a) shows the eﬀect of diﬀerent number of\n\
    particles on multiobjectives result. In the PSO algorithm,\npopulation size can\
    \ aﬀect the speed and optimal value of the\nsearch results. In this experiment,\
    \ we set diﬀerent population\nsizes and concentrate on exploring their inﬂuence\
    \ on results.\nAs we can see, the multiobjectives result calculated by PSO\nbecomes\
    \ larger when we increase the population size. Figure\n10(b) shows the eﬀect of\
    \ diﬀerent number of SIGSs on\nmultiobjectives result. In this experiment, we\
    \ change the\nnumber\nof\nSIGSs\nbut\nﬁx\nthe\nnumber\nof\nchannels\n(i.e., number\
    \ of channels \x88 5) and population size (\x8870). Te\nmultiobjectives result\
    \ keeps increasing when the number of\nSIGSs increases. Because when we increase\
    \ SIGSs, the sec-\nondary throughput and the supportable number of SIDs are\n\
    also increasing. It should be noted that the increasing slope is\nnot linear because\
    \ the more SIGSs results in possible col-\nlisions between SIGSs to share channels.\
    \ Figure 10(c) shows\nthe eﬀect on diﬀerent number of channels on multiobjectives\n\
    result. It is shown that multiobjectives result is increasing\nwhile increasing\
    \ the number of channels because increasing\nthe number of channels expands the\
    \ available channel select\nrange and also reduces the interference with PBSs\
    \ and other\nSIGSs. It should be also noted that when the number of\nchannels\
    \ is larger than 5, most of SIGS systems already\nutilized available channels\
    \ successfully so that even though\nwe increase the number of channels, the performance\
    \ is\nsaturated.\nFigure 11 presents the capacity comparison between our\nalgorithm\
    \ and the RRA algorithm. Te red lines stand for the\ncapacity of the primary systems,\
    \ reﬂected on the right y-axis.\nTe steady, dashed red line is the PBS capacity\
    \ from the best\nresult of the RRA algorithm, which we previously recorded.\n\
    From this ﬁgure, we see that the primary system’s capacity\nincreased by 26%,\
    \ compared with the RRA algorithm,\nwhereas the secondary system’s capacity increased\
    \ by 43%.\nIn Figure 11, we can see that the capacity of PBSs (red solid\nline)\
    \ decreased from the 200th to 250th iterations. In\ngeneral, the capacity should\
    \ always increase in our algo-\nrithm, but our multiple-objectives ﬁtness function\
    \ is com-\nposed of two parts, as shown in (10). One part is the total\ncapacity\
    \ (including the secondary and primary capacities),\nand the other is the supportable\
    \ number of SIDs. Because the\nsecondary capacity is always greater than that\
    \ of the PBSs\n(because the number of SIGSs is 10, while there are ﬁve\nPBSs),\
    \ we can say that the main factor that inﬂuences the\nwhole capacity function\
    \ is the secondary capacity. Tus, it is\npossible that the whole capacity result\
    \ still keeps increasing,\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37\

    \ 12, the supportable number of SIDs is com-\npared. Similarly, the dashed line\
    \ that remains steady is the\nresult corresponding to the highest number of supportable\n\

    10\nMobile Information Systems\nﬁve, and we execute 20 topologies, we need to\
    \ change the\nPBS positions and SID appearance probability matrix 20\ntimes. We\
    \ can use our algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal results\nfor total capacity and the\
    \ number of supportable users for\neach topology. Tey are added together, and\
    \ the results are\naveraged. Next, when the number of SIGSs is changed, the 20\n\
    topologies and SID appearance probability matrix should be\nkept the same with\
    \ last time, in order to allow for a better\ncomparison. We analyzed the same\
    \ topologies with the RRA\nalgorithm, and then obtained results and averaged our\n\
    ﬁndings after changing the topology 20 times. Next time\nwhen the number of SIGS\
    \ changed, we executed the same\nsteps. However, for RRA algorithm, we do not\
    \ need to\ncirculate and ﬁnd the best one this time because we only\nneed the\
    \ average results.\nFor this comparison, we looked at multiple topologies\nwhere\
    \ the number of SIGSs was 5, 7, 9, and 11. As mentioned\nbefore, for each time,\
    \ we changed the PBS positions and SID\nappearance probability 20 times. We then\
    \ obtained the av-\nerage results while performing the same steps using the RRA\n\
    algorithm. In Figure 13, we can see that the average ﬁtness\nresults continue\
    \ to increase as more SIGSs are added, re-\ngardless of the algorithm used. However,\
    \ it is clear that our\nalgorithm’s result has higher growth than the RRA algorithm.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we proposed a distributed scheme that de-\ntermines\
    \ the optimal location and operating channel of\nSIGSs to manage the interference\
    \ and the resource allocation\nin cognitive radio networks for IoT sensor networks.\
    \ Te\nproposed algorithm can maximize the secondary system’s\ncapacity while guaranteeing\
    \ primary system’s required\nperformance. Meanwhile, it maximizes the supportable\n\
    number of SIDs based on the proposed probability of\nSID appearance. In addition,\
    \ the distributed scheme has\nlower complexity and fundamentally improves total\
    \ system\nperformance. Te simulation results show that the proposed\nalgorithm\
    \ works well to achieve our multiple objectives.\nFurthermore, when compared with\
    \ the RRA algorithm, the\nproposed algorithm is always at least 20% better, whether\
    \ it\nis about the secondary capacity or the number of supportable\nSIDs. Additionally,\
    \ our algorithm showed better eﬃciency\nthrough the last comparison, which compared\
    \ the average\nresults in multiple topologies.\nConflicts of Interest\nTe authors\

    are already at the core of next generation wireless networks, including 5G, cognitive
    radio and future Internet. There is a huge consilience that the majority of Internet
    devices will become sensors and actuators equipped over ordinary “things”. As
    a consequence, the radio environment will increasingly become crowded with thousands
    of low-cost devices sharing the unlicensed frequency bands. This paper is regarding
    a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of
    IoT. It proposes an embedded and low cost cooperative spectrum sensing solution,
    which has been experimentally implemented. Furthermore, we present a distributed
    software-controlled sector aware spectrum sensing architecture to store and analyze
    the spectrum usage information. Finally, the proposed approach has been integrated
    to a future Internet architecture called NovaGenesis. A proof-of-concept has been
    experimentally performed, demonstrating for the first time the convergence of

    internetInternet of ThingsNovaGenesisSoftware-defined 1. Introduction The Internet
    of Things (IoT) has been challenging all existing information and communication
    technology (ICT) architectures in the last years, mainly due to the exponential
    growth in the number of connected devices, the diversity of possible technology
    stacks (heterogeneous networks) and devices connectivity issues [1], [2]. The
    new scenario becomes even more challenging since many traditional networks had
    not been originally designed to offer adequate security and privacy for IoT [3],
    [4]. Moreover, a significant portion of mobile IoT devices will require rebinding
    of devices’ locators [2] and hundreds or even thousands of them will share the
    same radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic spectrum. The IoT requirements play
    an important role in the context of the next generation wireless networks, including
    5G [5], cognitive radio [6] and future Internet [2]. For instance, Michailow et
    al. [5] have considered low power consumption and delay tolerant requirements
    of machine-to-machine communications in the context of 5G networks. Cognitive
    radios networks (CRNs) have been proposed as a key solution to define rules and
    techniques for using underutilized licensed RF bands [7]. One of its benefits
    is allowing users of congested unlicensed bands to offload their traffic to other
    parts of the RF spectrum, even the licensed ones. A CRN is able to identify when
    the legal owner of some RF spectrum portion, who is called primary user, is not
    making use of its licensed RF band. Cognitive networks may orientate secondary
    (opportunistic) users to make use of this part of the RF spectrum without interfering
    in the primary user communication [6]. As a consequence, a cognitive radio (CR)
    must identify – or sense – when the licensed RF band is unused and distribute
    this information for the secondary users that may be interested in establishing
    communication over this part of the RF spectrum. The tsunami of devices expected
    in IoT will push radio frequency spectrum control and management towards more
    opportunistic approaches, creating a straightforward link between IoT and CRN
    [1]. The latest piece of this puzzle is the strong relation between the IoT requirements
    and future Internet (FI) research [8]. The term future Internet was adopted in
    the first initiatives with the aim of rethinking the Internet, including the future
    Internet design (FIND) initiative [9] and the European future Internet assembly
    (FIA) initiative [8]. By FI, we mean any Internet-like network that could emerge
    in the future. This includes evolutionary approaches, in which the fundamental
    protocols of the current Internet are maintained and new ideas are incrementally
    introduced; or revolutionary approaches, in which the architecture is redesigned
    from scratch (also named “clean slate” proposals). Examples of evolutionary FI
    architectures (FIAs) that encompass IoT scope are: FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and
    SmartSantander [12]. FIWARE provides a platform to integrate computer programs
    (or generic enablers – GE) via the next generation service interfaces (NGSIs).
    The NGSI-9/NGSI-10 is based on RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs)
    [10], as a consequence, it is dependent on the current Internet technologies.
    SENSEI is focused on the wireless sensor and actuator networks interoperation,
    creating a market for the sensed data also employing RESTful interfaces. Finally,
    SmartSantander is based on a platform for the smart city services integration
    using RESTful APIs. To the best of our knowledge, those projects do not explore
    CRN approach to opportunistically perform spectrum control and management, by
    using a spectrum sensing technique. They also lack on supporting some FIA ingredients,
    such as: information-centric networking (ICN) [13], service-oriented architecture
    (SOA) [14], service-centric networking (SCN) [15], software-defined networking
    (SDN) [16], network function virtualization (NFV) [17], self-verifying naming
    (SVN) [4], identifier/locator (ID/Loc) splitting [2] and network caching. Up to
    the current moment, we can conclude that none of the mentioned revolutionary approaches
    have being proper explored in the IoT state-of-the-art. In this sense, we idealized
    and developed a new FIA called NovaGenesis (NG) [18], which considers IoT and
    CRN as key players for future Internet. In this paper, we explore for the first
    time the convergence of IoT, CRN, and FI technologies, by means of three main
    contributions. Firstly, we report a successful implementation of a novel approach
    for cognitive radio in IoT scenarios based on a software-controlled, low-cost
    and an embedded cooperative spectrum sensing. Secondly, we present the concept
    and an experimental demonstration of a distributed, software-controlled and sector
    aware spectrum sensing architecture that employs current Internet protocols to
    store and analyze spectrum usage information. Thirdly, we extend NG with novel
    services to interoperate with the proposed CRN approach based on energy detection
    from spatially-distributed remote radio units by taking advantage of the NG FIA
    ingredients. The remainder of this article will introduce our CRN based on energy
    detection from spatially-distributed remote radio units in Section 2. The proposed
    system is implemented using a low-cost hardware and GNU Radio as a processing
    platform. Section 3 presents NovaGenesis, including its fundamental concepts,
    implementation and two novel FI services to interoperate with our CR solution.
    Experimental results are reported in Section 4, including a proof-of-concept of
    the new NG services together with the embedded spectrum sensing. Finally, we conclude
    the paper in Section 5, giving direction for future works. 2. Cognitive radio
    network proposal: embedded low-cost cooperative sensing The employment of a RF
    spectrum sensing technique is convenient, independently of the way that the unused
    RF band is going to be allocated by a secondary user, for this reason is considered
    one of the CR most important features [19]. CR may be placed alone in a non-cooperative
    environment or being part of a cooperative network, in which a channel allocation
    decision is based on the information collected by diverse CRs. In the ISM bands,
    there is no licensed user, so the primary user is not formally present, but the
    benefits of the spectrum sensing and CR techniques are still valid. Regulation
    agencies stipulate that radios must implement some specific channel access techniques
    for certain RF bands, such as frequency hopping spreading spectrum (FHSS) or direct
    sequence spreading spectrum (DSSS). By applying FHSS, a radio pair keeps changing
    the communication channel frequency over time, spreading the transmitting power
    over a wider bandwidth. In a point to point communication, FHSS is very reliable
    and have been used for a long time. IoT applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN) and smart grid solutions typically demand low power consumption in order
    to enable communication among hundreds or even thousands of devices. 2.1. Cooperative
    spectrum sensing The proposed cooperative cognitive radio network is presented
    in Fig. 1a. It is composed by the following blocks: sensing cell (SC); sensing
    cell controller (SCC); sensing information storage and analysis (SISA). The SC
    is responsible to acquire RF information, whereas the SCC detects users in the
    RF spectrum and SISA acts as a fusion center with the ability of collecting and
    aggregating information from many SCCs. The proposed approach provides higher
    level of RF spectrum usage information, with the purpose of allowing a dynamic
    spectrum allocation. Download : Download high-res image (225KB) Download : Download

    flow from sensing cell (SC) to sensing information storage and analysis (SISA);
    (b) radio interference scenario with three sensing cell controllers (SCCs). 2.1.1.
    Sensing cell (SC) The RF spectrum may be sensed by more than one sensing cell
    (SC), which includes a RF receiver, an antenna and a computational processing
    board. The SC hardware has been developed using a low-cost commercial hardware
    based on Raspberry PI 2 processing board and a digital video broadcasting-terrestrial
    (DVB-T) receiver acting as a RF receiver. The latter one has becoming popular
    in software-defined radio (SDR) applications [20]. SCs may be deployed over different
    locations in order to cover a wide geographic area, characterizing a cooperative
    network scenario. More than one source of spectrum sensing information may be
    used to provide information for a real-time RF spectrum allocation. The proposed
    cooperative network reduces the hidden node problem effect, providing information
    to discover distinct sectors, then improving the RF spectrum usage efficiency
    [21]. Traditional CR implementations define a radio capable to sense the spectrum,
    while performing its usual communication functionality [6]. Since the objective
    is to employ low resource devices that may not have enough processing capacity
    to run a spectrum sensing algorithm, the SCs may be used as a support system to
    existent fixed frequency systems. For this reason, in the proposed system, the
    SCs are sensing-only devices. It is feasible to implement the sensing algorithm
    over more powerful IoT devices. In context of IoT, a network commonly has its
    own border router or gateway that acts as a network coordinator and interface
    to the Internet. The SC acquires samples from RF spectrum for demodulating them
    to a baseband digital signal. The digital signal is delivered to the processing
    board, which encapsulates the RF information into TCP/IP packets to be sent to
    a SCC. 2.1.2. Sensing cell controller (SCC) The sensing cell controller (SCC)
    has two important roles in the proposed system: (i) it configures the SC receiver
    parameters; (ii) it performs the energy detector computation to be sent to SISA.
    The SCC runs on a standard desktop computer and all energy detection algorithm
    is performed by applying previously-developed GNU Radio framework, which is a
    free software tool that provides a set of processing blocks with focus on SDR
    usage. By controlling the SC parameters, such as radio central frequency and radio
    bandwidth, becomes possible to sense a wide RF spectrum, typically divided into
    RF channels. This functionality is very important, since the low-cost receiver
    has only 2 MHz bandwidth. The computed RF spectrum energy information is then
    sent to the SISA block. 2.1.3. Sensing information storage and analysis (SISA)
    The SISA block relies on a specific algorithm responsible to collect data from
    many SCCs and store this information in a database. The SISA information may be
    based on a specific region, or a specific RF spectrum band or even some calendar
    range. SISA provides a database information on the RF spectrum utilization divided
    in hours of a day, based on each SCC connected to it. The SISA has an API that
    allows some CR interested on its sensing information to put queries on spectrum
    information usage statistics. 2.1.4. Spectrum sensing based on energy detection
    Energy detection is considered the most simple spectrum sensing technique. It
    has been chosen to enable the use of low-cost components and, also, because it
    is the most appropriate technique when the transmitted signal is unknown [22].
    The energy for N received RF signals (X) may be calculated as follows: (1) where
    the resultant value defines the test statistic variable T. The noise power variance
    must be known in order to define an optimal test statistic variable T′ given by:
    (2) The need of obtaining T′ is a drawback of the energy detection technique,
    since the system must measure or estimate the channel noise. From this estimate,
    it is possible to define a detection threshold λ that allows to evaluate the channel
    availability. The acquired T′ samples are compared to λ and stored in a detection
    vector Dv: (3) The percentage of samples with value greater than the threshold
    is counted and this information is forwarded to the SISA, as a detection information,
    indicating a quantitative presence of a RF signal in the sensing band: (4) 3.
    NovaGenesis architecture NovaGenesis (NG) is a research project that started in
    2008, with the goal of answering the following question: “Imagine if there is
    no Internet architecture, how could we design it using the best contemporary technologies?”
    NovaGenesis scope includes not only data exchanging (like any other networking
    technology), but also data processing and storage (including cloud computing and
    networking cache). NG design considered a set of state-of-the-art ingredients,
    focusing on synergistically integrating them. 3.1. Motivation and advantages Cooperative
    spectrum sensing, spatial and temporal spectrum usage profiling, as well as dynamic
    resource allocation require the transfer and storage of the sensible information.
    The unrestricted access to spectrum samples can reveal private behavior, network
    infrastructure and weak performance points. Attackers can explore these weaknesses
    to cause unwanted interference, reducing the network throughput. False spectrum
    samples could create chaos in the resource managers. Collaborative spectrum sensing
    and dynamic resource allocation require more than performance. The provenance
    of spectrum samples should be guaranteed, creating a trustable network of sensing
    devices. Software control requires trust, privacy, provenance and integrity of
    control data. An illegitimate software controller can cause deliberate stopping
    of software-defined radios (SDRs). Software controllers and SDRs should establish
    a trustable network, working according to previously defined service level agreements
    (SLAs). Many Internet technologies were designed in the 70s. Despite of data integrity
    importance, it is still missing in the majority of TCP/IP networks today. A legacy
    of a time when security was not a big deal. According to Jacobson et al. [23],
    “trust in content is easily misplaced, relying on untrustworthy location and connection
    information”. Data security depends mainly on the available connection security,
    e.g. IPsec or security socket layer (SSL). Neither data, nor services are protected
    by their own names. Novel techniques such as self-verifying names (SVNes) can
    improve entities security and trust. Ghodsi et al. [4] contend on the security
    and privacy advantages of SVNes compared to the current Internet naming. In addition,
    data provenance is limited to the guarantees offered by the domain name service
    (DNS). However, DNSSEC standard is still in the early days of deployment and typically
    not available at low level domains, like the one presented in Fig. 1. Related
    works on IoT proposals, such as FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and SmartSantander [12]
    do not employ contract-based coordination of controllers and SDRs. NG “clean slate”
    design aims at fulfilling these gaps, bringing the following benefits to the scenario
    presented in Fig. 1: Unlimited namespaces: Not only natural language, but also
    SVNes can be employed to create as many namespaces as desired. Data, services,
    hardware and any other entity can be individually named, allowing persistent identification
    independently of location. This provides provenance, improving trustable operation
    [4], [13], [23], [24]. For this reason, we have redesigned the scenario of Fig.
    1 with SVNes and other NovaGenesis ingredients (Section 3.2). Flexible name resolution:
    Current DNS can resolve a limited set of names [25]. However, emerging scenarios
    require extending these capabilities to other entities, such as data objects [13],
    [23], [24] and services [15]. NovaGenesis name resolution is generic to accommodate
    this requirement (Section 3.3). On the other hand, the scenario of Fig. 1 is dependent
    on the available DNS deployment at sensing cells and SISA domains. Service-oriented
    design (SOD): The role of software is becoming increasingly important in modern
    ICT. Contemporary software engineering like service-oriented design should be
    employed. FIWARE, SENSEI and SmartSantander employ RESTful APIs, but they lack
    on implementing the entire service life-cycle, which includes negotiation and
    contracting. Our approach implements service life-cycling not only for SDR services,
    but also for software-controllers. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is
    the first work to experimentally demonstrate SOD application in a convergent CRN,
    IoT, and future Internet proposal. In contrast, Fig. 1 architecture does not employ
    SOD. Software-controlled radio: SDR capabilities and allowed configurations are
    exposed to services during dynamic service composition. NG software-controllers
    can negotiate the available resources, capabilities and configurations with the
    dynamic resource managers, with the purpose of forming a trustable network. If
    the services agree to work together, SDRs are configured under the “umbrella”
    of the established SLAs. As far as we know, this feature has never been reported
    in literature up to the moment. NovaGenesis combines these emerging ingredients
    towards more flexible and trustable ICT environments. As a first conclusion, NovaGenesis
    can be applied to integrate IoT, CRN, FI, smart cities, next generation mobile
    networks, among other contemporary ICT environments. 3.2. Fundamental concepts
    NovaGenesis is based on a set of fundamental concepts that are required to better
    understand its design and contributions, namely: Naming: Names are symbols used
    to denote one or more individual entities, like pieces of digital contents, computers
    and ordinary things. In our case, denoting stands for representing something by
    “signals”. By definition, names denote meaning and sense. Natural language names
    (NLNes) are those used in the human language, such as “Node 1” or “Domain A”.
    However, there are names that have no meaning, for example, the self-verifying
    names1 (SVNes) generated from the output of a mathematical hash function [4].
    For instance, a 32 bits name generated by NG using murmurhash 3 is “28FD4420”.
    SVNes are self-verifiable, because at any time the binary words used to generate
    them can be hashed again and get exactly the same output (name). Using SVNes as
    an alternative to NLNes [13], [24] makes possible to check the relationship between
    the named entity and its name at any time. According to Ghodsi et al. [4], SVNes
    provide better security, scalability, and flexibility than NLNes. Thus, the current
    paper proposes, for the first time, the use of SVNes in a joint IoT and cognitive
    radio scenario. Name binding: Our approach employs an unlimited number of namespaces
    that are linked by means of name bindings. A name binding (NB) is a mapping among
    two or more names, typically implemented as a vector in the form: < key; value(s)
    >. A NB can relate a name to an object or a name to other names. Fig. 2 illustrates
    a name binding scheme. The edges are NBs, whereas the vertices are NLNes or SVNes.
    For example, Domain 1 name is bound to Router 1 and Gateway 2. Obverse that NBs
    can represent entities relationships, i.e. “semantic operators” among entities,
    like is contained or contains. In the previous example, one can use the NB < Domain
    1; Gateway 2 > to represent that Domain 1 contains a Gateway 2. Download : Download

    and their bindings representing entities relationships. Colors are used to classify
    different types of physical and virtual entities. Name resolution: In context
    of Fig. 2, name resolution consists of resolving a name to other bound names,
    i.e. to determine the values behind a certain key. For example, the name Router
    1 is bound to the names OS 6, while OS 6 can be resolved to Process 10 and Process
    11. NG provides a distributed, hierarchical, name resolution service (NRS) that
    resolves NLNes or SVNes (keys) in one or more NLNes or SVNes (values). Identification
    and localization: An identifier unambiguously separates an entity from others
    in a certain scope. Considering Fig. 2, a scope can be denoted by the name Domain
    1 and all the names of entities inhabiting this domain can belong to the same
    scope. In this context, the names Process 12 and 280273AA uniquely separate this
    entity from others. However, the name Process 12 could not be unique globally.
    In this scenario, SVNes can be used. Note also that Domain 1 can denote the location
    of the Gateway 2 in the network. Services and contracts: A service is a virtual
    entity responsible for processing, exchanging and storing information. According
    to this definition, a computer program is a service. NG follows SOA principles
    [14], in which services are dynamically composed. In SOA, services life-cycling
    is contract-based. It means that after peer services discovery, a contract is
    formulated and negotiated. Therefore, a contract can be defined as a piece of
    information that sets the limits, responsibilities and clauses to be respected,
    as well as criteria for the completion and punishment of services that were poorly
    executed. Proxies, gateways and controllers: A proxy is an attorney that represents
    other components in a network for any purpose. As an example, consider a Wi-Fi
    access point that is represented by a proxy service that “sells” its forwarding
    capacities. This proxy can negotiate the Wi-Fi capabilities to potential clients.
    Another important concept is a gateway, which translates or encapsulates messages
    of a certain input protocol to the desired output protocol. Finally, we define
    a controller as a service that makes the decision regarding devices or services
    configurations. The controlled device can be physical or virtual. 3.3. The NovaGenesis
    current implementation The NG web of names (i.e. name bindings graph shown in
    Fig. 2) is implemented in a distributed way. NBs are published and subscribed
    by services and stored on hash table data structures hosted by one or more operating
    system (OS). We have adopted an object oriented design (OOD) approach to implement
    NG components. Every service has several internal objects, called blocks, with
    specific functionalities. Two blocks are instantiated in all services: gateway
    (GW) and hash table (HT), as illustrated in Fig. 3. GW provides a bus for block
    communication inside a service or at different services. It uses SVNes in the
    message headers to decide how to forward/route messages. The HT block is a hash
    multimap data structure employed to stored NBs. The current implementation is
    based in four services: Download : Download high-res image (176KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 3. Example of NovaGenesis one hop link scenario
    formed by two PGCS processes encapsulating NG messages over underlying hardware.
    PSS, GIRS and HTS encompass NovaGenesis name resolution services, which are used
    by two applications (APP1 and APP2) to communicate based on publish/subscribe
    model. Publish/subscribe service (PSS): NBs are published by any services through
    sending a message to an instance of a PSS. PSS provides the rendezvous between
    the publisher and subscriber services, allowing secure and private access to NBs.
    PSS implements the main NG application API that has six primitives: (i) publish
    NB (with associated data, if any); (ii) publish NB/data and notify other services
    about a publication; (iii) subscribe a NB/data; (iv) subscribe a NB/data and notify
    other services about a subscription; (v) deliver a subscribed NB/data; and (vi)
    revoke a NB/data publication. PSS can be seen as a distributed API, accessed via
    its names. Additionally, we have generalized PSS to allow pub/sub of contents
    associated to NBs, adding to this NRS a network cache functionality. Generic indirection
    resolution service (GIRS): PSS does not store bindings or data published, since
    it forwards them to a GIRS instance, which selects a proper hash table service
    (HTS) where they will be stored. The published NB/data are forwarded by GIRS to
    an HTS instance, where they are stored behind a hash table data structure. Therefore,
    GIRS is an intermediate service among PSS and HTS instances. Hash table system
    (HTS): HTS stores bindings and their associated contents, in case they exist.
    Consider for example the content named Sample 1 at Mote 3 of Fig. 2. This content
    will be stored as a file in a folder of an HTS instance. A name binding < 291074AA,
    Sample 1 > can relate the SVN of the content to its NLN. Proxy/gateway/controller
    service (PGCS): The component PGCS provides the following functions: (i) message
    encapsulation over already established networking technologies, such Ethernet
    or Wi-Fi; (ii) a proxy service to represent other NG services inside an OS; (iii)
    bootstrapping functionalities to initialize a domain; (iv) software-control of
    hardware or other computer programs outside NG environment. PGCS enables PSS,
    GIRS, and HTS to discover one another during initialization. Since an address
    is a name that denotes the position to where an existence can inhabit or be attached,
    PGCS relays on its local HT block or the domain HTS to store NBs among already
    established address formats (e.g. a real world or an emulated MAC Ethernet) and/or
    NG addresses. Independently of the address format used to connect PGCSes, inside
    NG all the communication is SVN-oriented. Additionally to the gateway service,
    PGCS publishes NBs about other NG services inside an OS to other PGCSes in the
    same domain, therefore propagating new services for their peers. NovaGenesis messages
    are implemented as information objects and serialized to ASCII character arrays
    with two portions: command lines (streamed from CommandLine objects) and payload
    (streamed from a file system archive). There is a bank line separating both. The
    command lines portion is composed by several textual lines, which can be dynamically
    expanded according to the need. The command lines are formatted as: ng -command
    –alternative version [ < n type E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En > ] where -command is the action
    to be done. -alternative selects among alternatives in the action to be done.
    version selects the desired version of implementation. [ ] indicates one or more
    vectorial arguments. n is the number of elements in an argument. type is the type
    of the elements in an argument. E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En are the elements of an argument.
    3.4. Representing a spectrum cell controller in NovaGenesis In this Subsection,
    we describe two new services developed for NovaGenesis to interoperate and manage
    the low-cost collaborative sensing approach presented in Section 2. Our main goal
    is enabling the convergence between the spectrum sensing approach for IoT with
    the NG “clean slate” FIA. This work represents an extension of our previous work
    on CRN with NovaGenesis [18]. 3.4.1. Spectrum sensing service The spectrum sensing
    service (SSS) has been developed to expose dedicated spectrum sensing hardware
    or a software-defined radio (SDR) to NG services. It exposes the device features,
    capabilities and configurations, as well details of the available spectrum sampling
    procedures. Other NG services can discover, negotiate and contract spectrum sensing
    functionality via their SSS representatives. This service is also a gateway for:
    (i) dedicated spectrum sensing hardware or SDR, translating NG command lines to
    non NG configurations, e.g. JavaScript object notation (JSON); and for (ii) interconnection
    of TCP/IP and NG stacks, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Messages from SCC are encapsulated
    over TCP/IP using ZeroMQ2 (ZMQ) push/pull sockets and delivered to SSS. Inside
    NovaGenesis, SSS changes to publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model instead of ZMQ’s
    push/pull, publishing and subscribing NBs and information objects (like SLAs or
    spectrum samples) to/from name resolution service (NRS).3 Download : Download
    high-res image (159KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Protocol stack
    for NovaGenesis interoperability with SCC. SSS provides the interconnection between
    TCP/IP and NG stacks. SCC sends spectrum samples to SSS using ZMQ with TCP/IP/Ethernet.
    Inside NG, the communication model employs pub/sub of NG messages directly over
    Ethernet, meanwhile other link layer technologies can be used. In Fig. 4, SSS
    communicates with SCC through three ZMQ push/pull socket connections, which form
    two communication channels, one for data and another for software-control settings.
    The data channel carries the spectral sensing information obtained by the components
    SC (Section 2.1.1) and SCC (Section 2.1.2). The setup channel is formed by the
    second and third connections and it is used by NG to obtain and send settings
    for SC and SCC. The information exchanged between SSS and SCC are structured in
    strings using JSON format. It is encoded in key/value pairs, in which the key
    field identifies the name of a parameter or command, tied to its value. The configuration
    channel to NovaGenesis can perform two operations: the commands get_info and set_config.
    get_info : The get_info JSON command is sent by SSS to SCC in order to request
    the spectral sensing available functionalities, identifying information of the
    sensing cell and the parameters of the current configuration of spectral sensing.
    The answer contains: (i) the sensing capabilities of the SCC in the key capacities;
    (ii) the cell identification information in the key cell_info; and (iii) the current
    spectrum sensing configuration. set_config : This command is sent from SSS to
    SCC to adjust spectrum sensing parameters according to a resource management service
    (RMS), which will be presented in Section 3.4.2. They are the start and end sampling
    frequencies in Hz. Also, the sampling bandwidth can be configured. data: The spectrum
    energy data is continuously transmitted from SCC to SSS. Fig. 5 illustrates the
    format of this data. The key scc_id uniquely identifies the SCC that generated
    the data. The key msgid provides a message sequence number, while the key date
    carries a timestamp of the sample. Last but not least, the key sensor contains
    the estimated probability that the related channel is busy. Download : Download

    format from SCC to SSS. The information collected by SSS is forwarded to a peer
    resource management service (RMS), whose responsibility includes data aggregation
    and correlation in a similar way to SISA. A SLA proposal describes the sampling
    features of spectrum sensing or SDR equipment it represents, such as rates, resolution,
    output format, among many others. 3.4.2. Resource management service (RMS) RMS
    implements a name-based, contract-oriented, dynamic orchestration of substrate
    resources exposed by SSS (other NG services are being developed, but they are
    out of the scope of this paper). RMS mediates the relationship among user applications
    and the SSS instances, inside NG cloud/networking (without TCP/IP). When a SSS
    discovers a RMS, it proposes a SLA with a description of the service to be provided.
    RMS accepts the contract and starts being notified of the SSSes’ publications
    to become aware of the situation of the radio spectrum opportunities in the ISM
    bands. 3.4.3. Sequence diagram of interoperability solution Fig. 6a and b provide
    a sequence diagram of the actions implemented to transport SCC spectrum samples
    to the NG RMS. In message a, both SSS and RMS publish their NBs to the PSS/GIRS/HTS
    (hereafter, called NRS for short). In message b, they subscribe possible peer
    keywords, e.g. “resource”, “manager”, “sensing”. NRS returns bindings containing
    the subscribed keywords in message c. These NBs, have in the value portion SVNes
    of services candidate to be a peer. Table 1 summarizes the messages exchanged
    among these components, giving details on technologies and message''s content.

    Fig. 6. Sequence diagram: (a) Spectrum sensing service (SSS) and resource management
    service (RMS) expose their names and discover one another (a,b,c). SSS represents
    sensing cell controller (SCC) inside NG, publishing an offer to the RMS containing
    SCC capabilities (d,e,f). (b) RMS publishes a contract acceptance that is subscribed
    by SSS (g,h). Spectrum samples are subscribed by RMS (i,j,k). Configuration files
    are published to SSS (l,m,n) and delivered to SCC (o). Table 1. Summary of messages

    SSS subscribes the configuration file. NG/Eth. n NRS delivers the configuration
    file to SSS. NG/Eth. o SSS translates the file and configures SCC. TCP/IP/Eth.
    During SSS initialization, it sends a get_info message to the SCC. When the answer
    returns in message d, SSS is able to make a service offer to RMS, specifying the
    possible configurations at SCC. SSS publishes the offer to the NRS, notifying
    the candidate RMS in message e. RMS subscribes the service offer object as illustrated
    in message f. In the current prototype, RMS just accepts this offer publishing
    a service acceptance object (message g). In future versions, we plan to add negotiation
    actions between them. Observe that these offer and acceptance objects are transferred
    using SVNes in the header of NG messages. Also, the keys used to subscribe these
    objects are used to verify their integrity. To the best of our knowledge, NG is
    the first FIA that checks integrity and provenance of data objects. In message
    h, SSS subscribes the service acceptance object published by the RMS and notified
    by the NRS. Then, when SCC publishes a data JSON like in message i, SSS publishes
    and notifies the peer RMS (message j). RMS then subscribes the data, as illustrated
    in message k. Finally, RMS can request SSS to change some configuration on SCC.
    In this case, it publishes a software-configuration object (message l) that is
    notified to the peer SSS. The SSS component subscribes the object (message m),
    which is delivered by NRS in message n. SSS translates the configuration object
    to the JSON format as expected by the SCC and forwards to SCC (message o). SCC
    then changes the configuration at the GNU Radio, which reflects the change on
    the hardware. 3.5. Comparison to our previous approach without NG Fig. 7 illustrates
    the TCP/IP over Ethernet stack as used to implement the scenario of Section 2.
    The SISA component has the following internal blocks: (i) input/output (IO) control;
    (ii) data access object (DAO), which is an interface to a MongoDB data base; (iii)
    information analysis, which provides algorithms to analyze data stored on the
    data base; and (iv) the data base itself. The communication between IO (and IA)
    to DAO uses ZMQ. From DAO to MongoDB a Linux system call is employed to invoke
    a TCP socket. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Stack for cooperative spectrum sensing using TCP/IP and ZeroMQ push/pull.
    A comparison of Fig. 4 with Fig. 7 indicates that Section 2 components (SC, SCC,
    SISA) employ TCP/IP over Ethernet as its communication stack, whereas NovaGenesis
    components (SSS, NRS, PGCS, and RMS) run NG directly over Ethernet without TCP/IP.
    SSS works as a gateway between the two stacks. In the Section 2 scenario, not
    only push/pull, but also client/server communication models are employed. On the
    other hand, NG employs only pub/sub due to its security, privacy and asynchronous
    communication features. We can summarize some of the differences between these
    scenarios as: Naming: Content and services are accessed using their self-verifying
    names (SVNes). Message forwarding/routing also employs SVNes. In contrast, ZMQ
    and TCP/IP only allows structured natural language names, which do not have the
    intrinsic security characteristics of SVNes [4]. Name resolution: In current Internet
    the name resolution is provided by DNS. In NovaGenesis, NRS does a similar role,
    but using pub/sub of domain name records. Limited service-orientation: In ZMQ/Internet,
    the service-oriented design (SOD) is employed only on the WWW, whereas in NovaGenesis
    it is for all services, including networking ones. Life-cycling: It encompasses
    the dynamic composition of services and their contents. In the Internet architecture
    it is present only at WWW. In NovaGenesis, life-cycling is intrinsic to any entity:
    content, services, operating systems (OSs), hosts, etc. The same pattern happens
    for contract-based operation. Deployment in hosts: Internet protocols are implemented
    at the core of operating systems. NovaGenesis protocols in hosts are implemented
    as services that follow SOD paradigm. 3.6. Next steps and open challenges We plan
    to implement the complete Fig. 1 scenario in NovaGenesis, with the aim at extending
    NG services to control Wi-Fi access points based on RMS decisions. We are also
    extending our NRS to hierarchical domains, as an alternative to DNS. In addition,
    we have already started implementing NG message encapsulation to other IoT technologies,
    such as IEEE 802.15.4. Furthermore, we have been developing an embedded proxy/gateway
    service (EPGS) to run inside energy constrained devices. Considering project activities
    up to now, we can summarize some open challenges for NG (and other FIAs) evolution
    as: Scalability and elasticity evaluation: Emerging architectures need to prove
    unprecedented levels of scalability and elasticity, especially due to the growths
    on the number of devices and services expected for IoT [2]. An open problem is
    how to evaluate “clean slate” proposals if experimentation technologies are dependent
    on TCP/IP? Testing revolutionary architectures require raw socket/link layer solutions
    or even interfaces for physical layer. Appropriate methodologies for comparison:
    New architectures such as NovaGenesis, expressive Internet architecture (XIA)
    [24] and network of information (NetInf) [13] employ novel ingredients, combined
    in a unique way. It is not trivial to determine the common and fair aspects to
    be compared, since it does not exist a standard benchmark methodology for FIA
    comparison. New methodologies for large-scale architectures comparison are required.
    Diversity of scenarios: Another hurdle is the diversity of scenarios that should
    be evaluated. Our contemporary Internet is huge and full of protocols. Therefore,
    new tools are required to automate experiments and results analysis. SmartSantander
    [12] and FIWARE [10] are examples of experimentation architectures for smart cities.
    However, as previously stated, many of their tools require TCP/IP and spectrum
    sensing capabilities are not available. Tools and experiments reproducibility:
    tcpdump is a famous tool for monitoring and evaluating TCP connections. Despite
    developing new architectures, researchers also need to develop tools for experimentation
    and performance evaluation of their proposals. 4. Results and analysis We divided
    this section in two parts. Firstly, we analyze the effects of an interfering radio
    in the quality of communication between two IoT nodes in the 915 MHz ISM band.
    Our low-cost cooperative sensing approach is used to determine the best channel
    for the pair of IoT communicating devices. Secondly, we demonstrate a convergent
    solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of IoT. A complete
    life-cycle of spectrum management services is performed, from service exposition
    and discovery up to service contracting and trustable transfer of spectrum data
    to a resource management service. 4.1. Low cost cooperative sensing and cognitive
    radio The implementation scenario of the low-cost cooperative cognitive radio
    for IoT applications was reported in Fig. 1b from Section 2. A pair of radios
    M1 and M2 have been used as IoT devices establishing a communication link; their
    hardware are composed by two Texas Instruments reference designs based on RF transceiver
    CC1120. The experiments have been realized from 902 to 928 MHz, which is a frequency
    range reserved for unlicensed ISM applications. The radios have been configured
    to continuously transmit packets with 50 bytes length at a fixed data rate of
    150 Kbps using 2-GFSK modulation. The radios are placed away from each other in
    such a position that a communication between them is possible when no interference
    is present. Near each radio a SC was placed so M1 and M2 may be sensed by SC1
    and SC2, respectively. Another radio Mint that acts as an interference source
    by means of generating random RF spectrum utilization was placed close to the
    SC1. Mint behaves such as a communication device that does not belongs to this
    IoT network, characterizing a multi-user RF environment. In a practical environment,
    a perfect isolation of RF boundaries is not possible, so the SCs will also sense
    some signal from neighbor radio as well the interfering source. Table 2 summarizes
    the adopted experimental parameters. Table 2. Experimental parameters. Parameters
    Actual values Variable parameters M1 and M2 frequencies 921 and 924  MHz Mint
    transmit probability 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% RF transmission power –21, –17 and
    –14  dBm Measured RSSI –95, –91 and –87  dBm Fixed parameters Sensed spectrum

    bandwidth 200  kHz Bit rate 150 kbps Data transport Packet Packet size 50 Bytes
    PER test 5000 Packets per test The experiments have been carried out for different
    values of receiver signal strength indication (RSSI) by changing the M2 transmission
    power. The probability of the radio Mint be transmitting have been modified to
    evaluate its influence over the link communication. Fig. 8 reports the experimental
    results where the packet error rate (PER) parameter has been used as a performance
    figure of merit. Five thousand packets have been sent in and the amount of successfully
    received packets were recorded. Initially, it was considered that the radios M1
    and M2 does not have information about RF spectrum usage, so the 921  MHz channel
    was selected, the same being used by Mint. During the experiment the interfering
    radio Mint randomly transmit messages that are not demodulated by M1 or M2 but
    interferes on link communication increasing the PER. Posteriorly, an additional
    test has been carried out by means of using the SISA information reported in Fig.
    9, for setting radios M1 and M2. As a centralized source of information, SISA
    indicates the channel 921  MHz is in use and the channel 924  MHz is available.
    The hidden node problem is present as SC2 does not sense Mint signal as shown
    in Fig. 9b. Note that the vertical axis in this figure corresponds to Eq. 4 Detection
    values. When SC1 information Mint is detected (Fig. 9a) the usage of the 921  MHz
    channel is avoided. The PER measurement have been conduced again with radios using
    the 924  MHz channel. It has been kept lower than 5%. Download : Download high-res

    radio in the context of Internet of Things. The computer on the left side runs
    SCC using GNU Radio, whereas the one in the middle runs five NovaGenesis services,
    including SSS for interoperability with SCC and PSS to provide a distributed API
    for NG pub/sub service, and a PGCS that encapsulates NovaGenesis messages over
    Ethernet/Wi-Fi. The computer on the right runs a PGCS and a RMS. RMS is the target
    of the spectrum samples collected at SCC, forwarded to SSS, published to PSS,
    and finally subscribed by RMS. Download : Download high-res image (534KB) Download

    discovery Fig. 11 contains a partial reproduction of the log of an SSS exposition
    message published to the PSS. The first command line with the command ng -m –cl
    is used by NovaGenesis to route the message to the destination. NG employs a name-based
    routing approach based on tuples of self-verifying names. The argument [ < 4 s
    0BD95286 ED12F3ED 342DD4C5 B8101939 > ] contains a tuple that identify/locate
    the source of the message (SSS) and the argument [ < 4 s 0BD95286 ED12F3ED 449B0B0C
    6FDF0A76 > ] provides the ID/Loc for the PSS. The command line ng -p –b is used
    to publish name bindings, therefore exposing keywords related to the SSS, e.g.
    the key 19656CF3 is the hash of the word “Wi-Fi”. This log is exactly an example
    of the message a from Fig. 6a. In the discovery process, the RMS subscribes keywords

    sensing samples inside a SSSFile_5818.txt. Fig. 14a depicts a plot generated from
    15 h of spectrum sampling over NovaGenesis. It demonstrates that the approach
    with NovaGenesis generated a result similar to the previous ones obtained over
    TCP/IP. Finally, in Fig. 14b it is plotted the mean round trip time (RTT) spend
    by the RMS to subscribe spectrum sensing objects from PSS/GIRS/HTS. In the first
    9 h, the RTT remained linear about 5.2 ms. After, it suffered a small increase
    probably due to the large amount of sample files stored at the HTS. All the samples
    have been stored. As a conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a straightforward
    and innovative convergence of IoT, FI and cognitive radio. Download : Download

    and (b) mean spectrum sample subscription RTT from RMS. 5. Conclusions This paper
    presented, for the first time, a successful convergence of cognitive radio network
    (CRN), Internet of Things (IoT) and a future Internet architecture (FIA) called
    NovaGenesis. We first report a low-cost embedded cooperative sensing and cognitive
    radio architecture for IoT. In this solution software-control is provided using
    current Internet technology. Moreover, we have experimentally demonstrated the
    use of cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection to overcome the
    hidden node problem, which for sure will be present in IoT. We measured PER as
    a function of RSSI to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed CRN. We have
    also extended NovaGenesis with two novel services to interoperate with the aforementioned
    CRN: spectrum sensing service (SSS) and resource management service (RMS). SSS
    interoperates with a sensing cell controller, which has a GNU Radio implementation
    for determining energy level at channels. The SCC spectrum samples are sent to
    SSS using TCP/IP. SSS translates the data objects from JSON to NovaGenesis and
    publishes them to the RMS (without TCP/IP). RMS subscribes the data objects according
    to their self-verifying names (SVNes), checking provenance and integrity. The
    novelties we demonstrated are typically found only in FIA research: exposition
    and discovery of services; contract-based operation; distributed name resolution
    using keywords and SVNes; and name-based routing of messages among services. These
    features allow the convergence among IoT, CRN and FIAs. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time spectrum sensing for IoT have been combined with a FIA.
    Future works include the evaluation with different radios, sensing cells, interference
    sources arrangements and spectral sensing algorithms. Finally, we also plan to
    extend NovaGenesis services to have the same software-control architecture (including
    SISA). In this way, we will be able to compare the performance and scalability
    of both current Internet and FIA approaches. Acknowledgments This work was partially

    Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Regardless of the context to which it is
    applied, sharing resources is well-recognized for its considerable benefits. Since
    5G networks will be service-oriented, on-demand, and highly heterogeneous, it
    is utmost important to approach the design and optimization of the network from
    an end-to-end perspective. In addition, in order to ensure end-to-end performance,
    this approach has to entail both wireless and optical domains, altogether with
    the IoT, edge, and cloud paradigms which are an indispensable part of the 5G network
    architecture. Shifting from the exclusive ownership of network resources toward
    sharing enables all participants to cope with stringent service requirements in
    5G networks, gaining significant performance improvements and cost savings at
    the same time. The main objective of this paper is to survey the literature on
    resource sharing, providing an in-depth and comprehensive perspective of sharing
    by recognizing the main trends, the techniques which enable sharing, and the challenges
    that need to be addressed. By providing a taxonomy which brings the relevant features
    of a comprehensive sharing model into focus, we aim to enable the creation of
    sharing models for more efficient future communication networks. We also summarize
    and discuss the relevant issues arising from network sharing, that should be properly
    tackled in the future. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials (

    Funding Agency: I. Introduction The widespread concept of sharing can be defined
    as a joint use of resources enabled by on-demand exchange, or by loaning of valuable
    goods [1]. Sharing brings its beneficial nature in many domains including social
    and economic systems, as well as in nature. Based on that fact, we anticipate
    and envision that provisioning of the models and methods for sharing of network
    resources represents one of the fundamental steps in designing Future Communication
    Networks (FCNs). Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    \a\nAbstract: The continuous growth of interconnected devices in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) presents\na challenge in terms of network resources. Cognitive\
    \ radio (CR) is a promising technology that\ncan address the IoT spectral demands\
    \ by enabling an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) scheme.\nThe application\
    \ of full duplex (FD) radios in spectrum sensing enables secondary users (SUs)\
    \ to\nperform sensing and transmission simultaneously, and improves the utilization\
    \ of the spectrum.\nHowever, random and dense distributions of FD-enabled SU transmitters\
    \ (FD-SU TXs) with sensing\ncapabilities in small-cell CR-IoT environments poses\
    \ new challenges, and creates heterogeneous\nenvironments with different spectral\
    \ opportunities. In this paper, we propose a spatial and temporal\nspectral-hole\
    \ sensing framework for FD-SU TXs deployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\n\
    environment. Incorporating the proposed sensing model, we present the analytical\
    \ formulation and\nan evaluation of a utilization of spectrum (UoS) scheme for\
    \ FD-SU TXs present at different spatial\npositions. The numerical results are\
    \ evaluated under different network and sensing parameters\nto examine the sensitivities\
    \ of different parameters.\nIt is demonstrated that self-interference,\nprimary\
    \ user activity level, and the sensing outcomes in spatial and temporal domains\
    \ have a\nsigniﬁcant inﬂuence on the utilization performance of spectrum.\nKeywords:\
    \ cognitive radio; IoT; full duplex; spectrum sensing; spatial–temporal spectral-holes;\n\
    utilization of spectrum\n1. Introduction\nRecent developments in wireless communication\
    \ have presented a new networking paradigm,\nInternet of Things (IoT) [1]. IoT\
    \ is a network of interconnected devices including sensors, health-care\ndevices,\
    \ home appliances, autonomous cars, and many others. IoT devices are connected\
    \ to the internet\nand are uniquely addressable. IoT promises machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) and human-to-machine\n(H2M) communications any-time, anyplace, with anyone,\
    \ using any network (or service) [2]. However,\nmaintaining continuous connectivity\
    \ and the enormous number of IoT devices present challenges\nto a radio network.\
    \ The demands of high bandwidth and spectrum resources for IoT applications\n\
    lead to the spectrum scarcity [3]. Traditional wireless spectrum standards rely\
    \ on the static spectrum\nallocation policies where speciﬁc frequency bands are\
    \ assigned to a speciﬁc licensed service and its\nusers. Unlicensed users are\
    \ not authorized to access the licensed bands, resulting in the underutilized\n\
    bands. Such policies cause unbalanced utilization of spectrum and degrade the\
    \ spectral efﬁciency.\nThus, static spectrum allocation policies are insufﬁcient\
    \ to address the high demands of spectrum\nresources required for the wireless\
    \ access of large number of IoT sensor devices [4]. Spectrum allocation\nﬂexibility\
    \ and spectrum utilization efﬁciency, required for IoT, can be achieved with different\
    \ proposed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441; doi:10.3390/s19061441\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1441\n2 of 18\ntechnologies such as long term evolution (LTE)\
    \ wireless local area networks (WLAN) aggregation\n(LWA), non-orthogonal multiple\
    \ access (NOMA), operations in millimeter-wave band, LTE over\nunlicensed band\
    \ (LTE-U), ultra-dense 5G small cells, and software-deﬁned cognitive radio network\n\
    (SD-CRN) [5].\n1.1. Motivations for Using SD-CRNs in IoT\nSD-CRN is a state-of-the-art\
    \ communication paradigm, and is one of the potential technologies\nadopted for\
    \ the IoT and other futuristic M2M applications [2–7].\nSD-CRN exploits the\n\
    dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) and spectrum diversity to address the spectrum\
    \ scarcity and\nunder-utilization issues. Enabling cognitive radio (CR) features\
    \ in IoT (CR-IoT) helps alleviate\ncongestion in the network; hence, increases\
    \ the utilization efﬁciency of spectrum, and helps to meet\nthe spectrum demands\
    \ of the future IoT. The proposed model is based on the case-study scenarios\n\
    where IoT devices (with CR features) coexist (share a common frequency band) with\
    \ any licensed\nprimary cellular network, and can dynamically access the spectrum\
    \ assigned to a licensed primary\nnetwork [8,9]. It is not spectral- and cost-efﬁcient\
    \ for network service providers to utilize an additional\nlicensed spectrum only\
    \ for IoT services. Therefore, spectrum sharing based on CR features is needed\n\
    for IoT networks. For (resource/power) constrained IoT devices, simple signal\
    \ processing techniques\nare needed to save energy, and reduce system cost. Hence,\
    \ the simplest non-coherent energy detection\n(as sensing technique) is preferred\
    \ as in the previous research [10,11]. In our proposed system, we also\nconsider\
    \ energy based sensing. Moreover, if IoT devices are restricted to perform the\
    \ sensing procedure\n(due to resource/power constraints), the sensing procedure\
    \ can be employed only for the fusion center\n(FC) [12]. The SUs in CR-IoT exploit\
    \ the spectrum under the interference constraint and ensure\nuninterrupted M2M\
    \ or human-based LTE communications. The CR features also provide a cognitive\n\
    facility to the IoT devices that are required to make smart decisions regarding\
    \ the spectrum and to\nperform intelligent operations by analyzing the network\
    \ conditions. The multi-tiered hierarchy in\nCRNs categorizes users into two types:\
    \ primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs). The DSA\ntechniques enable time\
    \ division multiple access (TDMA)-based spectrum sharing between the PUs\nand\
    \ SUs. However, the spectral efﬁciency (or spectrum utilization) of CRNs depends\
    \ signiﬁcantly\non the successful integration of the PUs and SUs. It requires\
    \ that the SUs be capable of sensing and\nkeeping track of primary transmissions\
    \ precisely. The three main types of DSA-based approaches\nare overlay, underlay,\
    \ and interweave [13–15]. In an underlay approach, the SU and PU can transmit\n\
    simultaneously but with a constraint for the SU to reduce its transmission power\
    \ when the PU is active.\nIn overlay, an SU transmits simultaneously with a PU,\
    \ and assists the primary transmissions with\ncertain relaying techniques. In\
    \ interweave (opportunistic spectrum access (OSA)-based approach),\nan SU exploits\
    \ the spectral opportunities and can transmit only when an idle spectral slot\
    \ is sensed\nto be idle. In Interweave-based CR systems, the SUs exploit the spectral\
    \ opportunities through the\nspectrum sensing. Spectrum sensing is performed either\
    \ independently or in a cooperative manner.\nPerfect spectrum sensing is impossible\
    \ to achieve in the realistic wireless scenarios. Thus, the sensing\nerrors due\
    \ to imperfect sensing must be considered for the precise analysis of the CR-IoT.\
    \ The sensing\nperformance can be enhanced by minimizing the sensing errors. Further,\
    \ the sum rate of the network,\nas well as the utilization for the PU and SU nodes,\
    \ can be improved by choosing the optimal sensing\noperating points under the\
    \ imperfect sensing scenarios [5–7,15,16]. In summary, integrating optimal\nCR\
    \ technology into IoT can alleviate the spectrum scarcity issues and contribute\
    \ in the process of\nIoT developments.\n1.2. Half Duplex (HD) and Full Duplex\
    \ (FD) Radios\nHalf duplex (HD) [16–18], a traditional SD-CRN operation mode,\
    \ is based on a time-slotted\nframe structure where the sensing phase is scheduled\
    \ sequentially with the transmission phase.\nIn HD-CRNs, the node is either in\
    \ the sensing or transmission mode; thus unable to receive and\ntransmit on the\
    \ same frequency simultaneously. An increase in the duration of the sensing phase\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1441\n3 of 18\nreduces the overall system capacity; an increase\
    \ in the duration of the transmission phase impairs the\nsensing accuracy. The\
    \ other drawbacks of HD-based operations include: (i) sacriﬁce of duration for\n\
    the sensing phase in each time slot, (ii) spectrum collision or waste when PUs\
    \ arrive or leave during\nthe transmission phase, and (iii) requirement for transmission\
    \ to be divided into small discontinuous\nslots even if the spectral hole is long\
    \ and continuous. Such limitations in HD-CRNs result in the\ninefﬁcient use of\
    \ system resources. To consider the above limitations, in-band full duplex (FD)\
    \ radios\nhave been proposed [18–20]. The FD-CRNs can simultaneously perform sensing\
    \ and transmission\nin each time slot. The FD-enabled nodes are able to use the\
    \ spectral holes uninterruptedly and\ncontinuously. Interference to the primary\
    \ network is minimized with the continuous sensing in\nFD-CRNs. Thus, FD-CRNs\
    \ have considerable potential to enhance the spectrum utilization and overall\n\
    system capacity. As a downside, FD-CRNs are achieved at a cost of increased energy\
    \ consumption\nand hardware complexity. The major limitation of FD radios is the\
    \ self-interference (SI) of transceivers\nbecause of small spacing and power difference\
    \ between the transmitting and receiving antennas.\nRecent developments in potential\
    \ FD techniques, i.e., SI suppression (SIS) and SI cancellation (SIC)\nhave facilitated\
    \ the implementation of radical FD-CRN systems. However, imperfect SIS and SIC\
    \ are\npractical achievable, resulting in non-zero residual SI power. The performance\
    \ of FD radios highly\ndepends on these SI mitigation capabilities. Excessive\
    \ SI can even result in the reduced capacity for FD\nsystems, even falling below\
    \ that of HD systems [20–22].\nFor ease of reference, we summarize our commonly\

    \ utilization of spectrum (UoS) [5,6]. In [5], the proposed\nstudy was conducted\
    \ for the multichannel scenarios considering imperfect sensing and spectrum\n\
    handoffs. The utilization of spectrum of the SU nodes, opportunistically operating\
    \ on different\nPU channels, was investigated under different PU and SU co-existing\
    \ network topologies. In our\nprevious studies, the UoS was investigated only\
    \ for the HD radios deployed in time-slotted CRNs.\nIn addition, only a one-dimensional\
    \ temporal spectral hole-sensing model was considered for the\nsynchronous PU\
    \ activities. This paper is inspired by the advances in FD techniques, making\
    \ FD-CRN\na potential candidate to complement and sustain the demands of future\
    \ dense IoT network. The main\naspects of the proposed work are as follows:\n\
    1.\nThe realistic small-cell CR-IoT scenario is considered where FD-enabled SU\
    \ transmitters\n(FD-SU TXs) with sensing capabilities are distributed randomly\
    \ across the transmission\nregion of primary network.\nSuch a dense distribution\
    \ of small-cell FD-SU TXs creates\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n4 of 18\nspectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment with different spectral opportunities. In this regards,\nwe propose\
    \ a two-dimensional spatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing model for FD-SU TXs\n\
    deployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment, and incorporate the trafﬁc\
    \ variations\nof PU both in time and space domains.\n2.\nAs a performance metric\
    \ of the spatial–temporal sensing model, we propose and evaluate the\nprobability\
    \ of ﬁnding the non-availability of spatial–temporal spectral holes, and the probability\n\
    of missing the availability of spatial–temporal spectral holes.\n3.\nIncorporating\
    \ the proposed sensing model, we present an analytical formulation and evaluation\n\
    of a UoS scheme for the FD-SU TXs present at different spatial positions. The\
    \ performance of\nUoS scheme is investigated in terms of average number of sensing\
    \ slots used for the successful\nsecondary communication in each time-slotted\
    \ frame.\n1.4. Paper Organization\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as\
    \ follows. In Section 2, the system model is described.\nIn Section 3, we describe\
    \ the proposed spatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing model. Section 4 presents\n\
    the performance metric for the spatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing model. Section\
    \ 5 presents the\nUoS scheme. Section 6 provides the results and discussion. Section\
    \ 7 concludes the paper, and presents\nthe future work.\n2. System Model\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the system model with a PU spectrum occupancy and frame\
    \ structure\nof FD-SU TXs.\n2.1. PU Spectrum Occupancy Model\nWe assume that the\
    \ PU is always authorized to use the channel. The PU trafﬁc across the\nchannel\
    \ is modeled by the discrete-time semi-Markov (two-state) process [22–24], as\
    \ shown in Figure 1.\nWithout loss of generality, it is assumed that the durations\
    \ of the OFF and ON states are represented\nby the random variables (RVs) A and\
    \ B, respectively. The RVs A and B follow exponential distribution\nwith mean\
    \ durations R and S, respectively. These distributions are to be independent.\
    \ At any time,\nthe probabilities that the PU is in ON or OFF state are given\
    \ by PON = S/S + R, and POFF = R/R +\nS, respectively.\nFigure 1. Activity model\
    \ for primary user (PU).\n2.2. Frame Structure of FD-SU TXs\nThe FD-SU TXs consist\
    \ of imperfect SIS enabled narrowband antennas, i.e., Ant − 1 and Ant − 2.\nAs\
    \ shown in Figure 2, Ant − 1 (a receive antenna) performs the sensing procedure\
    \ to locate the\nspectral holes and Ant − 2 (a transmit antenna) transmits when\
    \ spectral holes are available [22–26].\nIn traditional time-slotted FD frame\
    \ structure, sensing procedure is continuous, i.e., extends to the\nentire duration.\
    \ The drawbacks of such frame structure are: (i) change of PU state needs to be\
    \ consider\nin the sensing procedure when PU and SU are not synchronized (PU state,\
    \ in each frame, is not\nconsistent), which normally degrades the detection performance\
    \ [25], and (ii) time required to make a\ndecision regarding the presence of PU\
    \ extends to the entire time-slotted frame [26]. The considered\ntime-slotted\
    \ frame structure for FD-SU TX is shown in Figure 3, in which sensing duration\
    \ is divided\ninto n consecutive short sensing slots (labelled as TS.0, TS.1,...\
    \ and TS.n−1), and a sensing procedure\nis performed at each sensing slot. It\
    \ is assumed that the sensing-slots (in each time-slotted frame)\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1441\n5 of 18\nare of same duration. The number of samples in each sensing-slot\
    \ is N, and is expressed as M/n,\nwhere M is the number of total samples in each\
    \ time-slotted frame. The constraint for an asynchronized\ncase is much relax\
    \ as the duration of each sensing-slot is shorter. Therefore, a consistent PU\
    \ state,\nin each sensing-slot, is a more realistic assumption than in the traditional\
    \ time-slotted FD frame\nstructure, and is considered in the proposed system.\
    \ The initial (ﬁrst) sensing-slot in each time-slotted\nframe is HD (FD-SU TX\
    \ performs sensing only) to avoid collision at the start. If a PU is not detected\n\
    at the end of HD sensing slot (TS.0 in Figure 3), FD-SU TX initiates its transmission\
    \ and sensing\nsimultaneously. If a PU is detected at the end of HD sensing slot,\
    \ FD-SU TX do not transmit and\ncontinue to perform the sensing procedure until\
    \ channel is available in the next time-slotted frame\n(which also starts with\
    \ a HD sensing-slot). The reason of continuous sensing is that we do not introduce\n\
    any switching mechanism for sensing procedure at the receiving antennas of resource\
    \ constraint IoT\ndevices (FD-SU TXs). Similarly, if a PU is detected at the end\
    \ of any FD sensing slot, FD-SU TX aborts\nits transmission until the next time-slotted\
    \ frame. The motivation behind the considered time-slotted\nframe structure is\
    \ to account for the tradeoff between the sensing efﬁciency and timelines in detecting\n\
    the PU. An increment in the duration of sensing slots reduces sensing errors;\
    \ however, it increases\nthe delay of detecting the PU. Conversely, a reduction\
    \ in the duration of sensing slots reduces the\ndelay of detecting the PU, with\
    \ the cost of increased sensing errors. The sensed signal during the\nFD sensing\
    \ slots (TS.1–TS.n−1 in Figure 3) is corrupted by a self-interference signal.\
    \ The formulation\nof the sensing procedure at FD-SU TX is considered for both\
    \ types of sensing slots: (i) HD sensing\nslots (when FD-SU TX is not transmitting)\
    \ and (ii) FD sensing slots (when FD-SU TX is transmitting).\nThe energy detection\
    \ (ED) scheme is most commonly used for channel sensing because of its low\ncomputational\
    \ and implementation complexities. Moreover, it does not require prior knowledge\
    \ of\nthe PU signal parameters [24–32]. The secondary network does not guarantee\
    \ on-time services, i.e.,\nquality of service (QoS) is not guaranteed. Hence,\
    \ it is assumed that the considered FD-SU TX always\nhas packets to transmit [27].\n\

    \ (FD-SU TX).\nFigure 3. Time-slotted frame structure of FD-SU TXs.\n3. Spatial–Temporal\
    \ Spectral Hole-Sensing Model\nIn this section, we formulate a spatial–temporal\
    \ spectral hole-sensing model for FD-SU TXs\ndeployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment. As shown in Figure 4, we consider a\nprimary network, i.e., a single\
    \ primary transmitter (PU-TX), multiple primary receivers (PU-RXs),\nand a secondary\
    \ network, i.e., z number of IoT devices or FD-SU pairs (FD-SU TXs and FD-SU\n\
    RXs) [5,10,16]. The proposed system can be considered for both downlink and uplink\
    \ scenarios, i.e.,\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n6 of 18\nPU-TX as base station (BS)\
    \ and mobile station (MS). Because there is no difference in the sensing\nof PU\
    \ signal at a given time and frequency, the results of the paper are valid for\
    \ both scenarios.\nThe proposed system depends only on the transmission range\
    \ of PU-TX, and do not depend on the\nnumber of PU-RXs. The performance of channel\
    \ sensing in temporal domain with multiple PUs has\nbeen proposed [33]. However,\
    \ the authors did not consider the variation of signal power of each PU-TX\ndue\
    \ to the presence of active surrounding PU-TXs. Given the stochastic nature of\
    \ PU ON/OFF pattern,\nthe analytical modelling of (two dimensional) spatial-temporal\
    \ spectral holes sensing framework in the\npresence of multiple PUs is challenging.\
    \ To the best of our knowledge, the analysis of spatial–temporal\nspectral holes\
    \ with multiple PU-TXs has not been addressed [29–32]. The spectrum sensing system\n\
    model [33] with multiple PUs can be extended for the temporal-spatial analysis.\
    \ However, we consider\na single user primary network as the main contribution\
    \ of the proposed work is to consider the trafﬁc\nvariations of PU in both time\
    \ and space domains, and characterize and evaluate the sensing and UoS\nperformance\
    \ of FD-SU pairs present at different spatial positions. The consideration of\
    \ multiple PUs\n(cellular users) is added in the future work. In the proposed\
    \ work, a single PU-TX case is based on the\nassumption that a single PU-TX has\
    \ a much higher signal power than any other PU-TXs (in a given\nfrequency and\
    \ time) in the considered geographical area. Moreover, the transmission range\
    \ of the\nprimary network is much greater than the secondary IoT network employing\
    \ low power transmission.\nIn addition, secondary receivers only sense the signal\
    \ energy, i.e., do not distinguish (decode) the\nsignals from different PU-TXs.\
    \ Therefore, we can realistically assume that any FD-SU pair is effected\nby a\
    \ single PU-TX. We also consider that a single FD-SU pair is assigned to a time-slotted\
    \ primary\nchannel at a time. Hence, the proposed model do not include the scheduling\
    \ mechanism between the\nFD-SU TXs, and only considers the transmission-scheduling\
    \ of the individual FD-SU pairs in each\ntime slot (illustrated in Figure 3).\
    \ At a given time and frequency band, we consider only one SU\npair by assuming\
    \ the orthogonal multiple access, e.g., TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA. We considers that all\n\
    the FD-SU TXs are equipped with the sensing capability. The transmission radius\
    \ of an FD-SU TX\nis r0. The transmission region of the PU (with radius D1 from\
    \ PU-TX) is R1, and is determined by\nthe receiving sensitivity of PU [29,30].\
    \ If a primary receiver (PU-RX) is outside R1, it will not work\nproperly. The\
    \ FD-SU pairs are randomly distributed in an area (with radius D2 from PU-TX),\
    \ which is\nclosely related to the sensing sensitivity of FD-SU TXs. Any FD-SU\
    \ TX, outside this area, will not be\nable to detect the primary signal. The R2\
    \ is the region outside of R1. We considers a typical scenario\n(i.e., D2 > D1),\
    \ in which FD-SU TXs have a higher sensing sensitivity than the receiver sensitivity\n\
    of PU-RXs (to avoid interference with the primary transmission) [29–33]. Interference\
    \ to the PU-RX\nis not permitted. Hence, FD-SU TXs in R1 have the temporal spectral\
    \ opportunities only, and the\ntrafﬁc variations of PU are considered in the time\
    \ domain. The FD-SU TXs in R2 have the spatial\nspectral opportunities (can access\
    \ the channel anytime). However, FD-SU TXs lose their spatial spectral\nopportunities\
    \ when detect a PU-TX. The FD-SU TXs in R2, near to the PU-RXs, can cause harmful\n\
    interference and are referred to be present in the NC Region. The NC Region is\
    \ determined by the\ninterference constraint from the PU-RXs, and the peak transmission\
    \ power of the FD-SU TXs [29].\nAn appropriate power control, which is beyond\
    \ the scope of this paper, is an essential requirement to\nallow these FD-SU TXs\
    \ to exploit their spectral opportunities. Hence, FD-SU TXs in the NC Region are\n\
    not considered in the proposed work.\nIn the considered network, there are two\
    \ potential signal sources, i.e., PU-TX and FD-SU TX. Thus,\nwe deﬁne four tests\
    \ of the hypothesis as follows,\n•\nH00\nPU-TX is OFF and FD-SU TX is not transmitting.\n\
    •\nH01\nPU-TX is ON and FD-SU TX is not transmitting.\n•\nH10\nPU-TX is OFF and\
    \ FD-SU TX is transmitting.\n•\nH11\nPU-TX is ON and FD-SU TX is transmitting.\n\

    \ Gaussian random variable with zero mean and\nvariance σ2\ng1. In (1) and (2),\
    \ i = 0, 1... N – 1 is the sample index.\nIn general, the traditional spatial\
    \ spectral holes for SU node can be expressed as the following\nhypothesis-testing\
    \ problem [29–32],\n(\nSA :\nSU node is present in R2\nSB :\nSU node is present\
    \ in R1,\n(3)\nwhere hypothesis SA denotes the availability of spatial spectral\
    \ holes, and hypothesis SB denotes the\nnon-availability of spatial spectral holes.\n\
    From a joint (two-dimensional) sensing perspective, spatial–temporal spectral\
    \ holes for SU node\ncan be described as the following hypothesis testing problem\
    \ [29–32],\n(\nOA :\nH0 ∪ SA\nOB :\nH1 ∩ SB,\n(4)\nwhere OA denotes the case where\
    \ spatial–temporal spectral holes are available, either because of the\nabsence\
    \ of PU (H0), or the PU is present and the SU node locates in R2 (SA). Similarly,\
    \ OB denotes the\ncase that spatial–temporal spectral holes are not available\
    \ because of the presence of PU (H1) and the\nSU node locates in R1 (SB).\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1441\n8 of 18\nConsidering Equations (1), (2), and (4), we model the\
    \ availability of spatial–temporal spectral\nholes for FD-SU TX as the following\

    \ + g1s2(i) + n(i)\n{H11} ,\nSA,\n(6)\nwhere O0\nA denotes the availability of\
    \ spatial–temporal spectral holes during HD sensing slots either\nbecause of H00,\
    \ or H01 and FD-SU TX is present in R2 (SA). Similarly, O1\nA denotes the availability\
    \ of\nspatial–temporal spectral holes during FD sensing slots either because of\
    \ H10, or H11 and FD-SU TX is\npresent in R2 (SA).\nConsidering Equations (1),\
    \ (2), and (4), we now model the non-availability of spatial–temporal\nspectral\
    \ holes for FD-SU TX as the following composite hypothesis testing problems\n\
    O0\nB : S(i) =\nn\nh1s1(i) + n(i)\n{H01} ,\nSB,\n(7)\nO1\nB : S(i) =\nn\nh1s1(i)\

    \ of spatial–temporal spectral holes during HD sensing slots\nbecause of H01 and\

    of spatial–temporal spectral holes during FD sensing slots because of H11 and\
    \ FD-SU TX\nis present in R1 (SB).\nIt can be observed that the availability/non-availability\
    \ of spatial–temporal spectral holes (during\nHD and FD sensing slots) in Equations\
    \ (5)–(8) is a combination of availability/non-availability of\npure temporal\
    \ and spatial spectral holes in Equations (1)–(4). However, spatial–temporal spectral\n\
    hole-sensing model incorporates the trafﬁc variations of the PU in both domains\
    \ (time and space) for\nthe FD-SU TXs present at different spatial positions.\n\
    4. Performance Metric for Spatial–Temporal Spectral Hole-Sensing Model\nIn this\
    \ section, we introduce the performance metric to guide the spatial–temporal spectral\n\
    hole-sensing model. Closed-form expressions of sensing probabilities are proposed.\
    \ The sensing\nprobabilities are: (i) the probability of ﬁnding the non-availability\
    \ of spatial–temporal spectral holes\nand (ii) the probability of missing the\
    \ availability of spatial–temporal spectral holes.\nThe probabilities of ﬁnding\

    \ during HD and\nFD sensing-slots, respectively.\nBased on the detail derivation\
    \ in [29] and extending it separately for HD and FD sensing slots,\nthe probabilities\
    \ of ﬁnding the non-availability of spatial–temporal spectral holes are expressed\
    \ by the\ntemporal states of the PU and the spatial positions of FD-SU TX as\n\

    \ of ﬁnding the non-availability of spatial–temporal spectral\nholes (P0\nF.nST,\
    \ and P1\nF.nST) are related to the FD-SU TXs in R1 only, because the FD-SU TXs\
    \ in R2 have\nspatial spectral holes, i.e., can access the channel anytime. The\
    \ probabilities of missing the availability\nof spatial–temporal spectral holes\
    \ (P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST) for the FD-SU TXs in R1 are determined by the\nOFF\
    \ state of the PU, and are represented with an event that the FD-SU TX detects\
    \ the presence of the\nPU when the PU is in OFF state, i.e., temporal false alarms.\
    \ Furthermore, P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST for the\nFD-SU TXs in R2 are determined\
    \ by each state of the PU, i.e., ON, and OFF states, and are represented\nwith\
    \ the following two events; (i) FD-SU TX determines the presence of PU when PU\
    \ is in the OFF\nstate, i.e., temporal false alarms, and (ii) FD-SU TX determines\
    \ the presence of the PU when the PU is\nin the ON state, i.e., spatial false\

    Based on the proposed spatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing model in Section\
    \ 3, we present an\nanalytical formulation and evaluation of the UoS scheme for\
    \ the FD-SU TXs deployed at different\nspatial positions in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment.\nThe UoS performance was\nevaluated by determining the average\
    \ number of sensing slots, (τ), used for the successful secondary\ncommunication\
    \ in each time-slotted frame. Because a dense small-cell scenario is considered,\
    \ i.e.,\nr0 << D1, the UoS performance was evaluated for two possible cases, as\
    \ shown in Figure 5. The cases\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n11 of 18\nare: (i) the\
    \ FD-SU TX is present in R1 (FD-SU pair is completely inside the transmission\
    \ range of PU)\nand (ii) the FD-SU TX is present in R2 (FD-SU pair is completely\
    \ outside the transmission range of\nPU). As explained earlier, the ﬁrst sensing\
    \ slot in each time-slotted frame is always HD, i.e., FD-SU\nTX only performs\
    \ the sensing procedure. If the PU is not detected at the end of HD sensing slot,\n\
    the FD-SU TX initiates its transmission and sensing simultaneously. If the PU\
    \ is detected at the end of\nHD (or any FD) sensing slot, the FD-SU TX do not\
    \ transmit (or stops transmission) until the next cycle\n(time-slotted frame).\n\
    Figure 5. Considered cases of FD-SU TXs.\nThe probability of detecting the spatial–temporal\
    \ spectral holes during HD and FD sensing slots\ndepends on the sensing outcome,\
    \ the PU activity, and the spatial position of FD-SU TX. The probability\nof detecting\
    \ the spatial–temporal spectral holes in only ﬁrst k number of sensing slots in\
    \ each\ntime-slotted frame can be deﬁned as\nPST−h (k) = PA (k) − PB (k + 1) .\n\
    (28)\nHere, PA (k) refers to the possible scenarios where spatial–temporal spectral\
    \ holes are detected\nin greater or equal to k number of sensing slots. Similarly,\
    \ PB (k + 1) refers to the possible scenarios\nwhere spatial–temporal spectral\
    \ holes are detected in greater or equal to k + 1 number of sensing slots.\nHence,\
    \ PA (k) can be expressed as\nPA (k) =\n\x10\n1 − P0\nMi.ST\n\x11\nk\n∑\nj=1\n\
    \x10\n1 − P1\nMi.ST\n\x11j\n.\n(29)\nThe probabilities of missing the availability\
    \ of spatial–temporal spectral holes (P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST)\nfor FD-SU TX\
    \ in R2 are determined by each state of the PU, and involve both temporal and\
    \ spatial\n(excessive) false alarms. Conversely, P0\nMi.ST and P1\nMi.ST for FD-SU\
    \ TX in R1 involve only temporal false\nalarms. It is assumed that all FD-SU TXs\
    \ are synchronous to their corresponding receivers, and initiates\ntransmission\
    \ and reception at the same time.\nA channel error occurs when the received SNR,\
    \ because of path loss or deep fading, falls below\nthe considered threshold [5,13].\
    \ We consider the same bit error rate (BER) in each time-slotted frame.\nHence,\
    \ the number of transmitted bits is adjusted as per the k number of sensing slots\
    \ in each\ntime-slotted frame. The probability of obtaining an errored secondary\
    \ packet, owing to channel errors,\ncan be expressed as [5]\nPE = 1 −\nh\n(1 −\
    \ BER (γs))kPSi\n,\n(30)\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n12 of 18\nwhere kPS is the packet\
    \ size, i.e., transmitted number of bits in k number of sensing-slots, γs is the\n\
    SNR of the secondary transmission, and BER is the bit error rate for the considered\
    \ secondary channel,\nand can be expressed as [5]\nBER (γs) =\n1\n4γs\n.\n(31)\n\
    In our work, we assume that the UoS is contributed to only during the sensing\
    \ slots during which\nFD-SU TXs detect the state of the considered channel correctly.\
    \ Moreover, the access contention for the\nFD-SU TXs is also not considered.\n\
    From Equations (28)–(30), the average number of sensing slots used for a successful\
    \ secondary\ncommunication in each time-slotted frame can be deﬁned as\nτ =\n\
    ∞\n∑\nk=1\nkPST−h (k) (1 − PE (k))\n(32)\n6. Results and Discussion\n6.1. Simulation\
    \ Setup\nIn this section, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance\
    \ of proposed\nspatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing model and UoS scheme for\
    \ FD-SU TXs with different temporal\nstates and spatial positions. In our simulation\
    \ setup, the transmission range of the PU node and\nsensing range of the FD-SU\
    \ TXs were varied to allow different values of probabilities and sensing\nparameters.\
    \ To obtain the numerical results, the key parameters were chosen as follows:\
    \ kPS = 1000 bits\nfor k = 1 and BER = 0.00025. The power of the primary and secondary\
    \ transmissions was set to be\n20 dB and 10 dB, respectively. The variance of\
    \ the sensing channel was set to σ2\nh1 = 0.001, and hence,\nthe instantaneous\
    \ sensing SNR was −10 dB. The values of the SIS factor (X) were considered to\
    \ be in\nthe range 0.001–0.3. To provide the desired protection level to the PU,\
    \ the probabilities of ﬁnding the\nnon-availability of spatial–temporal spectral\
    \ holes during HD and FD sensing slots (\nP0 ¯\nF.nST, and\nP1 ¯\nF.nST)\nwere\
    \ considered to be in the range 0.7–0.9. Unless otherwise stated, a fair model\
    \ of PU the status, i.e.,\nPON = POFF = 0.5 was considered. The values of these\
    \ parameters were set accordingly to validate the\nchannels characteristics and\
    \ network behavior.\n6.2. Simulation Results\nFigures 6 and 7 show the sensing\
    \ performance during HD and FD sensing slots, respectively,\nin term of the probabilities\
    \ of ﬁnding the non-availability of spatial–temporal spectral holes,\nand the\
    \ probabilities of missing the availability of spatial–temporal spectral holes.\
    \ There was no\nself-interference signal during HD sensing slots. However, the\
    \ sensed signal during FD sensing\nslots was corrupted with the self-interference\
    \ signal as FD-SU TX was transmitting simultaneously.\nThe results indicate the\
    \ existence of different spatial and temporal spectral opportunities for FD-SU\n\
    TXs present at different spatial positions in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment.\
    \ It can be\nobserved that the probabilities of missing the availability of spatial–temporal\
    \ spectral holes during\nHD and FD sensing slots (P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST) was\
    \ always greater for FD-SU TXs in R2 than those\nin R1. This is because the P0\n\
    Mi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST for FD-SU TX in R2 involves spatial (excessive) false\nalarms,\
    \ determined by ON state of the PU. In detail, temporal false alarms for FD-SU\
    \ TXs (R1 and\nR2) arose because of the miss-detection of the absence of a PU.\
    \ The spatial false alarms for FD-SU\nTXs in R2 arose because of the detection\
    \ of presence of a PU despite the fact that the FD-SU TX\nis outside the transmission\
    \ region. The spatial and temporal false alarms depend on the usage\nof channel\
    \ by the PU, and number of sensing samples, respectively. It can be observed that\
    \ the\nreduced use of channel by the PU and a greater number of sensing samples\
    \ result in fewer spatial and\ntemporal false alarms, respectively, and results\
    \ in the improved spatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing\nperformance. The inﬂuence\
    \ of different INRs in terms of SIS factors (X) over the spatial–temporal\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1441\n13 of 18\nspectral hole-sensing performance is shown in Figure\
    \ 7. The temporal false alarms increased with\nX, which is intuitive because X\
    \ increases the interference power. Thus, our results illustrate the\nrequirement\
    \ for identifying the optimal range of the secondary transmit power to obtain\
    \ the desired\nspatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing performance.\nFigure 6.\
    \ Sensing performance of spatial–temporal spectral holes during the half duplex\

    \ of 18\nFigures 8 and 9 illustrate the performance of the UoS scheme, and show\
    \ the average number\nof sensing slots used for the successful secondary communication\
    \ (in each time-slotted frame).\nThe performance of the UoS scheme was investigated\
    \ for different PU active state probabilities\n(PON), SIS factors, and QoS constraints\
    \ (\nP0 ¯\nF.nST, and\nP1 ¯\nF.nST). In Figures 8 and 9, the QoS constraints\n\
    (during HD and FD sensing-slots) were set to 0.9, and 0.7, respectively. Reduced\
    \ QoS constraints\nmeans less protection to the PU and more spectral opportunities\
    \ for FD-SU TXs (R1 and R2), and hence,\naverage number of sensing slots used\
    \ for the successful secondary communication increases. In detail,\nthe results\
    \ show the reduction in the average number of successful secondary communicating\
    \ sensing\nslots with the usage of channel by the PU node, considering a ﬁxed\
    \ PU mean OFF duration (R).\nThe reason is that the spectral opportunities (spatial\
    \ and temporal) decrease under the considered\nscenario. The average number of\
    \ successful secondary communicating sensing slots also reduced\nwith the SIS\
    \ factors owing to the increase in temporal and spatial false alarms. The results\
    \ validate\nthe existence of different spectral opportunities in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment by\ndemonstrating different average number of communicating sensing\
    \ slots for R1 and R2. Importantly,\nthe average number of successful secondary\
    \ communicating sensing slots for FD-SU TX in R1 was less\nthan that of R2. This\
    \ is because FD-SU TX in R2 can continue to avail the spatial spectral opportunities\n\
    even when PU is in ON state, which is not the case for FD-SU TX in R1. Hence,\
    \ our results validate the\nrequirements for the optimal performance of the UoS\
    \ in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment.\nFigure 8. Average number of secondary\
    \ communicating sensing slots with different PU active state\nprobabilities and\
    \ SIS factors.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n15 of 18\nFigure 9. Average number of\
    \ secondary communicating sensing slots with different PU active state\nprobabilities\
    \ and SIS factors (at different quality of service (QoS) constraint).\nIn Figure\
    \ 10, the performance of the UoS scheme, in terms of average number of sensing\
    \ slots\nused for the successful secondary communication (in each time-slotted\
    \ frame), is investigated under\ndifferent PU mean inactive durations (R) and\
    \ SIS factors. The QoS constraints for the probability of\nﬁnding the non-availability\
    \ of spatial–temporal spectral holes (during HD and FD sensing-slots) were\nset\
    \ to 0.9. The PU active state probability was considered to be 0.1. The results\
    \ again demonstrate\nthe existence of different spectral opportunities in CR-IoT\
    \ spectrum-heterogeneous environment,\nand validate the average number of successful\
    \ secondary communicating sensing slots for temporal\nand spatial spectral holes.\
    \ Importantly, it can be observed that the average number of sensing slots\nused\
    \ for the successful secondary communication for all FD-SU TXs (R1 and R2) increased\
    \ as R\nincreased. The reason is that the increase in R at ﬁxed PU states probabilities\
    \ (PON and POFF) and\nduration of sensing slots means more sensing slots with\
    \ temporal and spatial spectral holes. Hence,\nthe average number of successful\
    \ secondary communicating sensing slots increased. Our results help\nto identify\
    \ the ranges of PU mean durations and SIS factors, subject to the spatial positions\
    \ of FD-SU\nTXs, for the required sensing performance in spatial and temporal\
    \ domains.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n16 of 18\nFigure 10. Average number of secondary\

    7. Conclusions\nCRNs are designed to manage radio resources efﬁciently by utilizing\
    \ the spectral holes in\nlicensed frequency bands. The in-band FD technology,\
    \ a new paradigm for CRNs, allows SUs to\nsimultaneously sense and access the\
    \ spectral holes. However, the efﬁcient sharing of spectrum\nbetween the dynamic\
    \ PU and FD-enabled SU transmitters (FD-SU TXs), in dense small-cell IoT\nscenarios,\
    \ presents challenges that must be addressed. The random and dense distribution\
    \ of FD-SU\nTXs with sensing capabilities creates heterogeneous environments with\
    \ temporal and spatial spectral\nopportunities. In this regard, we considered\
    \ the trafﬁc variations of the PU both in time and space\ndomains, and proposed\
    \ a two-dimensional spatial and temporal spectral hole-sensing model for the\n\
    FD-SU TXs deployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment. Incorporating\
    \ the proposed\nsensing model, an analytical formulation and evaluation of the\
    \ UoS scheme was proposed for\ndifferent FD-SU TXs. The performance of the UoS\
    \ scheme was investigated in terms of average\nnumber of sensing slots used for\
    \ the successful secondary communication in each time-slotted frame.\nThe numerical\
    \ results validated the inﬂuence of different network and sensing parameters over\
    \ the\nproposed spatial–temporal spectral hole-sensing model and UoS scheme. In\
    \ the future work, we can\nextend the proposed approach by considering the temporal\
    \ and spatial variations of idle channels in\nmore complicated IoT-CRN scenarios\
    \ such as full duplex (cooperative) or ARQ/HARQ enabled SU\nnodes co-exist with\
    \ the multiple PU-TXs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization & Methodology,\

    \ has led to a \ndire shortage of this indispensable resource. Furthermore, with\
    \ \nthe tremendous growth of wireless applications, this problem is \nintensified\
    \ as the unlicensed frequency spectrum becomes \novercrowded and unable to meet\
    \ the requirement of emerging \nradio devices operating at higher data rates.\
    \ Additionally, the \nalready assigned spectrum is underutilized. That has prompted\
    \ \nresearchers to look for a way to address spectrum scarcity and \nenable efficient\
    \ use of the available spectrum. In this context, \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\
    \ has been proposed as a \npotential means to overcome this issue by introducing\
    \ \nopportunistic usage to less congested portions of the licensed \nspectrum.\

    \ spectrum represents a scarce and finite \nresource that is used for transmitting\
    \ information in the radio \nenvironment. This resource is used by several services,\
    \ \nincluding radiocommunication, radio broadcasting, maritime \nradio, and satellite\
    \ communications. \nAt the national level, the assignment of this spectrum to\
    \ \nthese services is managed and regulated by local authorities \n(governmental\
    \ agencies) that are responsible for determining \nthe appropriate frequency band,\
    \ the geographical extent of the \nuse of this band, the maximum transmission\
    \ power, etc. One of \nthe fundamental purposes of these agencies is to ensure\
    \ a \nminimum interference level between the different radio \ntechnologies. \n\
    At the global level, the International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU) organizes,\
    \ every three to four years, the world \nradiocommunication conferences (WRC)\
    \ 1so as to examine and \nrevise the treaties governing the use of the radio frequency\
    \ \nspectrum. \nNevertheless, the static spectrum allocation strategy \nadopted,\
    \ where spectral frequency bands allocated to a wireless \ncommunication system\
    \ can only be used by that system, has \ncaused the shortage of frequencies. This\
    \ shortage is confronted \nwith a strong demand for spectrum resulting from the\
    \ \nemergence and abundance of wireless technologies and the \nextremely rapid\
    \ proliferation of radio applications developed in \nthe scope of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT). \nIn addition, while unlicensed bands like ISM (Industrial,\
    \ \nScientific, and Medical) bands can be freely used by all radios \nrespecting\
    \ a specific set of rules, such as a shared channel \naccess mechanism and a maximum\
    \ power per Hertz , they have \nbecome very crowded and can’t accommodate more\
    \ wireless \napplications [1]. \nOn the other hand, the already assigned spectrum\
    \ is \ninefficiently used in all domains, such as the time domain, the \nspace\
    \ domain, and the frequency domain, as shown in Fig. 1. \nThis was confirmed by\
    \ the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC), which reported in 2002 that the\
    \ radio \nspectrum, in most of the time, was from 15% up to 85% \nunderutilized\
    \ [2]. \nAs a result, it has been found that while some bands are \novercrowded,\
    \ such as those bands used by cellular base \nstations, many other bands are not\
    \ in use or are used only for \nshort periods [2]. \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\
    \ has been commonly \nregarded as an efficient solution to address the above-\n\
    mentioned issues by enabling the opportunistic usage of the \nfrequency bands\
    \ that are not heavily occupied by licensed users \n[3,4]. \n1 https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/wrc-19\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 1. Spectrum Utilization\
    \ [3]. \nA Cognitive Radio represents a Software Defined Radio \n(SDR) system\
    \ [5] capable of exploring the radio environment, \nlearning, and deciding to\
    \ use the unoccupied portions of the \nspectrum, called \"spectrum holes\" or\
    \ \"white spaces\", and \nconsequently \nof \ndynamically \nadjusting \nits \n\
    operating \nparameters, based on the decisions made. These decisions must \nimperatively\
    \ take into account the impact on the primary users \n(PUs), which have a license\
    \ on the chosen spectrum and have \nthe higher priority to access it, in order\
    \ not to cause them \nharmful interference. Unlicensed users, which use Cognitive\
    \ \nRadio to access the spectrum, are referred to as secondary users \n(SUs).\
    \ \nFurthermore, the transition from analog to digital television \nhas released\
    \ many frequencies, known as TV white spaces, \nwhich have too high propagation\
    \ and penetration qualities [6]. \nFor this reason, the FCC authorized in 2008\
    \ the use of these \nfrequencies by non-licensed users following a list of rules\
    \ like \nusing the geo-location capability to obtain the available TV \nbands,\
    \ from White Space DataBase (WSDB), before operating \n[7–9]. That has created\
    \ a lot of opportunities for Cognitive \nradio users. \nThe remarkable contribution\
    \ of this promising technology \nto the efficient use of spectrum, the minimization\
    \ of \ninterference, the reduction of cost, etc., has pushed its use in \nseveral\
    \ areas, namely the Internet of Things (IoT). \nThe main objective of this paper\
    \ is to provide a \ncomprehensive survey of Cognitive radio with a particular\
    \ \nfocus given to: \n• Software Defined Radio, as it is the building block of\
    \ \nCognitive Radio system; \n• Spectrum sensing, as one of the most important\
    \ pillars \nto set up a Cognitive Radio system; \n• CR-Based IoT, given that Cognitive\
    \ Radio is one of the \nimportant enabler technologies of IoT. \nTo the best of\
    \ our knowledge, in the literature, there is no \nsuch work that gives a comprehensive\
    \ survey of the three \naforementioned aspects, highlights the relation between\
    \ them, \nand exhibits the future research directions to handle their \nchallenges\
    \ in a single paper. The existing surveys dealt only \nwith a particular aspect.\
    \ \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \nSection II gives the\
    \ fundamentals of Cognitive Radio \ntechnology. Section III exhibits an overview\
    \ of Software \nDefined Radio and its different challenges. Section IV provides\
    \ \na detailed view of spectrum sensing and its challenges. Section \nV highlights\
    \ the use of Cognitive Radio in IoT. Finally, this \narticle is concluded in Section\
    \ VI. \nII. COGNITIVE RADIO FUNDAMENTALS \nCognitive Radio technology was first\
    \ introduced by Joseph \nMitola in 1999 to depict an intelligent radio system\
    \ capable of \nreconfiguring dynamically its radio parameters according to its\
    \ \noperational environment and to the user’s QoS requirements \n[4]. Afterward,\
    \ Cognitive Radio has been defined in many \nways by different entities and researchers.\
    \ The Federal \nCommunications Commission defined CR as follows: \n“Cognitive\
    \ radio: A radio or system that senses its operational \nelectromagnetic environment\
    \ and can dynamically and \nautonomously adjust its radio operating parameters\
    \ to modify \nsystem operation, such as maximize throughput, mitigate \ninterference,\
    \ facilitate interoperability, access secondary \nmarkets.” [10]. \nMoreover,\
    \ Simon Haykin defined CR as “an intelligent \nwireless communication system,\
    \ capable of being aware of its \nenvironment, learning, and adaptively changing\
    \ its operating \nparameters (e.g., transmit-power, carrier-frequency, and \n\
    modulation strategy) in real-time for providing reliable \ncommunication (anytime\
    \ and anywhere) and efficient \nutilization of the radio spectrum” [11]. \nAs\
    \ mentioned in the above definitions, the main \ncharacteristics of Cognitive\
    \ Radio are cognitive capability and \nreconfigurability [3,11]. \nThanks to the\
    \ cognitive capability feature, the CR user can \nsense and collect information\
    \ related to its radio environment \nand choose the best channel to use. The collected\
    \ information \nmainly involves transmission frequency, power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. \nThe reconfigurability feature allows CR users to adjust \nautomatically\
    \ its operating parameters (transmission frequency, \nmodulation, power, etc.)\
    \ based on the gathered information and \nwithout the need to change the hardware.\
    \ Hence an efficient \nand effective Cognitive Radio system is imperatively built\
    \ on \nSoftware Defined Radio platform. The latter will be briefly \nreviewed\
    \ in the next section. \nA. Dynamic Spectrum Access \nBy means of Dynamic Spectrum\
    \ Access (DSA) techniques, \nCognitive Radio enables secondary users to use the\
    \ unoccupied \nportions of licensed spectrum which are known as spectrum \nholes\
    \ or white spaces. When a primary user appears, the \nsecondary user vacates the\
    \ current band and moves to another \nspectrum hole or keeps transmitting on the\
    \ same band and \nadjusting its transmission power level or modulation scheme\
    \ in \norder not to cause any harmful interference to the licensed user \nor affect\
    \ its QoS as illustrated in Fig. 2 [3]. \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 2. Spectrum Hole Concept [3]. \nThere are three\
    \ DSA approaches that the SUs can use to \ndynamically access the available spectral\
    \ opportunities: \nunderlay, interweave, and overlay [12]. \n1) Spectrum underlay:\
    \ In the underlay transmission mode, \nthe SU can coexist with the PU as long\
    \ as the SU operates \nbelow the noise floor of the PU. In other words, the \n\
    coexistence between the SU and the PU may occur if only the \ninterference caused\
    \ by the SU at the PU receiver remains \nunder a predefined threshold, known as\
    \ the “interference \ntemperature” [13,14]. To meet the interference threshold\
    \ \nrequirement, SU can use some techniques such as spreading \nits signal over\
    \ a wide bandwidth below the noise floor of the \nPU or using multiple antennas\
    \ to direct its signals away from \nthe PU receiver [15]. \nMoreover, in the case\
    \ of the underlay approach, the \nspectrum sensing process is not required and\
    \ the SUs can \ntransmit the data over the spectrum even if it is occupied all\
    \ the \ntime by the PUs. Therefore, this paradigm is more appropriate \nto use\
    \ in situations when the spectrum usage status of PUs \nchanges rapidly [12].\
    \ \nNevertheless, meeting the interference constraint forces the \nSU to limit\
    \ its transmission power and consequently to operate \nover a small coverage.\
    \ \n2) Spectrum interweave: As regards the interweave \ntransmission mode, it\
    \ stands for the opportunistic usage of the \navailable spectrum holes which was\
    \ the major motivation \nbehind the introduction of the Cognitive Radio technology\
    \ \n[16]. This paradigm mandates that SUs should have only \naccess to the unoccupied\
    \ spectrum resources. Thus, spectrum \nsensing is needed to identify the vacant\
    \ spectrum bands that \nare not currently occupied by the PUs. \nFurthermore,\
    \ in this case, harmful interferences to PUs are \navoided due to the fact that\
    \ SUs do not transmit concurrently \nwith the PUs. Whereas, the constant tracking\
    \ of spectrum \nopportunities is a challenging task, especially in rapidly \n\
    changing environments in terms of spectrum occupancy. \nHence, this approach is\
    \ more adequate for slowly changing \nenvironments [12,17]. \nConcerning power\
    \ resources, they are only limited by the \nrange of the identified spectrum holes.\
    \ \nIt is also worth noting that this class of dynamic spectrum \naccess is also\
    \ referred to as opportunistic spectrum access [18]. \n3) Spectrum \noverlay:\
    \ \nIn \nrespect \nto \nthe \noverlay \ntransmission mode, it is like the underlay\
    \ approach in that \nboth approaches allow SUs to simultaneously transmit with\
    \ \nPUs. However, in the overlay mode, SUs can transmit at any \npower without\
    \ a predefined interference threshold constraint. \nMoreover, in this paradigm,\
    \ the performance of the PU \nshouldn't be negatively affected by the presence\
    \ of the SU. To \nmeet this requirement, SUs use a variety of techniques that\
    \ \nrequire prior knowledge about PUs' codebooks and messages \n[19]. For instance,\
    \ SUs can divide their power into two parts: \none is assigned to transmit their\
    \ packets and the other is \nallocated to support the PUs’ transmissions. In that\
    \ way, the \ninterference caused by the SU at the PU receiver can be \ncompensated\
    \ by the enhancement of the PU’s signal-to-noise \npower ratio (SNR), by dint\
    \ of the part of SU’s power that is \nused to relay the PU packets. \nAdditionally,\
    \ SUs can exploit knowledge about PUs' \ncodebooks and messages to cancel the\
    \ interference caused by \nPUs, using techniques such as dirty paper coding [19].\
    \ \nFinally, hybrid schemes that combine these transmission \nmodes can be conceived\
    \ to increase the overall throughput of \nthe wireless networks [20]. \nB. Cognitive\
    \ Radio Functions \nThe various tasks performed by a Cognitive Radio, \nincluding\
    \ detecting spectrum holes, selecting the best available \nchannel, determining\
    \ the transmission parameters, sharing \nspectrum with other users, and moving\
    \ to another frequency \nband when a licensed user appears are referred to as\
    \ the \ncognitive cycle (See Fig. 3) [21]. \nIn general, the cognitive cycle can\
    \ be divided into three \nfunctional steps, namely spectrum sensing and analysis,\
    \ \nspectrum management and handoff, and spectrum allocation \nand sharing [21]:\
    \ \n• Spectrum sensing and analysis: in this phase, CR \nmonitors the radio environment,\
    \ detects the spectrum \nholes, and estimates its different characteristics. \n\
    • Spectrum management and handoff: at this stage, CR \nchooses the best spectrum\
    \ white space, determines the \ntransmission parameters, and hops among different\
    \ \nbands based on the channel characteristics and user \nrequirements [3,21].\
    \ \n• Spectrum allocation and sharing: through these \nfunctions, CR can share\
    \ and coordinate the spectrum \naccess with other users. The coexistence with\
    \ licensed \nusers is restricted by their allowable interference level. \nThus,\
    \ secondary users should adjust their transmission \nparameters accordingly. As\
    \ for sharing spectrum access \nwith CR users, efficient spectrum access coordination\
    \ is \nrequired so as to avoid collisions and interferences [21]. \n102 | P a\
    \ g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 3. Cognitive Cycle\
    \ [21]. \nWith respect to the layer they are in, the aforesaid functions \ncan\
    \ be classified into three groups namely physical layer \n(PHY) functions, the\
    \ medium access control layer (MAC) \nfunctions, and network layer functions as\
    \ shown in Fig. 4 [22]: \n \nFig. 4. Key Functions of the PHY, MAC, and Network\
    \ Layers in a CR [22]. \n1) Physical layer functions: CR PHY layer is responsible\
    \ \nfor many tasks, including, but not limited to, identifying \nspectrum holes\
    \ through spectrum sensing and acquiring \nadvanced radio environment knowledge,\
    \ such as the channel \ngain from the CR transmitter to the primary receiver and\
    \ \nchannel-state information (CSI), via environmental learning \n[22]. Based\
    \ on the gathered information, cognitive spectrum \naccess is performed by using\
    \ transceiver optimization and \nreconfiguration. \n2) Medium access control layer\
    \ functions: CR MAC layer \nincorporates two key functions that allow to control\
    \ and \nmanage spectrum sensing operations as well as access to the \nidentified\
    \ spectrum opportunities. The first function is known \nas sensing scheduling,\
    \ whereas the second is referred to as \nspectrum-aware access control. The operations\
    \ of these \nfunctions are controlled by the sensing-access coordinator, on \n\
    a time basis, by taking into consideration the compromise \nbetween the sensing\
    \ requirement and the availability of the \nspectrum access opportunity. \nIn\
    \ \ncomparison \nwith \nthe \nconventional \nwireless \ncommunications MAC layer,\
    \ the CR MAC layer is more \ncomplicated to implement because of the dynamic nature\
    \ of the \nradio environment and the constant adaptation process that the \nCR\
    \ should perform. More detailed information about the CR \nMAC layer can be found\
    \ in [23,24]. \n3) Network layer functions: CR network layer provides \nthree\
    \ main functions: network tomography, quality of service \n(QoS) and error control,\
    \ and spectrum-aware routing [22]. \nNetwork tomography refers to the operation\
    \ by which the \nCR nodes sense the traffic patterns of the primary and the \n\
    coexisting networks. The output of this operation provides \nimportant baseline\
    \ data that allows a better understanding of \nthe routing design and the network\
    \ utilization at the packet \nlevel. \nQuality of service (QoS) control and error\
    \ control are of \nparamount importance to build a successful CR network. \nStatistical\
    \ control can be used to address these tasks over \nCRNs that are characterized\
    \ by opportunistic links. \nFurthermore, In CR networks, data routing is a challenging\
    \ \nproblem due to varying link quality, frequent topology \nchanges, and sporadic\
    \ connectivity caused by the movement of \nPUs in the network [25]. In such a\
    \ changing environment, the \nspectrum-aware routing function should be enabled\
    \ in order to \nfind optimal routes and paths while avoiding PUs. This \nfunction\
    \ has two problems to handle [21]: the first problem \nrelates to the fact that\
    \ routing algorithms and protocols should \nbe aware of the various network characteristics\
    \ such as \nspectrum availability, PU activity, channel switching delay, \nand\
    \ link qualities and take them into consideration while \nexecuting their different\
    \ operations. The second problem deals \nwith the setting up of interaction between\
    \ routing algorithms \nand dynamic spectrum allocation routines so as to select\
    \ \nrouting paths with minimum interferences. \nMoreover, the optimization of\
    \ the energy consumption, the \ndesired QoS, and the spectrum management should\
    \ be \nconsidered while designing routing algorithms and protocols \nfor CR networks.\
    \ Routing protocols are further detailed in [26]. \nFinally, the spectrum manager\
    \ serves as the means of \nestablishing a connection between the three aforementioned\
    \ \nlayers and ensuring dynamic and efficient access to the \navailable spectrum.\
    \ \nC. Cognitive Radio Networks \nA Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) consists of\
    \ a number of \nCR nodes with or without a secondary base station. \nBased on\
    \ the presence of infrastructure support, CRNs can \nbe classified as either an\
    \ Infrastructure-based network \n(centralized) or an Ad-Hoc network (distributed).\
    \ Moreover, \nCRNs can be also deployed in another architecture known as \nMesh\
    \ architecture that combines Infrastructure-based and Ad-\nHoc modes. A brief\
    \ description of these architectures is given \nbelow. \n1) Infrastructure-based\
    \ CR network: It is a centralized \narchitecture which contains a CR base station\
    \ that is \nresponsible for controlling and coordinating the transmission \nactivities\
    \ of the CR nodes. In this architecture, the CR base \nstation retrieves the spectrum\
    \ related information from all the \nSUs in the network and on the basis of the\
    \ gathered \ninformation, it makes decisions on spectrum access and \nsharing\
    \ for all CR nodes. \n103 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nCompared to Ad-hoc network, infrastructure-based network \nprovides many advantages\
    \ including, the reliability of the \nsensing process, collision avoidance, and\
    \ a high data right for \nSUs. However, an infrastructure is required to build\
    \ such a \nnetwork. \nSome examples of centralized networks include: \n• The IEEE\
    \ 802.22 network: it is the first wireless \nregional \narea \nnetwork \nstandard\
    \ \nthat \ndefines \nspecifications for broadband wireless access using CR \n\
    technology in TVWS bands [27]; \n• Spectrum Efficient Uni and Multi-cast Services\
    \ Over \nDynamic Radio Network in Vehicular Environments \n(Over DRiVE) [28];\
    \ \n• European Dynamic Radio for IP services in Vehicular \nEnvironment (DRiVE)\
    \ [29]; \n• Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) [30]. \n2) Ad-hoc mode CR network: In Ad-hoc CRNs,\
    \ there is no \nneed for base stations or access points to coordinate the SUs.\
    \ \nThus, in the absence of a central controlling entity, SUs in \nsuch a distributed\
    \ network, make independent decisions \nconcerning spectrum access and transmission\
    \ parameters. \nAdditionally, SUs must use distributed DSA protocols so as to\
    \ \nmanage the spectrum access operation. Designing distributed \nDSA protocols\
    \ for Ad-hoc CRNs is a challenging task because \nof the absence of central control\
    \ entities and the completely \ndistributed networking architecture [12]. These\
    \ protocols \nshould support a set of functions including, transparency for \n\
    PUs, collision avoidance, accurate spectrum sensing, and \nefficient dynamic spectrum\
    \ allocation [12]. \nIII. SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO: OVERVIEW \nGiven that SDR is\
    \ considered as an enabling technology \nthat handles the implementation of Cognitive\
    \ Radio, this \nsection will be dedicated to a brief overview of SDR. \nA. Definition\
    \ of SDR \nSoftware Defined Radio [31,32] is referred to as a \nprogrammable radio\
    \ transceiver where digital signal processing \nfunctions, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ coding/decoding, \nerror \ncontrol, \ninterleaving/deinterleaving, \nand \n\
    scrambling/descrambling are implemented by means of \nsoftware instead of hardware\
    \ as it has been used in traditional \nradio \ncommunication \nsystems. \nThat\
    \ \nenables \nthe \nimplementation of different waveform standards in a single\
    \ \nplatform and switching between them without any change in \nthe hardware components.\
    \ In some cases, there is just the need \nof a simple software upgrade to support\
    \ other modes, bands, \nand functions. \nMany hardware platforms are used to implement\
    \ the \nsoftware part of SDR, mainly, General Purpose Processor \n(GPP), Digital\
    \ Signal Processor (DSP), Field Programmable \nGate Arrays (FPGA), and Application\
    \ Specific Integrated \nCircuit (ASIC) [33]. \nEach of the above-mentioned platforms\
    \ has its own \nchallenges, limitations, and strengths in terms of computational\
    \ \npower, power consumption, implementation cost, flexibility \nand reconfigurability,\
    \ and complexity of design (See Table I). \nB. SDR Architecture \nJoseph Mitola\
    \ proposed the architecture of an ideal \nsoftware radio transceiver that includes\
    \ three components, \nnamely an antenna, a Digital-to-Analog/Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nconverter, and a processing unit as illustrated in Fig. 5. The \nprocessing\
    \ unit allows performing, in software, all the digital \nsignal \nprocessing \n\
    functions, \nincluding \nmodulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, and error control\
    \ \n[3]. \n \nFig. 5. Ideal Software Radio [16]. \nMany factors impede the real\
    \ implementation of this \nproposed architecture such as the technology limitations,\
    \ more \nparticularly those related to ADC’s performance, computing \npower, and\
    \ power consumption of the processing unit. \nUnlike the ideal software radio\
    \ transceiver, the SDR \ntransceiver is feasible. Indeed, the general architecture\
    \ of SDRs \ncontains more components that make its real implementation \npossible.\
    \ \nAs shown in Fig. 6, the SDR transceiver includes mainly \nfour parts which\
    \ are an antenna, an analog RF front end, a \ndigital RF front end, and the signal\
    \ processing unit. \n1) Antenna: One of the main tasks expected from an SDR \n\
    platform is its ability to cover multiple frequency bands. Thus, \nSDR platforms\
    \ often use Intelligent/Smart antennas so as to \nfulfill the aforementioned task.\
    \ \nA smart antenna consists of an antenna array combined \nwith signal processing\
    \ blocks that allow to smartly exploit the \nspatial diversity in order to select\
    \ the appropriate frequency \nband and adapt with interference nulling, and mobile\
    \ tracking \n[34,35]. \nAn antenna for SDR should ideally integrate some features\
    \ \nsuch as self-adaptation, self-alignment and self-healing [35]. \nThese characteristics\
    \ can be defined as follows: \n• Self-adaptation: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to \nadapt its parameters according to the selected band and \nthe system requirements\
    \ (gain…); \n• Self-alignment: it is the capability of an antenna to \ncontrol\
    \ its radiation pattern; \n• Self-healing: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to avoid \ninterferences. \n104 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \n2) Analog RF front end: The RF front end part [34] \nrepresents\
    \ an analog circuitry where the following operations \nare performed: \nIn the\
    \ transmission path, Digital-to-Analogue Converter \n(DAC) converts digital samples\
    \ into an analog signal which \nrepresents the input of the RF Front End. After\
    \ that, the analog \nsignal is mixed with high frequency carriers, modulated to\
    \ a \npreset RF frequency, and then transmitted. \nIn the receiving path, the\
    \ RF signal captured by the antenna \nis fed to the RF Front end section through\
    \ a matching circuitry \nwhich allows achieving an optimum signal power transfer.\
    \ \nThen, in order to amplify very low-power signals while \nguaranteeing a minimum\
    \ noise level, the RF signal passes \nthrough a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) which\
    \ is often mounted \nvery close to the antenna. Afterward, the output of the LNA\
    \ is \nmixed with a signal from the Local Oscillator (LO) so as to \nshift to\
    \ a lower fixed frequency known as intermediate \nfrequency (IF). \nThe frequency\
    \ generated by the Local Oscillator is \nadjustable to ensure that the mixer produces\
    \ a lower fixed \nintermediate frequency independent of the incoming RF signal.\
    \ \nThe intermediate frequency presents several advantages: it \nimproves the\
    \ selectivity due to the fact of being fixed and it \nincreases the performance\
    \ of the processing unit and the global \ngain of the receiver owing to be lower\
    \ than the incoming \nfrequency. \n3) Digital front end: The Digital Front end\
    \ section [34] \ncontains a set of blocks that are responsible for performing\
    \ all \nof the succeeding functions: \nIn the transmission path, the digital baseband\
    \ signal (near-\nzero frequency range) is shifted into the IF frequency by the\
    \ \nDigital Up Converter (DUC) then it passes through the Digital \nAnalog Converter\
    \ (DAC) that converts it to the analog IF \nsignal. The analog IF signal is later\
    \ up-converted to RF signal. \nIn the receiving path, the analog IF signal is\
    \ converted to \ndigital IF samples by the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).\
    \ \nNext, the Digital Down Converter (DDC) changes the IF \nsamples to a baseband\
    \ signal which is then resampled and \nfiltered before being processed by the\
    \ signal processing unit. \nThese above-mentioned tasks can be divided into two\
    \ \nprincipal functions which are Resampling and Channelization. \nResampling\
    \ or Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) is the process \nof converting samples from\
    \ one sample rate to another. As for \nChannelization, it involves up/down conversion\
    \ and channel \nfiltering. \n4) Signal processing unit: This block is regarded\
    \ as the \nmain part of SDR architecture which is designed to perform \nDigital\
    \ \nSignal \nProcessing \nfunctions \nsuch \nas \nmodulation/demodulation and\
    \ encoding/decoding. \nAs already mentioned in this paper many hardware \nplatforms\
    \ are used to implement this section, namely DSP, \nGPP, GPU, ASIC, and FPGA [36–39].\
    \ The real challenge is \ndetermining which of these platforms is best to achieve\
    \ SDR \ngoals and which design approach is appropriate to meet the \nrequested\
    \ quality of service. \nTable I shows the strengths and weaknesses of some \n\
    hardware platforms and highlights certain techniques used to \nimprove their performance.\

    \ \nadaptability, cost, and complexity. \nTo exploit the advantages of each platform,\
    \ researchers \nhave proposed the co-design (hybrid) approach as a solution. \n\
    This approach consists of regrouping design schemes that \nemploy hardware techniques,\
    \ such as FPGAs and ASICs, and \nthose that use software solutions including GPPs,\
    \ into one \nplatform. \nThis approach presents some issues, the most known are\
    \ \nthe problem related to the shared access of the internal memory \nby different\
    \ units (FPGAs, Processors ...) and the very \nexpensive cost of the whole implementation.\
    \ \nOne of the interesting readings that give a detailed review \nof the aforementioned\
    \ platforms, can be found in [35]. \nC. SDR Advantages \nSoftware Defined Radio\
    \ technology has brought a lot of \nadvantages to the world of wireless communications,\
    \ such as \nreconfigurability and flexibility, interoperability, and cost \nreduction\
    \ [34,37]: \n• Reconfigurability and Flexibility: The main feature of \nSDR is\
    \ its capacity to handle wireless standards newly \ndeveloped by simply changing\
    \ or upgrading the \nreconfigurable software instead of replacing the \nhardware\
    \ platform or its analog components. \n• Interoperability: One of the most important\
    \ benefits of \nSDR is its ability to resolve interoperability problems \nbetween\
    \ incompatible radios that work with different \nwireless standards. \n• Cost\
    \ \nreduction: \nSeveral \nexpensive \nhardware \ncomponents disappeared due to\
    \ the fact that in SDR \nmany \ndigital \nsignal \nprocessing \nfunctions \nare\
    \ \nimplemented by means of software. \nIn addition to the forenamed benefits,\
    \ SDR allows to test \nand study several communication standards by using the\
    \ same \nplatform. Furthermore, SDR is regarded as the block building \nof a Cognitive\
    \ Radio system and as already mentioned in this \npaper, SDR enables the reconfigurability\
    \ of Cognitive Radio. \nD. SDR Tools \nThere are different commercial and open-source\
    \ tools that \ncan be used for SDR development. Choosing the more \nappropriate\
    \ \ndevelopment \ntool \nfor \na \nspecific \ndesign \nmethodology requires prior\
    \ knowledge of the available tools’ \nfeatures. Examples of these tools include\
    \ GNU Radio, \nUniversal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), MATLAB, \nLabVIEW,\
    \ and CUDA. \nGNU Radio and USRP are the most widely used tools to \ndevelop SDR\
    \ systems [40]. A brief description of these two \ntools is given below: \nGNU\
    \ Radio: GNU Radio is a free & open-source software \ntoolkit for building software\
    \ radios [35]. It runs on host \n106 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \ncomputers and it provides many signal processing blocks such\
    \ \nas filters, decoders, and demodulators which are required to \nimplement software\
    \ radios. These blocks are programmed in \nC++ and they are often connected using\
    \ Python script that has \nthe advantage of allowing the data flow to be at the\
    \ maximum \nrate, without being interpreted [41]. In addition, this tool offers\
    \ \nthe possibility of easily programming and adding new blocks \nfor supporting\
    \ unavailable functions. GNU Radio can be used \njointly with Universal Software\
    \ Radio Peripheral systems or \nother alternatives to set up complete SDR platforms.\
    \ \nUSRP: Universal Software Radio Peripheral is the most \ncommonly used transceiver\
    \ for SDR platforms, developed by \nEttus2 Research under GPL license. USRPs are\
    \ available in \nseveral series and versions, differentiated by their hardware\
    \ \nperformances and their connection method to a host computer. \nGenerally,\
    \ USRP is a board that integrates the following \ncomponents: ADC/ DAC, an FPGA\
    \ board, an RF front end, \nand a PC host interface [42]. Based on the USRP series,\
    \ a \ncertain number of daughterboards can also be held. \nDaughterboards perform\
    \ functions such as filtering and \nconversion between RF and baseband signals\
    \ (up/down \nconversions) and may support applications operating up to 6 \nGHz\
    \ due to being modular. Concerning the other signal \nprocessing functions, the\
    \ majority of them are performed at the \nhost machine and only some operations\
    \ are processed by the \nFPGA board [42]. USRP platforms offer several advantages,\
    \ \nincluding ease-of-use, affordability, and flexibility. However, \nbandwidth\
    \ limitations of USRP components have an impact on \nsystem throughput. That makes\
    \ USRP platforms only suitable \nfor research experiments and rapid prototyping\
    \ [35,42]. \nE. SDR Challenges \nIn this subsection, the challenges that still\
    \ remain to be \naddressed for implementing efficient and practical SDR \nsystems\
    \ are presented. \n1) Security and attack issues: Although SDR has brought \n\
    many powerful advantages to the field of wireless \ncommunication, it has introduced\
    \ new types of security threats \nand attack issues. Indeed, in addition to the\
    \ known threats that \nexist in conventional wireless communication systems such\
    \ as \ndenial of service attacks, misconfiguration issues, listening \nand capturing\
    \ data that can be used to perform malicious \nactions, there are several threats\
    \ that are specific to SDR, \nincluding downloading and running malicious software.\
    \ \nIn the absence of authentication and verification \ntechniques, unauthorized\
    \ software can easily be installed and \nactivated on SDR terminals. The challenge\
    \ of implementing \nprotection techniques and security mechanisms, to prevent\
    \ this \nissue, has been addressed by many researchers. For instance, in \n[43]\
    \ a framework for establishing secure download for SDR is \npresented. This framework\
    \ uses a public/private key scheme to \nverify the authenticity of the software.\
    \ The digital signature is \nconsidered as a good solution to keep malicious and\
    \ \nunauthorized software from being activated on SDR nodes, \nnevertheless, it\
    \ greatly increases the complexity of the \n2 https://www.ettus.com/ \nframework\
    \ due to the fact that for each combination of \nwaveform and terminal, a digital\
    \ signature should be created. \nFurthermore, the data configuration of SDR components\
    \ \ncan be prone to extraction, alteration, or destruction. Those \nissues can\
    \ be prevented by guaranteeing the integrity of the \nsecurity administrative\
    \ module (SAM) and implementing data \nintegrity and protection techniques [44].\
    \ \n2) Energy efficiency: Addressing the power consumption \nissue is of primary\
    \ importance especially when designing \nsolutions that are intended for battery-powered\
    \ devices and \nlow power objects in an IoT network. Several reasons are \nbehind\
    \ the importance of addressing power consumption \nmanagement, including limited\
    \ size and battery, ensuring a \nlonger lifetime of IoT objects, and enabling\
    \ Green Computing \n[17,45]. In SDR, many factors contribute to the loss of energy\
    \ \nefficiency, namely signal processing complexity and the \nincreased hardware\
    \ requirements. To alleviate this loss, the \nauthors of [46] proposed a cooperative\
    \ wireless network \nscheme that is based on resource sharing (Battery, processing\
    \ \nunit, memory…). \n3) Antenna requirements for SDR: One of the major \nchallenges\
    \ in SDR is to design wideband antennas that support \ndifferent technologies\
    \ and standards. Although smart and \nreconfigurable antennas are used to resolve\
    \ this concern, \nseveral constraints still hamper the SDR implementation in \n\
    portable handsets and other systems, such as bandwidth and \ngain limitations,\
    \ which are imposed by the antenna size, and \nthe complexity of a design that\
    \ meets all the antenna \nrequirements for SDR [47]. \n4) Hybrid design: Implementing\
    \ an optimal SDR design, \nthat meets the real-time requirements at low power\
    \ and cost \nwhile maintaining flexibility and programmability, represents \n\
    a great challenge. Researchers address this issue by using the \nhybrid approach\
    \ which enables the use of hardware schemes \n(ASICs…) along with software schemes\
    \ (GPP...) in the same \nplatform in order to take advantage of their different\
    \ benefits. \nThe hybrid design has also its own challenges in both \nphysical\
    \ and MAC layers, including partitioning and \nscheduling problems [35]. \n5)\
    \ ADC and DAC limitations: The concept of an ideal \nsoftware defined radio transceiver\
    \ consists in placing the \nADC/DAC as close as possible to the antenna. That\
    \ requires a \nvery high-speed ADC/DAC with sampling capability up to \nGiga Samples\
    \ per second which is actually not feasible. To \novercome this issue, an RF front\
    \ end block is placed right after \nthe antenna so as to shift the incoming frequency\
    \ to an \nintermediate frequency that can be supported by the currently \navailable\
    \ ADC/DAC. \nIV. SPECTRUM SENSING \nSensing is considered as the most important\
    \ and critical \nphase in the Cognitive Radio cycle. It refers to the operation\
    \ by \nwhich the CR users can be aware of the channel occupancy, the \npresence\
    \ of the primary user, the quality of the radio channel, \n107 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n                                                           \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nand other parameters such as transmission power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. Based on this gathered information, the CR \nusers can determine the vacant\
    \ portion of the spectrum and \nchoose the white spaces which meet its QoS. \n\
    This section gives a detailed view of sensing spectrum \nfunction in Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks. \nA. Multi-dimensional Spectrum Sensing \nThrough the sensing\
    \ function, Cognitive radio can identify \nthe existing spectrum opportunities\
    \ in its surrounding \nenvironment by using different sensing techniques. Spectrum\
    \ \nopportunity is conventionally defined as “a band of frequencies \nthat are\
    \ not being used by the primary user of that band at a \nparticular time in a\
    \ particular geographic area” [48,49]. This \ndefinition takes into consideration\
    \ only three dimensions, \nnamely frequency, time, and space. However, there are\
    \ other \ndimensions that can be exploited to create new opportunities \nsuch\
    \ as code dimension and angle dimension. Developing \nsensing algorithms that\
    \ take into account all those dimensions \nencounters more complex and challenging\
    \ issues. \nA radio environment in which all the aforementioned \ndimensions are\
    \ exploited to share spectrum access among \nmultiple users is known by several\
    \ names including, \nhyperspace, electro space, and radio spectrum space. Table\
    \ II \nshows parameters that are needed to be sensed for each \ndimension and\
    \ highlights its main idea [49]. \nB. Types of Spectrum Sensing \nSpectrum sensing\
    \ approaches can be divided into several \ntypes on the basis of specific aspects,\
    \ including the cooperation \nbetween secondary users, the bands of interest,\
    \ the sensing \nexecution time, and the number of sensed channels at a time \n\
    (See Fig. 7) [50]: \nBased on the bands of interest for the Cognitive Radio \n\
    system, spectrum sensing falls into two groups: in-band \nsensing and out-of-band\
    \ sensing. In-band sensing consists in \nsensing the channel that is already transmitting,\
    \ in the aim of \ndetecting primary user signals and avoiding harmful \ninterferences\
    \ [51,52]. As to out-of-band sensing, CR senses \nbands other than the band on\
    \ which it is transmitting so as to \ndiscover new spectrum holes [51]. \nBased\
    \ on the sensing execution time, two classes of \nspectrum sensing can be distinguished:\
    \ reactive (on-demand) \nand proactive(periodic) sensing. The reactive sensing\
    \ takes \nplace when the secondary user intends to transmit or as a result \n\
    of radio environmental changes. In proactive sensing, CR users \nsense the radio\
    \ environment persistently so as to detect \nspectrum opportunities. Reactive\
    \ sensing is more energy \nefficient but the time to identify an unoccupied channel\
    \ may be \nlonger than proactive sensing. \nAmong the types of spectrum sensing,\
    \ we also find \nsynchronous \nsensing \nand \nasynchronous \nsensing. \nIn \n\
    synchronous sensing, all CRs respect the same schedule to \nsense a frequency\
    \ band. In that case, a high synchronization \nbetween CRs represents a challenging\
    \ task. \nTABLE II. \nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRUM SENSING \nDimension \nParameters\

    \ frequency band is segmented into disjoint sub-\nbands. Identifying opportunities\
    \ in the frequency domain consists \nin determining the unoccupied sub-bands.\
    \ It is unlikely that all the \nbands can be used concurrently at the same time.\

    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \nIn the case of asynchronous sensing, each CR has its own \n\
    schedule to sense a frequency band. Distinguishing between \nSU signals and PU\
    \ signals is a challenging problem. \nIn respect to the cooperation aspect, there\
    \ are two classes of \nspectrum sensing: cooperative and non-cooperative (local)\
    \ \nSensing. In non-cooperative sensing, each CR settles for its \nown sensing\
    \ data and independently decides on the channel \nstate, i.e. the presence or\
    \ the absence of the primary user. \nDecisions that are made through this sensing\
    \ type are \nunreliable and error prone under bad channel conditions, \nmultipath\
    \ fading and shadowing effects, and hidden node \nissues [53]. \nThe aforementioned\
    \ issues can be avoided by using \ncooperative sensing [21,53]. Indeed, when cooperative\
    \ sensing \nis enabled, CR users share their local observations and sensing \n\
    data with others and exploit the shared sensing outcomes of \nother users to decide\
    \ on the presence or absence of the primary \nuser. Several works have been carried\
    \ out on this topic and it \nhas been shown that cooperative sensing contributes\
    \ to the \nimprovement of detection accuracy and reliability on the cost \nof\
    \ increased latency and traffic overhead. It has also been \nproven that cooperation\
    \ between secondary users can solve \nhidden primary user problem and decrease\
    \ sensing time [53]. \nThere are two types of cooperative sensing: centralized\
    \ \nsensing and distributed sensing [3,54]. In centralized sensing \n[55], a central\
    \ unit gathers local sensing information from CR \nusers through a control channel,\
    \ fuses them by means of one of \nthe fusion decision rules [56], identifies spectrum\
    \ holes by \nperforming binary hypothesis testing algorithm such as \nNeyman-Pearson\
    \ test or Bayesian test, and shares the result \namong other cognitive users or\
    \ directly controls the cognitive \nradio traffic. In distributed sensing [54],\
    \ cognitive nodes \nexchange their local observations among each other and make\
    \ \ntheir own decisions on channel state. Distributed sensing \ndoesn’t require\
    \ a backbone infrastructure or a centralized base \nstation. \nOn the basis of\
    \ interference detection, spectrum sensing is \ncategorized as primary transmitter\
    \ detection, primary receiver \ndetection, and interference temperature [51].\
    \ In primary \ntransmitter detection approaches, spectrum holes are identified\
    \ \nby processing received signals at the PU receiver. This class \nincludes several\
    \ techniques such as energy detection and \nmatched filter detection. In primary\
    \ receiver detection, the \nstatus of primary channels is detected based on the\
    \ local \noscillator leakage power of the PU receiver [57]. This power is \nemitted\
    \ by the PU receiver’s RF front end while receiving the \ndata from the PU transmitter\
    \ [58]. As for interference \ntemperature, secondary users transmit simultaneously\
    \ with \nprimary users as long as the interference caused by the SU at \nthe PU\
    \ receiver remains under a specified interference limit. In \nthis case, the underlay\
    \ DSA model is considered. \nIn regard to the requirement of the PU’s information,\
    \ \nspectrum sensing schemes can be categorized into two classes: \nblind and\
    \ feature detection techniques [50]. The blind detection \ntechniques serve to\
    \ blindly determine the channel state without \nany prior knowledge about the\
    \ primary user signals. This type \nincludes, among others, energy detection and\
    \ Higher-Order-\nStatistics detection. The feature detection techniques allow\
    \ \nperforming signal classification to the detected signal. They are \nmore advantageous\
    \ than blind detection techniques in the sense \nthat it is possible to distinguish\
    \ between PU and SU signals and \nto characterize the different types of PU and\
    \ SU signals. \nMatched filter and cyclostationarity detection techniques are\
    \ \nexamples of feature detection techniques. \nDepending on the bandwidth (number\
    \ of sensed channels at \na time), spectrum sensing schemes are classified into\
    \ two broad \ngroups which are narrowband and wideband sensing \ntechniques [59]:\
    \ in the narrowband sensing, only one channel \nis analyzed at a time to detect\
    \ available opportunities. The most \nwidely and commonly known narrowband methods\
    \ are energy \ndetection, matched filter detection, cyclostationary feature \n\
    detection, covariance-based detection, and waveform detection \n[59]. \nAs for\
    \ wideband sensing, multiple frequency bands are \nexplored at a time so as to\
    \ discover spectrum holes. In this \ncase, the available spectrum is usually divided\
    \ into narrower \nsub-bands which are sensed either concurrently or sequentially\
    \ \nby using narrowband sensing techniques. Wideband sensing \ntechniques contain\
    \ two groups: Nyquist-based and Sub-\nNyquist wideband sensing. The former type\
    \ processes digital \nsignals at the rate equal to or greater than the Nyquist\
    \ rate, \nwhereas the latter type processes the signals with a sampling \nrate\
    \ lower than the Nyquist rate [59]. \nWideband sensing allows to exploit the available\
    \ spectrum \nmore efficiently but it brings about new challenges related to \n\
    its implementation. \nOn the basis of the latest mentioned classification of \n\
    spectrum sensing schemes (Narrowband sensing/ Wideband \nsensing), the next subsection\
    \ will review some of the most \ncommon spectrum sensing methods as well as the\
    \ recent \nadvanced spectrum sensing techniques. \n \nFig. 7. Types of Spectrum\
    \ Sensing. \n109 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal\
    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nC. Spectrum\
    \ Sensing Techniques \nBefore reviewing in detail spectrum sensing techniques,\
    \ \nmore particularly narrowband sensing techniques, the system \nmodel for spectrum\
    \ sensing is given below. \n1) System Model for spectrum sensing: The fundamental\
    \ \nobjective of spectrum sensing is to make a choice between two \nhypotheses:\
    \ \n• H0: Channel is temporarily available for opportunistic \nusage i.e. no primary\
    \ user signal is present; \n• H1: Channel is occupied i.e. a primary user signal\
    \ is \npresent. \nThese hypotheses can be expressed as under: \nH0: Y(n)= N(n)\
    \ when PU’s signal is absent  \n         (1) \nH1: Y(n)= h.X(n)+ N(n) when PU’s\
    \ signal is present          (2) \nWhere Y(n) represents the received signal by\
    \ SU, X(n) \nrepresents the transmitted PU signal, N(n) denotes Additive \nWhite\
    \ Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with mean zero and variance \n\U0001D70E\U0001D70E2.h\
    \ represents the channel gain, n= 1,2,3…N where n is the \nsample index, and N\
    \ is the number of samples. \nGenerally, a test statistic of Y(n) is compared\
    \ against a \ndecision threshold value \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide\
    \ between the two \nhypotheses. If the test statistic is greater than the threshold,\
    \ H1 \nis assumed to be true and thus PU’s signal is declared present. \nin contrast,\
    \ if the test statistic is less than the threshold, H0 is \nassumed to be true\
    \ and then PU’s signal is declared absent. Fig. \n8 presents the general model\
    \ of spectrum detection. \n \nFig. 8. Spectrum Sensing Model. \nSensing accuracy\
    \ is typically evaluated using the Receiver \nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curves.\
    \ These curves are the \nplot of the detection probability versus the false alarm\
    \ \nprobability or plot of the probability of miss detection against \nthe probability\
    \ of false alarm [60,61]. These probabilities are \ndefined as: \nProbability\
    \ of detection (Pd): It is the probability that the \nSU declares the presence\
    \ of PU signal when it is actually \npresent. \nPd = Pr(H1/H1)   \n \n \n \n \
    \        (3) \nA \nhigh \nProbability \nof \ndetection \nallows \navoiding \n\
    interference impact on primary receivers. Hence a high Pd is \neminently desirable.\
    \ \nProbability of false alarm (Pfa): It is the probability that the \nSU declares\
    \ the presence of PU signal when it doesn’t truly \nexist. \nPfa= Pr(H1/H0)  \
    \ \n \n \n \n         (4) \nA high Probability of false alarm decreases the efficiency\
    \ \nspectral due to the loss of spectrum access opportunities. In \naddition,\
    \ the QoS may be negatively affected as a result of this \nloss. Thus, Pfa should\
    \ be low to avoid the under-use of \npotential spectrum holes. \nProbability of\
    \ miss detection (Pm): It is the probability of \nmissing a PU signal when it\
    \ is present. \nPm= Pr(H0/H1)   \n \n \n \n         (5) \nA high Probability of\
    \ miss detection causes a harmful \ninterference on primary users because, in\
    \ the case of a miss \ndetection, SUs may transmit simultaneously with PUs in\
    \ the \nsame band. So, to avoid interference to and from license holder \nusers,\
    \ Pm should be low. \n2) Narrowband sensing techniques: In this subsection, we\
    \ \ndiscuss several narrowband sensing techniques, focusing on \ntheir \nfunctions,\
    \ \nmathematical \nmodels, \nstrengths, \nand \ndrawbacks. \na) Energy detection\
    \ scheme: Energy detection [1,62–64] \ncalled also Radiometry or Periodogram,\
    \ is the most widely \nused sensing scheme due to its low computational complexity,\
    \ \nthe simplicity of its implementation, and the absence of need \nfor PU signal\
    \ information. \nIn this sensing technique, the received signal energy is \ncomputed\
    \ and compared with a threshold value. If the \nmeasured energy is higher than\
    \ the threshold, the target \nfrequency band is considered to be occupied by a\
    \ PU; \notherwise, the target frequency band is considered to be vacant. \nThe\
    \ block diagram of the energy detection method is illustrated \nin Fig. 9 and\
    \ its decision metric can be written as: \nT= \n1\nN ∑\n(Y(n))\nN\nn=1\nⁿ  \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (6) \nDespite its aforementioned advantages, energy detection\
    \ \nhas several drawbacks, including the degradation of detection \naccuracy as\
    \ a result of noise uncertainty (NU). The latter refers \nto the noise power fluctuations\
    \ with time caused by the effects \nof various factors such as thermal noise,\
    \ filtering effects, radio-\nfrequency circuits, and interference from other signals\
    \ [65]. \nAuthors of [65] analyzed the impact of NU on energy detection \nperformance\
    \ using different OFDM system designs. The \nresults of their analyses show that,\
    \ for all OFDM system \ndesigns, the probability of detection is higher for signals,\
    \ with \nlower NU and higher SNR, which are transmitted at higher PU \ntransmit\
    \ power and detected with a higher number of samples. \nMoreover, energy detection\
    \ is unreliable at low SNR values \n[66], ineffective in detecting spread signals\
    \ [60], and unable to \ndistinguish between PU signals from other signals. \n\
    To enhance the performance and the accuracy of energy \ndetection, several methods\
    \ based on the use of dynamics \nthresholds are investigated in [67–70]. \n \n\

    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nb) Matched filter detection: The matched filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique is viewed as the best method for identifying the \nunutilized bands\
    \ when the PU transmission characteristics are \nknown a priori, e.g., bandwidth,\
    \ operating frequency, the \nmodulation type and order, packet format, and pulse\
    \ shaping \n[70–72]. In this technique, the received signal is correlated \nwith\
    \ the known PU signal and the result is compared with a \nthreshold to decide\
    \ on the presence of the PU. The block \ndiagram of matched filter detection is\
    \ shown in Fig. 10 and its \ntest statistic is given by: \nT=∑\nY(n)X∗(n)\nN\n\
    n=1\n23T \n \n \n \n         (7) \n \nFig. 10. Block Diagram of Matched Filter\
    \ Detection [70–73]. \nThe main advantage of this sensing scheme is that it \n\
    requires only a small number of samples and thus less sensing \ntime to achieve\
    \ good detection performance due to its \nresilience against noise uncertainty\
    \ [73]. Nevertheless, it has \nseveral drawbacks. First, there is a need for precise\
    \ and \naccurate prior information about the primary user signal, which \nmay\
    \ not always be available [65]. Second, the performance of \nthe matched filter\
    \ technique drops when the prior information \nis incorrect. Third, to detect\
    \ different types of PUs, a dedicated \nmatched filter structure for each type\
    \ must be used, which \nincreases the complexity of the system. \nc) Cyclostationary\
    \ Feature Detection: Cyclostationary \nFeature Detection [74–76] depends on cyclostationary\
    \ \ncharacteristics of the received signals. Indeed, in wireless \ncommunications,\
    \ the transmitted signals are typically \ncharacterized by the periodicity of\
    \ some of their statistics such \nas mean and autocorrelation[76,77].This periodicity\
    \ results \nfrom the fact that signals are modulated and coupled with \ncyclic\
    \ prefixes, hopping sequences, pulse trains, sinusoidal \nwave carrier, and other\
    \ features before being transmitted \n[76,77]. Furthermore, additive noise signals\
    \ are stationary \nwith no correlation. Therefore, Cyclostationary Feature \n\
    Detection schemes are very robust to noise uncertainties and \ncan distinguish\
    \ between the signal and noise by calculating \nand analyzing the cyclic autocorrelation\
    \ of the received \nsignals. \nThe periodicity of the mean and the autocorrelation,\
    \ of a \ncyclostationary signal y(t), can be expressed mathematically \nby: \n\
    my(t) = E[y(t)] = my(t + T0) \n \n \n         (8) \nRy(t, τ) = Ry(t + T0, τ) \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (9) \nWhere T0 represents the period of the signal \U0001D466\
    \U0001D466 (\U0001D461\U0001D461), \U0001D70F\U0001D70F \nrepresents the time\
    \ offset, \U0001D438\U0001D438 denotes the expectation operator, \nand \U0001D445\
    \U0001D445\U0001D466\U0001D466 is the autocorrelation function of \U0001D466\U0001D466\
    \ (\U0001D461\U0001D461) and it is given \nby: \nR\U0001D466\U0001D466 (\U0001D70F\
    \U0001D70F) = \U0001D438\U0001D438 [\U0001D466\U0001D466 (\U0001D461\U0001D461\
    \ + \U0001D70F\U0001D70F) \U0001D466\U0001D466∗(\U0001D461\U0001D461 − \U0001D70F\
    \U0001D70F)\U0001D452\U0001D452\U0001D457\U0001D4572\U0001D70B\U0001D70B\U0001D6FC\
    \U0001D6FC\U0001D461\U0001D461]  \n \n       (10) \nThe block diagram of Cyclostationary\
    \ Detection scheme is \nillustrated in Fig. 11, in which The Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nConverter (ADC) digitizes the received analog signal y(t) into \ndigital samples\
    \ and then it is fed into the N-point FFT block \nwhich computes its Fast Fourier\
    \ Transform. Next, these FFT \nvalues are correlated with themselves and then\
    \ averaged over \nthe number of samples. Finally, in the feature detection block,\
    \ \nthe sensing decision is obtained by detecting the features of the \naverage\
    \ outcome. \nThis scheme has also the advantage of being able to \ndistinguish\
    \ between various types of PU signals that are \ncharacterized by different transmit\
    \ features [78]. \nHowever, this detector also presents some limitations such\
    \ \nas the need for a large number of samples and high sampling \nrate which results\
    \ in an increase in sensing time, power \nconsumption, and complexity [76,78].\
    \ \nIn order to reduce computation complexity while \nmaintaining sufficient detection\
    \ sensitivity, authors of [79] \nproposed an improved Cyclostationary Detector\
    \ with SLC \nDiversity over Nakagami-m Fading channels, where the test \nstatistic\
    \ of conventional Cyclostationary detector is reliably \nsimplified. For the same\
    \ purpose, in [80], an improved \nCyclostationary Feature Detection Algorithm\
    \ is presented, in \nwhich authors proved that the cyclic spectrum is conjugate\
    \ \nsymmetry about the relevant axis, which decreases the \ncomputational complexity.\
    \ \n \nFig. 11. Block Diagram of Cyclostationary Feature Detection [74–76]. \n\
    d) Covariance Based Detection: Covariance-based \ndetection methods exploit the\
    \ correlation structure inherent in \nthe received data and the noticeable differences\
    \ between the \nstatistical covariances of signal and noise to decide on the \n\
    presence of primary signals in background noise without the \nneed for prior knowledge\
    \ about signal, channel, or noise \npower [81]. \nDifferent statistical tests\
    \ can be extracted from the \ncovariance matrix of the received signal and used\
    \ to detect the \npresence of the signal like the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue\
    \ \nto minimum eigenvalue in the case of Eigenvalue-Based \nDetection Method [82].\
    \ The steps of the latter can be \nsummarized as follows: First, the sample covariance\
    \ matrix of \nthe received signal is built from the received signal samples. \n\
    Then, the eigenvalues of this matrix are computed using \ntechniques such as singular\
    \ value decomposition (SVD). \nFinally, a decision on the presence of the signal\
    \ is taken by \ncomparing the ratio between the maximum eigenvalue and the \n\
    minimum eigenvalue with a threshold. The block diagram of \nthis method is shown\
    \ in Fig. 12. \n \nFig. 12. Block Diagram of Covariance-Based Detection [82].\
    \ \n111 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nThe sample\
    \ covariance matrix of the received signal can be \nexpressed as [82]: \nRy (Ns)=\n\
    1\nNₛ ∑\nL−2+Nₛ ŷ(n) ŷH(n) \nn=L−1\n \n \n \n       (11) \nWhere Ns is the number\
    \ of collected samples, L is a \npositive integer called “smoothing factor\",\
    \ ŷ(n) is the received \nsignal vector at sampling instance n, and ŷH(n) is its\
    \ conjugate-\ntranspose. \nThe test statistic can be written as: \nT= \nλ\U0001D45A\
    \U0001D456\U0001D45B\nλ\U0001D45A\U0001D44E\U0001D465  \n \n \n \n \n       (12)\
    \ \nWhere \U0001D706\U0001D706max and \U0001D706\U0001D706min are respectively\
    \ the maximum and \nminimum eigenvalues of Ry (Ns); \nUsing a predefined threshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706, the decision can be made as \nfollows: if T> \U0001D706\
    \U0001D706, H1 is considered to be true, otherwise, H0 is \nconsidered to be true.\
    \ \nIt is noteworthy that, despite the robustness of covariance \ntechniques against\
    \ noise uncertainty, they have a high \ncomputational complexity due to two factors,\
    \ namely \ncovariance matrix computation and eigenvalue decomposition \n[82].\
    \ \ne) Waveform-based \ndetection: \nWaveform-based \ndetection method, also known\
    \ as coherent detection [49], can \nbe considered as a simplified version of the\
    \ matched filter \nscheme. Although, unlike the latter, this method doesn’t need\
    \ \ncomplete information about the PU signals. It simply exploits \nknown patterns,\
    \ that are used in wireless communication \nsystems to support many functions\
    \ such as synchronization, \ncontrol, and equalization so as to execute coherent\
    \ detection. \nThese patterns involve but not limited to the following: \n• Preambles:\
    \ a preamble is a known sequence that is sent \nbefore each burst; \n• Midambles:\
    \ a midamble is a known sequence that is \nsent in the middle of a slot or burst;\
    \ \n• Pilot symbols: pilot symbols are an extra overhead \nadded to the transmitted\
    \ signal. \nWhen such patterns are available, the received signal is \ncorrelated\
    \ with a known copy of itself to perform signal \ndetection. As such, the test\
    \ statistic can be expressed as: \nT=R [∑\ny(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n] \n \n \n \n  \
    \     (13) \nwhere R[.] denotes the real part, y(n) is the received signal \n\
    by SU, x(n)* is the complex conjugate of the signal transmitted \nby PU, and n=\
    \ [1,2…. N] is the sample index. \nIn the absence of the primary user’s signal,\
    \ the given \nexpression can be written as follows: \nT=R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n\
    ] \n \n \n \n       (14) \nWhereas in the presence of the primary user, the test\
    \ static \ncan be simplified as under: \nT= ∑\n(|x[n]|)2\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B\
    =1\n+R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B=1\n] \n \n       (15) \nWhere n(n)\
    \ denotes Additive White Gaussian Noise \n(AWGN) with mean zero and variance \U0001D70E\
    \U0001D70E2. \nThe value of the test statistic T is compared to a fixed \nthreshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide on the presence of a primary user \n\
    signal. H1 is considered to be true if T > \U0001D706\U0001D706, and H0 is \n\
    considered to be true otherwise. \nIt is noteworthy that the waveform-based sensing\
    \ scheme \ncan only be applied to wireless systems having known signal \npatterns,\
    \ such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b) [83] and WIMAX [84]. \nIn [85], it is demonstrated\
    \ that compared to energy detector \ntechnique, this method is more reliable and\
    \ has less sensing \ntime. In addition, it is demonstrated that the accuracy of\
    \ this \nsensing scheme increases with the length of the known primary \nsignal\
    \ pattern. \nIn [86], the authors have opted for waveform-based sensing \nscheme\
    \ to analyze the sensing performance of the simultaneous \ntransmission-and-sensing\
    \ (TS) mode, which has proven its \neffectiveness under imperfect self-interference\
    \ signal (SIS), \nunlike energy detection that cannot differentiate between a\
    \ PU \nsignal and a residual SIS. \nIn spite of the aforementioned advantages,\
    \ there are some \ndownsides to this scheme, mainly the need for complete and\
    \ \naccurate information concerning waveform patterns as well as \nhigh synchronization\
    \ between PU and SU, which is not always \npossible to attain. \nConcerning the\
    \ implementation complexity, coherent \ndetection is more complex than Energy\
    \ detection method and \nhas a lower complexity compared to match filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique. \nTable III provides a performance comparison of the \npreviously\
    \ described narrowband sensing methods based on a \nset of performance criteria,\
    \ namely detection accuracy, \ncomplexity, need for prior information about the\
    \ primary user, \nrobustness against noise uncertainty, and sensing time required\
    \ \nto achieve a good performance. \n3) Wideband sensing techniques: Wideband\
    \ spectrum \nsensing enables detecting spectral opportunities that lie within\
    \ \nfrequency bands greater than the coherence bandwidth of the \nchannel. One\
    \ application of this class of sensing is to exploit \nthe available spectrum\
    \ holes in the UHF (ultra-high-\nfrequency) TV band ranging from 300 MHz to 3\
    \ GHz. \nAs have been discussed earlier, narrowband sensing \nschemes make a single\
    \ binary decision for the whole frequency \nband. That makes these schemes incapable\
    \ to perform directly \nwideband sensing, since the latter intends to determine\
    \ the \noccupancy of several sub-channels that are involved in a given \nwideband\
    \ spectrum at a time. \nThe two types of wideband sensing techniques (Nyquist\
    \ / \nSub-Nyquist) will be briefly reviewed in this subsection. \n \n \n112 |\

    \ \nwideband \nsensing: \nNyquist \nwideband \nsensing is carried out using a\
    \ standard ADC operating at \nNyquist rate to digitize the wideband signal and\
    \ digital signal \nprocessing methods to detect spectral opportunities. It \n\
    includes, among other, wavelet-based detection, multi-band \njoint detection,\
    \ and filter bank detection: \nWavelet-based detection [87] determines spectrum\
    \ holes \nover a wide frequency band, which is assumed to be composed \nof a multitude\
    \ of sub-bands whose locations and power spectral \ndensities are unknown, by\
    \ using the wavelet transform. The \nlatter serves to identify discontinuities\
    \ that are located at the \nboundaries (edges) of each sub-band. The discontinuous\
    \ \nchanges on the edges correspond to irregularities in power \nspectral density.\
    \ As such, information about the locations and \nintensities of the sub-bands\
    \ can be retrieved through the \nwavelet transform and then their status (occupied\
    \ or \nunoccupied) can be deduced. \nConcerning the multiband joint detection\
    \ algorithm [88], it \nsenses the primary signal over multiple frequency channels\
    \ by \nperforming the following procedures: first, sampling the \nwideband signal\
    \ using a high sampling rate analog to digital \nconverter. Second, dividing the\
    \ sampled data into parallel data \nstreams by a serial-to-parallel converter.\
    \ Third, computing the \nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the digital signal. Fourth,\
    \ \ndividing the wideband spectrum into multiple sub-bands that \nare occupied\
    \ by narrowband signals. Finally, detecting \nspectrum opportunities over each\
    \ sub-band by using a \nnarrowband sensing scheme such as energy detection. \n\
    Furthermore, this technique allows to jointly determine the \noptimal threshold,\
    \ that maximizes the accuracy of sensing for \nall the sub-channels, by formulating\
    \ an optimization problem. \nAs for filter bank detection [89], a filter bank,\
    \ consisting of \na set of bandpass filters, is used to separate the wideband\
    \ signal \ninto multiple sub-bands. The bandpass filters are realized \nthrough\
    \ modulation (Poly-phase decomposition) of a prototype \nfilter. The prototype\
    \ filter is a lowpass filter that is used to \nimplement the zeroth band of the\
    \ filter bank. The obtained sub-\nbands are then sensed separately via a narrowband\
    \ sensing \nscheme. In this type of sensing, the sub-bands can be down-\nconverted\
    \ and consequently re-sampled at a lower sampling \nrate. However, a large number\
    \ of RF components will be \nadded, resulting in a high implementation complexity\
    \ [90]. \nWhile Nyquist wideband sensing allows to exploit \nefficiently the available\
    \ spectrum, it has certain limitations, \nincluding the requirement of a high\
    \ sampling rate (Wavelet-\nbased detection and multiband joint detection) and\
    \ the high \nimplementation complexity (Filter bank). \nb) Sub-Nyquist \nwideband\
    \ \nsensing: \nSub-Nyquist \nwideband sensing offers solutions to the challenges\
    \ facing \nNyquist-based sensing, more particularly high sampling rate \nand high\
    \ implementation complexity concerns. Sub-Nyquist \napproaches aim to identify\
    \ spectral opportunities by exploiting \nonly a few measurements derived from\
    \ processing wideband \nsignals at sampling rates less than the Nyquist rate.\
    \ \nAmong the most important Sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \ntypes is compressive-based\
    \ sensing [91–93]. The latter refers to \nthe process of recovering a sparse signal\
    \ from a few \nmeasurements by following a three-step procedure (sparse \nrepresentation,\
    \ measurement, and sparse recovery). In the first \nstep, the sparsity of the\
    \ signal is derived by projecting the \nsignal on an appropriate basis. In second,\
    \ only a reduced \nnumber of measurements are retrieved by multiplying the \n\
    sparse signal by a measurement matrix. In third, the signal is \nrecovered by\
    \ using the few collected measurements. Finally, \nthe sensing operation is performed\
    \ to identify the spectral \nopportunities. \nIt is noteworthy that the use of\
    \ comprehensive sensing, in \nthe context of wideband sensing, is enabled due\
    \ to the sparsity \nfeature that characterizes the wideband signal in the frequency\
    \ \ndomain. \nFurthermore, the reliability of sub-Nyquist wideband \nsensing schemes\
    \ depends largely on the accuracy of sparsity \nlevel estimation. Although, the\
    \ latter suffers from uncertainty \nbecause of various factors, mainly the dynamic\
    \ nature of PUs \ntransmission activities as well as wireless channel impairments.\
    \ \nD. Machine Learning for Spectrum Sensing \nAs pointed out earlier, CR is an\
    \ intelligent radio system that \nincorporates the three main components which\
    \ any intelligent \nsystem should have, namely perception, learning, and \nreasoning\
    \ [94]. Perception refers to the ability of the system to \nsense its radio environment\
    \ and it can be realized by means of \nsensing measurements of the spectrum. Learning\
    \ refers to the \nability of the system to convert the gathered information into\
    \ \nknowledge and it can be achieved through classification and \n113 | P a g\
    \ e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \ngeneralization algorithms.\
    \ Finally, knowledge is exploited by \nthe system to attain its objectives via\
    \ reasoning ability \n[94].Considering this intelligent design, machine learning\
    \ \nbased spectrum sensing presents itself as a good alternative to \ndetermine\
    \ the channel occupancy in Cognitive Radio Networks \nby addressing two main issues\
    \ which are classification and \ndecision making [94]. \nMachine learning algorithms\
    \ can be classified into two \nbroad groups: supervised learning and unsupervised\
    \ learning. \nIn supervised learning, a classifier learns from a training \ndataset\
    \ to make predictions on unforeseen data. According to \nthe training dataset,\
    \ supervised machine learning problems can \nbe further grouped into classification\
    \ and regression problems. \nIf the input variables are mapped to discrete output\
    \ values \n(categories, labels, classes…), then it is a classification \nproblem.\
    \ If the input variables are mapped to continuous \noutput values, then it is\
    \ a regression problem. Some examples \nof supervised algorithms include support\
    \ vector machines \n(SVM), Random forest, and naive Bayesian classifier (NBC).\
    \ \nAs for unsupervised learning, its main function consists in \nfinding patterns\
    \ in a set of untagged data. K-means is one of \nthe simplest and most widely\
    \ used unsupervised machine \nlearning algorithms. \nIn the context of Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks, several papers \nhave dealt with the use of machine learning\
    \ algorithms to \npredict the availability of frequency channels. For instance,\
    \ in \n[95], the authors performed a comparative analysis of different \nsupervised\
    \ and unsupervised machine learning algorithms \nbased on computational time and\
    \ classification accuracy. They \nalso proposed a new method that combines support\
    \ vector \nmachines with the firefly algorithm. The authors of [96] \nproposed\
    \ a deep learning approach to learn channel activities \nand predict its availability\
    \ in future time slots. The ability to \npredict the channel occupancy in the\
    \ next time slots may \nincrease the efficiency of selecting the more appropriate\
    \ \nchannel at the instant t (For example, choosing the channel \nhaving the highest\
    \ probability of being unoccupied in the next \ntime slots). \nGenerally, in the\
    \ case of spectrum sensing, researchers \nadopt a two-phase machine learning approach\
    \ [95,97]. In the \nfirst phase, an unsupervised learning technique, such as K-\n\
    means algorithm, is applied to discover the transmission \npatterns of primary\
    \ users. In the second phase, the discovered \nclusters (channel busy or free)\
    \ are used to train supervised \nlearning classifiers like support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) and \nthen to assign the new input data to the suitable cluster. it is\
    \ \nworth mentioning that in several works, the sensing clusters are \nassumed\
    \ to be known and thus the first phase is omitted. In this \ncase, the researchers\
    \ adopt a one-phase machine learning \napproach in which supervised learning techniques\
    \ are trained \nwith the already known clusters [98,99]. \nIn building machine\
    \ learning models for spectrum sensing, \nseveral features are used, including\
    \ energy statistic, probability \nvector, and occupancy over time. Obviously,\
    \ the accuracy of \ndetecting the primary users may be affected by the selected\
    \ \nfeatures. \nFinally, to evaluate the performance of a given model, a set \n\
    of metrics can be used mainly, probability of detection, \nprobability of false\
    \ alarm, total error rate, sensing time, and \naccuracy. \nE. Sensing Challenges\
    \ \nThis subsection is devoted to discussing the various \nchallenges related\
    \ to the spectrum sensing process in Cognitive \nRadio Networks as well as highlighting\
    \ some possible future \nresearch directions in this field. \n1) Hidden PU problem:\
    \ As the Carrier Sense Multiple \nAccessing (CSMA), which is characterized by\
    \ the presence of \nhidden node problem, spectrum sensing suffers also from \n\
    hidden primary user problem. The latter refers to the situation \nin which the\
    \ secondary user misses the primary user presence \ndue to many issues, including\
    \ severe multipath fading and \nshadowing effects experienced by primary signals,\
    \ during \npropagation from PU transmitter to SU receiver. As such, the \nsecondary\
    \ user may induce undesirable interference to \nprimary user receivers. In several\
    \ research papers, cooperative \nsensing has been proposed as a successful approach\
    \ to handle \nthis issue by exploiting spatial diversity [49,100]. \n2) Challenges\
    \ related to cooperative sensing: Cooperative \nsensing has proven to be effective\
    \ in improving the reliability \nand accuracy of detection, especially in the\
    \ case of the \npresence of channel impairments. Moreover, it has also been \n\
    shown to be useful in decreasing individual sensing durations \nand local processing\
    \ requirements [21,53]. \nDespite its different advantages, cooperation among\
    \ CR \nusers also brought many challenges and invoked significant \nresearches.\
    \ One of these challenges is mitigating the additional \nsignaling overhead and\
    \ reducing delays that are induced by the \ncooperation process [101]. \nAnother\
    \ challenge is to find a tradeoff between the number \nof users participating\
    \ in cooperation and additional processing \nrequirements. Indeed, a large number\
    \ of cooperative nodes can \nensure a high probability of detection, even in the\
    \ presence of \nchannel uncertainties and detectors with less sensitivity, but\
    \ it \nintroduces a considerable amount of extra overhead which \nleads to an\
    \ increase in the sensing time and processing. Hence, \nthere exists a compromise.\
    \ \nAnother challenge consists in developing asynchronous \ncooperative spectrum\
    \ sensing algorithms [102,103]. In fact, CR \nnodes are located at different positions\
    \ and may perform \nspectrum sensing at different times [104]. Therefore, CR nodes\
    \ \ncannot report their local sensing results to the fusion center at \nthe same\
    \ time and thus some of the reported information may \nnot be up to date [103].\
    \ Furthermore, there is always a time \noffset between the local observation and\
    \ the final decision \nwhich may incur performance degradation. In addition, \n\
    reporting channel uncertainties may impact negatively the \nsensing accuracy.\
    \ \n3) Spectrum sensing duration: Admittedly, a long sensing \nduration can guarantee\
    \ a higher accuracy for spectrum sensing \nresults, but it can compromise with\
    \ interference avoidance, \nenergy efficiency, and throughput. \n114 | P a g e\
    \  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nRegarding interference avoidance,\
    \ secondary users must be \naware promptly of the presence of the primary user\
    \ and vacate \nthe frequency band rapidly when the incumbent user resumes \nits\
    \ transmission in that band. Thus, a real trade-off arises \nbetween the quickness\
    \ with which the secondary user must \nperform the aforementioned tasks and the\
    \ required sensing \nduration to ensure more reliable results. \nConcerning energy\
    \ efficiency, the gain in accuracy \nachieved by a long sensing duration comes\
    \ at the expense of \nenergy. Hence, sensing duration and energy efficiency should\
    \ \nbe optimized. \nAs for throughput, it is inversely related to sensing time.\
    \ \nTherefore, there is a compromise between longer sensing \nduration for higher\
    \ performance and lower sensing duration for \ngood throughput. \nThese trade-offs\
    \ should be addressed jointly to find an \noptimum solution that ensure a higher\
    \ performance under \ncertain constraints. \n4) Noise \nuncertainty: \nSeveral\
    \ \nspectrum \nsensing \ntechniques rely on a threshold value to decide on the\
    \ presence \nof primary user signals. Hence, selecting the optimum \nthreshold\
    \ is crucial and important to ensure high accuracy of \nsensing results. To determine\
    \ the best threshold value, many \nparameters should be taken into consideration\
    \ such as noise \npower. The latter is uncertain and developing techniques that\
    \ \nare robust to noise uncertainty is still a challenging task. Some \nresearch\
    \ papers have addressed this issue using different \napproaches. For instance,\
    \ in [105] a blind spectrum sensing \ntechnique based on goodness of fit testing\
    \ of t‐distribution \nhas been proposed to cope with the noise uncertainty problem.\
    \ \n5) Complexity and hardware requirements: Several issues \nneed to be addressed\
    \ to bridge the gap between the theory and \nthe hardware implementation realities\
    \ of spectrum sensing \nschemes from both types, narrowband and wideband sensing.\
    \ \nThese include the complexity of narrowband sensing \ntechniques, mainly covariance-based\
    \ and cyclostationary \nfeature detection schemes, which require large processing\
    \ \npower that is unsuitable for portable devices. Hence, \nAdditional efforts\
    \ are required to reduce the complexity of \nthese techniques and take advantage\
    \ of their various benefits \nin real-life application. Besides, meeting the hardware\
    \ \nrequirements of wideband sensing schemes, like high-\nresolution ADCs and\
    \ high-speed signal processors, while \nmaintaining acceptable complexity and\
    \ moderate computation \npower, is a challenging task. \n6) Sparsity level uncertainty:\
    \ In wideband compressive \nsensing, estimating the accurate sparsity level is\
    \ of paramount \nimportance, since it is a prerequisite for determining the \n\
    optimal number of measurements. However, achieving this \nresult is very difficult,\
    \ especially in rapidly changing \nenvironments, due to random changes in spectrum\
    \ activities \nand time-varying fading channels. That may lead to calculate \n\
    the number of measurements using the worst-case sparsity \nlevel assumption, resulting\
    \ in high energy consumption and \ninefficient use of sub-Nyquist sampling technologies.\
    \ \nTherefore, developing blind sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \nschemes, in which\
    \ the estimation of sparsity level isn’t \nneeded, still a challenging task [90].\
    \ \nIn the literature, only a few papers have dealt with the issue \nof sparsity\
    \ level uncertainty. For instance, the authors of [106] \nproposed an algorithm\
    \ for estimating the sparsity level of the \nchannel over a learned dictionary\
    \ using Machine Learning \nalgorithms. \n7) Security: As with any wireless network,\
    \ Cognitive \nRadio Networks are vulnerable to various cybersecurity \nattacks\
    \ that can be performed by selfish or malicious users and \ninduce disruptive\
    \ effects on network operation. Selfish users \nexploit network facilities for\
    \ their interests, namely \nmonopolizing the use of available spectrum opportunities\
    \ and \nthus depriving legitimate Secondary users of their fair share of \nspectrum.\
    \ As for malicious users, they abuse network facilities \nby exploiting the existing\
    \ vulnerabilities and thereby \nhindering legitimate SUs from using the spectrum.\
    \ \nSome of the cybersecurity attacks in Cognitive Radio \nNetworks include most\
    \ active band (MAB), primary user \nemulation (PUE), and spectrum sensing data\
    \ falsification \n(SSDF) attacks. \nMost active band (MAB) attack aims at detecting\
    \ and \nmaking the most active band, in a multi-band CR network, \nunavailable\
    \ by targeting it via a denial of service (DoS) attack \nand consequently preventing\
    \ the other users (PU and SU) from \nusing it. The authors of [107] proposed a\
    \ coordinated \nconcealment strategy to counter this attack. In this strategy,\
    \ a \nset of SUs cooperate and transmit useless data in a free band to \nmake\
    \ it the most active and therefore the attacker's target. \nPrimary user emulation\
    \ (PUE) attack is an attack where a \nselfish or malicious node adjusts its air\
    \ interface to emulate \nprimary user characteristics and thus mislead secondary\
    \ users \nconcerning the availability of the spectrum holes [108]. During \nthe\
    \ sensing process, SUs, under this attack, may detect attacker \nsignals as primary\
    \ user signals and then refrain from using the \nspectrum. A range of countermeasures\
    \ against PUE attack has \nbeen \ninvestigated \nin \nthe \nliterature \n[109].\
    \ \nThese \ncountermeasures can be categorized into four types: \ncountermeasures\
    \ based on cryptography, countermeasures \nbased on fingerprint, countermeasures\
    \ based on game theory, \nand hybrid countermeasures that combine the three other\
    \ types \n[109]. \nSpectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack, also \n\
    known as Byzantine attack, specially targets cooperative \nspectrum sensing and\
    \ consists in compromising the fusion \ncenter with false spectrum sensing results\
    \ to deceive decision-\nmaking. In [110], a reputation-based approach, in which\
    \ the \nfusion center recognizes the malicious attackers and eliminates \nthem\
    \ from the data fusion process, was proposed to counter \nSSDF attack. \nWhile\
    \ significant efforts have been carried out to detect and \ncope with cybersecurity\
    \ issues, there are still several challenges \nthat need to be addressed, including\
    \ developing advanced \ntechniques that do not need prior knowledge about PU location\
    \ \n115 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n, as this\
    \ is not always available in real-world scenarios, \ndeveloping detection and\
    \ counter-measures methods based on \ncryptography that take into account resource\
    \ constraint (e.g., \npower and bandwidth), and developing spectrum sensing \n\
    techniques capable of differentiating between PU signals and \nmalicious user\
    \ signals. \nV. CR-BASED IOT \nThe wide variety of IoT technologies have led to\
    \ a rapidly \nincreasing number of networked devices that are expected to \nreach\
    \ 51.11 billion by 2023, according to research from Cisco \nstates (See Fig. 13).\
    \ Such devices involve daily tech gadgets \nsuch as smartphones and smart home\
    \ devices, as well as \nindustrial devices like smart machines and robots. These\
    \ smart \nconnected devices are capable of gathering, sharing, and \nanalyzing\
    \ information and creating actions accordingly. By \n2023, global spending on\
    \ IoT will reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollar \n[111]. This puts IoT at the core of\
    \ current and future social and \neconomic transformation. \nFurthermore, with\
    \ the massive proliferation of these \nconnected objects, there is an increased\
    \ demand for spectrum \nresources. Cognitive Radio proves to be a promising \n\
    technology to cater to current and future IoT devices in terms \nof spectrum access.\
    \ In this section, the integration of the \nInternet of Things and Cognitive Radio\
    \ is explored. \n \nFig. 13. IoT Connected Devices Installed base Worldwide from\
    \ 2015 to 2025 \n(in billions)3. \nA. Definition of IoT \nThe term \"Internet\
    \ of Things\" was coined by Kevin Ashton \nto depict “a system in which the Internet\
    \ is connected to the \nphysical world by ubiquitous sensors”4. \nInternet of\
    \ Things (IoT) can be defined as a network of \nobjects connected to the Internet\
    \ and can communicate with \neach other using different communication technologies.\
    \ These \nobjects are equipped with sensors, that allow interaction with \nthe\
    \ environment, and communication modules [112–114]. \nSome of those sensors include\
    \ temperature sensors, pressure \nsensors, proximity sensors, and humidity sensors.\
    \ \nToday, the IoT enables the real world and the virtual/or \ndigital world interconnection.\
    \ Thanks to IoT, things will \n3 https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-\n\
    the-internet-of-things/ \n4 https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3411\
    \ \ncommunicate with each other and develop their own \nintelligence. Televisions,\
    \ cars, kitchen appliances, surveillance \ncameras, smartphones, utility meters,\
    \ cardiac monitors, \nthermostats, and almost anything that we can imagine will\
    \ be \nconnected every day, everywhere and every time. \nThe idea of the IoT dates\
    \ back to 1999 [115] and became a \nreality due to several technologies and protocols,\
    \ including \nMachine to Machine (M2M), Wireless Sensor Networks \n(WSN), Radio\
    \ frequency Dentification (RFID), Internet \nProtocol version 6 (IPv6), IPv6 Low\
    \ power Wireless Personal \nArea Networks (6LoWPAN), Routing Protocol for Low-Power\
    \ \nand \nLossy \nNetworks \n(RPL), \nConstrained \nApplication \nProtocol(CoAP),\
    \ and Cognitive Radio that comes to empower \nthe IoT revolution. This revolution\
    \ gives birth to the \nproliferation of small devices such as sensors and actuators,\
    \ \nwith low consumption at lower cost, and a large number of \nplatforms allowing\
    \ users to develop their own applications. \nThus, the number of connected « things\
    \ » is increasing \nexponentially in the world (See Fig. 13). \nB. Motivations\
    \ behind the use of Cognitive Radio in the IoT \nCognitive Radio has a great potential\
    \ to address several \nissues and challenges related to the deployment of IoT\
    \ \nnetworks, namely, resource scarcity, interferences problem, \nlimited communication\
    \ range, purchasing license, storing and \nanalyzing the data generated by IoT\
    \ objects, heterogeneity, and \nreconfigurability and autonomicity. Dealing with\
    \ these issues \npresents the prime motivation behind the use of Cognitive \n\
    Radio in IoT. \nRegarding spectrum resources, it is difficult to allocate \nfrequency\
    \ bands to all the ever-increasing number of IoT \nobjects. CR address this issue\
    \ by enabling frequency reuse. \n As for the interference problem, most IoT technologies\
    \ \nsuch as RFID, IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) operates in UHF and \nISM frequency bands\
    \ which are already saturated and can’t \naccommodate more applications. Thus,\
    \ sharing these bands \nbetween a large number of objects creates inevitable \n\
    interferences. CR deal with this issue by enabling dynamic \nspectrum access to\
    \ interference-free channels. \nConcerning communication range, ISM unlicensed\
    \ bands \nallow wireless technologies to operate only over a limited \nrange.\
    \ Acquiring a frequency spectrum, that ensures \ncommunications over long distances,\
    \ requires the purchase of \nlicenses which generates superfluous expenses. CR\
    \ avoids the \npurchase of license and allows the opportunistic usage of \nunoccupied\
    \ bands that enables long-distance communications. \nIn terms of storing and analyzing\
    \ the data generated by IoT \nobjects, the objects must find communication links\
    \ to transmit \nthe generated information to numerous servers (Cloud servers).\
    \ \nCR is a proper solution to resolve this issue. \nWith respect to heterogeneity\
    \ problems, IoT applications \nrepresent a wide range of design options (resources,\
    \ \ndeployment, connectivity, energy, communication modality, \ninfrastructure,\
    \ network size, network topology...). Thus, new \ncommunication paradigms should\
    \ be designed to support this \nheterogeneity by providing environmental discovery,\
    \ self-\norganization, and self-management capabilities [116]. CR is \n116 | P\

    \ used to tackle heterogeneity \nissues. \nAnother reason is related to reconfigurability\
    \ and \nautonomicity. In fact, smart objects are expected to have the \ncapacity\

    \ to be able to recognize and analyze \ntheir environment, detect neighboring\
    \ objects, and then \nreconfigure. themselves. CR proves to be a suitable solution\
    \ to \nfit these circumstances. \nTaking into account all of the above, it can\
    \ be concluded \nthat Cognitive Radio is genuinely a promising enabler \ntechnology\
    \ for IoT. \nC. IoT Applications and CR \nThe deployment of IoT products and services\
    \ will be \npresent in all sectors and industries, from the smart home to the\
    \ \nsmart city, education, health care, manufacturing, energy, \nutilities, commerce,\
    \ transportation, monitoring, supply chain, \nand logistics as illustrated in\
    \ Fig. 14. In general, the \nopportunities offered by IoT are unlimited and its\
    \ full impact \nand potential will be realized in the near future as more and\
    \ \nmore devices connect to the Internet. At present, there are few \nworks in\
    \ the literature dealing with potential applications of \nCR technology for IoT,\
    \ including military applications, \ncognitive radio-vehicular ad hoc networks\
    \ (CR-VANET), \nemergency networks, smart grids, smart metering, and medical \n\
    applications [117–123]. Table IV describes some IoT \napplications while demonstrating\
    \ how CR can be used to \naddress a number of their concerns. \nD. Open Research\
    \ Issues in CR-Based IoT \nSeveral open research issues need to be addressed in\
    \ order \nto take advantage of the full potential of Cognitive Radio for \nIoT\
    \ networks. In this subsection, some of these issues will be \ndiscussed. \n1)\
    \ Optimization of network resources: Efficient spectrum \nutilization, in the\
    \ context of a network composed of CR IoT \nnodes, requires the joint optimization\
    \ of a set of parameters \nsuch as transmission power, energy efficiency, transmission\
    \ \ndelay, and transmission data rate, which is a challenging task. \nThe authors\
    \ of [125] formulated an optimization problem to \nconverge to an optimal solution,\
    \ in a constrained environment, \nby taking into account three variables namely;\
    \ transmission \npower, transmission rate, and transmission delay. To solve this\
    \ \nproblem, they applied a branch-and-cut polyhedral approach. \nThe results\
    \ show that an increase in network and packet size \nleads to an increase in transmission\
    \ delay, power, rate, and \ninterference. \nFormulating and solving multi-objective\
    \ optimization \nproblems, considering a large number of factors, still need to\
    \ \nbe addressed. \n2) Energy efficiency: One of the main challenges that \nneed\
    \ to be addressed in CR-based IoT networks is energy \nefficiency. IoT objects\
    \ with cognitive radio capabilities \nconsume more energy due to performing additional\
    \ functions \nmainly spectrum sensing, which intensifies the power \nconsumption\
    \ issue, especially for energy-constrained nodes \nand battery-powered devices.\
    \ \n \nFig. 14. Applications of IoT. \nTABLE IV. \nCR CONTRIBUTION IN IOT APPLICATIONS\
    \ \nIoT application \nDescription and CR contribution \nSmart Grids [120,121]\
    \ \nSmart Grid is an electricity distribution network that allows the flow of\
    \ information between producers and consumers in order to \ncontrol and regulate\
    \ the flow of electricity in real time and enable more efficient management of\
    \ the electricity grid. The major \nchallenge of this technology is the transmission\
    \ of data through long distances without investing in the purchase of licenses\
    \ or the \ninstallation of cable trays. Cognitive radio offers a good solution\
    \ to this problem. \nSmart Homes [117] \nHomes will be equipped with smart objects,\
    \ allowing to carry out all daily task, such as smart lamps and smart fridges.\
    \ These \nobjects will integrate sensors endowed with cognitive capabilities that\
    \ help to avoid interference in the ISM band. \nHealthcare and Medical \nApplications\
    \ [122,123] \nSmart sensors are deployed to monitor critical data like blood pressure,\
    \ glucose levels, and temperature. With Cognitive Radio \nthis information can\
    \ be transmitted to medical staff in real time, over long distances without worrying\
    \ about spectrum availability. \nSmart Cities [119] \nThe smart city is a paradigm\
    \ of urban development which integrates information and communication technology\
    \ (ICT) and IoT \nsystems. In this paradigm, continuous connectivity should be\
    \ maintained. CRNs can be a good solution to support this \nrequirement. \nInternet\
    \ of Vehicles (IoV) \n[124] \nToday, the trends toward less dependence on human\
    \ beings have led us to the IoV paradigm in which vehicle control is achieved\
    \ \nthrough the integration of communications and embedded systems. The IoV is\
    \ supposed to be an autonomous travel decision-\nmaker. Safe navigation may be\
    \ possible in the future through vehicle-to-vehicle information exchange, vehicle-mounted\
    \ sensors, \nand user intentions. The challenge in IoVs is the availability of\
    \ spectrum for mobile vehicles. CRNs may be a good solution \nbecause of their\
    \ long-range and interference-free spectrum sensing. \n \n117 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\

    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nAmong the solutions that have been introduced to deal\
    \ with \nenergy efficiency concerns are energy harvesting or scavenging \nand\
    \ Cooperative Wireless Networks. Energy harvesting is \ndefined as the process\
    \ through which energy is extracted from \nexternal sources, such as wind and\
    \ solar energies, and then \nstored so as to be used as a source of power [126].\
    \ Energy \nharvesting is considered as one of the most enabling \ntechnologies\
    \ \nfor \nGreen \nComputing \nand \nreal-world \nimplementation of IoT. In [127]\
    \ a differential game model has \nbeen proposed to resolve the resource allocation\
    \ problem in \ncognitive WSN using energy harvesting. Optimal resource \nallocation\
    \ strategies for all SUs are obtained by determining \nthe loop Nash equilibrium\
    \ and the feedback Nash equilibrium \nsolutions of the proposed model. In [128],\
    \ a CR-based energy \nharvesting approach has been used to extend the battery’s\
    \ \nlifetime for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under reliability \nand secrecy\
    \ constraints. To reduce energy consumption, the \nenergy harvested is maximized\
    \ and the transmission energy \nconsumption \nis \nminimized \nby \nsolving \n\
    a \nformulated \noptimization problem. \nCurrently, Cognitive Radio networks based\
    \ on energy \nefficiency approaches are considered an important research \ndirection.\
    \ \n3) Security: Addressing security issues in CR-Based IoT \nnetworks is a prime\
    \ concern and a challenging task as most \nIoT objects are inherently heterogeneous\
    \ and have their proper \nuniform security standards. These standards are not\
    \ adequate \nfor all heterogeneous networks. Several privacy and security \naspects\
    \ should be taken into account in designing IoT systems, \nincluding authentication,\
    \ security assurance, and intrusion \nsoft-ware [117]. Worthy efforts have been\
    \ done to tackle \nsecurity issues in some IoT applications with cognitive radio\
    \ \ncapabilities. For instance, the authors of [129] proposed a \ndistributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum sensing approach to deal \nwith the security problem in\
    \ CR-VANETs. This approach uses \na weighted consensus-based spectrum sensing\
    \ technique with \ntrust assistance to ensure the reliability of spectrum sensing\
    \ \noperation in a hostile CR-VANET. The validity of the \nproposed approach was\
    \ approved by extensive simulations. In \n[128], the proposed CR-Based energy\
    \ management scheme for \nUAVs has been designed in such a way that the secrecy\
    \ and \nreliability of the system are ensured. This is illustrated by \nconsidering\
    \ the scenario for the eavesdroppers. \nSecurity remains an open issue to be addressed\
    \ as \ncybersecurity attacks and threats are emerging and increasing \nin parallel\
    \ with new technologies. Therefore, developing \ninnovative countermeasures is\
    \ demanded. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nNowadays, wireless network devices are emerging\
    \ at an \nunprecedented rate, which will further exacerbate spectrum \nshortages.\
    \ Therefore, addressing the spectrum scarcity problem \nbecomes more urgent. Cognitive\
    \ Radio is a promising \ntechnology to overcome this issue for futuristic networks\
    \ (IoT \nand 5G) by enabling an efficient, flexible, and opportunistic \nusage\
    \ of the scarce frequency spectrum. This paper provides a \nreview of Cognitive\
    \ Radio with emphasis is put on SDR, \nspectrum sensing, and CR-Based IoT. Concerning\
    \ SDR, this \narticle highlights its architecture, tools, advantages, and some\
    \ \nof its ongoing challenges. As for spectrum sensing, it is \nextensively reviewed:\
    \ spectrum opportunities considering \nmultiple dimensions are discussed, classification\
    \ of spectrum \nsensing based on several aspects is presented, Narrowband and\
    \ \nWideband sensing techniques are analyzed, ML-based \nspectrum sensing is studied,\
    \ and challenges and open research \ndirections are reviewed. Regarding CR-Based\
    \ IoT, the focus \nwas on explaining the motivations behind the use of CR in IoT\
    \ \nnetworks and reviewing some of the open issues related to CR-\nBased IoT.\

    Get rights and content Abstract In this paper, a battery-powered Internet of Things
    assisting Cognitive Radio (CR-IoT) network is considered. In CR-IoT network, a
    set of IoT End Nodes (ENs) are assumed to cooperatively sense the channel. Each
    EN performs a Spectrum Sensing (SS) and reports its decision to a Fusion Center
    in order to reach the decision on the PU status. Such monitoring of PU comes at
    the cost of additional energy resources consumed by the EN to perform SS and reporting,
    and raises the need to set a suitable protocol to manage the data exchange. The
    extra operations may exhaust the energy of the EN battery, especially when Low
    Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technology is used. In our manuscript, an Eligibility
    Score-based (ESco) Strategy is defined to reflect the eligibility of an EN to
    make a reliable SS taking into consideration its battery level. Our strategy is
    adapted to LoRaWAN Class-B protocol in order to handle real world scenarios. Necessary
    modifications are introduced to the existing protocol in order to support the
    synchronization between the ENs and the Application Server, (at which the SS need
    is identified), and the on-demand nature of the SS requests. To evaluate our strategy,
    LoRa sensors’ parameters are considered in our simulations. The numerical results
    highlight the efficiency of the proposed strategy by showing the extension of
    the ENs’ lifetime compared to classical strategies. Previous article in issue

    sensingLoRa networksLoRaWAN protocol 1. Introduction According to [1], 75 billions
    of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be connected to the Internet by 2025.
    IoT will cover almost all the society life sectors, such as: urban, industry,
    medicine, transportation, security & surveillance, etc [2], [3]. The expected
    huge number of devices will require special attention to the physical layer in
    order to maintain the service quality [4], [5]. In turn, Cognitive Radio (CR)
    is one of the most studied wireless technologies in the last two decades [6],
    [7], [8]. CR was introduced to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem due to the
    ever increasing demand on the wireless communications. The CR system is based
    on sharing the spectrum between primary (PU) and secondary (SU) users. A PU has
    the exclusive right to access its spectrum band at any time, while SU, as an opportunistic
    user, can only access the spectrum whenever PU is absent. If PU resumes its transmission
    while SU is active, then SU should immediately vacate the channel. The decision
    on the PU channel availability is the mission of the Spectrum Sensing (SS) part
    of CR. To tackle the needs of the additional frequency resources, the shifting
    to the CR-based communication requires SS to keep aware of the PU activity. Due
    to the deployment of IoT networks, their sensors may successfully perform the
    SS operation. Thus, the monitoring of the primary channel can be exploited according
    to two scenarios: • CR-based Communication for IoT: In this scenario, IoT network
    performs SS for its interest due to its need for additional spectrum resources
    to send extra data [9]. This scenario may happen when the number of nodes in the
    IoT network is largely increased, which may cause high pressure on the frequency
    resources and require additional spectral bands. In this scenario, the EN may
    perform SS in addition to its initial task in sensing physical measures, such
    as: the temperature, the humidity, etc. • Providing Spectrum Sensing as a Service
    (SSaaS): the CR-IoT may deliver a service of SS for another network. Hence, Sensing
    as a Service strategy is applied [10], [11]. In this case, CR-IoT receives a request
    from another network/operator asking about the status of a given channel within
    a geographical area. Accordingly, the CR-IoT asks the ENs to perform SS and report
    their decisions on the availability of a given frequency band for the sake of
    another network/operator. This second scenario is particularly covered in this
    paper. 1.1. CR-based Communication for IoT In this section, an overview on related
    works to the CR-based communication for IoT is presented. Due to the huge expected
    number of IoT devices, CR has been proposed as a major solution to tackle the
    problem of the scarcity of frequency resources on the physical layer [4]. CR considers
    the IoT nodes as secondaries and provides them with a high flexibility since they
    may access any frequency band whenever PU is absent. The scarcity of the spectrum
    and the static allocation policy are presented as main reasons to adopt the CR-based
    IoT in future radio technology generations [4]. The latter reference details the
    implementation of CR in IoT network in addition to the standardization and the
    applications of the CR-based IoT. Energy-Throughput trade-off of wireless sensor
    network is studied in [12] in the context of cooperative SS and dedicated to low-power
    devices. The main contribution of that study focuses on minimizing the consumed
    energy while satisfying the requirements of secondary throughput and the primary
    signal detection. In [13], CR is extended to IoT networks in order to make a self-reconfigurable,
    interference-free, and intelligent IoT networks. CR xan be helpful to Machine-to-Machine
    communications as suggested by [14], [15]. A dynamic spectrum allocation for IoT
    is proposed in [16], where a cognitive radio-based strategy is applied in order
    to avoid the interference among the IoT nodes as SU and PU. To achieve such a
    goal, the proposed strategy aims to work in both licensed and unlicensed bands
    in a dynamic manner. Last but not least, cognitive radio framework is proposed
    in [17] for IoT networks. The multiband cooperative SS is applied on IoT nodes,
    assumed to be environment-aware and self-reconfigurable, in order to reduce the
    energy consumption at every node. Multiband SS is adopted due to two main reasons:
    1) the need of the IoT networks to cover several frequency channels to fulfil
    their transmission requirement, and 2) having several available frequency channels
    makes the frequency handoff simpler and faster. 1.2. Spectrum sensing as a service
    The SSaaS is inspired by the concept of Sensing as a Service which can be adopted
    by a Wireless Sensor Network or IoT network to deliver a service to another network
    or operator. Data like humidity, temperature, pressure, etc. can be monitored
    by a WSN/IoT within a geographical area and provided to another operator. Similarly
    to the concept of Sensing as a Service, SSaaS has been proposed to provide another
    network/operator by the channel availability within a geographical area. The authors
    of [18] proposed the separation of the SS task from the other tasks of a cognitive
    radio, by using the dedicated infrastructure of a WSN/IoT. In this case, the WSN/IoT
    outcomes a list of available channels in response to a request of a Cognitive
    Radio-based network. The SSaaS imposes several challenges related to the business
    model to be adopted between the WSN/IoT and the operator to be provided. Other
    challenges related to the nodes selection and the energy efficiency have been
    studied for the literature in the sake of providing reliable and cost-effective
    service of SS [10], [11], [18], [19]. Our manuscript mainly focuses on this scenario,
    where we aim at analysing the selection strategy of the ENs of the IoT network
    in production, and adapt the suitable protocol to exchange the data between the
    ENs and the upper entity of the IoT network. One of the main challenging issues
    when assigning the SS task to an IoT network, in both scenarios detailed above,
    is the energy autonomy which is related to the battery lifetime [20]. For instance,
    in Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) IoT, the lifetime of a sensor is usually
    long and may exceed 5 years [20]. This is related to the battery technology and
    the transmission specifications of the IoT networks, especially the small duty
    cycle of less than 1% as in LoRa network [21]. The sensing operation required
    by the cognitive system reduces the IoT node’s life due to the additional energy
    resources required by the SS function, where two major additional power consuming
    operations have to be done: 1. Making a decision on the channel by applying a
    sensing technique. 2. Reporting the decision to the Fusion Center (FC). This operation
    may rapidly consume the battery energy of the sensor due to the additional transmission
    operation. However, the sensing of a given channel is the mission of several ENs
    in CR-IoT networks. This will positively impact both the energy efficiency and
    the performance since the consumed energy per node will be reduced and the spatial
    diversity will improve the sensing outcome [22]. Each EN makes a decision on the
    channel and sends it to the FC, which combines all decisions on that channel to
    output a final decision. Thus, the selection of the ENs performing the SS becomes
    an essential challenge of the FC. From one hand, selecting these ENs may be a
    function of the required number of ENs to perform the SS in order to fulfil the
    detection requirement (target false alarm and detection probabilities). On the
    other hand, this selection should take into consideration the battery level of
    the EN and its detection reliability, which is related to Signal to Noise Ratio
    (SNR) observed at that node. If an EN is about to be exhausted, it is recommended
    not to ask it to perform further SS. In addition, when the EN’s SNR is bad, EN
    should treat a high number of received samples to outcome a reliable decision
    [23]. This fact may degrade the EN’s battery. However, the ENs selected to perform
    the SS may vary from one SS operation to another. This fact will ensure a high
    participation of the node in the SSaaS task and to decrease the number of transmissions
    of each node so that it respects the LoRaWAN specifications related to the duty
    cycle. In this paper, an Eligibility Score-based (ESco) strategy for IoT network
    providing SSaaS is proposed, where the selection of IoT ENs respects both the
    SS requirements and the energy level of the ENs. LoRaWAN is taken as case study
    to investigate the performance of our strategy, where we adapted the new strategy
    requirements to the LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN is basically designed for uplink
    operations in which the ENs report the data to the Application Server (AS) after
    passing by the Gateway (GW) and the Network Server (NS) sparsely in time with
    a relatively low throughput. This fact ensures a long lifetime to the ENs measured
    in years instead of hours or months. In our application, the need for spectrum
    resources is identified at the AS, which requests the ENs to collect sensing data
    on a given channel. Then, the ENs should report their SS decisions on such channel
    to the AS, which plays the role of the FC in our work, upon request. Hence, we
    are in on-demand scenario [24], which is not fulfilled in existing LoRaWAN protocol.
    Therefore, we are suggesting to adapt the protocol to better fit our application.
    Fig. 1 gives an overview of the adopted system model. The whole network is under
    the control of the NS and AS. NS manages the transmission parameters of the LoRa
    ENs such the Spreading Factor (SF) and the operating frequency. However, being
    the only entity in the LoRa network allowed to read the sensing content of the
    EN’s message, AS elects the most eligible nodes to perform the SS using ESco strategy
    based on the data received from these nodes. A selected node participates in the
    CR operations and works at the CR network level to sense the PU activity. Download

    proposed ESco solution: the elected End-Nodes from a standard LoRa network carry
    on the Spectrum Sensing for the Cognitive Radio Network layer The main contributions
    of this manuscript can be summarized as follows: 1. Based on an evaluated Eligibility
    Score (ES) defining the eligibility of each EN to perform the SS, a new strategy
    called ESco of ENs selection is proposed. ESco ensures that the CR-IoT meets the
    detection requirements to achieve a high spectrum efficiency and a good protection
    of PU against the ENs transmission interference. In addition to the SS reliability,
    the new strategy respects the energy-related ability of the EN’s battery to make
    SS. 2. The proposed strategy is adapted to the highly deployed LPWAN technology
    LoRa, where the LoRaWAN Class-B protocol is modified to meet the requirements
    of our strategy on exchanging the data between the AS and the ENs. Noting that
    in our paper, the LoRa network does not operate in cognitive way, but it holds
    its physical parameters, i.e. the operating frequency and the adopted Spreading
    Factors. The LoRa network in our study is SSaaS provider, which delivers the information
    on the primary channel to the AS upon a request of the latter. 3. The PayLoad
    (PL) of the packets related to both SS and reporting from EN to AS is investigated
    in order to get an efficient performance while saving the EN battery. 4. Numerical
    results show that long lifetime of the EN’s battery is better ensured thanks to
    the proposed strategy compared to classical strategies. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows. In Section 2, the system model is described and detailed.
    The proposed ESco strategy is explained in Section 3; where we derive the ES and
    the related strategy to select the eligible ENs to establish the SS. Section 4
    describes the adopted protocol to exchange the data between the ENs and the AS.
    LoRaWAN-based protocol is presented. Numerical simulations are presented in Section
    5; where we evaluate our proposed strategy based on the detection reliability,
    battery energy efficiency, and CR-IoT throughput. Section 6 concludes our work.
    2. System model The considered CR-IoT consists of a certain number of ENs, with
    ENs are able to make the SS. The nodes serve as spectrum sensors by reporting
    their measured decisions to the FC (Application Server), which makes the final
    decision. Note that the channel to be sensed is different from the actual channel
    used by the AS and ENs to exchange the data through the GW. To reach this goal,
    the nodes are assumed to be equipped with a cognitive radio module allowing them
    to configure their frequency parameters to observe a certain channel as per the
    request of AS. In order to exploit the spatial diversity of the ENs, cooperative
    SS is used. These nodes, or some of them, must cooperatively report their decisions
    on a given channel to the AS via the GW and the NS. In turn, AS considers the
    decisions of the ENs to reach a final decision on that channel. In our scenario,
    the CR-IoT networks may sense a set of channels. The sensing operation of each
    channel is the task of ENs, where each of them evaluates a Test Statistic (TS).
    The th EN (denoted by EN), should discriminate between two hypotheses : PU is
    idle and : PU is active: (1) (2) where and are respectively the received signal,
    the received PU signal including the channel effect, and the noise observed at
    the th EN at the channel . In this paper, the widely used non-coherent Energy
    Detector (ED) is adopted [25]. ED consists in evaluating the TS on the received
    signal at the channel and compare it to a predefined threshold to make a binary
    decision: 1 if PU is detected as active, and 0 if PU is diagnosed absent. (3)
    where is the number of received samples at the th EN used to evaluate . The ENs
    should inform the AS of their decisions. Thus, the decision of EN should be reported
    using a control channel to the AS in order to make a final decision [22], [26].
    In our work, the ”” logic rule, i.e. the minimum risk strategy, is applied on
    the received decisions of the ENs. The overall probability of detection and false
    alarm can be evaluated as follows [22]: (4) (5) where and are the probability
    of detection and the probability of false alarm at th EN respectively. Assuming
    that the received signal samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.),
    thus and are presented as follows [27]: (6) (7) where 1 is the Gaussian function,
    and and are the variance of and the observed SNR at the the EN respectively. As
    it can be shown from previous equations, and control the SS performance. However,
    for target and and become functions of . More increases more the required and
    decrease. In turn, high leads to a high consumption of the battery of the EN,
    and usually decreases with . The optimal solution that takes both the SS performance
    and the power consumption into consideration is to fulfil the target and with
    low and . Thus, the FC should be able to select the best ENs to perform the SS
    taking into consideration the battery level of these ENs and their SNRs. 3. Proposed
    ENs selection strategy In order to optimize the consumption of the energy related
    to SS among the network’s ENs, we propose to evaluate an Eligibility Score (ES)
    of each EN, which takes into consideration the needed to fulfil the SS requirements
    at the EN and its battery level . In fact, in the classical cooperative SS, all
    the ENs can participate in sensing a channel in order to maximize the sensing
    reliability. Even though such a strategy presents high performance with a relative
    low consumed power by SS operations, it may exhaust the ENs with low [22], [29].
    The same problem may be encountered when only ENs with the highest SNR performs
    the SS [30]. In this scenario, an efficient sensing performance is obtained, however,
    the energy level cannot be respected. Another strategy is to select the ENs with
    high to perform the SS. The weak point is to not respecting the SNR, which may
    lead to low accuracy or to fast consumption of the EN’s battery due to the need
    of high when performing SS at low SNR. Finally, a proposed strategy is based on
    randomly selecting the ENs participating in the SS [31], [32]. This strategy is
    adopted to avoid the selection of two correlated ENs. However, in IoT scenario,
    this procedure requires the cooperation between several GWs2 to specify the location
    of EN [33]. This may add additional computational complexity which is not always
    feasible. 3.1. Evaluating the eligibility score of a node Our proposed ESco aims
    at evaluating the eligibility of the EN to perform the SS based on and . At a
    good SNR, low is required to fulfil the detection requirements, and subsequently
    reduce the sensing power. In contrast, even with a low the EN may be unable to
    make SS due to a low . In other words, low is not sufficient to consider an EN
    as eligible. In contrast, even with a high the EN may highly consume its battery
    to fulfil the detection requirements when the SNR is low. Thus, solely neither
    are sufficient to select the eligible ENs. Motivated by the discussion above,
    we define the ES as follows: (8) is a positive-valued function since and and its
    unit is Joule/Sample. Such ES indicates how much the EN could spend energy for
    one sample. Thus, more the ES increases more the EN proves itself to be eligible.
    In addition, in the Eq. (8), and are represented by since the latter inversely
    changes with and for target and . The optimal choice derived from Eq. (8) corresponds
    to a high with a low . 3.2. Setting of sensing parameters The main goal of the
    CR network is to reach a high spectrum efficiency while protecting as possible
    the PU from the secondary interference. This goal can be reformulated as follows:
    (9) (10) where and are the target false alarm rate and detection probability in
    the CR-IoT network respectively. Assuming all the ENs involved in the SS have
    the same target and then by satisfying Eqs. (4) and (5) we obtain: (11) (12) Here,
    represents the number of ENs which have the highest ESs: (13) where is the th
    user selected to perform the SS, and is the total number of ENs in CR-IoT network.
    These ENs must meet and . To do so, the EN should take into consideration the
    number of samples to adopt. Using Eqs. (6) and (7), we can obtain: (14) where
    and . As per the equation above, and are inversely proportional. Low SNR necessitates
    high to converge to an accurate decision of SS. This requires additional power
    resources. Thus, ENs with low are dying faster than ENs with high SNR. However,
    this issue can be controlled by the ES: when the AS selects two ENs of the same
    ES to perform the SS, if the first EN is of higher than the another one, then
    it performs the SS with a higher . In this case, the second EN uses certainly
    lower and subsequently it does not require to spend a large amount of energy as
    such as the first one. Thus, the proposed ESco is dynamic and adaptable with respect
    to both needed number of samples and the available battery’s energy. 4. Application
    to LoRa network LoRa (Long Range) is a spread spectrum modulation technique derived
    from Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology. The Gateway (GW) coverage of LoRa
    network may achieve up to 20 Km in rural areas and 5 km in urban areas. The data
    rate of LoRa network may vary from 0.3 to 50 kbps depending on the Spreading Factor
    (SF), which varies between 7 and 12, and the adaptive data rate algorithm. The
    SF selection has a great impact on the lifetime of the EN and may depend on several
    factors such as the distance from the EN to the GW, the network capacity, the
    packet error ratio, etc. [34], [35]. On the other hand, LoRaWAN defines the communication
    protocol of the LoRa technology. LoRaWAN networks are defined in a star topology,
    where the GW receives the data from the EN inside the network and forwards it
    to the NS and AS. The communications between EN and GW are done using LoRa, while
    communications between GW and NS use Internet Protocol (IP)-based technologies
    such as 4G or WiFi. NS is considered as the manager of the LoRaWAN network, where
    it controls the selection of SF, the operating frequency, the network capacity,
    etc.. NS controls the network parameters while the Application Server (AS) is
    the only entity that could read the message content of the ENs. For that reason,
    AS could manage the proposed ESco strategy since the selection process is based
    on the data sent by the ENs. Thus, AS play the role of the FC of the ENs participating
    in the SS. 4.1. Protocol of data exchange between FC and ENs As previously mentioned,
    AS plays the FC role in our network. Therefore, the need for spectral resources
    should be identified at the AS, which sends a request to the ENs via the NS and
    the GW respectively. The communication between GW and ENs is assumed to be established
    on a reserved control channel. The AS, playing the role of FC, is assumed to be
    equipped with a database to save data on the ENs especially . Thus, the ENs, eligible
    to make the SS, should be ready once the AS sends a request following on-demand
    fashion of the data exchange. This insists a synchronization between the AS and
    the ENs. As per LoRa regulations the GW broadcasts a Beacon each 128 sec [36].
    Then, to respect this regulation, the ENs may report a decision on a channel every
    128 sec at least. For LoRaWAN case study, we can distinguish two main classes:
    Class-A and Class-B [37], [38]. In Class-A, no synchronization is made between
    GW and EN, thus, it becomes hard to adopt it in our scenario since the ENs should
    response once the AS requests. By contrast, in Class-B, the synchronization is
    ensured thanks to a Beacon sent by the GW to the ENs. This Beacon is considered
    as a timing reference to the ENs, which can be used by the AS to initiate SS operation.
    Then, the ENs can periodically open receive windows called ping slots to initiate
    an uplink operation from the EN. Following each uplink transmission, the EN opens
    two short reception windows, and to receive data from the NS (see Fig. 2). Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Time windows of LoRaWAN classes A and B: Class-B
    ensures a synchronization between FC and EN thanks to the Beacon. Upon the request
    of the AS, the ENs make SS and Reporting (SR) operations in T x 3. The ENs participating
    in the sensing operation send their decisions in addition to the updated l i and
    γ i . γ i lets the AS calculates N s , i as per Eq. (14), and subsequently evaluate
    F i ( l i , N s , i ) . Evaluating F i ( l i , N s , i ) at the AS reduces the
    computational complexity at the EN and ensures that EN meets the detection requirement,
    i.e., P d ¯ and P f a ¯ , since the SS requirements reflected by Eq. (14) could
    be changed from a primary channel to another according to the tolerable collision
    rate between PU and SU [39], [40]. Regarding the remaining ENs, which do not participate
    in SR, they remain silent but receive from the AS through the NS and the GW. In
    turn, after receiving the SS-related data in T x , AS makes the final decision
    on the PU channel and updates the database of the ENs based on the received data
    to select the most eligible N E to perform the SS in the next round. These N E
    ENs are selected based on their F i ( l i , N s , i ) . The SR operation is terminated
    by informing the N E ENs of the next SR operation by their task, and providing
    them with N s , i to be used in the next round within R x 1 time slot. Indeed,
    other parameters are sent by the NS to the EN according to the classical LoRaWAN
    protocol such as the SF and the operating frequency to be adopted in the next

    the LoRaWAN packet is composed from the PayLoad (PL) and other bytes related to
    the communication identification between the EN and the AS. It must report to
    the AS three parameters: the decision on the channel D i , the SNR γ i and the
    battery level l i . Subsequently PL length depends on the number of bits on which
    D i , l i and γ i measures are represented. Given that D i can be represented
    using one bit: 0 if PU is detected absent and 1 otherwise, the two other measures
    are not one-bit represented. We assume that the battery level and SNR are quantized
    on Q l and Q γ levels respectively as follows: (15) Q l = [ B 0 , B 1 , B 2 ,
    . . . , B Q M l − 1 ] (16) Q γ = [ 0 , ζ 1 , ζ 2 , . . . , ζ Q M g − 1 ] with:
    Q γ = 2 M l and Q γ = 2 M g , where M l and M g are the bits number reserved to
    represent the battery levels and the SNR respectively. B 0 represents a battery
    level very close to zero, while B Q l represents the full energy. ζ 1 represents
    the minimum SNR, i.e. any SNR lower than ζ 1 the SNR is considered null, and ζ
    Q M g − 1 is the maximum SNR, where it represents the saturation level. The following
    equation summarizes the the quantization process of γ i : (17) γ i → { 0 ; if
    γ i < ζ 1 ζ k ; if ζ 1 ≤ γ i ≤ ζ Q γ and ∥ γ i − ζ k ∥ 2 ≤ ∥ γ i − ζ p ∥ 2 , ∀
    k ≠ p ; k , p ∈ [ 1 , Q γ ] ζ Q γ ; if γ i > ζ Q M g − 1 Forcing SNR to be 0 as
    shown in the above equation makes the ES null, since N s , i → ∞ as γ i → 0 (see
    Eq. (14)). This will help the CR-IoT network to avoid selecting ENs with very
    low SNR and prevents the SNR-wall phenomenon [23], which may happen when performing
    SS at low SNR values. In addition, low values of SNR highly consumes the battery
    since a huge number of samples is required to meet the detection requirement.
    Regarding the maximal value ζ Q γ , this saturates the SNR value. In fact, at
    very high SNR, the EN could fulfil the detection requirement with a few number
    of samples. Thus, it positively impacts the amount of consumed energy by the SS
    operation. 5. Simulation results In our simulations, we use real parameters related
    to the SS, the transmit/receive, and the Micro-Controller Unit (MCU). For the
    SS operation, the parameters of RTL-SDR-based RadioHound are used [41]. It can
    scan from 25 MHz to 6 GHz, with a power less than 3 W. For transmit/receive and
    MCU operations, we use respectively the parameters of transceiver SX1272 and the
    Semtech STM32L073 MCU [42], [43]. According to the experimental results of [44],
    the energy is mainly consumed by the four following functions of the EN: (1) The
    Measurement (Sensing of the channel in our application), (2) the transmission,
    (3) the Micro-Controller Unit (MCU) running, and (4) the receiving. Even though
    in Sleep mode the EN consumes a very low power, but it becomes considerable due
    to the long time taken by this mode. Table 2 gives the electrical specifications
    of the system under the following parameters: Supply voltage = 3.3 V, Capacity
    = 1000 mAh, Operating Frequency = 868 MHz, Power of transmission = 10 dBm, and
    the bandwidth (BW) of LoRa communication = 125 KHz. Table 1. List of abbreviations

    A MCU Running STM32L073 1.8 mA Sleep mode SX1272 0.1 μ A Receive Mode In the receive
    mode, EN is active to hear from the AS two kinds of operations: (1) when receiving
    the Beacon from the GW considered as request to make the SS, the Beacon lasts
    for 16 ms [36]. And (2), when receiving data in R x 1 informing the EN whether
    it is selected to make the SS in the next round or not. The time of R x 1 depends
    on the SF used by the EN in the transmission. R x 2 is used by the NS to send
    some updates to the ENs, and it is disregarded in this work. Transmit Mode The
    duration of the transmission operation is related directly to the number of transmitted
    symbols N s y m b : (18) N s y m b = 8 + max [ H , 0 ] where H = ⌈ 28 + 8 P L
    + 16 C R C − 4 S F 4 ( S F − 2 D E ) ⌉ ( C R + 4 ) , where ⌈ X ⌉ rounds X to the
    nearest integer greater than or equal to X . P L represents number of bytes in
    the PL. CRC indicates the presence or not of the CRC field in the physical message
    (CRC is set to 0 if the CRC field is not present; otherwise, CRC is equal to 1).
    CR denotes the coding rate and can take values from 1 to 4, for 4/5 to 4/8 coding
    rate, respectively. Finally, D E = 1 when the low data rate optimization is enabled
    (for SF=12 and SF=11) and D E = 0 elsewhere. The transmission time T T x is evaluated
    using the duration T s y m b of the N s y m b symbols and the preamble message
    time T p r e (refer to [38], [44] for more information), where: (19) T s y m b
    = N s y m b × 2 S F B W (20) T p r e = ( N p r e + 4.5 ) × 2 S F B W (21) T T
    x = T s y m b + T p r e N p r e is the number of preamble symbols, and it is fixed
    in this study to 8. Spectrum Sensing Mode The energy consumed by SS depends on
    the number of samples needed for the energy detector before making the decision.
    We assume that the band to be monitored is 125 KHz BW, and the sampling frequency
    f s is twice the BW. Thus the sensing time T S S at the EN i becomes: (22) T S
    S = N s , i f s Even though the power of SS is relatively high compared to other
    modes, the time of SS is very short, which leads to a comparable consumed energy
    to other modes. Micro-Controller Unit Running Mode This mode is activated once
    the system wakes up and lasts till the end of the receiving mode. Sleep Mode After
    receiving the data from the NS and AS in R x 1 , the EN system goes to Sleep mode
    till the time of the next SS round. 5.1. Simulation scenarios ESco is compared
    to two other strategies: (1): N E ENs are randomly selected to make the SS, and
    (2) ENs with the N E maximal energy level make the SS. For the three strategies,
    the network is considered dead when the last number of ENs with l i > 0 is smaller
    than N E . The total number of nodes in the networks is fixed to N t = 500 throughout
    the upcoming simulation results. The ENs are assumed to be equipped with the same
    battery capacity, and l i is considered at 100 % of the full battery capacity
    at the beginning of the simulations. The battery lifetime is considered to evaluate
    the proposed mechanism. This lifetime is related to the initial energy of the
    battery as well as the adopted SF and the SNR at the node. High SF means that
    the transmission time becomes large, and subsequently the consumed energy increases
    compared to the scenario when low SF is used. On the other hand, low SNR leads
    to the need of a large number of samples to make an accurate SS, which increases
    the consumed energy of the SS as shown in Eq. (22). Regarding the parameters of
    SS, the target P d ¯ and P f a ¯ are fixed to 0.9 and 0.1 respectively. The SNR
    is assumed to be log-normal distributed among the ENs, with a mean γ m and a standard
    deviation σ g . 5.2. Investigation on the size of PL The precision of the quantization
    of SNR and the battery level is necessary to make a reliable decision at the AS.
    From one hand, the quantization error may adversely affect the ES, leading to
    wrong selection of the ENs. On the other hand, N s , i of ENs participating in
    the SR is calculated at the AS based on the quantized SNR for target P d ¯ and
    P f a ¯ . If the SNR’s quantization is badly done, the EN may not meet the detection
    requirements since N s , i becomes irrelevant to the real SS conditions of the
    EN. Given that D i is represented on one bit, we aim at investigating the number
    of bytes to be loaded by the PL in the transmitted packet. γ i is log-normal distributed
    with γ m = − 10 and σ m = 10 dB. The minimum SNR is set to − 20 dB. The maximal
    value of SNR is set to 5 dB, beyond this value the SNR is saturated as per the
    model of (17). The evaluation of the reliability of the quantization is based
    on the error ϵ : (23) ϵ = E [ | F ( l i , N s , i ) − F q ( l i , N s , i ) |
    ] E [ F ( l i , N s , i ) ] where F q ( l i , N s , i ) is the ES evaluated based
    on the quantized γ i and N s , i , and E [ · ] stands for the mathematical expectation.
    Fig. 6 presents the evolution of ϵ for several values of Q γ and Q l . As expected,
    ϵ decreases with the increase of M g and M l . For M l = 9 bits and M g ≥ 9 the
    error becomes lower than 1 % . At M l = 9 bits and M g = 12 , the error becomes
    close to 0.1 % . Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Variation of the
    error of quantization ϵ is terms of the number of bits used in Q γ and Q l . Throughout
    the rest of the paper M l = 9 and M g = 12 are fixed to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed strategy ESco. 5.3. Lifetime and sensing performance evaluation
    In this subsection, we analyse the performance of the CR-IoT from the sensing
    and the lifetime points of view. Due to the modifications on the LoRaWAN protocol,
    especially the need of all the ENs to be awake at the beginning of each transmission
    period, the energy efficiency may be changed. Fig. 7 shows the network lifetime
    for several values of γ m while comparing with the standard LoRaWAN, where not
    all the ENs wake up at the beginning of the period. σ g is fixed to 10 dB and
    the number of nodes participating in each SR operation is fixed to N E = 8 . The
    lifetime of the network increases with γ m for all the presented strategies since
    the number of samples to be treated decreases. Thus, the energy spent by the SS
    operation decreases. On the other hand, the proposed ESco outperforms both Random-based
    and Battery level-based strategies by achieving highest lifetime. The variation
    of γ m from -18 dB to -4 dB leads to increase the lifetime of ESco by more than
    three months and a half, and about three months for both Random-based and Battery
    level-based strategies. Compared to LoRaWAN, the lifetime of the ENs adopting
    ESco exhibits a decrease of 25 % , from 47 months at γ m = − 14 to around 33 months
    for the same SNR. This is due to the fact of the waking up of all the ENs at the
    beginning transmission period. This paid cost comes at providing the LoRaWAN with
    the ability to apply on-request data transmission which is not available for the
    actual LoRaWAN protocol, and, on the other hand, to make the LoRa network work
    cooperatively to select the ENs with the best ESs. Download : Download full-size

    = 0.1 ; P d = 0.9 ; N t = 500 . The chosen number of the participating ENs, N
    E , may play an essential role in the SR process since this parameter is related
    to the spatial diversity to be ensured by the cooperative SS. Fig. 8 shows the
    evolution of the network lifetime in terms of N E . The lifetime decreases as
    N E increases. However, for all the considered values of N E our proposed strategy
    reaches the longest lifetime compared to other considered strategies. Even though
    the sensing time decreases with N E , leading to reduce the consumed energy of
    SS, the lifetime is decreasing with N E because the participating ENs consumes
    a high transmission energy to report the sensing results to the AS. However, a
    sufficiently high number of the ENs is required in order to ensure the spatial
    diversity that overcomes the problem of the hidden PU problem [22]. Download :

    adopted SF on the lifetime of the network. SF varies form 7 to 12 according to
    the specifications of LoRaWAN. The lifetime decreases with the increase of SF
    for the three presented strategies. This refers to the fact that the transmission
    time increases with SF, which leads to increase the transmission energy. However,
    the proposed ESco outperforms the two other strategies for all the used SFs. Download

    lifetime of the network. N E = 8 is adopted. As N E increases the network lifetime
    increases. This is because the probability of an EN is selected to perform the
    SS decreases with N t for all the presented strategies. This leads to extend the
    lifetime of the sensor and subsequently the one of the network. Our proposed ESco
    preserves better the lifetime of the network compared to the two other strategies
    as show in Fig. 10. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. The impact of
    N t on the network lifetime when N E = 8 . One of the essential parameters to
    be set in any CR-based network is the time between two consecutive SS operations.
    This is related to the rate of a tolerable collision time between SU and PU, and
    this collision rate may differ from one primary channel to another. In the proposed
    protocol, AS should request a SS operation each T b c n using a Beacon, where
    the request rate may highly impact the lifetime of the ENs. Fig. 11 shows the
    evolution of the lifetime of the network for several of T b c n . As depicted,
    the lifetime is highly impacted by T b c n since at each SR operation the EN must
    spend energy for sensing, receiving and reporting. For ESco, which outperforms
    the two other strategies, achieves a lifetime of 34 months for T b c n = 128 sec,
    while this lifetime is reduced to 18 months when T b c n = 32 sec. The lifetime
    becomes almost the double when using T b c n = 128 instead of T b c n = 32 . Thus,
    increasing T b c n the lifetime of the network increases; however, this may increase
    the collision risque with the PU since the latter may return active between two
    consecutive Beacons. Further discussion on the collision is given in the next
    subsection. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. The impact of the length
    of Beacon period on the network lifetime with N E = 8 . 5.4. Throughput and collision
    analysis In this section, we analyse the impact of the length of T b c n on the
    throughput and the collision rate between the secondary transmission and PU. Secondary
    transmission is based on the decision made by the CR-IoT. Useful throughput R
    0 of the secondary transmission is done without any interference with PU, while
    the colliding throughput R 1 is considered when SU sends the data with an active
    PU on the same channel. R 0 happens when the CR-IoT makes a true decision on the
    absence of PU and the latter does not returns back during T b c n . R 1 takes
    place is two cases: (1) if the CR-IoT makes a miss-detection on PU presence, and
    (2) CR-IoT makes a true decision on the absence of PU when doing the SS, but PU
    returns back during T b c n . Given that the PU can change its state (active to
    idle or idle to active) once during T b c n , the probability of collision P c
    and collision-free P c f are given as follows [39], [45]: (24) P c = ( 1 − P d
    ) p 1 + ( 1 − P f a ) p 0 P r (25) P c f = ( 1 − P f a ) p 0 ( 1 − P r ) where
    p 0 and p 1 are the probabilities that PU is absent and active respectively when
    the SS is performed. P r is the probability that PU reappears during T b c n −
    T S S , and it is given by: (26) P r = 1 − e x p ( − T b c n − T S λ ) where λ
    is defined as the average idle duration of the PU. Subsequently, R 0 and R 1 are
    given is the following equations: (27) R 0 = C 0 P c f (28) R 1 = C 1 P c C 0
    and C 1 are the channel capacities related to R 0 and R 1 respectively: (29) C
    0 = W log 2 ( 1 + Z 0 ) (30) C 1 = W log 2 ( 1 + Z 1 ) where W is the transmission
    bandwidth (in our case W = 125 kHz), Z 0 and Z 1 are the SNR and the Signal to
    Noise and Interference Ratio (SNIR) of the secondary transmitted signal at the
    secondary receiver respectively. Fig. 12 presents the evolution of the collision
    probability, collision-free probability, and the throughputs of the secondary
    system. Z 0 = 5 dB and Z 1 = 3 dB are fixed. λ = 130 sec, p 0 = 0.3 and p 1 =
    0.7 are adopted. As shown in Fig. 12(a), P c increases with T b c n from 0.08
    at T b c n = 32 sec to greater than 0.18 at T b c n = 128 sec. This reflects the
    adverse impact of a long T b c n on the collision between the secondary and the
    primary transmissions. On the other hand, P c f decreases with T b c n . Thus,
    low T b c n reduces the secondary collision to the primary transmission while
    enhances the collision-free activity of the secondary system. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. The evolution of the collision and collision-free probability,
    and the useful and colliding throughputs in terms of T b c n Fig. 12(b) depicts
    the evolution of both the useful and the colliding throughputs of the secondary
    transmission. R 0 decreases with T b e a c o n while R 1 increases. In fact, a
    long T b c n may reduce the frequency efficiency of the secondary system, since
    it takes a long time to re-establish a SS after a decision of the presence of
    PU. During this time, PU may leave the channel, thus a lost in exploiting the
    available frequency resources happens. In turns, the long time may also increase
    the collision probability since PU may return active between two consecutive SS
    operation, when the secondary system is unaware of PU activity. Thus shortening
    this time leads to reduce the collision rate. 6. Conclusion In this paper, Eligibility
    Score-based (ESco) strategy is proposed to handle the sensing-reporting process
    in a battery-powered CR-IoT network providing Spectrum Sensing as a Service. LoRaWAN
    protocol is taken as case study to implement the proposed strategy. The SS operation
    performed in such network may largely consume the battery of the ENs. Thus the
    ENs involved in the SS should be carefully selected so that the lifetime of the
    CR-IoT network is extended as possible. The selection process is done based on
    an efficient Eligibility Score (ES) evaluated at each EN in the network. This
    ES takes into consideration both SS decision reliability and the battery level
    of the EN. In addition, we studied the data exchange between Network Server and
    EN of proposed ESco as per the LoRaWAN Class-B protocol, where we introduce needed
    modifications to make this protocol responsive to the on-demand model of the Spectrum
    Sensing as a Service. Numerical results depict the efficiency of the proposed
    strategy by respecting high protection of PU against the interference, high spectrum
    efficiency and long extended network lifetime. The compatibility of ESco with
    other IoT technologies such as Sigfox and NBIoT are to be explored and investigated
    in future work. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they

    \ rapid growth in wireless communications, coupled with insufﬁcient utilization\
    \ of the\nspectrum, led to the development of new wireless services and the promising\
    \ technology of cognitive\nradio (CR) networks, which facilitate periodic access\
    \ to the unoccupied spectrum bands and thus\nincreases spectral efﬁciency. A fundamental\
    \ task in CR networks is spectrum sensing, through which\nunauthorized secondary\
    \ users (SUs) detect unoccupied bands in the spectrum. To achieve this, an\naccurate\
    \ estimate of the power spectrum is necessary. From this perspective, and given\
    \ that many\nother factors can affect individual detection, such as pathloss and\
    \ receiver uncertainty, we aim to\nimprove its estimate by exploiting the spatial\
    \ diversity in the SUs’ observations. Spectrum sensing\nis treated as a parameters\
    \ estimation problem, assuming that the parameters’ vector of each SU\nconsists\
    \ of some global and partially common parameters. To exploit this modeling, distributed\n\
    and cooperative spectrum sensing is the subject of interest in this study. Diffusion\
    \ techniques, and\nespecially the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) method will be exploited,\
    \ where each SU cooperates\nwith a group of nodes in its neighborhood that share\
    \ the same parameters of interest. We consider\na network of three static PUs\
    \ with overlapping power spectrums, and thus, frequency bands. The\nperformance\
    \ of the employed method will be evaluated under two scenarios: (i) when the PUs\n\
    spectrum varies, since some frequency bands are not yet utilized, and (ii) when\
    \ the frequency bands\nof the PUs are ﬁxed, but there is a mobile SU in the network,\
    \ changing regions and parameters\nof interest. Experimental results and performance\
    \ analysis reveal the ATC algorithm robustness\nand efﬁciency.\nKeywords: cognitive\

    1. Introduction\nThe radio frequency spectrum is an inherently limited resource.\
    \ Many services pro-\nvided to users every day are based on the broadcast of radio\
    \ signals (radio, television,\ntelephony, broadband internet, defense applications\
    \ (e.g., radar), scientiﬁc uses such as\nmeteorology, positioning (GPS), etc.).\
    \ New technologies, such as the Internet of Things\nand Machine-to-Machine communication,\
    \ appear that rely on the use of wireless radio\nsystems (UMTS, Wi-Fi, WiMax,\
    \ Digital TV, 5G, and B5G). Additionally, the transition to\nmultimedia applications,\
    \ and in general, the rapid growth in wireless communications\nhave contributed\
    \ to a great demand for the development of new wireless services for both\nthe\
    \ authorized and unauthorized frequency spectrums [1].\nAt the same time, the\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum, because of greater and greater in-\ncreases in demand,\
    \ is in short supply. Most of it is occupied by already existing services\nand\
    \ applications. Therefore, to assign a part of the electromagnetic spectrum to\
    \ a new\nservice, an existing one should be replaced, cease its operation, and\
    \ thus free the requested\nspectrum band. However, the electromagnetic spectrum\
    \ will still be fully occupied. On the\nother hand, a signiﬁcant part of the already\
    \ allocated spectrum has limited or sporadic\nusage, thus leading to its underuse.\n\

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6692\n2 of 20\nAll of the above create the requirement for continuously\
    \ available spectrum frequen-\ncies without interference. Recent studies have\
    \ shown that the current ﬁxed spectrum\nassignment policy has imposed insufﬁcient\
    \ use of the spectrum. In recent years, dynamic\nspectrum management in 5G networks\
    \ is more necessary, due to the increasing demand for\nfree frequencies solving\
    \ the problem of spectral inadequacy [2]. To address this problem,\nCognitive\
    \ Radio Networks have been brought to the foreground as a promising technology\n\
    that facilitates periodic access to unoccupied frequency bands, contributing to\
    \ the increase\nin spectrum efﬁciency [3].\nAccording to the Federal Communications\
    \ Commission (FCC), cognitive radio is\na system that senses its operating electromagnetic\
    \ environment and can dynamically\nand autonomously adjust its radio operating\
    \ parameters to modify the operation of the\nsystem, such as to maximize the throughput,\
    \ mitigate interference, facilitate interoperability\nand access the secondary\
    \ networks. Hence, one main purpose of cognitive radio is the\nautonomous exploitation\
    \ of the locally unused part of the spectrum (spectrum holes) with\nthe aim of\
    \ providing new access paths to it [4].\nThe main functions of the cognitive radio\
    \ networks (spectrum sensing, management,\nmobility, sharing) are represented\
    \ in a cycle called the cognitive radio cycle [5]. Cognitive\nNetworks manage\
    \ the problem of congestion frequencies by introducing the occasional use\nof\
    \ frequency bands that are not occupied by authorized users and are known as spectrum\n\
    holes. The CR network users can share the spectrum with primary users. Primary\
    \ users\nhave higher priority or authorization in the use of an available piece\
    \ of the spectrum, and\nuse the service to which the speciﬁc bandwidth is assigned,\
    \ thus maximizing the degree of\nspectrum utilization [6]. Secondary users of\
    \ the cognitive network have a lower priority\nand exploit the available spectrum\
    \ in such a way that they do not create interference with\nprimary users. The\
    \ fundamental work of each of the SUs is to detect and identify the\npresence\
    \ or absence of authorized users, known as primary users. It is usually achieved\n\
    by sensing the RF environment through a process called spectrum sensing. The way\
    \ of\nmeasuring and exploiting the spectral space is called spectrum coverage,\
    \ which is stated\nas being a frequency band that is not used by its PU, at a\
    \ speciﬁc time, in a speciﬁc\ngeographic area [7]. CR networks, along with device-to-device\
    \ communication, are two key\ntechnologies for efﬁcient spectrum sharing, especially\
    \ in next-generation networks [8,9].\nIn the current study, we will be concerned\
    \ with cooperative sensing, and especially\ndistributed learning and distributed\
    \ estimation methods about intelligent wireless sensor\nnetworks similar to [10].\
    \ Speciﬁcally, our aim is to estimate the total spectrum of three PUs\nwith overlapping\
    \ frequency bands. Capitalizing on the relevant literature, the problem has\n\
    been previously studied for either independent [11] or overlapping spectrums among\
    \ two\nPUs [12]. Additionally, the main contribution of the presented analysis\
    \ is the evaluation\nof the ATC diffusion-based method in more challenging and\
    \ practical scenarios, where\nsome frequency bands stop being utilized by some\
    \ PUs, or where there is a mobile SU\nnode in the network. The experimental results\
    \ verify the efﬁciency of the method in such\nchallenging conditions.\nThe rest\
    \ of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the relevant spectrum\n\
    sensing works with the subject under consideration. Furthermore, in Section 3,\
    \ an analysis\nof the system model and the adopted methodology followed are made.\
    \ In addition,\nin Section 4, we discuss the acquired research results. Finally,\
    \ conclusions and future\ndirections are outlined in Section 5.\nThe following\

    2. Spectrum Sensing Methods\nIn this section, we will present the most common\
    \ spectrum detection techniques where\neach user individually decides if some\
    \ frequency band in the spectrum is available for\nuse. In particular, we will\
    \ focus on the most popular in wireless communications, such as\nEnergy Detector\
    \ (ED), Cyclo-stationary Feature Detection (CFD), Compressive Detection\n(CD),\
    \ and Matched Filter and Waveform-based technique [13,14]. Furthermore, we will\n\
    present recent works on spectrum sensing exploiting the capabilities of machine/deep\n\
    learning. Additionally, the section concludes with cooperative approaches.\n2.1.\
    \ Traditional Methods\nAn energy detector is a non-coherent method that identiﬁes\
    \ the primary signal based\non the detected energy. It is the most common method\
    \ due to its low computational\nand implementation complexity. Because of its\
    \ simplicity and non-requirements for prior\nknowledge of the primary signals,\
    \ the energy detector is the most popular technique in\ncooperatives spectrum\
    \ sensing. The signal is detected by comparing the output of the\ndetector to\
    \ a threshold, which depends on the noise level [15]. However, the detection\n\
    time to achieve a speciﬁc detection probability may be high. In addition to, the\
    \ detection\nperformance is subject to noise power uncertainty. An energy detector\
    \ cannot be used to\ndistinguish between the primary and CR signals. As a result,\
    \ CR users need to be strongly\nsynchronized and not transmit to the quiet period\
    \ [6,16].\nCyclo-stationary Feature Detection (CFD) exploits the periodicity of\
    \ the received\nPU signal to identify its presence. It is a detection method that\
    \ takes advantage of the\ncyclo-stationary characteristics of the received signal,\
    \ which is usually integrated into\n(i) sinusoidal carrier frequencies, (ii) pulse\
    \ sequences, (iii) signal periodicity, or (iv) its\nstatistical properties, such\
    \ as mean value and autocorrelation [17]. Thus, CFD can dis-\ntinguish between\
    \ a telecommunication signal and the noise due to robustness at noise\nuncertainty,\
    \ and performs better than the energy detector at low SNR. Although this re-\n\
    quires prior knowledge of the signal characteristics, CFD can distinguish CR transmissions\n\
    from various PU signals. It eliminates the requirement to synchronize the energy\
    \ detector\nin cooperative detection. A weakness of this method is the high computational\
    \ cost and\nlong detection time. Because of these issues, it is less common than\
    \ energy detectors in\ncooperative detection.\nIn the case of spectrum underutilization,\
    \ compressive sensing techniques for cognitive\nradio networks can be used to\
    \ approximate and recover the detected spectrum, which\nfacilitates the detection\
    \ of sparse primary signals in the wideband spectrum [18]. Hence,\nthe compressive\
    \ detection techniques provide promising solutions for the fast recovery of\n\
    wideband signals and facilitate wideband detection with acceptable computational\
    \ com-\nplexity. In wideband cooperative compressive detection, SU nodes individually\
    \ perform\ncompressive detection and cooperatively estimate the wideband spectrum\
    \ by exchang-\ning spectrum estimates, and iteratively reach a collective decision\
    \ by exchanging local\ndecisions [19].\nMatched Filter [20] is the optimal method\
    \ of detecting PUs signals when the transmit-\nted signal is known. The main advantage\
    \ is the short required time for achieving a certain\nprobability compared to\
    \ other methods that are discussed. The required number of samples\nincreases\
    \ with O(1/SNR) for a given false alarm probability Pf a to low SNR. However,\
    \ this\nrequires the SU to modulate the received signals. Therefore, this requires\
    \ perfect knowledge\nof the signal characteristics of PUs, such as bandwidth,\
    \ operating frequency, modulation\ntype, pulse shape, and format framework [21].\n\
    Waveform-based is usually used in wireless systems with known standards to help\n\
    synchronization, or for other purposes. Such standards include preambles, midambles,\n\
    spread-out sequences, etc. The preamble is a sequence transmitted before each\
    \ burst.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6692\n4 of 20\nThe midamble is transmitted in the\
    \ middle of a burst or a time slot. It uses the same model\nas the energy detector.\
    \ In the presence of a known pattern, detection can be performed\nby correlating\
    \ the received signal with a known copy of it. This method only applies to\nsystems\
    \ with known signal patterns and is called coherent detection. This method is\
    \ more\nreliable, has a better time convergence, and the performance of the algorithm\
    \ increases\nwith the length of the standard signal [21].\n2.2. Recent Methods\
    \ and Motivation\nApart from traditional spectrum sensing methods, researchers\
    \ have turned to ma-\nchine/deep learning [22], and Reinforcement and Federated\
    \ Learning for efﬁcient spectrum\nsensing. A reliable machine learning-based spectrum\
    \ sensing in CR networks is presented\nin [23]. Wang et al. surveyed dynamic spectrum\
    \ allocation based on reinforcement learning\nalgorithms in cognitive radio networks\
    \ [24]. Additionally, in [25], it is suggested that a\nmachine-learning-based\
    \ opportunistic spectrum access approach exploits multi-armed\nbandit (a powerful\
    \ reinforcement learning tool) and matching theory. In [26], machine\nlearning\
    \ techniques (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest\n\
    neighbors (KNN)) are used to detect a PU in Mobile CR networks.\nClassical local\
    \ techniques can also be part of a cooperative framework for spectrum\nsensing,\
    \ which is usually employed to increase the detection reliability in either a\
    \ cen-\ntralized (e.g., Fusion Center), decentralized, or relay-assisted manner\
    \ [27–29]. In [30,31],\ncooperative spectrum sensing methods are suggested based\
    \ on an energy detector. Alter-\nnative methods perform spectrum sensing in CR\
    \ networks based on adaptive LMS-based\ndistributed cooperative methods [12,32,33].\
    \ Recently, in [34], spectrum sensing is solved\nvia federated learning, which\
    \ is exploited for data distribution and model training over\nmany devices. The\
    \ proposed method creates a common deep learning model for each user\ngroup in\
    \ the iterative process.\nIn the era of 5G networks, a high trend toward distributed\
    \ and cooperative schemes\nhas emerged for important operations in the physical\
    \ layer, with some remarkable examples\nbeing spectrum sensing [35], beamforming\
    \ [36], and channel estimation in the mmWave\nspectrum [37,38]. Due to the persistent\
    \ increase in smart devices, and the need for high\ndata rates with low latency,\
    \ 5G and beyond networks have become more important than\never. Essential technology\
    \ for its successful implementation is direct Device-to-Device\n(D2D) communication\
    \ (e.g., for extending capacity and enabling scalability) with Internet-\nof-Things\
    \ (IoT) being a characteristic short-range application that will highly beneﬁt\
    \ from\nthe capabilities of 5G networks. Focusing on spectrum sensing in a 5G\
    \ IoT network,\ngeographically distributed SUs can sense multiple channels owned\
    \ by PUs and decide via\ncooperation on available spectrum holes using learning\
    \ algorithms (i.e., centralized and\ndistributed).\nIn this study, distributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum sensing will concern us, since such\nschemes are adaptable\
    \ and more robust against changes in topology, especially in mobile\nand scalable\
    \ IoT systems [39]. Focusing on a mobile CR network with overlapping spec-\ntrum\
    \ PUs, a Bayesian machine learning approach for collaborative spectrum sensing\
    \ has\nbeen suggested in [40]. In a more recent study [41], the authors, considering\
    \ clusters of\nunmanned aerial vehicles, elaborated a diffusion-based distributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum\nsensing approach with adaptive weights, assuming a binary\
    \ state model to describe channel\noccupancy.\nIn the same direction, this study\
    \ focuses on the problem of multi-task [42] parameter\nestimation, assuming varying\
    \ spectrum sensing and adopting a distributed diffusion-based\napproach from a\
    \ well-established family of techniques, which are preferable in wireless\nsensor\
    \ networks due to lower communication overhead and more improved performance,\n\
    compared with the centralized and non-cooperative strategies. In particular, we\
    \ exploit\nthe distributed diffusion method ATC to cooperatively estimate the\
    \ aggregated spectrum,\nassuming a more complex scenario of three PUs with overlapping\
    \ spectrums. Hence,\nmultiple clusters of users are derived, each of which relates\
    \ to a common interest frequency\nSensors 2022, 22, 6692\n5 of 20\nband. According\
    \ to [11], a multi-task CR network is formulated. Initially, we evaluate the\n\
    efﬁciency of ATC, assuming that the spectrum of PUs is varying (i.e., we cease\
    \ the use of\nsome frequency bands) and that secondary users are static. Finally,\
    \ an interesting aspect of\nthis work constitutes the performance evaluation of\
    \ the same method in the case where\none SU node is mobile.\n3. Materials and\
    \ Methods\nIn this section, we will present a description of the system model\
    \ that approximates\nthe total power spectrum in a speciﬁc SU node, the main aspects\
    \ of the adopted solution\nmethod, and the deﬁnition of the necessary structures\
    \ for the selected case study.\n3.1. System Model\nWe consider Q PUs and K SUs.\
    \ The power spectrum emitted by each PU can be\ncaptured as a linear combination\
    \ of some basis functions. Here, we choose Gaussian basis\nfunctions. Each SU,\
    \ through spectrum sensing, essentially detects the total spectrum from\nall of\
    \ the PUs of the area. The power spectrum from PU q is written as [43,44]\nSq\
    \ =\nB\n∑\nm=1\nbqm fm(ejω)\n= f ωwq, q = 1, 2, . . . , Q\n(1)\nwhere fm(ejω)\
    \ = e\n− (ω−ωm)2\n2σ2m\nand parameters ωm, σm are the central frequency and stan-\n\
    dard deviation (these parameters are part of the system design and thus a priori\
    \ known),\nf ω =\nh\nf1(ejω), f2(ejω), f3(ejω), . . . , fB(ejω)\ni\nis a vector\
    \ with the basis functions, scalars\n{bqm} denote the coefﬁcients of the basis\
    \ expansion for user q, and wq = [bq1, bq2, . . . , bqB]T\nis the vector with\
    \ the factors involved in the linear combination of the basis functions. The\n\
    representation in (1) can well approximate an essential part of the power spectrum\
    \ if B is\nsufﬁciently large.\nThe power spectrum that a SU k detects by PU q\
    \ is subjected to attenuation due to\nthe propagation path loss denoted as pqk.\
    \ Path loss coefﬁcients are known and deﬁned\nin advance in a training stage between\
    \ PUs with each SU. Training is usually repeated\nat regular intervals because\
    \ the coefﬁcients may change (slowly) in time due to node\nmovement. When the\
    \ transmitted spectrum travels from the PU to the SU, then the power\nspectrum\
    \ that is measured by the receiver of the SU k is pqkSq(ejω).\nHence, the total\
    \ power spectrum from all PUs at SU k is written as\nSt\nk =\nQ\n∑\nq=1\npqkSq(ejω)\
    \ + σ2\nk\n=\nQ\n∑\nq=1\npqk f ωwq + σ2\nk\n= uk,ωwo\nk + σ2\nk\n(2)\nwhere wo\n\
    k =\nh\nwT\n1 , wT\n2 . . . wT\nQ\niT\n(Q · B × 1) and uk,ω = pkq ⊗ f ω (1 × Q\
    \ · B) and σ2\nk the\nreceiver noise. Notice that wT\nq stands for the {bqm}s\
    \ involved in the power spectrum\ncomposition of PU q; thus, wo\nk concatenates\
    \ the {bqm}s of all PUs Q.\nAt each time instant i, the SU k observes the received\
    \ power spectrum in a discrete\nfrequency grid {ωr}, in the interval [0, π] under\
    \ the measurement and/or model noise vk,r\nwith zero mean and covariance matrix\

    \ matrix has L rows. As a result, in (6), a linear model is obtained for\nestimating\
    \ the parameters of interest in wo\nk. All of the considered processing steps\
    \ are also\nillustrated in Figure 1.\nThe path loss factor is approximated according\
    \ to the formula\npqk,i =\n\x10dqk,i\nd0\n\x11−n\n(7)\nwhere dqk,i is the Euclidean\
    \ distance of SU k to PU q at i, d0 is the reference distance which\nis d0 = 1,\

    Combine (ATC). The aforementioned strategy well approximates the centralized solution\n\
    when all nodes want to estimate the same vector of parameters [12].\nEach vector\
    \ {wo\nk}K\nk=1 might consist of parameters of global interest to the whole net-\n\
    work, parameters of common interest to subsets of nodes including node k, and\
    \ parameters\nof local interest for node k. In particular, subsets of parameters\
    \ in wo\nk may account for:\n•\nOne global parameter vector related to the frequency\
    \ band in the power spectrum of\nall PUs, which affects all SUs in the network.\n\
    •\nJ common parameter vectors associated with frequency bands in the power spectrum\n\
    of PUs that affect speciﬁc subgroups of nodes with partially or fully overlapped\n\

    \ local interest.\nIn this way, considering a scenario where there are J different\
    \ subsets of common\nparameters, the observation model provided in (6) can be\
    \ reformulated as\ndk,i = Ukg,iwo\ng + ∑\nj∈Ik\nUkcj,iςo\nk,j + vk,i,\n(9)\nwhere\

    \ of the diffusion-based ATC LMS algorithm with the\nprevious combiners is satisﬁed\
    \ for any initial condition, and any choice of the combiners,\nif step size µ\

    3.3. Case Study: Cognitive Radio Network with Three PUs of Overlapping Frequency\

    \ the results of the ATC algorithm performance evalua-\ntion, which is used to\
    \ estimate the Q · B = Mk = Mg + ∑j∈Ik Mcj parameters that ap-\nproximate the\
    \ total power spectrum emitted by the three PUs. Here, we assume that\nM1 = M2\
    \ = . . . = MK = M. The problem is translated into a multiple interests (global\
    \ and\ncommon) parameter estimation problem.\nThe performance of the adopted method\
    \ was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations\nwith 50 independent runs [45].\
    \ We simulated a network consisting of Q = 3 PUs and\nK = 11 SUs, as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3. Additionally, we have considered B = 16 Gaussian\nbasis functions\
    \ of amplitude normalized to one and standard deviation σm = 0.05. These\nfunctions\
    \ are involved in (2), and especially, in the creation of Uk,i in the linear model\
    \ of (6).\nFurthermore, each SU scans L = 50 channels over the normalized frequency\
    \ axis between 0\nand 1. The noise vk,i in (6) or (9) is zero-mean Gaussian with\
    \ a standard deviation varying\nbetween 0.04 and 0.16 for different k. Similarly,\
    \ the additive noise nk in path loss estimation\nis generated with σp ∈ [0.03,\
    \ 1.25]. In Figure 5, we illustrate the noise power of each SU\nnode. The step-size\
    \ µk of the LMS adaptation at each node is equal to 0.02 ∀k. Additionally,\nwe\
    \ selected Mg = 10, Mc1 = 3, Mc2 = 5, Mc3 = 6, Mc4 = 7, Mc5 = 8, Mc6 = 9.\n1\n\

    \ spectrum is utilized to capture the case where the PUs ceases to\nuse some of\
    \ the frequent zones a, b, c, d, e, z, h. In this case, we aim to examine the\
    \ behavior\nof the ATC algorithm by monitoring if the parameters’ estimation error\
    \ has the desired\nbehavior. SUs are not aware of these changes, but through the\
    \ measurements {dk,i, Uk,i}\nand the estimation error of the involved parameters\
    \ that approximate the total power\nspectrum, they learn of the changes that occur\
    \ in the broadcasting spectrum of the PUs.\nTo evaluate the above conditions,\
    \ we run the algorithm so that in different time intervals,\nthe use of a particular\
    \ frequency band is cancelled. The cancellation is achieved by setting\nzero values\
    \ to the corresponding optimal parameters in the augmented vector wk which is\n\
    used internally in the algorithm for estimating the MSD. Speciﬁcally, we selected\
    \ to cancel,\nin speciﬁc time intervals, the use of the following parameter vectors:\n\
    •\n15–20: Mg parameters of wg,\n•\n60–70: Mc1 parameters of ς1,\n•\n110–120: Mc2\
    \ parameters of ς2.\nIn Figure 6, we present the average performance of MSD error\
    \ for the aforementioned\ninterest vectors. As it is shown, the ATC method identiﬁes\
    \ this change in the sensing\nenvironment, which is captured in the MSD error\
    \ of these parameter vectors. For com-\nparison, we also plot the performance\
    \ of the non-cooperative LMS algorithm, setting the\nadjacent matrix as A = IK.\
    \ The results verify the importance of cooperation in relation\nto individual\
    \ estimation. Moreover, comparing the two methods for the estimation of the\n\
    combination weights, the superiority of adaptive ﬁltering is veriﬁed. The nodes\
    \ working\ntogether to achieve spectrum estimation do not know in advance which\
    \ neighboring nodes\nare affected by which model and which model affects their\
    \ own data. A node with different\ninterests may feed its neighbors with irrelevant\
    \ data, that is, with incorrect estimates that\nalter their own. The nodes gradually\
    \ adjust the weight they give to the estimates of that\nneighbor, which tends\
    \ to zero, so the effect of its estimate becomes negligible. That is,\nthe network\
    \ is divided into clusters-groups according to the interests of the nodes. As\
    \ we\nsee, the collaboration between members of a group with the same interest\
    \ leads to a better\nestimation of the parameters of interest. The weights’ values\
    \ are a measure of trust that a\nnode gives to its neighboring node.\nFocusing\
    \ on the convergence of the ATC, we observe that in the case of the global\nparameters\
    \ vector, the algorithm starts to approach the steady state at iteration i = 1000.\n\
    However, much more iterations are needed in the case of the two common interest\
    \ parameter\nvectors for the MSD to attain a steady state. Additionally, an essential\
    \ performance difference\noccurs from the average individual estimate of all nodes.\
    \ Observing the MSD of the two\ncommon interest parameter vectors, it is lower\
    \ than the MSD of the global parameters.\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n\

    \ the performance of ATC, assuming\nthat there is one mobile SU node in the network.\
    \ A moving SU changes position (x, y).\nHowever, this change may not necessarily\
    \ vary the frequency bands of interest and the\nneighbors. If changes occur, this\
    \ implies that the corresponding structures of the ATC\nalgorithm should be updated.\
    \ These structures relate to the path loss coefﬁcients between\nthe mobile SU\
    \ and the three PUs because it is location-dependent, the adjacency matrix\nA\
    \ and the interests’ matrix C. To check the area in which the moving node is located,\n\
    we measure the node’s Euclidean distances from the three PUs and compare them\
    \ with\nthe corresponding transmission range of the PUs. Let’s assume that the\
    \ distances are\nd1, d2, and d3, respectively, and the transmission ranges are\
    \ R1, R2, and R3. For the speciﬁc\nexperiment, we considered R1 = 150, R2 = 165,\
    \ and R3 = 170. Based on Figure 3, we\nformulated the rules presented in Table\
    \ 2, which helps us to update the interests’ matrix C\nand the structures that\
    \ depend on it. Moreover, in Table 3, we assume the characteristic\npoints of\
    \ the SU1 trajectory and the corresponding frequency zones of interest derived\
    \ from\nTable 2 under the selected values for the parameters R1, R2, R3.\nTable\

    \ d3 < R3\ne\nd1 > R1 & d2 > R2 & d3 < R3\nz\nd1 > R1 & d2 < R2 & d3 > R3\nh\n\
    Now, let us focus on Figure 7, which captures the MSD curves of those parameter\n\
    vectors that correspond to the frequency zones (i.e., e, z, h) that started to\
    \ be in the interests of\nthe SU1 node and that relate to the common interest\
    \ vectors ς4, ς5, ς6. Focusing on ς4, ς5, ς6\nand the convergence of the ATC,\
    \ we see that in the case of ς5, ς6 the algorithm approaches\nthe steady state\
    \ earlier, at iteration i = 500. However, more iterations are needed (at least\n\
    i = 1000) in the case of ς4 to attain the steady state. An essential performance\
    \ distance is\ncaptured between the adaptive and the uniform weighting methods,\
    \ where the adaptive\nweights win. Finally, we observe an abrupt fall in the MSD\
    \ in the time instants 19 and 59,\nas indicated in Table 3, which shows that the\
    \ algorithm identiﬁes the new parameters of\ninterest of SU1.\nSensors 2022, 22,\

    j=1.\nIn concluding the evaluation part of the adopted ATC method, we see that\
    \ the al-\ngorithm is able to identify the changes in the interests of a SU, which\
    \ is reﬂected in the\nerror curves. In either case, its performance remains intact,\
    \ achieving low error values that\nattain zero.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion,\
    \ the estimation of the total power spectrum of three PUs was investigated\nvia\
    \ the ATC diffusion algorithm, which was tackled as a multi-task problem, having\n\
    promising results in each of the considered scenarios. We examined its efﬁciency\
    \ for two\ndifferent weighting rules for the coefﬁcients in the combination step\
    \ of the algorithm.\nIn the case of the relative variance rule combined with the\
    \ adaptive estimation ﬁlter, MSD\nachieved better performance than the uniform\
    \ one. This is due to the fact that the noise\nproﬁle of the nodes is derived\
    \ based on the instant estimates of the parameters vector, both\nof them and their\
    \ neighbors.\nAn open issue in the above scenarios could be the usage of more\
    \ overlapping primary\nusers, which would, however, eliminate the zone of global\
    \ interest, and nodes would only\nestimate various common interest parameters.\
    \ Additionally, a variation of the examined\nSensors 2022, 22, 6692\n19 of 20\n\
    scenarios could concern the movement of more than one node, since, in practical\
    \ scenarios,\nmore SUs may be mobile.\nAlternatively, we could determine the combination\
    \ weights, taking into account only\nthe variance of two communicating nodes and\
    \ not of the whole neighborhood, and evaluate\nits beneﬁts in the per node and\
    \ network MSD in the adaptive combination weights. Our\naim is to see the improvements\
    \ to MSD by experimenting with the parameters involved\nin the ATC method and\
    \ especially the step size µ, which is an important parameter that\nimpacts on\
    \ the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, it would be interesting to re-evaluate\n\
    the above parameter estimation problem, if we were using the Combine-Then-Adapt\
    \ or\nLMS-type incremental methods.\nAuthor Contributions: E.D. and M.T. conceived\

    Abstract: Mobile-health (m-health) is described as the application of medical
    sensors and mobile

    computing to the healthcare provision. While 5G networks can support a variety
    of m-health services,

    applications such as telesurgery, holographic communications, and augmented/virtual
    reality are

    already emphasizing their limitations. These limitations apply to both the Quality
    of Service (QoS)

    and the Quality of Experience (QoE). However, 6G mobile networks are predicted
    to proliferate over

    the next decade in order to solve these limitations, enabling high QoS and QoE.
    Currently, academia

    and industry are concentrating their efforts on the 6G network, which is expected
    to be the next major

    game-changer in the telecom industry and will signiﬁcantly impact all other related
    verticals. The

    exponential growth of m-health multimedia trafﬁc (e.g., audio, video, and images)
    creates additional

    challenges for service providers in delivering a suitable QoE to their customers.
    As QoS is insufﬁcient

    to represent the expectations of m-health end-users, the QoE of the services is
    critical. In recent

    years, QoE has attracted considerable attention and has established itself as
    a critical component of

    network service and operation evaluation. This article aims to provide the ﬁrst
    thorough survey

    on a promising research subject that exists at the intersection of two well-established
    domains, i.e.,

    QoE and m-health, and is driven by the continuing efforts to deﬁne 6G. This survey,
    in particular,

    creates a link between these two seemingly distinct domains by identifying and
    discussing the role of

    6G in m-health applications from a QoE viewpoint. We start by exploring the vital
    role of QoE in

    m-health multimedia transmission. Moreover, we examine how m-health and QoE have
    evolved over

    the cellular network’s generations and then shed light on several critical 6G
    technologies that are

    projected to enable future m-health services and improve QoE, including reconﬁgurable
    intelligent

    surfaces, extended radio communications, terahertz communications, enormous ultra-reliable
    and

    low-latency communications, and blockchain. In contrast to earlier survey papers
    on the subject, we

    present an in-depth assessment of the functions of 6G in a variety of anticipated
    m-health applications

    via QoE. Multiple 6G-enabled m-health multimedia applications are reviewed, and
    various use cases

    are illustrated to demonstrate how 6G-enabled m-health applications are transforming
    human life.

    Finally, we discuss some of the intriguing research challenges associated with
    burgeoning multimedia

    m-health applications.

    1. Introduction

    The healthcare industry has constantly adopted the latest technologies with the
    goal

    of improving the overall healthcare of the global population. The use of technology
    has sig-

    niﬁcantly changed the way in which healthcare is provided [1], and it has had
    far-reaching

    impacts on delivering healthcare facilities to the general population, including
    those living

    in remote locations and in underdeveloped countries [2]. The advancements in technology

    have enabled the diagnosis of complicated diseases, and currently, sophisticated
    medical

    treatments are carried out easily. For instance, advancements in medical imaging
    technol-

    ogy have led to an increased understanding of the internals of human physiology,
    and

    this technology has become an important tool for diagnosing patient diseases,
    and condi-

    tions [3]. One of the most important applied technologies in healthcare is communications

    technology. The use of network and communication technologies has, over the decades,

    providing numerous beneﬁts to healthcare. The earlier communication technologies,
    such

    as wired telephone lines, fax technology and networking technologies, supported
    quick

    and easy communication lines for the exchange of simple diagnostic information
    such as

    patient reports, treatment options, prescriptions, etc. The advent of wireless
    communication

    and the advancements in internet and satellite communication technologies have
    provided

    a signiﬁcant boost to the delivery of healthcare [4]. They are necessary to revitalize
    pri-

    mary healthcare since they contribute to the personalized monitoring of chronic
    diseases,

    increase access to healthcare for rural populations, and optimize data measurement
    and

    management. Patients must have to visit hospitals; it is generally a time-consuming
    and

    labor-intensive process that involves the participation of both the patient and
    healthcare

    workers. It often requires the management of several different healthcare aspects,
    making

    this process even more confusing and overwhelming. Hence, researchers turned towards

    smart healthcare using technologies such as wearable sensors enabled technologies,
    artiﬁ-

    cial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) [1,5–7]. Moreover, the
    authors in [8]

    conducted a comprehensive review of E-Health Practices and Technologies from 2014
    to

    2019. E-Health refers to a range of technologies that utilize the internet to
    enhance the

    provision of healthcare services and improve the overall quality of life. Given
    the scarcity

    of research on this subject, their study employs a systematic literature review
    of articles

    published between 2014 and 2019 to identify prevalent e-health practices across
    the globe,

    along with the primary services offered, diseases targeted, and supporting technologies

    employed in this ﬁeld.

    1.1. Objectives

    The objective of this survey paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis and
    un-

    derstanding of the impact of 6G networks on user quality of experience management,

    particularly in the context of healthcare applications. The paper aims to bridge
    the gap in

    existing research by examining the relationship between 6G networks, Quality of
    Experi-

    ence (QoE), and healthcare. The speciﬁc objectives of the paper are as follows:

    •

    To extend the previous study by exploring the broader aspects of 6G networks in
    the

    ﬁeld of smart health services and applications.

    •

    To investigate how 6G networks can transform healthcare lifestyles and enable
    intelli-

    gent healthcare communication.

    •

    To examine the advancements in cellular networks and technologies that contribute
    to

    the improvement of QoE in mobile health (m-health) multimedia applications.

    •

    To demonstrate multiple 6G-enabled m-health multimedia applications and their

    impact on human life.

    •

    To identify and discuss the research challenges associated with the development
    and

    deployment of multimedia m-health applications in the context of 6G networks.

    1.2. Contributions

    The literature on 6G networks presents numerous features, but there is a lack
    of re-

    search on managing user experience. It is believed that 6G will provide better
    and more

    personalized mobile experiences [9]. Advanced generations of networks demonstrated
    an

    evolution in terms of incorporating the user’s impression of the service. The
    consideration

    of network management was based on a QoS-based approach, where performance indica-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    3 of 43

    tors were produced in terms of latency, jitter, and call drop percentage, among
    other metrics.

    However, combining voice with multimedia led to an expansion of evaluation to
    include a

    QoE perspective. This transition was prompted by a twofold developing reality
    at the time:

    network enhancements cannot be carried out without ﬁrst analyzing the impact on
    user

    perception and without ﬁrst acknowledging that elements other than network performance

    can inﬂuence user experience. QoS is concerned with network performance, but QoE
    is

    concerned with the performance as perceived by the users. Nowadays, network operators

    are placing greater emphasis on End-to-End (E2E) service quality in order to provide
    the

    best possible user experience. As a result, while migrating to 6G networks, it
    is critical that

    the developments in architecture maintain these quality criteria.

    This research is an extension to our previous study in [10], which only looked
    at

    a few aspects related to 6G in smart health services and applications. In our
    previous

    study, we brieﬂy identiﬁed and discussed the role of 6G in smart health services
    and

    applications, the critical 6G technologies that are projected to enable future
    smart health

    services applications, and the multiple 6G-enabled smart health applications.
    Moreover,

    there was not much elaboration in terms of taxonomy classiﬁcation, diagrams, tabulations,

    discussion, recommendations and challenges, which could easily help researchers
    to build

    their future research in the ﬁeld. On the other hand, to further improve the impact
    of

    this study, we have expanded the work in [10] to an extent where we look at how
    6G

    could impact the future of healthcare lifestyles and demonstrate how 6G can be
    used for

    intelligent healthcare communications and speciﬁcally the QoE for m-health multimedia

    communications. We examine the advancements made in cellular networks to meet
    the

    demands of new m-health applications, such as high data rates, scalability, latency,
    and

    reliability. We shed light on several 6G technologies that are projected to enable
    future

    m-health services and improve QoE, including reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces,
    extended

    radio communications, terahertz communications, enormous ultra-reliable and low-latency

    communications, and blockchain. Moreover, we demonstrate multiple 6G-enabled m-health

    multimedia applications along with various use-cases to show how 6G-enabled m-health

    applications are transforming human life. Finally, we discuss some of the intriguing

    research challenges associated with burgeoning multimedia m-health applications.
    To our

    knowledge, there is no publication in the literature where three major players,
    6G, QoE,

    and healthcare, are discussed together. Table A1 provides a list of survey research
    papers

    and their primary focus; there are many surveys and tutorials that cover either
    one or

    two topics among 6G, QoE, and healthcare. Our survey is far broader, covering
    all three

    technologies.

    Figure 1 provides the organization and systematic framework of the survey and
    is

    explained as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical background of m-health
    and QoE.

    Section 3 provides the methodology adopted in conducting this research and also
    discusses

    the ﬁndings and limitations. Section 4 provides an overview of QoE and the evolution

    of cellular generations. Section 5 covers the 6G features and advanced technologies
    that

    will transform the healthcare industry and signiﬁcantly contribute to QoE enhancement

    of m-health multimedia applications. In Section 6, some 6G-enabled applications,
    such as

    holographic communication, haptic technology, AI, AR, and VR, have been investigated.

    Section 7 identiﬁes various roadblocks to deploying 6G networks for healthcare,
    and ﬁnally,

    Section 8 concludes the paper. A list of key abbreviations used throughout the
    article can

    2. Theoretical Background

    In this section, an overview of the different aspects used to facilitate the investigation

    of our research are provided. These aspects are Mobile-health (m-health), Multimedia

    Communications in m-health, Quality of Experience (QoE) of Multimedia Communications

    in m-health, and the Role of 6G towards Multimedia Communications.

    2.1. m-Health

    The rapid increase in mobile phone penetration across the globe has led to the
    advent

    of applications that deliver services in different areas, including healthcare.
    Several nations

    across the globe are adopting mobile-based technologies for healthcare. The World
    Health

    Organization (WHO), in their report on mobile-based technologies for healthcare,
    declared

    that over 80 percent of their member nations had made efforts towards the adoption
    and

    implementation of mobile technologies for health in their countries [11]. These
    technologies

    are popularly referred to as m-health technologies, where medical sensors and
    mobile

    computing for healthcare were the original deﬁnitions of mobile health (m-health)
    [12].

    m-health works on the concept of any-time, anywhere access, exploiting the best
    connection

    features of emerging wireless communications and network technologies in a heteroge-

    neous environment. Hence, it provides an alternative to the traditional healthcare
    delivery

    system and assists this system by bridging the gap between terrestrial boundaries
    and rural

    and urban areas. However, it is largely driven by successful business and market
    sectors. It

    still aims to reach the tipping point for clinical adoption and healthcare delivery
    efﬁciency.

    The three technology pillars of m-health, including telecommunications, computing,
    and

    medical sensing, drive this growing popularity. A massive number of smartphones
    and

    devices connected to a large number of mobile health applications are used worldwide
    by

    both patients and healthcare professionals. These services continuously generate
    structured

    and unstructured datasets, revealing new healthcare insights, but also creating
    some chal-

    lenges. Today’s m-health apps are increasingly coupled to wearable sensors and
    Internet

    of Things (IoT) devices [6]. These applications are becoming common in everyday
    health,

    wellness, and clinical applications, including chronic disease tracking and management,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    5 of 43

    remote patient data collection and monitoring, diagnostics and treatment, healthcare
    re-

    source management, patients’ education and awareness as well as healthcare professionals’

    training [13].

    2.2. Multimedia Communications in m-Health

    The different types of data transmitted via m-health applications could include
    text,

    image, and video data. In recent years, there has been a signiﬁcant increase in
    medical

    imaging/videos for diagnostic purposes. Medical imaging technology advancements
    have

    resulted in portable scanning machines that have made producing medical images
    and

    videos easier. Subsequently, medical images and videos are also becoming an important

    part of the data transmitted via m-health applications [14]. Many use cases directly
    touch

    our lives and are now more complete and intuitive using multimedia technologies.
    Systems

    and services have been developed to use the beneﬁts of multimedia technology,
    e.g., medical

    images and videos can be supplied to remote clinicians for consultation, and they
    can also

    be disseminated for educational and awareness purposes. As an added convenience
    in

    emergency situations, ambulances may be outﬁtted with portable scanners that capture

    and transmit diagnostic information to hospitals. Tele-consultation via video
    conferencing

    and remote patient monitoring sharing medical data can make individuals with chronic

    diseases see their doctors regularly and lessen the requirement for patient–physician
    visits.

    Gesture recognition and speech recognition are two technologies that are frequently
    used

    in conjunction with telemedicine in the smart medical home. Informing patients
    about

    diagnosis, surgery, and treatment is critical to their understanding of medical
    processes.

    Many patients are being educated using visual, audio, interactive, and internet
    content to

    supplement traditional paper-based information. As a result, medical video streaming
    is

    becoming an increasingly important component of m-health applications.

    Multimedia services are time-sensitive, where efﬁcient network systems are required

    to ensure service quality [15]. Due to the potential loss in quality in the video
    between the

    source and the destination, the quality of video transmission in m-health applications
    must

    be maintained at high levels so that the change in quality remains imperceptible.
    Further,

    medical videos carry sensitive data that determine patient diagnosis, and at times
    a loss

    in quality may impact the diagnostic understanding that can be gleaned from the
    medical

    videos. Thus, it is crucial that the quality of video transmission from source
    to destination

    is maintained at high levels in m-health applications.

    2.3. QoE of Multimedia Communications in m-Health

    To ensure that the quality of video transmission is maintained, a quality assessment

    needs to be carried out at the destination. Quality assessment is a process that
    employs

    methods to measure the quality of the video received at the destination compared
    to that of

    the video at the original source. There are two approaches to quality assessment;
    one is

    measuring the Quality of Service (QoS), and the other is Quality of Experience
    (QoE) [16]. In

    networking and communication applications, the QoS is a method of assessing the
    service

    quality that the network provides [17]. It is a network-centric measure that measures

    the quality of the data transmission provided by the communication network. The
    QoS

    measurement includes metrics that measure the key performance indicators (KPIs)
    of

    a communication system. These KPIs include metrics such as the percentage of data

    transmitted, the amount of data lost during transmission, channel throughput,
    speed of

    data transfer, system fairness, etc. On the other hand, QoE is a user-centric
    evaluation

    approach that reﬂects the degree of delight or annoyance of the user with the
    service

    used [18]. In the case of video transmission, the QoE of a user is the perception
    of the

    video quality by the end-user [19,20]. The QoE puts the focus of quality assessment
    on

    the user’s perspective and typically considers many factors surrounding the context
    of

    the application [21]. There are two broad categories of QoE evaluation: subjective
    and

    objective evaluations. Subjective evaluation methods are based on the Human Visual

    System (HVS), which largely depends on observation by human subjects. The subjective

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    6 of 43

    evaluation method uses an evaluation score known as the Mean Opinion Score (MOS),
    a

    mean score of the users’ opinions about their perception of the video’s quality.
    On the other

    hand, objective evaluation methods use mathematical models that act as quality
    metrics to

    measure the audio or video received quality, such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio
    (PSNR),

    Mean Square Error (MSE), etc. A list of subjective and objective QoE assessment
    metrics

    are listed in Tables 1 and 2, where more details and explanations about all these
    metrics can

    be found in [22,23]. Given that QoS primarily focuses on the technical elements,
    whereas

    QoE is centered around customer service and satisfaction, it is plausible to include
    QoS as

    an inherent component within the deﬁnition of QoE.

    The QoS achieved in networks is now being increasingly associated with the QoE
    of

    the application. Recently, achieving high QoE has become an important part of
    multimedia

    communications [24]. The important features that affect the QoS and QoE in medical
    video

    streaming applications from the perspective of healthcare professionals include
    bandwidth,

    packet delay, jitter and packet loss tolerance, quality of the image, frame rate
    of the video

    received, real-time streaming when required, the direction of ﬂow (uplink/downlink),

    mobility, etc. [25]. Measuring QoE can be complex, as several factors need to
    be considered

    that inﬂuence the end user’s QoE. The authors in [26] term these factors as “Inﬂuence

    Factors” (IF) and deﬁne them as: “Any characteristic of a user, system, service,
    application,

    or context whose actual state or setting may have an inﬂuence on the Quality of
    Experience

    for the user”. The m-QoE is the concept of traditional QoE seen from the perspective
    of

    healthcare applications. It is deﬁned as the overall acceptability of m-health
    applications as

    perceived by end-users, where the end-users are the patients and healthcare profession-

    als [27]. The m-QoE perceived in m-health systems is generally inﬂuenced by the
    system,

    context, and human inﬂuence factors (IFs).

    2.4. The Role of 6G towards Multimedia Communications

    Smart healthcare must be able to monitor health, diagnose diseases, and treat
    patients

    remotely with services such as Hospital-to-Home (H2H) services, emergency services,

    ambulance services, Intelligent Wearable Devices (IWD), etc. These services send
    the

    patient data remotely over the internet and then analyze them at data centers.
    Healthcare

    networks must provide mobility, high capacity, low latency (1 ms), green communication

    for patient safety, and continuous connectivity availability with high reliability.
    For these

    requirements, the sixth generation of wireless communication (6G) is regarded
    as the ideal

    solution for hosting healthcare networks [28,29]. Figure 2 depicts the healthcare
    network

    architecture in 6G; this diagram depicts the network’s key deployment tiers, including

    intelligent sensing, intelligent access, and intelligent cloud. This 6G architecture
    will enable

    many processes, such as security, ﬂexibility, and intelligent resource management.
    This

    ﬁgure displays the slicing architecture of 6G networks, where different network
    slices

    enable different applications. The devices in the sensing layer gather data and
    deliver it

    to the next level. At this level, the nodes, users and devices connect to the
    radio access

    networks technologies such as massive MIMO, small cells, and advanced modulation

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    8 of 43

    techniques are implemented. Lastly, in the cloud layer, intelligent resource allocation,

    network management and optimization are performed. These different layers provide

    ﬂexibility to the system on different levels, and a wide range of applications
    beneﬁt from

    the network. This ﬁgure envisions such a scenario, demonstrating all layers and
    their key

    technologies.

    Figure 2. The 6G healthcare network layers.

    The development of 6G communication technologies addresses some of the issues

    discussed in previous subsections, particularly in connectivity, data rates, network
    compat-

    ibility, and guaranteeing high levels of QoS and QoE for m-health applications
    [30–32]. A

    high data rate of at least 1 Tbps, extremely reliable, further-enhanced mobile
    broadband

    (FeMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), long-distance and high
    mo-

    bility communications (LDHMC), ultra-massive machine-type communications (umMTC),

    and extremely low-power communications (ELPC) are all features of 6G technology.
    QoS

    also incorporates parameters such as mobile broad bandwidth and low latency (mBBLL),

    and massive low latency machine type (mLLMT), revolutionizing many applications.
    The

    6G technology must execute all desired characteristics to achieve good QoE. Thus,
    6G

    technology will be groundbreaking in many ﬁelds as providing high QoS and QoE
    will

    enable new applications such as telesurgery, holographic communications, augmented

    and virtual reality, ﬁve-sense communications, and tactile internet. QoE will
    also play a

    vital role in intelligent transportation services and autonomous vehicles such
    as intelligent

    cars, drones, and ambulances [33]. One of the key goals of QoE in 6G is to allow
    service

    providers to assess the performance of their services and how speciﬁc service
    components

    contribute to that performance. From this viewpoint, we envision the research
    on the

    QoE of m-health multimedia to determine how various factors contribute to the
    QoE of

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    9 of 43

    the m-health application. Because of their nature, m-health applications differ
    from other

    applications. It is vital to determine how quality elements such as data, network,
    analytics,

    and so on affect the various stages of an m-health service and hence the service
    quality.

    3. Methodology and Findings

    This section of the paper aims to present the methodology employed for this compre-

    hensive survey, and share the key ﬁndings obtained from the literature review.
    This section

    also discusses the limitations of the conducted literature review.

    3.1. Methodology

    The methodology of conducting this literature review can be divided into four
    steps,

    as shown in Figure 3, and described as follows.

    Figure 3. Research methodology.

    •

    Step 1 Research Paper Extraction: A comprehensive search was conducted using

    academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, MDPI, Springer, and other

    relevant sources. The search aimed to identify publications related to 6G networks,

    3.3. Limitations

    In conducting this review, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the
    research

    methodology employed. By understanding these limitations, readers can gain a better

    understanding of the scope and external validity of the conclusions drawn. The
    aim of this

    paper was to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on QoE in 6G networks,

    particularly in the context of m-health applications.

    •

    Non-systematic Approach: Although efforts were made to collect papers from various

    sources, including IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, MDPI, Springer, and others, the lack
    of a

    formal systematic methodology might have resulted in potential omissions of relevant

    studies. As a result, the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the reviewed

    literature may be inﬂuenced.

    •

    Selection Biases: The selection of papers was based on the relevance of their
    content to

    the research topic. While efforts were made to include a diverse range of perspectives,

    it is possible that some papers were unintentionally excluded, introducing a potential

    selection bias. Moreover, the availability and accessibility of certain papers
    might have

    inﬂuenced their inclusion, leading to a bias in the representation of the literature.

    By acknowledging these limitations, we aim to provide readers with a transparent

    understanding of the potential biases and constraints associated with this narrative
    review.

    It is essential to recognize that while the conclusions drawn from this review
    are supported

    by the available literature, further research using systematic approaches and
    objective

    evaluations is warranted to provide more conclusive and refutable ﬁndings.

    4. Overview: Quality of Experience and Cellular Generations

    This section provides an overview of the relationship between Quality of Experience

    (QoE) and cellular generations in m-health applications. It addresses the limitations
    of 5G,

    the evolutionary progress of m-health wireless systems and quality of experience,
    and the

    correlation between QoS and QoE.

    4.1. 5G Limitation for m-Health

    Mobile technologies ranging from the ﬁrst generation (1G) to the ﬁfth generation
    (5G)

    have already been developed and deployed as an enabler for supporting a diverse
    range of

    networks and applications, including IoT. Notably, due to inherent usage characteristics

    such as eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC services, the 5G technology has been demonstrated

    to provide different service opportunities to IoT ecosystems with high throughput,
    low

    latency, and energy-efﬁcient service provision [34]. However, 5G will be unable
    to fully ad-

    dress escalating technical demands such as autonomous, ultra-large-scale, highly
    dynamic,

    and fully intelligent services due to the unprecedented spread of smart devices
    and IoT

    networks. More importantly, as new IoT services and applications arise, such as
    remote

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    12 of 43

    robotic surgery and ﬂying vehicles, further advances in current 5G systems are
    required to

    improve the quality of IoT service delivery and business [35]. The 6G wireless
    networks

    and the technological innovations that have accompanied them have recently gotten
    much

    attention from academia and industry and are expected to pave the way for the
    growth of

    the IoT and beyond [36,37]. Due to its superior features over previous network
    generations,

    such as ultra-low-latency communications, extremely high throughput, satellite-based

    services, massive and autonomous networks [38–40], 6G is expected to provide an
    entirely

    new level of service quality and improve the user’s experience in current IoT
    systems. In

    addition to enabling unprecedented capacity levels, 6G-based IoT networks will
    speed the

    development and implementation of IoT applications throughout the spectrum of
    data

    sensing, device connectivity, and wireless communication, among other areas. Figure
    5

    shows the evolution of cellular generations from 1G to 6G with their distinguishing
    fea-

    tures. This ﬁgure provides a synopsis of the evolution. It can be seen here how
    the last

    decade has brought a revolution in wireless communication by bringing applications
    such

    as multimedia, real-time communications, and high-deﬁnition video streaming. In
    the

    ﬁgure, we can see this evolution has resulted in various advanced services.

    Figure 5. Evolution of cellular communications: from 1G to 6G.

    Although the 5G network has signiﬁcantly improved the QoS over previous genera-

    tions, it would still be difﬁcult to fully meet the requirements of future m-health
    services [41],

    which are still in their infancy. The key performance indicators include parameters
    such as

    data rates, latency, network efﬁciency, coverage extension, reliability, spectrum
    efﬁciency,

    mobility and many more. The capabilities of 6G communication network as compared
    to its

    predecessor are shown in Figure 6, where the red indicates 5G and the blue as
    6G. The 5G

    networks will be unable to handle the massive amount of mobile trafﬁc generated
    by multi-

    media m-health applications due to higher screen resolution, machine-to-machine
    (M2M)

    communications, and mobile edge services. Because of the expansion of smartphones
    and

    tablets and the proliferation of mobile data services, the demand for mobile broadband

    (MBB) is increasing at a rapid pace. The services provided by 5G are insufﬁcient
    to meet

    the evolving needs of healthcare technology and emergency situations. In this
    regard, 6G is

    envisioned to bring new disruptive wireless technologies and sophisticated networking

    infrastructures that would enable the realization of many new m-health applications
    by

    holistically addressing such rigorous network demands compared to 5G [42]. With
    the

    emergence of advanced technologies (e.g., edge intelligence, terahertz (THz),
    and large-

    scale satellite constellations), 6G communication systems will help the healthcare
    sector

    grow toward a more efﬁcient, fully connected and intelligent system.

    Billions of people throughout the world now use mobile and wireless networks.
    There

    will be a bottleneck for m-health applications due to the inﬂux of trafﬁc generated
    by all

    of these people being online simultaneously, which will put them at a competitive
    disad-

    vantage with other high bandwidth-demanding services. As a result, wireless technology

    innovation is critical to keep pace with the ever-increasing demands for spectrum
    efﬁciency,

    energy consumption, mobility, ﬂawless coverage, and the wide range of QoS and
    QoE

    needs. The network resources must be coordinated end-to-end and cross-layer to
    meet the

    needs and expectations of individual users [43]. A 6G mobile network is anticipated
    to

    provide QoS, QoE, and quality of physical experience (QoPE), as well as reliability
    and

    security [35,44]. Due to rate-reliability-latency and sensitive m-health applications
    such

    as telepresence, telesurgery, etc., QoE is a critical performance metric for 6G.
    The 5G QoS

    measurements, including packet loss rate, end-to-end latency, and round-trip timings,
    are

    no longer effective for upcoming 6G wireless applications. QoE focuses on user
    pleasure,

    aesthetics, comprehension, and application manageability. As a result, in addition
    to QoS,

    the outcome of usage is a critical component in ensuring QoE. Network and service
    man-

    agement needs to be transformed by researching automation, cognitive operation,
    AI, and

    ML to increase QoE further. Quality is determined not only by network measurements
    in

    m-health multimedia applications, but also by other factors. Authors have focused
    on QoE

    in multimedia IoT apps in surveys such as [45–47], which is deﬁned by how users
    utilize

    such applications. However, because 6G is still in its early stages, measuring
    performance

    metrics is susceptible to change at this time.

    Figure 6. Comparison of 6G and 5G capabilities.

    4.2. Evolution of m-Health Wireless Systems: 2G to 5G

    Over the years and with the evolution of wireless systems, numerous m-health services

    and applications have been successfully deployed worldwide, satisfying the vision
    of per-

    vasive connected healthcare. It is well-known that the evolution of wireless communication

    technologies has contributed signiﬁcantly to the progression of m-health systems,
    starting

    from 2G (GPRS) and 3G (UMTS, CDMA) through WiMAX to the existing 4G (LTE/LTE-A),

    current 5G and towards future 6G systems [27,48]. m-health services are beneﬁcial
    in

    areas with a shortage of medical health facilities, where hospitals are located
    far from large

    populations, or where medical care is costly. Satellite communication, cloud-based
    systems,

    and 4G and 5G cellular networks are all examples of innovative and advanced wireless

    and wired technologies used in m-health systems. Technology is altering traditional
    health-

    care services and saving lives by providing rapid diagnosis and alerting medical
    centers,

    such as advanced cellular technologies, smart small wearable gadgets that monitor
    and

    communicate data to patients’ and medical assistants’ smartphones [49,50].

    While security, dependability, latency, and physical size are all critical considerations

    for m-health systems, one of the most signiﬁcant barriers to the broad adoption
    of cellular

    networks in telemedical systems is a lack of bandwidth and performance [51]. The
    ﬁrst

    generation (1G) of analogue mobile phones aimed solely at voice communication.
    The

    2G Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMC) phones were designed primarily

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    14 of 43

    for digital voice transmission (GSM). General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is offered
    as

    a network overlay for GSM, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and Time Division

    Multiple Access (TDMA) networks formed 2.5G. The initial GSM service only allowed

    for data rates up to 9.6 kbps per channel, and GPRS allowed approximately 14 kbps
    per

    channel. In theory, GPRS can combine up to eight channels, bringing the total
    bandwidth

    to 100 kbps. For the ﬁrst time, the primary objective of wireless phone service
    was data

    transmission rather than voice transmission. For end-users, the most crucial characteristic

    of GPRS was that it provided constant connectivity. Various services were made
    available

    over GPRS, including web browsing, the transfer of still photographs and video
    clips,

    document sharing, and remote collaborative working. These services contributed
    to the

    development of the world’s ﬁrst usable medical systems, which were built on global

    accessibility. Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was denoted by 2.75G. If
    the GPRS

    protocol was the ﬁrst step on the road to 3G, the EDGE protocol was the next step
    on the

    road. In theory, EDGE provided data rates of up to 384 kbps, while actual data
    speeds

    were lower. The ability of EDGE to operate on the current GSM spectrum was the
    main

    attraction of the technology.

    Increased data rate requirements and technological advancements necessitated the
    ad-

    vent of 3G technologies, with the primary air interface being wideband CDMA (WCDMA).

    This generation was named the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS).

    UMTS supported data transfer rates of up to 2 Mbps indoors (a low-mobility scenario),

    384 kbps outdoors (at the speed of slow-moving pedestrians), and 144 kbps for
    fast-moving

    mobile phones. The overall goal of UMTS was to provide seamless functioning through
    the

    employment of pico- and microcells indoors and in urban areas, macrocells outside
    and in

    rural regions, and, when necessary, satellite networks. When the 3G systems were
    being

    deﬁned in their infancy, video telephony was envisioned as a breakthrough application.

    The 3G systems have been demonstrated to efﬁciently support the amount of data
    necessary

    for medical applications [52]. The emergence of 3G wireless systems provided an
    initial

    platform for transmitting medical images and videos. The requirements after 3G
    started

    increasing rapidly as new systems required more bandwidth, steady performance,
    and a

    high QoS.

    The introduction of 4G technology was a turning point for m-health applications

    as it overcame the limitations of previous wireless communications generations.
    The

    amalgamation of 4G technology with healthcare brought in the concept of 4G health,

    which can be deﬁned as m-health using personalized medical systems with adaptable

    functionalities and compatibility with future 4G network technologies. In the
    4G systems,

    the High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) protocol supported data rates of
    up to

    14.4 Mbps with a latency of around 100 ms. The 5G mobile communication technologies
    and

    their related IoT-connected ecosystem served as a catalyst for the development
    of m-health

    applications. Mobile health apps beneﬁted from the unparalleled speed, capacity,
    and low

    latency levels provided by these technologies. Data rates of up to 10 Gbps are
    possible,

    representing a 10- to 100-fold boost over the 4G networks with one millisecond
    or less

    latency, more than 100 times the number of connected devices per square meter
    compared

    to its predecessor. Network coverage levels exceed 100 percent while maintaining
    a fairly

    constant network availability [12].

    4.3. Evolution of Quality of Experience: 2G to 5G

    QoS has traditionally been used to evaluate a system’s overall performance in
    terms of

    its service to its users. The intent of the QoS was not to capture the subjective
    perception of

    quality or level of pleasure held by the user. The International Telecommunication
    Union

    (ITU) ﬁrst proposed the concept of QoS as experienced by the user in 2008 [53],
    stating that

    it is “inﬂuenced by the delivered QoS and psychological factors inﬂuencing the
    perception

    of the user”. As a result of the signiﬁcant advances in information and communications

    technology, the term Quality of Experience (QoE) was coined at a later stage.
    According

    to [53], QoE is the total acceptability of an application or service as assessed
    subjectively

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    15 of 43

    by the end-user. As a result, the user-centric idea of QoE complements the notion
    of

    network-centric QoS. The primary goal of the QoE program is to assess customer
    percep-

    tions of quality and collect feedback to support the optimization of various technological

    aspects [33]. Voice as the primary service in the ﬁrst two wireless generations,
    measur-

    ing user impressions relied on mean opinion score (MOS)—a subjective measure widely

    employed in traditional phone networks. GSM enabled a signiﬁcant increase in mobile

    data rates leading to the GPRS and the EDGE that enabled the ﬁrst widespread adoption

    of Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). It enabled multimedia service applications
    to

    prosper and provided increased speed, bandwidth, security, and mobility management

    while improving radio resource utilization [54]. UMTS deﬁned the QoS requirements
    for

    multimedia wireless data servicesand necessitated the development of a new architecture

    capable of reducing the latency (100 ms) using end-to-end IP data communication.
    Ad-

    ditionally, 4G and LTE-A enabled improved mobile multimedia functions and increased

    user equipment ﬂexibility. The LTE-A enabled the efﬁcient sharing of multimedia
    resources

    across the eNodeB, the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), and the Content Provider via
    the Multi-

    media Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) pioneered a new business model based
    on

    the LTE radio architecture. Additionally, by implementing the Mobility Management
    Entity

    (MME) on activated eMBMS on 4G networks, LTE-Broadcasting (LTE-B) was enabled,
    con-

    clusively enabling the simultaneous distribution of multimedia resources to several
    users

    at the same time, thereby enhancing QoS. The MBMS Signal Frequency Network (MBSFM)

    converts multimedia content sent from several eNodeBs to a multipath signal to
    increase

    the gain of the original content that is being multicast or broadcast. The eMBMS
    bearer

    contributes immensely to video compression methods and new multimedia technologies.

    eMBMS leverages MIMO technology to provide consumers with Multicast/Broadcast

    media content that supports a high level of QoE, such as High-Deﬁnition Video
    streaming.

    The 5G NR introduced new functionalities to improve QoE by merging the concepts

    of Network Slicing, Edge Computing, and the 5G QoS Flow. With the introduction
    of

    new features such as improved Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency

    Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC), new

    opportunities for service applications have opened up. Numerous m-health multimedia

    apps were made possible by these components. When considered in light of the ongoing

    discussions on 6G networks, QoE considerations take on new dimensions that have
    not

    been considered previously, particularly in light of the projected enhancement
    of the user

    context through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), in addition to
    tactile

    experiences. It becomes vital, as a result, to streamline the QoE investigation
    toward

    relevant and usable procedures.

    4.4. The Correlation between QoS and QoE in m-Health Applications

    In medical video streaming, especially for real-time diagnosis, it is crucial
    to have

    a highly reliable network that is predictable and performs as required, even in
    varying

    conditions. Furthermore, the wireless network should be able to support real-time
    trafﬁc

    management for the medical video streaming application. Trafﬁc management is important

    because real-time trafﬁc tends to be bursty in nature, and this may often lead
    to packet

    losses, which in turn implies the loss of information; hence, the video packet
    streams need

    to be well-managed. The loss of packets is not acceptable for medical applications
    because

    it may hinder the accurate reconstruction of the received videos, which may further
    affect

    the diagnosis process. Therefore, a medical video streaming platform must be able
    to

    support a maximum, average, and minimum set of trafﬁc parameters.

    The m-QoS aspects related to m-health applications have been investigated extensively

    in the literature. However, the m-QoE aspects are not yet well-explored. A challenge
    in

    m-QoE is that users generally have higher expectations in terms of quality received
    as

    the service is related to their health, and they are vulnerable to losing trust
    in the service

    provided by the m-health system. Therefore, in order to achieve high acceptability
    of

    m-health applications, the m-QoE aspects need to be determined and incorporated
    into the

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    16 of 43

    design. To determine the context of the m-health application, it is important
    to identify and

    analyze the clinical-related requirements and the inﬂuencing factors such as application

    area, application purpose, content type, and context of use.

    6G Technology promises to deliver high QoS [36,38], enabling a plethora of new

    applications making 6G technology a game-changer in numerous ﬁelds. Additionally,
    6G

    technology promises high QoE, which deﬁnes user-centric communications. m-health

    multimedia communications refer to clear and detailed signals, which can be audio,
    video,

    bio-signals, text, graphics, still images, interactive data, and so on. The optimization
    of the

    QoE during medical media transmission is one of the most signiﬁcant concepts to
    consider

    from the perspective of the end-users perception [55].

    Many studies have focused on determining the relationship between QoS parameters

    and QoE; few instances claim that QoS is the most critical factor in determining
    a user’s

    perceived quality [56]. Correlation models must be established to evaluate the
    relationship

    between QoS parameters and their individual and mutual effects on QoE [22,57].
    The

    correlation models proposed in the literature can be divided into general and
    speciﬁc

    models [58]. The prior one is shown in Figure 7. This ﬁgure talks about the general

    model of correlation between QoE and QoS. It considers QoS as a component in a
    series of

    QoE-determining variables and shows that QoE cannot be separated from QoS metrics
    as

    the network’s state inﬂuences the user experience. Figure 7 shows where QoS is
    speciﬁc

    to the transmission, while QoE includes transmission as well as involves the end-user’s

    engagement. The ﬁgure illustrates prospective application scenarios of m-health,
    such as

    intelligent ambulance services, remote patient monitoring, telemedicine, etc.

    Figure 7. QoS and QoE in m-health applications.

    Alternatively, speciﬁc models investigate the impact of QoS parameters on QoE.

    QoS/QoE mapping calculates QoE values based on a set of measurable network KPIs
    from

    the QoS objective criteria, referring to the degree of service adequacy. Using
    appropriate

    mathematical models, QoE can be obtained from these measurements. Subjective user-

    centric aspects, which cannot be measured directly from the network but may impact
    the

    end-entire user’s experience, are included in the QoE inﬂuencing factors [59].
    Understand-

    ing the relationship between network-based QoS parameters and end-user-perceived
    QoE

    is crucial in the QoE management process [60].

    QoE cannot be separated from QoS metrics as the network’s state inﬂuences the
    user

    experience [9]. However, the tendency to view the network as the primary element
    in

    determining QoE should be addressed. Research has been conducted on ﬁnding QoS

    parameters affecting QoE in telecommunication systems [61,62]; for example, the
    authors

    in [63] show how QoE has a logarithmic relationship with the throughput in transmission.

    Studies such as [64] improve the modeling of QoE–QoS interactions, but QoE consideration

    is still limited to what can be measured and managed through the network. The
    researchers

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    17 of 43

    in [65] classify multimedia as a key performance indicator for QoE and QoS analysis.
    A

    reliable and efﬁcient technique for analyzing QoE is designed to determine the
    trade-off

    between user perception and QoS entities [66]. Additionally, they addressed the
    fact

    that standard network performance metrics such as delay, jitter, and throughput
    do not

    accurately reﬂect the complete user perception level. However, by combining QoE
    and

    QoS parameters, the desired result can be attained. Similarly, researchers in
    [67] provide

    a mechanism for energy conservation and QoS evaluation in healthcare and traditional

    wireless networks.

    Overall, 6G is planned to enable a wide range of m-health applications, making
    it more

    challenging to handle the unique QoS requirements of different apps while also
    ensuring

    the QoE of different users. The ability to derive complicated quantitative correlations

    between QoS parameters and KPIs is crucial for controlling QoS. In order to do
    this,

    Ref. [68] suggested a delay estimation approach based on neural networks. The
    input to the

    supervised learning technique is the trafﬁc load and the routing strategy, while
    the output

    of the supervised learning approach is the network delay. According to the ﬁndings
    of the

    experiments, the NN-based estimator outperforms the standard M/M/1 model in terms
    of

    estimation accuracy by a signiﬁcant margin. Similar to this, Ref. [69] attempted
    to uncover

    the mapping relationships between QoS parameters and KPIs through a decision tree.
    The

    linear regression technique M5Rules is used to determine the quantitative inﬂuence
    of

    KPIs on QoS. Obtaining the QoE values takes a signiﬁcant amount of time, and as
    a result,

    understanding how various QoS parameters affect the QoE values is particularly
    crucial

    when computing QoE values quickly. The goal of [70] is to measure the QoE of a
    video

    streaming service using a supervised learning approach. Network metrics such as
    RTT,

    jitter, bandwidth, and delay are utilized as input to train the NN model, while
    the QoE is

    employed as an output. The SDN controller can adjust network parameters to increase

    QoE; on the other hand, Abar et al. [71] attempted to estimate QoE values from
    video

    quality characteristics. Four machine learning algorithms are investigated: the
    decision

    tree, the neural network, the K-NN, and the random forest. By applying MLP, Pierucci

    et al. [72] studied the relationship between user throughput and QoS factors to
    forecast

    users’ QoE based on user throughput, the number of active users, and channel quality

    indicators, among other things. The simulation results reveal a high degree of
    accuracy

    in making predictions. As new applications, such as XR in 6G, have emerged, new
    QoE

    and QoS evaluation metrics are introduced. Existing research reveals that deep
    learning is

    promising in learning the complex relationships between them, allowing for more
    efﬁcient

    QoE insurance and resource utilization.

    According to the authors in [73], QoE is a broader concept that incorporates QoS

    metrics and user-related elements such as their behavioral, cognitive, and psychological

    states and the context in which these products and services are offered. These
    elements

    inﬂuence the overall QoE when using a particular application or service. Mobile
    computing

    environments are characterized by dynamic user behavior, as users interact with
    appli-

    cations or services in various situations. Consequently, when measuring and predicting

    QoE, it is critical to take into account metrics relating to users, their device(s),
    and the

    surrounding environment, as well as network QoS. User moods, screen size, social
    context,

    activities, and packet loss, are just a few examples of the types of information
    that can be

    collected and stored.

    5. 6G Features Significantly Enhancing the QoE of m-Health Multi-Media Applications

    As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, internet video streaming has already taken

    over a major portion of our daily lives through various applications such as webinars

    and video conferencing. However, issues such as video startup failures, pixilation,
    delays,

    or other sorts of image or audio quality degradation were commonly seen during
    the

    quarantine period in all parts of the world. All of these degradations are unacceptable

    in the context of m-health services. The need to deal with the explosion of multimedia

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    18 of 43

    services has been considered in the 6G network, which will provide greater QoS
    while also

    guaranteeing QoE.

    In this section, we provide greater discussions about 6G features which speciﬁcally

    discusses the following: the provision of enhanced video streaming using small
    cells

    solutions, the ﬂexibility of 6G high frequencies, the phenomena of the 3CLS services,

    the enhanced multimedia transmission services, the provision of network slicing
    and

    artiﬁcial intelligence, enhanced security and blockchain, reconﬁgurable intelligent
    surfaces,

    extended radio, and ﬁnally the massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications.

    5.1. How Small/Tiny Cells Can Enhance the Video Streaming

    The deployment of small cells in an m-health wireless infrastructure would mean
    that

    patients and healthcare professionals on handheld devices would experience high
    QoS

    and QoE down at the street level, where it really matters. The expansion of video
    trafﬁc

    has increased the strain on spectral efﬁciency, energy consumption, mobility,
    seamless

    coverage, and the various requirements for QoS and QoE. Medical multimedia applications

    will coexist and compete with conventional video trafﬁc to deliver healthcare
    services

    across mobile networks in a shared environment. To address the aforementioned
    issues, the

    adoption of tiny cell (e.g., small cell) technology as a communication platform
    for strong

    m-health systems is recommended.

    Small cells (e.g., femtocells) are low-power base stations (BSs) speciﬁcally designed
    for

    coverage enhancement in an indoor dense environment where there is limited macrocell

    network coverage. They are characterized by the low transmission power, high capacity,

    low cost and easily deployable features with a coverage range of some tens of
    meters. They

    can be readily installed by the users in a plug-and-play manner, with an option
    of restricting

    access to only a certain group of users present at home or in an ofﬁce environment
    (i.e.,

    closed access). They perform the entire operational task in a completely autonomic
    and self-

    organized manner, including device conﬁguration, troubleshooting, and optimization
    [74].

    Due to the limited number of users permitted access to the small cell BS, each
    user can

    achieve high data rates. The demand for improved data rates along with spectral
    and

    energy efﬁciency at any time in 6G motivates the exploration of frequencies above
    sub-6

    GHz. As 6G evolves, it will become essential to use frequencies beyond mmWave,
    in the

    terahertz (THz) range (i.e., referring to electromagnetic waves with frequencies
    between

    100 GHz and 10 THz) [75]. To take advantage of higher mmWave and THz frequencies,
    the

    6G cell size must be reduced from small to “tiny cell” with a radius of only a
    few tens of

    meters. Small cells (e.g., femtocells and picocells) have a different radio range,
    and network

    characteristics, which enables them to transmit at a higher rate while reducing
    trafﬁc on

    macrocells [76].

    5.2. 6G Supports Higher Frequencies

    As discussed previously, 6G enables higher frequencies, which is advantageous
    for

    multimedia applications requiring high data rates. It also provides spectral and
    energy

    efﬁciency, high mobility, and seamless coverage. Additionally, 6G will require
    the con-

    tinuance of Massive-MIMO technologies to offer high data rates efﬁciently; frequencies

    above the radio spectrum (i.e., Terahertz) are strong candidates for use with
    Massive

    MIMO [35,54]. THz communications are envisioned as the driving technology for
    6G-IoT,

    demanding data rates of 100+ Gbps and latency of less than one millisecond. Receiving

    high data rates to the order of Gbps would let healthcare professionals view high-resolution

    medical images and videos in Ultra-High-Deﬁnition format. The THz band (0.1–10
    THz)

    appears to be a good candidate for future m-health needs, including picosecond-level

    symbol duration, integration of thousands of submillimeter-long antennas, and
    low in-

    terference without requiring complete legacy regulation [77]. Some beneﬁts of
    the THz

    spectrum for 6G-enabled m-health systems include addressing spectrum scarcity
    issues in

    wireless communications, allowing ultra-high bandwidth and throughput, and enabling

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    19 of 43

    ultra-broadband applications such as virtual reality and Wireless Personal Area
    Networks

    (WPAN) to be implemented [78].

    In m-health wireless systems, the scalability of multiple medical sensors/devices

    and seamless connectivity are requirements that future 6G technology is anticipated
    to

    support. Body wearables and implants involve multiple biomedical/nano sensors
    and

    actuators that take physiological readings from the human body for m-health remote

    monitoring applications. 6G THz frequency bands can accomplish Internet of Nano-

    Things (IoNT) communication [68], where densely deployed nano-things continuously

    generate valuable data and forward it to data centers over a high-speed 6G communication

    network [79]. Similarly, the Tbps data rate needs for AR/VR services can be supported
    via

    THz transmission and Tiny cells [80]. Given the signiﬁcant free-space path loss
    associated

    with THz signals, including spreading and molecule absorption loss [81], the THz
    bands

    are better suited for short-range wireless communications, such as wireless backhaul
    for

    tiny cells. THz communication will evolve steadily over the next few years and
    will be

    critical in the 6G sector, with numerous promising technologies [82].

    5.3. 3CLS Services

    Overall, 6G will signiﬁcantly expand the wireless network depth from single infor-

    mation transmission to information transmission, storage, and processing, which
    helps in

    maximizing network utility and providing exceptional QoE for various services
    and appli-

    cations. As a result, sophisticated wireless sensing, communication, processing,
    caching,

    and control must all work together. With this convergence, the networks can make
    optimal

    decisions related to sensing and computing tasks [45]. In the previous ﬁve generations
    of

    cellular systems, only the feature of wireless communication was available, but
    6G will

    provide a variety of services through the convergence of Communication, Computing,

    Control, Localization, and Sensing (3CLS) [35]. As a multi-purpose system, 6G
    has the

    potential to provide many 3CLS services, which are particularly interesting and
    even critical

    for applications such as extended reality (XR) services (encompassing augmented,
    mixed,

    and virtual reality (AR/MR/VR)), Connected Robotics and Autonomous Systems (CRAS),

    and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) that require tracking and control, as
    well as

    localization, computation, and other features.

    Using the same time-frequency-spatial resources, communication, location, and
    sens-

    ing services are all expected to coexist in 6G networks [83]. This coexistence
    will signiﬁ-

    cantly improve spectrum efﬁciency while also avoiding present regulatory obstacles.
    The

    cooperation between these services has signiﬁcant mutual beneﬁts [84], e.g., location
    and

    context-aware communication. This context awareness will also assist m-health
    applica-

    tions in 6G networks by allowing multi-modal communication and service quality
    based on

    the present location or context. For example, based on the application needs,
    one can select

    a subset of terrestrial, aerial, and space elements using accurate context awareness
    [85].

    Applications such as Human-Centric Services (HCS) are predicted to rely on 3CLS
    services

    to provide effective communication and real-time processing of a huge number of
    data

    streams collected by sensors centered on humans [86]. Existing 5G technologies
    have not

    thoroughly investigated the interdependence between 3CLS in an end-to-end manner;
    thus,

    the development of 3CLS services is an essential driving trend toward the next
    generation

    of mobile communication networks [87]. Future mobile communication networks will

    need collective network intelligence at the network’s edge to run AI and ML algorithms
    in

    real-time to provide 3CLS services [35]. In order to support AI-managed end-to-end
    3CLS

    design services, the network architecture should also be open, scalable, and elastic
    [35,88].

    5.4. Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services

    Current cellular IoT systems monitor service announcements even when ﬁrmware and

    software changes are infrequent. The 6G IoT devices would no longer need to watch
    service

    announcements but instead be paged to obtain multicast data resulting in a reduction
    in

    energy consumption [89]. The Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS)

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    20 of 43

    bearer is a valuable addition to video compression protocols and new technologies
    devoted

    to video applications. It uses MIMO technology to deliver Multicast/Broadcast
    media

    material to users while maintaining a high level of QoE, for example, high-deﬁnition
    video

    streaming [54].

    Mobile cellular networks offer great potential to support vehicular services due
    to their

    high network capacity and widespread coverage, but still some challenges persist.
    Vehicular

    data should be routed through the base station (BS) ﬁrst, as centralized cellular
    networks

    have limited applicability for vehicle-to-vehicle communications [90]. In unicast
    mode, a

    vehicle transmits emergency information to a cellular BS, then unicasts it to
    the appropriate

    vehicles; this limits the downlink channel. MBMS and eMBMS are viable methods
    for

    disseminating emergency information [11]; eMBMS is typically used in conjunction
    with

    a single-frequency network, where multiple BSs broadcast simultaneously over the
    same

    channel [12]. Multiple vehicles can acquire emergency information concurrently
    utilizing

    the same frequency band. When multimedia content is sent from separate eNodeBs,
    the

    MBMS Signal Frequency Network (MBSFM) converts it into a multipath signal, which
    can

    then be used to improve the gain of the original content, that is multicast or
    disseminated.

    5.5. Network Slicing

    User demands for high-quality services have prompted telecom operators to invest
    in

    new cutting-edge network softwarization paradigms such as Software Deﬁned Networking

    (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC),

    and Cloud/Fog Computing (C/FoC). Pressure from new emergent use cases such as

    ultra-high quality video (4K/8K), network-controlled D2D communications, Machine

    Type Communication (MTC), and Massive Internet of Things (MIOT) is also driving
    this

    transformation and system upgrading. The future networks will be cloudiﬁed via
    SDN

    and NFV, enabling Internet Service Providers to customize services and provide
    QoE that

    matches consumer needs through sophisticated QoE control and management [45].

    Virtualization is a technology that provides virtual representations of things
    such

    as virtual computers, servers, memory, network services, etc. The NFV allows network

    functions to be separated from proprietary hardware appliances and run in software
    on

    standardized hardware. SDN adds intelligence and ﬂexibility to programmable networks,

    allowing ﬁner-grained network-wide orchestration and management of operating appli-

    cations and services [91]. SDNs can have their QoE control and management planes

    built as software that runs on commodity hardware devices [45]. SDN and NFV aim

    to establish a future software-based networking solution that enables end-users
    to have

    ﬂexible and automated network connectivity and QoE provisioning. The use of AI
    in

    conjunction with SDN/NFV/NS allows for dynamic and zero-touch network orchestration,

    optimization, and management, accelerating the transition from 5G to autonomous
    6G

    networks. AI-assisted network optimization can track real-time network KPIs and
    make

    rapid adjustments to network parameters to maintain high QoE.

    Different strategies for QoE-centered management of multimedia streaming services

    are applied using SDN/NFV technologies. Maximum QoE for end-users is achieved

    through the best path calculations for each service ﬂow. The video is broadcast
    through

    low-latency, high-throughput networks, which improves the attained video quality
    [92].

    The computation of optimal bitrates for clients to achieve QoE-fairness in the
    delivered

    video is performed by assigning different priorities to a video stream depending
    on the

    requested quality [93,94]. Allocation of network resources cost-effectively ensures
    that the

    highest possible level of user QoE fairness is attained. The underlying concept
    is to prevent

    quality instability, unfair bandwidth sharing, and network resource underutilization
    among

    DASH competing clients who share the same bottleneck network link to maximize
    network

    usage [95,96]. Coordination of actions and cooperative cooperation between layers
    are

    required to optimize network resources and improve the end-user’s QoE. Using SDN

    controllers, the QoE requirements can be set at the application layer and regulated
    at the

    network layer in such a conﬁguration [97]. In SDN-based networks, it is necessary
    to

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    21 of 43

    support effective multipath routing and accelerate the transmission of huge amounts
    of

    multimedia applications between end points while maintaining the QoE of end-users.
    The

    MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) enables load balancing, reliable communication, and improved

    network resource usage, which results in increased network throughput and improved

    QoE for end-users [98].

    5.6. Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    QoE models based on Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) that

    consider video features can be extremely useful for m-health multimedia applications.

    AI-assisted network optimization can track real-time network KPIs and make rapid
    ad-

    justments to network parameters to maintain high QoE [36]. “Pervasive intelligence”
    is

    proposed as one of the 6G network’s ultimate goals, which aids in the formation
    of an

    auto-generating and auto-conﬁguration network paradigm [99]. The network is designed

    to conﬁgure processing algorithms, signaling autonomously, and protocol processes
    for

    future new use cases and more complex requirements, potentially reducing standardization

    efforts and costs in implementing new network infrastructures.

    AI-enabled RAN design is proposed in [100] to minimize the cost of standardization

    while maximizing the potential gain of AI-enabled network optimization. One AI
    scheduler

    controls all tasks of the RAN, including RRC, RRM, protocol function elements
    (PFEs)

    setting, and MAC layer scheduling. Deep learning, reinforcement learning, Q-learning,

    and other AI approaches can be used to learn the characteristics of the services
    [101]. The

    scheduler might be more efﬁcient and intelligent based on the prospective prediction
    of

    channels, data trafﬁc, QoS/QoE indicators, and so on at either the AI controller
    or AI

    scheduler. The non-real-time AI processing is handled by the RAN AI controller,
    which

    has logical interfaces with the CN, network operations, administration, and maintenance

    (OAM) platform, and BS. The AI controller may forecast user mobility, trafﬁc behavior,

    network loading ﬂuctuation, and other factors using big data analytics [102],
    which is

    then supplied to the BS to assist the AI scheduler with RRC, RRM, PFE orchestration,
    and

    real-time MAC scheduling.

    The AI controller and scheduler could use deep learning approaches based on his-

    torical and new data to ﬁgure out customized RRC and RRM functions set for a certain

    UE in a speciﬁc circumstance. Instead of regular dynamic scheduling, the network
    can

    allocate a reserved semi-static resource, such as semi-persistent scheduling (SPS)
    and con-

    ﬁgurable grant (CG) conﬁguration(s), to a device based on its trafﬁc pattern acquired
    from

    application-layer data. A service’s unique requirements for dependability and
    survival

    time might also be supplied, which would aid the scheduler in determining whether
    to use

    a duplication mechanism or repeat transmission for devices.

    5.7. Enhanced Security and Blockchain

    Achieving a high level of security and privacy in 6G-based IoT networks is a real

    challenge since 6G systems are distributed and, as a result, face higher risks
    of cyberattacks

    and threats. Additionally, maintaining data privacy in multilayer 6G open-sharing
    systems

    such as vehicular data sharing in automated vehicles is a crucial issue. In terms
    of security

    attacks, signals used for dedicated short-range communication in autonomous ambulances

    can be altered or controlled to jam the radar or cause collisions with other vehicles.
    Aside

    from that, smart wristbands are worn by restricted patients to monitor and track
    their

    movements around the hospital facility. However, the communication signals transmitted

    by wristbands are susceptible to jamming and spooﬁng attempts. Overall, 6G will
    bring

    a new solution to the security paradigm, redeﬁning it entirely. Blockchain [103],
    as an

    emerging disruptive technology, can provide novel solutions to such privacy and
    security

    concerns in 6G-IoT networks. The blockchain, in theory, is a decentralized, immutable,
    and

    transparent database in which no authority is required to administer the data.
    It is made

    possible by a peer-to-peer network structure, which gives each entity, such as
    an IoT device,

    an equal right to control and authorize the data recorded in the blockchain.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    22 of 43

    Due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data, blockchain adoption is required
    to

    ensure utilitarianism and other normative issues of rights and duties [104]. There
    are

    signiﬁcant ethical concerns as this sector deals with individually identiﬁable
    and conﬁ-

    dential health-related data. The veriﬁcation of health data in 6G-based healthcare
    systems

    can be accomplished using blockchain and its inherent smart contract technology
    [105],

    eliminating the need for a third party while maintaining a high conﬁdence level.
    The

    operational reach of blockchain-enabled systems may span multiple jurisdictions
    with

    varying medical and cyber-security requirements. So, if any blockchain-enabled
    healthcare

    application is to be applied across national or regional borders and provided
    via a high-

    speed network, standardization, transparency, and accountability are required
    [104,106].

    Apart from blockchain, federated AI, quantum machine learning, quantum computing,

    and THz communication will be used to ﬁght against cyberattacks in 6G [107,108].
    THz

    communication is impenetrable to eavesdropping and jamming.

    Spectrum sharing is an expensive feature in 6G or lower cellular networks because

    large quantities of money are paid to spectrum regulators. The operator purchases
    bands

    and sub-bands and then uses or leases to other operators. Blockchain technology
    can be uti-

    lized for license shared access (LSA), and cognitive radio networks (CRN) can
    be used with

    blockchain to create a distributed MAC protocol for secondary network users [109].
    Further-

    more, spectrum sharing based on blockchain would enable network resource virtualization.

    The federal communications commission (FCC) has stated that because blockchain
    is an

    important component of 6G stacking applications, a blockchain-based spectrum-sharing

    service can be implemented in the 6G protocol stack [110].

    5.8. Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surfaces

    Overall, 6G will enable a plethora of new possibilities and state-of-the-art applications

    requiring minimal latency and high-quality video and huge image data transmission.

    Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and orbital angular momentum communication

    could serve as core technologies for the 6G radio interface, providing a solution
    to many

    physical layer constraints [9]. This new paradigm of programmable and software-deﬁned

    metasurfaces will offer previously unimaginable technical solutions for unobtrusive
    and

    noninvasive sensing, which has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry
    [111].

    Recently, RISs have garnered signiﬁcant research attention for applications, including
    6G

    technology [112]. The RIS comprises arrays of passive scattering devices with
    artiﬁcial

    planar structures. Each element is enabled to reﬂect the impinging electromagnetic
    wave in

    a software-deﬁned manner using electronic circuits [113]. Due to their reconﬁgurability,

    RISs are a possible solution for assisting in the design and optimization of wireless
    systems

    by facilitating signal propagation, channel modeling, and acquisition, hence enabling
    smart

    radio environments advantageous for 6G-based applications.

    This integration of RIS enabled-Intelligent Walls (IW) will play a critical role
    in the

    development of the 6G communication ecosystem. Diverse factors necessitate seamless

    coverage and connectivity in healthcare settings. The hospital’s complicated physical

    structure and sensitive equipment restrict network coverage. Currently, the hospital
    uses

    Wi-Fi networks for communication, but electromagnetic interference limits coverage
    in

    sensitive places [114]. In order to improve coverage and safeguard RF-prohibited
    areas,

    RIS can be installed on walls, ceilings, etc., in hospitals [115].

    Interconnected medical equipment and applications capture data and send it to
    health-

    care IT systems. Wearable healthcare devices must be charged periodically to stay
    active

    and transmit patient data to monitoring systems. The IW will be an indoor primary
    surface

    used to charge wearable gadgets wirelessly [116]. The IW’s sensor circuit would
    listen for

    the wearable device’s beacon signal and direct the ambient RF energy toward it
    when a

    battery threshold was met. Nevertheless, most wearable gadgets use backscatter
    communi-

    cation, which requires a separate transmitter nearby. Wearable devices cannot
    transfer data

    over extended distances due to power limits and limited data rate transmission.
    Thus, in

    IoMT applications, IW can be employed for both charging and rapid data transfer.
    Noninva-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    23 of 43

    sive patient sensing is another case in healthcare [116,117]. The RF signals could
    be utilized

    as an illuminator of opportunity, combining an ambient signal from a BS with echoes
    from

    test subjects to collect information on their movements [118]. Using ambient signals,
    it

    can obtain high-resolution full-scene images and accurately detect human body
    postures

    and vital signs [116,119]. The AI-enabled controller attached to the IWs can process
    the

    data. A patient with heart attack symptoms or an elderly patient who falls over
    would

    order a secondary IW to redirect the ambient mm-wave signal to the specialized
    emergency

    response radio link. RIS can also provide great beneﬁts for services such as localization

    and mapping [120].

    5.9. Extended Radio (XR)

    Overall, 6G will be supported by Extended Radio (XR) by having satellite communi-

    cation in conjunction with the terrestrial connection. The 6G technology’s primary
    needs

    are a 1 THz operating frequency, and a 1 Tbps data throughput [108]. Existing
    5G tech-

    nology is primarily focused on metropolitan areas, with less emphasis on developing

    and rural areas. Thus, a broad swath of the population area is covered with deep
    indoor

    penetration, ensuring adequate equity for rural areas. Overall, 6G will provide
    an inter-

    connected communication network ranging from the ground and sky to the underwater

    environment and satellite communication to achieve global connectivity. Unlike
    today’s

    IoT deployment, primarily based on terrestrial infrastructure, 6G communication
    utilizes

    diverse low and high-altitude platforms, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites,
    to

    form an aerial network framework that supports ultra-massive IoT connections via
    reliable

    wireless links. The aerial network is also supported by UAVs and balloons that
    act as

    ﬂying BSs, providing coverage and connectivity for disaster-affected areas and
    supporting

    public safety networks and emergency scenarios requiring URLLC [121]. UAVs integrate

    with terrestrial BSs to provide direct air-ground links for collaborative sensing
    and data

    transmission in 6G-IoT contexts. Because of their quick response time, remote
    operating

    capability, and controllable agility, UAVs are well suited for emergencies, such
    as anti-terror

    battleﬁelds or catastrophe areas following earthquakes and ﬂoods [122]. When terrestrial

    infrastructure is rendered inoperable, UAVs can be launched to quickly restore
    wireless

    network coverage and communicate with the outside world [123].

    5.10. Massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications

    Remote health monitoring and other healthcare domains require low-latency com-

    munications (below 1 ms) with a reliability requirement of greater than 99.99%
    to achieve

    nearly real-time health provision and fast and reliable remote diagnosis. URLLC
    is pre-

    dicted to be achieved in the 6G era, which will allow for the support of future
    IoT services

    through low-latency and dependable communication [78]. For example, the mURLLC
    is ex-

    pected to support the timely and highly reliable delivery of massive health data
    to facilitate

    remote healthcare, with the goal of providing better medical services to patients
    in remote

    areas while also reducing regional imbalances in the health workforce. Smart factories

    can use mURLLC to automate mission-critical activities such as automatic production
    and

    remote robotic control. Its outstanding characteristics make mURLLC well-suited
    for sup-

    porting transportation systems by enabling high-reliability and timely data sharing
    among

    vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians. This contributes to improved smart
    ambulance

    systems and high efﬁciency in vehicular networks. Because of this, mURLLC can
    provide

    an extensive range of mission-critical services, including fast fault diagnosis
    and accurate

    location, dependable fault isolation, system restoration, and remote decoupling
    protections.

    This section is summarized in Table 4, and an illustration of these technologies
    can be

    seen in Figure 8. The ﬁgure block lists the enabling technologies that will drive
    the evolution

    of 6G systems and play a signiﬁcant role in enhancing m-health’s QoE as discussed
    in this

    section. The 6G will integrate the physical, biological and digital world together,
    as shown

    in this ﬁgure’s pictorial representation.

    6G Feature

    Description

    Tiny Cells

    to install and conﬁgure, with the ability to restrict access to a speciﬁc set

    of users present at home or in an ofﬁce environment.

    High-frequency spectrum (THz) exploration is being pursued with the

    goal of achieving data rates of one terabyte per second (TB/s).

    In addition to the wireless communication that earlier generations of-

    fered, this generation adds computing, control, localization, and sensing.

    Supports various new applications.

    eMBMS

    Video compression methods and new technologies targeted to video

    applications beneﬁt from the eMBMS bearer. MIMO technology is used

    streaming.

    Network Slicing

    Enables superior ﬂexibility, scalability, and specialization capacity for the

    provision of novel and specialized services. It simpliﬁes the process of

    updating and patching the program.

    Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    The use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is proposed to enable self-sustaining

    wireless networks, providing a distributed (AI) architecture for model

    training in which each participating device learns the model locally and

    then communicates the updated model rather than the data. This ad-

    dresses issues such as privacy leakage, huge overheads, etc.

    Blockchain

    Numerous beneﬁts of immutability, disintermediation, audibility, and

    non-repudiation are provided by blockchain technology, which enables

    decentralized and distributed management of a cryptographically se-

    cure digital ledger. Secure spectrum, resource, mobility, and interference

    management capabilities.

    RIS

    Smart reﬂecting surfaces that can act as walls, roadways, doors, and

    entire buildings. RIS aids in maintaining a line of sight and obtaining a

    high-quality signal with less noise and interference from other users.

    Extended Radio

    6G is intended to integrate space–air–ground–sea mode, enabling wireless

    communication in planes, UAVs, and other applications.

    mURLLC

    Provide extremely low latency. Ultra-high reliability, high availability,

    massive connectivity, and scalability.

    6. Applications Depending Heavily on 6G

    A summary of the applications is given in Table 5 and Figure 9. The ﬁgure summarizes

    the key m-health applications that belong to 6G and will become a reality with
    the deploy-

    ment of the 6G communication systems. The table is intended to serve as a guide
    for the

    applications that will be discussed in this section. The brief descriptions are
    highlighted in

    order to provide the reader with a foundational understanding of the applications,
    which

    will be further developed as the section unfolds.

    Description

    AR/VR and Holograph communications

    Human communication via holograms (3D pictures

    in thin air) to enhance remote communication. Holo-

    graphic communication is hampered by latency and

    excessive bandwidth, but 6G will overcome them.

    Perceptual AR/VR, URLLC and eMBB in 6G will en-

    able perceptual aspects. A great candidate for better

    remote healthcare applications.

    teractions.

    Wireless Brain-Computer Interactions

    The brain–computer interface (BCI) facilitates com-

    munication between the brain and electronic equip-

    ment. High reliability, ultra-low latency, and a large

    data ﬂow are required for this.

    Intelligent Ambulance Service

    Remotely control automobiles. These autos are also

    called semi-autonomous. Semi-autonomous vehi-

    cles require a reliable, low-latency wireless network.

    A method employing 6G-based URLLC to facilitate

    connected ambulances in future healthcare by en-

    abling real-time video streaming with high color

    resolution for trustworthy diagnosis.

    Remote Health Monitoring

    The combination of mURLLC and THz communica-

    tions provides a solution for remote health monitor-

    ing that allows for exceptionally low-latency data

    transmission and network connections between

    wearables and distant clinicians.

    Telesurgery

    A more comprehensive approach incorporating un-

    manned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and blockchain inte-

    gration, which may provide both rapid and secure

    features for surgical processes, is being developed.

    WBAN/IoBNT and Molecular Communications

    A network of biological nanoparticles (nanoma-

    chines). Mostly used in healthcare. The 6G tech-

    nology is proposed to meet loBNT’s perceptual

    6.1. Holographic Communications, Augmented and Virtual Reality

    Overall, 6G will create new opportunities for many m-health applications, such
    as

    providing 3D services using holographic communication, which will revolutionize
    smart

    healthcare systems, especially telesurgery. Doctors will be able to diagnose patients
    re-

    motely using holographic communication, which will reduce the ﬁnancial and physical

    burden placed upon them by the medical system [107]. For improved diagnosis, augmented

    reality and holographic communication can be integrated. The primary goal of VR/AR
    in

    healthcare is to enable the transmission of high-resolution multimedia (video,
    audio, and

    voice) [124,125]. One of the drawbacks of 5G-enabled VR/AR in healthcare for multimedia

    transmission is the lack of a real-time platform for end-users [55]. AR enables
    viewing of

    the inside of a patient’s body, where doctors can adjust the depth of a speciﬁc
    body area and

    can be expanded to improve visibility. It will be extremely beneﬁcial while doing
    difﬁcult

    procedures/surgeries that involve a signiﬁcant degree of risk.

    Overall, 6G will enable the creation of a smooth and high-resolution display for
    remote

    medical education or diagnostics [126]. Combining AI and 6G approaches also enables

    seamless 360-degree video streaming at edge nodes with high packet delivery, seamless

    connectivity, interoperability, and convergence. The 6G network has traditionally
    favored

    highly interactive and unique video-coding techniques that enable the distribution
    of

    360-degree on-demand and live video at a quicker rate via edge devices, which
    is critical

    for VR/AR-enabled healthcare applications. Due to the rapid adoption of mobile
    edge

    computing and edge caching technologies and trends, 6G ensures that latency and
    load

    at the backhaul are distributed equally across end-users, whereas 5G does not
    [127]. To

    deliver these videos or holograms, current 5G KPIs such as data rate, bandwidth,
    and

    dependability become insigniﬁcant [128]. These services must be able to reproduce
    real

    experiences to the user; hence, QoE is of high importance. Overall, 6G guarantees
    high

    QoE, proving itself to be the best technology for hologram/AR/VR applications
    [129].

    6.2. Five Sense Communications and Tactile Internet

    It is anticipated that 6G will be capable of supporting a 5D communication system

    with ﬁve senses, namely, sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste [130]. Additionally,
    6G

    demands an exceedingly high data throughput while also having incredibly low latency.

    Furthermore, the sensors must be capable of reproducing the ﬁve senses from faraway

    locations to give users a realistic experience, and as a result, 6G is primarily
    concerned

    with the QoE [108]. Another feature that is projected to be available on 6G networks
    is

    the tactile internet, which will enhance the user experience by including factors
    such as

    weight, temperature, and speed [131]. Tactile internetworking will also combine
    a sense

    of touch or taste with audio, video, or other responses. Such considerations are
    critical in

    various situations when the need for prompt remote control is required. Remote
    surgery,

    manufacturing, and navigation are examples of such applications. It is a good
    example of

    service enhancements that encourage the usage of high-precision networking [9].

    The 6G networks will allow real-time data transfer, control, and feedback via
    touch.

    Using this method, one can simultaneously convey touch, sensations (sense), and
    informa-

    tion, allowing for a more interactive experience. In a smart healthcare system
    where an

    injured patient may only convey emotions through visualization, a smart headband
    can

    reconstruct brain impulses and display them as a 3D video of the patient’s imagination,

    which the caregiver may see in real-time using mobile networks. Furthermore, a
    group of

    people who do not speak the same language can communicate using their imaginations,

    and disabled people can utilize haptic communication to open doors or control
    gadgets.

    These haptic communication methods will allow them to express information through

    touch. It is one of the expected use cases for 6G networks, in which the network
    can sustain

    substantially higher data rates than 5G can.

    QoE has been extensively investigated and considered an important aspect of mul-

    timedia (engaging more than three human senses) [132]. Tactile internet communication

    may demand strict latency requirements, reliability, and user experience, which
    can be

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    28 of 43

    provided by 6G mURLLC to render an immersive, synchronized effect to the human
    senses.

    The 6G-driven communication architecture, consisting of a Radio Access Network
    and a

    Core Network, satisﬁes the fundamental requirements for realizing the 6G-enabled
    Tactile

    Internet [29]. The following are the essential tasks of the 6G RAN in the Tactile
    Internet

    ecosystem to achieve this goal: (i) radio access technologies (RATs) such as mmWave,

    massive MIMO, and full-duplex; (ii) tactile QoE/QoS for tactile applications (iii)
    efﬁcient

    packet delivery via reliable radio protocols and the physical layer; and (iv)
    novel medium

    access control (MAC) techniques that optimally control air-interface conﬂicts.
    The follow-

    ing are the primary functions of the 6G CN linked with the tactile internet: (i)
    dynamic

    provisioning of QoS; (ii) edge-cloud access; and (iii) security.

    6.3. Wireless Brain-Computer Interactions (BCI)

    Brain–computer interactions are another form of haptic communication in which

    humans interact with their environment via haptics and control it using digital
    gadgets

    such as brain-embedded wireless chips that respond to human emotions [35,133,134].

    Traditionally, BCI applications were limited to those healthcare scenarios in
    which humans

    use brain implants to operate prosthetic limbs or nearby computing devices. The
    recent

    applications of wireless BCI and implants will revolutionize this industry and
    provide

    new use-case scenarios that necessitate 6G connectivity. Individuals will interact
    with their

    surroundings and other people utilizing discrete devices, some worn, some implanted,
    and

    others embedded in the world around them, employing wireless BCI technologies
    instead

    of cellphones.

    The nervous system processes the data from the sensor system, which comprises

    receptors, neurons, etc. The format for comprehending is based on 6G wireless
    technology

    with a form of wireless biosignal processor that receives brain signals from computer

    equipment [135]. Following that, it analyzes, controls, and transforms these signals
    into

    electronic instructions that will be processed to determine the level of attention,
    locate the

    attention, and calculate the time required to complete the desired task, among
    others [35,41].

    The BCI is a process for controlling the items we use daily in our smart home
    to transform

    into a smart society, and these things are all related to the m-health systems
    [136]. Compared

    to 5G, wireless BCI services necessitate fundamentally different performance metrics,

    including guaranteed Quality of Physical Experience (QoPE), which incorporates
    QoS,

    QoE, and human perceptions. Wireless BCI services also require high speeds, ultra-low

    latency, and great reliability, making 6G the ﬁrst to enable a new class of applications
    that

    leverage several human cognitive senses. When considering future spectrum demands,
    BCI

    is expected to be one of many applications supported by future wireless networks
    [137].

    6.4. Intelligent Ambulance Services

    Overall, 6G is intended to produce self-driven, steering-less, completely AI-driven

    automobiles [138]. As a result of 6G’s capacity to communicate in real-time, the
    automobiles

    will monitor passenger health, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.
    In

    an emergency, intelligent automobiles will transform into intelligent ambulances.
    It is

    achieved by remote doctors employing mix-virtual reality/holograph communication
    over

    6G. In smart ambulances, real-time medical imaging data transfer demands high
    data rates,

    which ﬁeld hospitals often lack due to restricted or nonexistent network connectivity.

    Communication between intelligent ambulances with medical equipment and hospital

    workers requires exceptionally low latency [139]. Autonomous ambulances and teleoper-

    ated vehicles can also beneﬁt from edge intelligence supporting wide coverage
    to improve

    mobility [140]. A relatively recent concept called joint radar communication (JRC)
    can

    be used to enable reliable sensing, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication
    in

    smart ambulances [141]. Furthermore, REM- and AI-assisted cognitive radios can
    solve

    handover concerns (delay, jitter) due to patient mobility with implanted medical
    devices.

    Additionally, 6G-based URLLC can be used to enable connected ambulances in future

    healthcare by allowing physicians and paramedical staff from the hospital to broadcast

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    29 of 43

    real-time video with high color resolution for reliable diagnosis at reasonably
    fast speeds

    (up to 100 km/h) [142]. For example, EEG and ECG data from clinical examinations
    can be

    collected aboard, and hospital doctors can deliver urgent indications to paramedical
    staff in

    the ambulance via URLLC-based real-time teleconsultation. In this case, an extremely
    short

    survival time (less than two milliseconds) must be guaranteed, despite the ambulance’s

    fast speed. By leveraging the beneﬁts of 6G networks and AI, the trafﬁc control
    system can

    investigate and assess the road trafﬁc load, topology, and accidents in real time,
    facilitating

    the intelligent ambulance services [143].

    6.5. Remote Health Monitoring of Patients

    Transmission of patient vital signs is an important part of m-health applications,

    and the amount and frequency of information that is transmitted are dependent
    on the

    patient’s needs. The 5G services are inadequate to meet the evolving healthcare
    technology,

    and remote healthcare privacy and security [139]. The 6G integration will revolutionize

    m-health technologies such as mURLLC, and THz communications could support ultra-low-

    latency healthcare data transmission and speed up medical network connections
    between

    wearables and remote doctors [144]. Healthcare domains such as remote health monitoring

    necessitate low-latency communications (below 1 ms) with a reliability requirement
    of

    greater than 99.999 percent to achieve near-real-time health provision with a
    fast and

    reliable remote diagnosis.

    An aging population is driving the development of novel healthcare provisions
    that

    move away from the traditional hospital-based system. These patients can be observed

    in their homes remotely using 6G technology by identifying critical events, such
    as the

    freezing of one’s gait and wandering behavior. The IW would make it possible to
    monitor

    patients hidden behind large objects [116]. Furthermore, the placement of IW at
    specific

    locations throughout the house would direct the beams so that signals could reach
    the

    patient-monitoring equipment. In addition to generating multiple beams [145],
    the IW will

    be useful for monitoring multiple patients in a nursing home. The monitoring devices

    would typically relay back patient data to a hospital network server with the
    assistance of

    the IW.

    Continuous health monitoring is critical in healthcare, especially for patients
    with

    sudden diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases). In this system, the sensors transmit
    the

    measurements (based on patient-speciﬁc thresholds, timing and frequency as speciﬁed
    by

    a healthcare provider) via a signal processing module that further transmits to
    different

    network destinations such as hospital servers, emergency stations, remote clinicians,
    and

    others. The 6G-based healthcare systems will pre-upload data-driven models that
    can

    detect abnormal health statuses. Noninvasive sensors can continuously collect
    patient

    physiological data and send it to the cloud. The cloud models will analyze the
    data and

    send an alert if sudden diseases occur. The 6G technology will be critical for
    real-time

    monitoring and disease notiﬁcation. It will also spur the development of hospital-to-home

    (H2H) services to replace ambulances [107].

    6G networks will allow for large amounts of data to be transmitted at a faster
    rate,

    allowing for network-assisted consultations with specialists. Overall, 6G will
    encourage the

    development of these smart medical services [146] and provide a strong enough
    network to

    respond on time [147]. Health-monitoring technology has the potential to reduce
    the need

    for patients to see their doctors in person [14]. Instead, the practitioner could
    conduct a

    teleconsultation via video conferencing, with the necessary medical data shared
    via remote

    monitoring systems.

    6.6. Telesurgery

    The advent of 6G networks will be a game-changer because it will reduce space
    and

    time constraints [148]. Critical applications such as remote surgeries are extremely
    sensitive,

    requiring a latency of less than one millisecond (nearly 0.1 ms) [149]. Remote
    robotic

    surgeries will necessitate extremely high data precision and reliability and a
    high data

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    30 of 43

    rate for data exchange and control signals between two remote healthcare facilities
    via the

    mobile network. Overall, 6G will be the most suitable candidate to meet these
    requirements

    because its vision is to provide at least 99.99999% data reliability and a 1 Tbps
    data rate.

    The latency requirements are the primary concern in the case of remote surgeries.
    Unlike

    previous generations of networks, the 6G should aim for both minimum and maximum

    latency requirements. During remote surgery, some aspects of the transmitted data
    must

    arrive at the destination within a speciﬁed maximum latency, while others must
    arrive

    within a speciﬁed minimum latency. The combination of these minimum and maximum

    latencies will result in coherent data at the receiver, which is a critical requirement
    for

    remote surgery [148]. Recently, a telesurgery system based on UAVs and blockchain
    was

    investigated in [150] in the context of 6G. The blockchain is integrated into
    the robotic

    system because of the security risks in existing mobile surgery networks. Each
    robot acts as

    a data node, allowing surgical data to be securely stored in the database ledger
    without

    needing centralized authority. Smart contracts, in particular, are being used
    to provide

    automatic authentication for health data requests and control over health data
    sharing

    during surgery [103].

    Meanwhile, using the THz bands in 6G-based healthcare networks, the mURLLC

    technology is ideal for meeting future requirements in terms of ultra-high data
    rates of

    medical data communications [151]. mURLLC is especially important in hospital-based

    telemedicine, where doctors can remotely monitor and manage surgery procedures
    using

    real-time video streaming from medical robotics and assistant devices connected
    by 6G core

    networks [28]. Computer-assisted operating room simulations in VR are highly beneﬁcial

    for both educational and clinical settings [14]. Using multimedia components to
    create

    real-time surgical procedure simulations in a controlled and realistic setting
    (i.e., a virtual

    theater) allows the operating surgeon to perform preoperative planning and practice,

    surgical education, and training. Where the surgeon’s technical skills often determine
    the

    surgical outcomes, such systems have proven useful. In particular, VR/AR for surgical

    planning and education has the potential for medical home applications (i.e.,
    virtual

    simulations aimed at increasing the emotional comfort of older and disabled patients

    at home).

    6.7. Wireless Body Area Networks and Molecular Communication

    Human Bond Communication (HBC) is the ability to integrate all ﬁve sensory features

    of humans. In humans, information is exchanged through biochemical and physical
    pro-

    cesses that involve the synthesis, transformation, emission, propagation, and
    reception

    of molecules. This information exchange is referred to as molecular communication
    in

    telecommunication engineering [152]. With the advent of NanoThings, molecular
    com-

    munication has emerged as one of the most important research areas for revolutionizing

    Medical-IoT [153].

    Advanced nanotechnology has the potential to enable the manufacture of nanodevices

    such as nanorobots, implantable chips, and biosensors with critical applications
    in ﬁelds

    such as nanoscale sensing and biomedicine [154,155]. The application of nanotechnology
    in

    biomedicine, in particular, has generated interest due to its potential to perform
    tasks such

    as intelligent drug distribution through blood vessels and monitoring of body
    organs, both

    of which can signiﬁcantly improve human healthcare outcomes. Connecting nanodevices

    to the internet or forming networks (i.e., the Internet of Nano-Things) enables
    effective

    communication and information transmission. In biomedicine, the Internet of Bio-Nano-

    Things (IoBNT) enables the connection of nanodevices and biological entities.
    In the

    IoT, molecular communication enables the IoBNT by allowing biological molecules
    to

    communicate and transport information between nanodevices [154]. Additionally,
    when

    the IoBNT is combined with body area networks, which are short-range wireless
    networks

    comprised of wearable monitoring devices/sensors and sensing devices embedded
    in or

    on the body, comprehensive solutions for healthcare enhancements can be provided.

    7. Challenges

    Several challenges are associated with m-health multimedia data.Despite recent
    efforts

    to address QoE control and management difﬁculties and the rapid evolution of cellular

    communication systems, there are still signiﬁcant gaps in certain areas that require
    extensive

    research and investigation [45]. To address the provisioning of QoE to end users,
    additional

    research on multimedia m-health services should be conducted in the following
    critical

    areas that have received little attention in the past:

    7.1. Spectrum Management for the m-Health Multimedia Applications

    In future wireless networks, meeting the demands of formidable and diversiﬁed

    6G use cases involves high resource efﬁciency and more ﬂexibility and scalability
    [156].

    Resource expansion is critical as the networks are expected to go beyond their
    statistically

    assigned resources and take advantage of available resources based on spatial
    and temporal

    constraints. With new services and applications such as 3D holographic image and
    presence,

    5D communications, smart clothes and wearables, and completely autonomous vehicles,

    6G will take resource challenges to the next level [41]. Furthermore, as predicted
    by

    ITU-R, connectivity would reach an extreme level by 2030 [157], with nearly 120
    billion

    subscriptions, including M2M subscriptions, and exponentially growing trafﬁc [158].

    Managing 6G spectrum resources and interference issues demands updated spectrum

    management technology and appropriate sharing policies [159]. Effective management
    is

    critical for optimal resource utilization with high QoS and QoE. The 6G radio
    must be agile

    and adaptive beyond the 5G NR deﬁnition. It must be capable of utilizing multiple
    channel

    bandwidths across a wide spectrum, supporting cell-free communications, implementing

    ultra-massive MIMO, and operating on a discontinuous spectrum [35]. The requisite

    ﬂexibility can also be achieved by integrating network softwarization and network
    slicing

    more deeply into core and transport networks. Additionally, the stringent operational

    settings, ranging from ultra-reliable and low-latency scenarios to massive connectivity,

    necessitate a considerably more ﬂexible radio capable of spectrum sharing [36].
    In that

    context, capacity expansion via adaptive strategies such as spectrum sharing is
    critical in

    serving applications envisioned by the 6G ecosystem [160]. There are many survey
    articles

    about CRNs in the literature; however, most of them overlook the rigorous requirements

    of multimedia communications. Those considering multimedia transmission over CRNs

    failed to address the difﬁculties of QoS/QoE provisioning [161].

    Building a viable solution for dynamic spectrum allocation is a major issue in
    CRNs. A

    simpliﬁed QoS uniform assumption for spectrum assignment must be explored to solve
    this

    problem. The explicit QoS needs of Secondary Users (SUs) for various m-health
    multimedia

    services must also be considered; otherwise, SUs will continually hand off to
    other channels

    in search of the best available channel, resulting in quality degradation. As
    a result,

    providing QoS and QoE for multimedia transmission over CRNs poses signiﬁcant issues.

    7.2. Standardizing QoE Mapping to Network Performance Indicators

    Despite the numerous research initiatives and remarkable progress made in recent

    years, m-health multimedia communication still has a number of unresolved concerns
    that

    need to be addressed. In the m-health services and IoT applications, user satisfaction
    with

    multimedia content is measured using subjective QoE indicators. In recent studies
    on QoE

    evaluation for multimedia applications, packet loss, MOS, DMOS, and user satisfaction
    are

    the key QoE indicators used. For M-IoT evaluation, other QoE indicators such as
    buffering

    time, data rate, interruption time, and failure rate should be employed [162].
    Jitter, end-to-

    end delay, bit error rate, and frame loss are the most commonly used network performance

    measures (QoS metrics) in M-IoT research. To improve multimedia quality and network

    services, both QoS and QoE measurements should be examined together [163].

    QoE management in 6G-enabled m-health will be a difﬁcult task, as QoE is expected

    to be maintained competently and autonomously for each patient and the accompanying

    needed service. As a result, a data-driven architecture for individualized QoE
    management

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    32 of 43

    in the next-generation healthcare network has been suggested. The suggested architecture

    must meet some requirements to capture the user’s subjective characteristics.
    A deﬁnable

    cognitive computing capability must be built into the architecture, and the design
    should be

    based on a data-driven model that can predict customer demand. To maintain a satisfying

    QoE, the architecture must efﬁciently manage communication resources based on
    the QoS

    requirements, and the expected user-centric service [164].

    7.3. The Role of Contextual and Device Information in QoE

    Context awareness was initially studied in the context of pervasive computing,
    in

    which relevant information about the user and its environment, such as location,
    user

    identiﬁcation, etc., was obtained and used by the computing system to adapt accordingly.

    Numerous context-aware approaches for optimizing cellular network operations,
    including

    radio resource management, mobility management, and congestion control, have been
    de-

    veloped. Current RAN architectures are often optimized for a single RAT, which
    frequently

    under-utilizes available heterogeneous resources. Additionally, such an architecture
    cannot

    ensure consistent QoE for users traveling between various RANs. Context awareness

    becomes critical in these situations, allowing for more precise and intelligent
    adminis-

    tration. The 6G network must be planned to be entirely context-aware. The network

    must constantly be aware of all devices in its environment and their capabilities.
    Various

    open difﬁculties are associated with achieving total context awareness and administering

    such a system efﬁciently. Several critical issues in this area include: managing
    conﬂicting

    changes in a system caused by multiple applications or network functions based
    on the

    same context, monitoring and collecting context information without overwhelming
    the

    core network’s operation, and maintaining the acquired context’s recentness by
    aligning

    the temporal scales of monitored information [44]. The context-aware quantized
    QoE

    model improves user experience while ensuring resource efﬁciency, while the invalid
    action

    masking approach reduces invalid RATs to accelerate convergence [164].

    In recent years, video quality assessment studies have focused on incorporating
    the

    context awareness of the application in order to assess video quality. Context
    awareness

    includes considering factors such as the video content, video characteristics
    such as frame

    resolution, frame rate, etc., the delivery mechanism, the application in which
    it is used, the

    end user’s requirements, the devices on which the videos are streamed, etc. In
    medical

    video streaming, it is particularly important to consider the context of the system.
    This

    is because the quality of the video in m-health applications should not just be
    of good

    visual quality, but also retain its quality so that the video is suitable for
    diagnosis. Here,

    context can be deﬁned as any information that aids in determining a user’s QoE.
    There are

    two types of context: static and dynamic [64]. Dynamic context evolves over time
    and is

    difﬁcult to predict, but static context does not change frequently. The user’s
    application

    choices, security needs, and cost are all examples of the static context. The
    context in

    real-world settings can be highly dynamic and stochastic, i.e., it can change
    rapidly and is

    uncertain and imperfect; have a variety of temporal characteristics; have several
    alternative

    representations, interconnected or distributed; and it may not be available at
    any given

    time. Context gathering and processing should be done as soon as possible because
    it can

    lose its correctness. User position, velocity, network load, battery power, memory/CPU

    utilization, presence, and signal-to-noise ratio are all examples of dynamic context.
    QoE

    can be considered as a function of contextual factors (represented as a vector).

    Measurement and prediction of QoE might include a vast parameter space with

    multiple context attributes and QoE parameters. Different context attributes may
    inﬂuence

    different QoE parameters. The QoE parameters can also interact with one another.
    As

    a result, choosing important context traits and QoE parameters and establishing
    links

    between them can be difﬁcult. These connections are frequently non-linear and
    difﬁcult to

    quantify. This needs the creation of unique QoE modeling methodologies that can
    effectively

    model various context features and QoE parameters. The new QoE models should be

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    33 of 43

    more than just conceptual; they should also address the issues of QoE measurement

    and prediction.

    7.4. Inﬂuence Factors (IF)

    In general, the m-QoE perceived in m-health systems is inﬂuenced by the system,
    the

    context and human Inﬂuence Factors (IFs), and these need to be taken into account
    during

    the design stage [9,165]. The ﬁrst refers to what can be called the user’s demographic

    composite. These factors include an individual’s age, gender, culture, personality,
    mood,

    and interests. Clearly, these are not static effects and are subject to change
    throughout time

    and space. Context modiﬁes human IFs by incorporating information about the user’s

    location, surroundings, time, activity, co-occupants of shared space, technical
    afﬂuence, and

    economic capabilities. Finally, system IFs are concerned with the content, the
    conﬁguration

    of the media, the network condition, and the device (or gear). A detailed understanding
    of

    the IFs and their impact on the QoE of a speciﬁc service is a key requirement
    for successful

    QoE management with the overall goal of optimizing end-user QoE while utilizing
    network

    resources efﬁciently and retaining a contented user base. It is required to identify
    and

    comprehend many inﬂuence factors (IFs) and perceptual dimensions from the perspective

    of various players in the service delivery chain in order to ascertain their impact
    on QoE.

    This is a necessary precondition for QoE management since it establishes the parameters
    to

    be monitored, assessed and ultimately utilized to develop, test, and apply QoE
    control and

    optimization techniques.

    Because QoE is a relatively new term, content providers, service and network providers,

    as well as academics are confronted with new issues in delivering, evaluating,
    and control-

    ling QoE. Then, a preliminary step would be to investigate and analyze the QoE-inﬂuencing

    parameters (IFs) [25]. Due to the subjective nature of the QoE, it is difﬁcult
    to predict. Thus,

    prior to evaluating the overall service quality, it is necessary to ascertain
    the aspects that

    inﬂuence users’ perceptions [26].

    7.5. Mobility Management

    Mobility management in 6G will be complicated as the networks will be extremely

    heterogeneous, multi-layer, large-dimensional, and dynamic [80]. To provide a
    positive

    user experience, optimize resource utilization, and reduce network signaling overhead,
    in-

    telligent mobility management is critical. It can be accomplished by learning
    and predicting

    user movement and optimizing handover settings. Numerous academics have attempted

    to understand and predict user mobility behavior using machine learning approaches.
    For

    example, in [28], the back-propagation NN is used to forecast the next cell a
    user will move

    towards by learning the user’s mobility model and then predicting the next cell.
    Addition-

    ally, the optimization of handover (HO) parameters is a critical problem for 6G
    networks,

    as it can affect various factors, including coverage capacity, energy usage, interference,
    and

    user experience. As a result, various works utilizing machine learning have been
    devoted

    to the subject.

    The 6G networks plan to support high speeds to counter mobility, but this will
    necessi-

    tate regular handovers. Additional service needs, such as high data ﬂow, high
    dependability,

    and low latency, may complicate efﬁcient changeover [44]. When a mobile device
    requests

    video content, it is often issued from servers and subsequently traverses the
    mobile carrier’s

    CN and RAN. Many concurrent streams would create enormous demand on the backhaul

    side. Additionally, the unpredictable characteristics of the wireless channel
    (e.g., fading,

    multi-user interface, peak trafﬁc loads, etc.) may pose a challenge for monitoring
    user QoE

    by imposing additional stress on the cellular network. Nonetheless, distributing
    streaming

    content is a challenge, as the link between servers hosting the needed information
    and

    consumers can introduce delays in data transfer, impairing the user experience.
    By bringing

    content closer to the consumer via caching, numerous hurdles such as network load
    and

    latency can be addressed, resulting in an improved QoE [45].

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    Handover decisions should be made carefully in these HetNets environments to

    guarantee that video applications meet their criteria for low packet loss and
    delay, as well

    as QoE support [166]. For example, a user traveling in a vehicle may pass through
    multiple

    geographical areas in a short period of time, necessitating repeated handovers
    in order to

    retain connectivity with the video service provider [167]. Thus, independent of
    the network

    circumstances and characteristics or the user’s mobility, the handover must occur
    without

    compromising the QoE, i.e., a video devoid of ghost effects, pixelization, or
    screen freezing.

    Handover methods in HetNets use radio (e.g., signal strength) or QoS context factors

    as a key metric for handover decisions. However, considering it alone or in combination

    with QoS is inefﬁcient for mobile multimedia. Determining, controlling, and improving

    the quality of multimedia applications is not limited to QoS techniques. Handovers
    in

    heterogeneous networks should address subjective characteristics of video content,
    such as

    user perception and pleasure. QoE must be quantiﬁed and integrated into decision-making

    to improve handover decisions while meeting mobile user video service requirements.

    The current HetNets must adopt QoE-centric methodologies. Cognitive radio (CR)
    is a

    prospective candidate technology for enabling HetNets. HetNets based on CR can
    give

    better-suited QoE for multimedia applications that require a lot more bandwidth
    [161].

    8. Conclusions and Future Works

    The vision for the 6G network indicates that it will vastly surpass the 5G network
    in

    terms of meeting the high requirements of future use cases such as telehealthcare,
    aug-

    mented/virtual reality, and haptic internet. With customer demand for video services

    increasing, QoE is critical for service providers and network operators. This
    paper aims

    to draw attention to the complex elements of QoE in 6G networks and the limitations
    of

    current deﬁnitions in the context of m-health applications. We identiﬁed some
    interesting

    technologies in 6G networks that will signiﬁcantly impact the healthcare business
    and

    improve the QoE for m-health applications. We provide an in-depth description
    of artiﬁcial

    intelligence, intelligent reﬂecting surfaces, THz communications, blockchain,
    and extended

    radio, among other technologies, and how they will revolutionize m-health. We
    covered

    numerous healthcare applications that require 6G networks to deliver extreme data
    speeds,

    ultra-low latency, extreme dependability and availability, vast scalability, extreme
    power ef-

    ﬁciency, and extreme mobility. In the end, we explore the difﬁculties that 6G
    will encounter

    while implementing new healthcare applications.

    In addition to the aforementioned aspects, it is crucial to address the existing
    gaps in

    medical data transmission within the context of 6G networks. While extensive research
    has

    been conducted in this area, the absence of a standardized format universally
    compatible

    with other wireless devices poses a signiﬁcant challenge. Future telemedicine
    designs

    should prioritize the resolution of concerns pertaining to scheduling mechanisms,
    data

    security, privacy considerations, and the adoption of advanced compression techniques

    for medical video streaming. Furthermore, the design of wearable medical devices
    must

    carefully consider factors such as energy efﬁciency, radiation absorption rates
    from wireless

    sensors, and the provision of adequate skin protection, ensuring the safety and
    well-

    being of users. By addressing these critical issues, the implementation of 6G
    networks in

    healthcare applications can be further optimized to enhance the quality of experience
    for

    m-health services.

    \ technologies such as ZigBee, WiFi, 6LowPAN, RFID,\nMachine-to-Machine, LTE-Advanced,\
    \ etc. depend on the license-free Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\n(ISM) bands\
    \ for the Internet. The proliferation of IoT devices is not only anticipated to\
    \ create a\nhuge amount of congestion in the near future, but even now the unlicensed\
    \ spectrum is not enough\nin the ISM bands. Towards this end, Cognitive Radio\
    \ (CR) technology can resolve the spectrum\nshortage issue since CR users can\
    \ opportunistically exploit white spaces in licensed channels of\nthe adjacent\
    \ wireless systems. In CR networks, it is critical to coordinate spectrum access\
    \ among\nSecondary Users (SUs) while protecting priority rights of Primary Users\
    \ (PUs). Therein, SUs need to\ntake good care of hidden PUs in order to avoid\
    \ harmful interference. Further, a densely deployed\nCR network can compromise\
    \ spectrum sensing quality and certainty of the results when a large\nnumber of\
    \ SUs contends to access the same channel. Therefore, based on the vulnerable\
    \ sensing\nresults, SUs can cause interference to the PUs. In this paper, we ﬁrst\
    \ investigate the leading issues\nand then propose a novel Handshake Sense Multiple\
    \ Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA)\nprotocol for CR-based IoT networks.\
    \ Our proposed HSMA/CA scheme resolves hidden primary\nterminal problem and maintains\
    \ sufﬁcient priority rights to PUs in a densely distributed network.\nIn addition,\
    \ we optimize the spectrum sensing period to maximize the system performance by\n\
    maintaining peculiarities in the sensing operation like false alarm and misdetection.\
    \ To evaluate\nthe performance of HSMA/CA, we have analyzed the protocol through\
    \ the Markov chain model in\nterms of throughput and verify its accuracy by simulations.\
    \ Simulation results show that our scheme\nis suitable for non-collaborative densely\
    \ deployed CR-based IoT networks.\nKeywords: carrier sensing; CSMA/CA; dynamic\
    \ spectrum access; IoT; spectrum sensing\n1. Introduction\nFor the recent decades,\
    \ Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has been sharply propelling into\nour daily\

    2 of 21\nIn one report, Cisco anticipates that the Internet-connected devices\
    \ will be 2.7% of the worldwide\nphysical objects by 2020, which is more than\
    \ that of 80% in 2012 [2]. From another recent report [3],\nwe have calculated\
    \ based on the United Nation world population prospects [4], that each person\
    \ will\nhave at least nine devices on the Internet in 2025, as shown in Figure\
    \ 1. On one hand, the leap in IoT\ngrowth can liberate humans from the old and\
    \ dump devices, while it requires enabling protocols and\nmore spectrum on the\
    \ other. Worse still, the available spectrum is scarce; especially in the Industrial,\n\
    Scientiﬁc, and Medical Bands (ISM). However, most of the IoT technologies (e.g.,\
    \ Bluetooth Low\nEnergy, WiFi, 6LoWPAN, ZigBee, etc.) depend on ISM bands that\
    \ are not really sufﬁcient to their needs\nfor spectrum.\nCognitive Radio (CR)\
    \ is considered as a cornerstone technology to resolve the spectrum shortage\n\
    issue through the dynamic spectrum allocation [5–7]. In CR networks, allocated\
    \ frequencies are often\nused by the Primary Users (PUs), which have higher priority\
    \ rights of spectrum use. Conversely,\nthe Secondary Users (SUs) do not have a\
    \ spectrum license, but they can dynamically occupy the\nunused frequencies (or\
    \ white spaces) in the absence of PUs [8,9]. However, the CR system may not\n\
    have the freedom to operate at the similar transmission parameters across the\
    \ existing spectrum bands\nin order to avoid interference to the PUs [10]. Further,\
    \ a CR system should accurately detect white\nspaces without generating a level\
    \ of harmful interference, which is what is not acceptable to the PUs.\nUnfortunately,\
    \ this is not always true because the accuracy of energy detector equipped with\
    \ the\nCR system for spectrum sensing is not perfect due to inevitable inefﬁciencies\
    \ like the false alarm\nand misdetection [11,12]. The spectrum assignment through\
    \ dynamic access is, therefore, not trivial\nsince the radio transmissions can\
    \ interfere with each other unless separated enough in time, space or\nfrequency.\
    \ The dynamic spectrum access can be more aggressive as a channel can be used\
    \ by multiple\nusers simultaneously if only the channel satisﬁes a predeﬁned quality\
    \ condition. This situation will get\nworse if IoT-enabled SUs are densely deployed\
    \ to act as competitors. Hence, the dynamic spectrum\nleasing, e.g., in [13,14],\
    \ can increase the transmission power density and subsequently the interference\n\
    level [15]. We need to consider the leaked powers from the adjacent SUs to the\
    \ PU receivers especially\nin the decentralized networks due to hidden primary\
    \ terminal problem [16–18].\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\

    \ to the Internet.\nIn the existing literature, purpose-built Medium Access Control\
    \ (MAC) protocols for CR-based IoT\nnetworks have not been studied directly. However,\
    \ there exist several MAC protocols for CR networks\nas in [19–23], which always\
    \ consider a dedicated Common Control Channel (CCC) to schedule the\nSUs’ transmissions\
    \ in a sequential way. In [19], the authors proposed an opportunistic MAC protocol\n\
    that relies on an exclusive CCC for each frame. In this protocol, the channel\
    \ time is divided into two\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n3 of 21\nvirtual segments named\
    \ as report and negotiation phases. First, SUs report the sensing information\n\
    of the available channels in the report phase. Then, in the negotiation phase,\
    \ they compete to win\nthe access opportunity for the next frame using a p-persistent\
    \ CSMA/CA mechanism. To enable\nthis protocol, each SU necessarily equipped with\
    \ the two transceivers. That is, the one transceiver is\ntuned to the CCC, while\
    \ the other is dedicated to sense and occupy the identiﬁed unused spectrum\nchannels.\
    \ In [22], the OMC-MAC is proposed, in which the CCC time is divided into non-overlapping\n\
    periods called beacon intervals. Therein, each beacon interval consists of three\
    \ phases called sensing,\ncontention, and transmission phases. According to this\
    \ protocol, SUs ﬁrst sense channels in the sensing\nphase, then contend to win\
    \ a transmission opportunity in the contention phase and they ﬁnally follow\n\
    a contention-free process in the transmission phase. However, CCC-based MAC protocols\
    \ are not\nmuch attractive due to denial of service attack, jamming, and single\
    \ point of failure [24–26].\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, few of the\
    \ previous works have considered the random\naccess model that does not require\
    \ an exclusive CCC and so it is more suitable for the CR-based IoT\nnetwork. However,\
    \ SUs’ channel access, and PUs’ detection and protection become more challenging\n\
    in the absence of CCC. Furthermore, in distributed CR network the lack of centralized\
    \ control without\nCCC can cause many challenges like the hidden primary terminal\
    \ problem. We can ﬁnd various MAC\nprotocols for distributed CR network that based\
    \ on the random access model, as in [27–34]. In [27],\nthe VX, VAC, and KS schemes\
    \ are proposed, which enable two metrics, to protect the transmission\npriority\
    \ rights of the PUs, named collision probability and overlapping time in a random\
    \ access\nmechanism. In these sachems, collisions between the SUs due to the hidden\
    \ terminal problem are\nnot considered, which are not trivial in the densely deployed\
    \ secondary networks. Furthermore,\nthe assumed scenario of one PU band and one\
    \ SU is too simple, which is in fact an impractical\nassumption. In [29], the\
    \ O-CSMA/CA is proposed, in which the backoff algorithm of the IEEE\n802.11 standard\
    \ is revised to improve fairness and reduce collisions among the SUs. In this\
    \ protocol,\nSUs enable virtual carrier sensing to resolve the classical hidden\
    \ and exposed terminal problems.\nHowever, no mechanism is suggested to resolve\
    \ the hidden primary terminal problem to protect the\nPUs’ transmissions.\nIn\
    \ [31–33], the authors suggested a two-level opportunistic spectrum access strategy\
    \ in CR\nnetworks. In the ﬁrst level, SUs enable spectrum sensing with a given\
    \ probability to detect and protect\nthe PUs. In the second level, they compete\
    \ to access channel with one of the following random access\nmechanisms called\
    \ CR-ALOHA and CR-CSMA protocols. The CR-ALOHA is based on the classical\nSlotted\
    \ ALOHA scheme as that in [35], while the operation of CR-CSMA is inspired by\
    \ the traditional\ncarrier sense multiple access schemes as that in [36]. However,\
    \ the performance of these protocols\nis not very attractive because of the inability\
    \ to avoid packet collisions with nearby SUs. In [34],\nthe CR-CSMA/CA is proposed\
    \ to resolve the hidden primary terminal problem in distributed CR\nnetworks.\
    \ In this scheme, the transmitter sends a control packet, called PTS, to initiate\
    \ the mutual\nspectrum sensing with the receiver. When both the transmitter and\
    \ the receiver conﬁrm all the\nneighboring PUs to be silent, they can transmit\
    \ a data packet following the RTS/CTS handshaking\nprocedure as in the standard\
    \ CSMA/CA [37]. However, this scheme is not much attractive because\nmutual spectrum\
    \ sensing (a relatively long operation) is carried out before the RTS/CTS handshaking\n\
    procedure that can lead to increase the cost of transmission failure. We notice\
    \ that the event of\ntransmission failure is most likely happen in a densely deployed\
    \ network and so it should not\nhave unnecessary overhead to maintain the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system. In our previous works [38–40],\nwe suggest different proposals\
    \ of random access MAC protocols inspired by the CR-CSMA/CA.\nIn [38], the CR-MEGA\
    \ is proposed, which adopts a dual sensing approach by enabling carrier\nsensing\
    \ with spectrum sensing in a sequential way so as to avoid packet collisions with\
    \ the nearby\nSUs and as well as the faraway PUs. This protocol performs well\
    \ even with the highly active PUs due\nto its proactive mechanism. However, the\
    \ advantage is achieved with the increased sensing overhead,\nwhich is what is\
    \ not acceptable in a densely distributed environment. In [39], hybrid-MAC is\
    \ proposed,\nwhich is based on the asynchronous and hybrid spectrum sensing techniques.\
    \ This scheme alternatively\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n4 of 21\nexploits two different\
    \ spectrum sensing approaches, i.e., fast sensing [41] and ﬁne sensing [42],\n\
    in addition to the traditional carrier sensing of CSMA/CA. In [40], the adaptive-MAC\
    \ is proposed,\nwhich is the straightforward extension of the hybrid-MAC. In this\
    \ scheme, a purpose-built algorithm\nin SUs controls the adaptive spectrum sensing\
    \ time, depending on the packet transmission result and\nthe previous activity\
    \ of PUs, in order to maintain a balance between the system throughput and the\n\
    spectrum sensing overhead. However, the performance of both hybrid MAC and adaptive-MAC\
    \ are\nnot very optimistic due to the same reason as that in CR-CSMA/CA protocol.\n\
    In [43], a random access model called Mutual Sense Multiple Access with Collision\
    \ Avoidance\n(MSMA/CA) is proposed, which is based on cognitive radio network\
    \ to efﬁciently utilize the\nbandwidth and spectrum resources in the IoT-enabled\
    \ environment. MSMA/CA enables mutual\nspectrum sensing operation in the midst\
    \ of the two control frames named Notify-To-Sense (NTS)\nand Acknowledge-To-Sense\
    \ (ATS), to avoid the hidden primary terminal problem. The operation of\nMSAM/CA\
    \ is rather smart and agile because it has merged the functionality of classical\
    \ RTS/CTS into\nNTS/ATS frames with the added advantage of spectrum sensing. We\
    \ notice that the long spectrum\nsensing period in the midst of NTS and ATS can\
    \ let the hidden SUs affect the transmission in densely\ndeployed networks. That\
    \ is, with the NTS and ATS frames SUs transmitter and receiver can only stop\n\
    the exposed and hidden SUs, respectively. However, if the gap between the sharing\
    \ of NTS and ATS\nframes is large due to the long spectrum sensing period, then\
    \ hidden SUs can also broadcast the NTS\nframe (followed by the secondary transmitter)\
    \ and hence cause collision over the secondary receiver.\nWe think that this phenomenon\
    \ can severely affect the system performance when SUs are placed in\nclose proximity\
    \ in a super dense environment. It is, therefore, the optimum selection of the\
    \ spectrum\nsensing period especially in the IoT environment is desirable. In\
    \ addition to the spectrum sensing\nperiod, the performance of the energy detector\
    \ is vulnerable by another factor, i.e., spectrum sensing\nthreshold, due to the\
    \ peculiarities of the energy detection sensing model.\nIn this paper, we design\
    \ a novel MAC protocol for densely deployed CR-based IoT networks\nby modifying\
    \ the prevalent CSMA/CA protocol. Our protocol is called Handshake Sense Multiple\n\
    Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA) mechanism since it purposefully features\
    \ the handshake\nbased mutual spectrum sensing in the transmitter and the receiver.\
    \ We tailored the Notify-To-Sense\n(NTS)/Clear-To-Sense (CTS)/Acknowledge-To-Sense\
    \ (ATS) procedure for the data transmission in\nplace of the NTS/ATS operation\
    \ in existing MSMA/CA in order to improve the SUs’ access operation in\na dense\
    \ environment. The NTS/CTS/ATS mechanism ﬁrst enables the handshaking operation\
    \ among\nthe SUs and then conduct the spectrum sensing operation in the transmitter\
    \ and in the receiver to avoid\nthe hidden secondary terminal and hidden primary\
    \ terminal problems simultaneously. Moreover,\nwe incorporate the optimization\
    \ of the spectrum sensing period considering the inefﬁciencies of energy\ndetector\
    \ to improve the performance of the CR-based IoT networks.\nThe key contributions\
    \ of this work are summarized as follows:\n•\nWe propose a new MAC protocol for\
    \ densely deployed CR-based IoT networks that resolves the\nhidden primary terminal\
    \ problem with the minimal possible overhead while effectively dealing\nwith the\
    \ classical hidden (secondary) terminal problem.\n•\nWe develop an optimization\
    \ model to judicially adapt the spectrum sensing period considering\nthe incidences\
    \ of false alarm and misdetection and hidden primary terminal, in order to improve\n\
    the system efﬁciency and reduce the interference to active PUs.\n•\nWe analyze\
    \ the performance of our proposed protocol in terms of normalized throughput\n\
    with the Markov chain model and compare the results with that of existing CR-MEGA\
    \ and\nMSMA/CA protocols.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section\
    \ 2 covers the main issues in CR-based IoT\nnetworks that make them different\
    \ from the classical wireless networks. Section 3 takes an overview\nof the system\
    \ model. Section 4 describes the proposed MAC protocol. Section 5 analyzes the\
    \ proposed\nprotocol through a mathematical model. Section 6 validates our model\
    \ and discusses the obtained\nresults. In the last section, we summarize and conclude\
    \ the paper.\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n5 of 21\n2. Issues of CR-Based IoT Networks\n\
    There are a variety of reasons that can compromise the performance of the classical\
    \ wireless\nnetworks. However, we here only discuss the issues related to the\
    \ CR-based IoT networks as in\nthe following.\n2.1. Heterogeneous Environment\n\
    A CR system generally works in a multi-dimensional environment having coexistence\
    \ of PUs and\nSUs with variations of time, space and frequency. The coexistence\
    \ of non-cooperative users makes it\nvery hard to sense the signals from PUs reliably.\
    \ Moreover, the resulted interference induced from\nautonomous detection procedure\
    \ of multiple SUs in an independent sensing environment would also\nlead to confuse\
    \ the CR system by overestimation of signal’s power. Hence, the potential transmitter\
    \ is\nlikely to deceive by assuming the inactive status of PU to be active. This\
    \ phenomenon is more likely to\nhappen in dense networks.\n2.2. Tradeoff between\
    \ Sensing Schemes\nSpectrum sensing is to detect the signal from PUs possibly\
    \ under noisy environment. It is very\ncrucial to identify the PU’s signal for\
    \ the communication of SUs at the desired interference level.\nThere are two general\
    \ techniques on spectrum sensing i.e., fast sensing and ﬁne sensing [44]. The\
    \ fast\nsensing measures the energy level of received signals while consuming\
    \ less than 1 ms. This approach\nhas the advantage of reporting results in a very\
    \ short time, but it cannot distinguish the source of\nsignals. On the other hand,\
    \ the ﬁne sensing consumes several tens of milliseconds, and identiﬁes better\n\
    the signal source by using the matched ﬁlter or cyclostationary detection. Hence,\
    \ there exists a tradeoff\nbetween sensing time and sensing quality alternatively\
    \ in addition to the selection of an appropriate\nsensing scheme.\n2.3. Sensing\
    \ Performance\nThe perfect sensing is a big challenge in real environments. There\
    \ exists always a probability\nof misdetection and false alarm. We denote the\
    \ false alarm probability as α and the misdetection\nprobability as β, respectively.\
    \ The false alarm means that an SU mistakenly detects an idle PU to be\nactive.\
    \ Then the SUs can miss the transmission opportunity. For SU i, the false alarm\
    \ probability, αi,\ncan be found in [45] as,\nαi = Q\n\x10\x10 λ\nν2 − 1\n\x11\
    p\nT fs\n\x11\n,\n(1)\nwhere λ is the detection (or spectrum sensing) threshold\
    \ of the sensor to decide the activity of PU,\nand ν2 denotes the power of the\
    \ noise in the channel. On the other hand, misdetection indicates that\nan SU\
    \ recognizes active PUs as idle by mistake, which leads to the signiﬁcant interference\
    \ due to\nsubsequent transmissions of SUs. In [45], the detection probability\
    \ of an arbitrary SU i is derived as,\nΩi = Q\n\x10\n1\n√2γ + 1Q−1(αi) −\np\n\
    T fsγ\n\x11\n,\n(2)\nwhere T denotes the spectrum sensing time, fs indicates the\
    \ sampling rate of the channel, γ accounts\nfor the Signal-to-INoise-Ratio (SINR)\
    \ of the PU’s signal measured at the SU i, and Q(·) represents\nthe complementary\
    \ distribution function of a standard Gaussian variable. Hence, the misdetection\n\
    probability, βi, of an SU i can be written as,\nβi = 1 − Ωi.\n(3)\nIn order to\
    \ adequately protect the PUs, we require the misdetection probability should be\
    \ bounded\nby a predeﬁned value ˆβ such that β ≤ ˆβ.\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n\
    6 of 21\n2.4. Hidden Primary Terminal Problem\nThe performance of an CR system\
    \ is signiﬁcantly affected by its sensing ability during the\ndetection process\
    \ of the active PUs. SUs may fail to detect the presence of PUs due to multipath\
    \ fading\naffects in wireless channels and temporal and spatial appearance of\
    \ the PUs. In that case, SUs can\ncause much interference to the PUs in their\
    \ successive transmissions.\nWe illustrate the scenario of the hidden primary\
    \ terminal problem in Figure 2, where the solid\nlines denote the Carrier Sensing\
    \ Range (CSR) and the dotted lines indicate the Spectrum Sensing Range\n(SSR),\
    \ respectively. We see that SUs i and j are respectively involved in a transmission\
    \ as a transmitter\nand as a receiver. We can also observe that PUs P and H are\
    \ respectively located outside the CSRs of\nthe SUs i and j. In carrier sensing,\
    \ SU i can only ensure the inactive status of PUs that are located inside\nits\
    \ CSR, when it senses the channel is idle for Data Interframe Space (DIFS) interval,\
    \ but not that of PU\nH. In spectrum sensing, the ability of SU i is, however,\
    \ only limited to evaluate when PU H is working\nas a transmitter but not when\
    \ it is performing as a receiver. The obvious reason is the inability of SU i\
    \ to\nreceive signals of the PU P’s transmission to the hidden PU H. Hence, SU\
    \ i’s transmission to SU j can\nessentially affect the likely transmission of\
    \ PU P to the PU H. In such a scenario, a secondary network\ncan create harmful\
    \ interference when an PU e.g., H, is hidden from SU e.g., i. It is very desirable\
    \ that\nSU i should make sure of the silence of neighboring PUs when it involves\
    \ in transmission with SU j.\ni\nj\nH\nP\nSSR of user i\nSSR of user j\nCSR of\

    \ problem. CSR, Carrier Sensing Range; SSR,\nSpectrum Sensing Range; P, Primary\
    \ Terminal; H, Hidden Primary Terminal.\n3. System Model\nWe have considered one\
    \ secondary network with K SUs and one primary network with multiple\nPUs in the\
    \ system. The SUs and PUs both can coexist yet cannot communicate with each other\
    \ since\nthey lack collaboration. The secondary network is established in a decentralized\
    \ manner without\ngetting support from the centerlized server, in which SUs’ transmissions\
    \ are carried out through\npeer-to-peer communication setup. However, SUs, whenever\
    \ they act as IoT devices, can rely on\nthe server for Internet service. We have\
    \ assumed the single and shared channel model, therein SUs\ncan ﬁnd transmission\
    \ opportunities whenever the legitimate owners (or incumbent PUs) are inactive.\n\
    Once PUs are active, SUs are then liable to vacate the channel immediately. To\
    \ identify a transmission\nopportunity, the secondary transmitter and its corresponding\
    \ receiver, denoted as SU i and SU j,\ncan enable spectrum sensing using one of\
    \ the energy detection, autocorrelation-Based Sensing or\ncyclostationary feature\
    \ detection mechanisms [45–48].\nDuring a spectrum sensing operation, each SU\
    \ in its neighborhood can detect PUs either to be\nactive or inactive. The PUs\
    \ in the neighborhood of SU i can be found active with the probability of\nπ1,i,\
    \ while the neighboring PUs can be observed as inactive with the probability of\
    \ π0,i. However,\nthe spectrum sensing operation is not ideal due to the imperfect\
    \ sensing environment. We hence\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n7 of 21\nconsider the\
    \ incidence of false alarm and misdetection in order to make the proposed system\
    \ more\nrealistic. Ultimately, SU i can conduct a data transmission operation\
    \ based on the sensing results,\nprovided that the channel is clear from the incumbent\
    \ PUs. For SU i, the clear-channel probability (R),\nwith which the channel is\
    \ free from the incumbent PUs, can be obtained as,\nRi = (1 − αi)π0,i + βiπ1,i,\n\
    (4)\nwhere recall that αi and βi, respectively refer to the probabilities of false\
    \ alarm and misdetection for SU\ni, as deﬁned in Equations (1) and (3). So, the\
    \ energy detector in SU i suggests declaring the activity or\ninactivity of incumbent\
    \ PUs with probability 1 − Ri and probability Ri, respectively.\n4. Proposed MAC\
    \ Protocol\nWe here discuss the proposed MAC protocol called Handshake Sense Multiple\
    \ Access with\nCollision Avoidance (HSMA/CA), which is designed for the densely\
    \ deployed cognitive radio-based\nIoT networks. In HSMA/CA, the system time is\
    \ divided into consecutive and multiple equal sized\ntime slots, therein SUs competing\
    \ at a moment follow a random access procedure over the shared\nchannel. The channel\
    \ is based on a single channel model, in which data and control packets both\n\
    are transmitted over the same channel. SUs contend at the beginning of each time\
    \ slot, denoted as\nσ, and the winner SU thereafter transmits data packet according\
    \ to a deﬁned mechanism outlined in\nthe following.\n4.1. NTS/CTS/ATS Access Mechanism\n\
    Our proposed protocol, HSMA/CA, is a tailor-made version of the standard CSMA/CA\n\
    (and MSMA/CA) for the densely distributed systems. In classical CSMA/CA, each\
    \ station must\nﬁrst identify the state of the channel as idle or busy through\
    \ the carrier sense before it enables collision\navoidance and data transmission\
    \ procedures. Therein, carrier sensing includes sensing of the physical\nmedium\
    \ by Clear Channel Assessment function to avoid a transmission overlap and the\
    \ Network\nAllocation Vector (NAV) function to reserve the channel for data packet\
    \ transmission. However,\ncarrier sensing in CSMA/CA is limited because it is\
    \ usually carried out at high SNR regime, and so\nvulnerable to the presence of\
    \ hidden primary terminal nodes in CR ad hoc networks. For example,\nif an PU\
    \ is positioned outside the carrier sensing range of an SU transmitter, it is\
    \ hard to identify the\nactivity status of this PU through the carrier sensing\
    \ mechanism. On the other hand, the spectrum\nsensing method such as energy detection,\
    \ autocorrelation-based sensing or cyclostationary feature\ndetection mechanisms\
    \ [45–48] can be carried out in low SNR regime, but requires signiﬁcant time\n\
    while introducing greater incidences of misdetection and false alarm. In HSMA/CA,\
    \ we have used\nNotify-to-Sense (NTS)/ Clear-to-Sense (CTS)/Acknowledge-to-Sense\
    \ (ATS) based handshake access\nmechanism in place of the classical RTS/CTS. The\
    \ NTS/CTS/ATS procedure is purposefully designed\nto complement carrier sensing\
    \ with spectrum sensing in order to avoid and protect the hidden\nsecondary and\
    \ hidden primary terminals, respectively. However, SUs under HSMA/CA adopt the\n\
    similar backoff procedure as that is used in CSMA/CA since both protocols are\
    \ based on the same\nrandom access model.\nWe illustrate the packet transmission\
    \ procedure in accordance to HSMA/CA in Figure 3, which is\ndescribed as follow.\
    \ The SU with packet to send ﬁrst chooses a backoff counter at random to avoid\n\
    collision. Then the SU conducts the carrier sensing for one DIFS interval to check\
    \ whether the channel\nis free or not and to avoid a transmission overlap. If\
    \ the channel is sensed as idle for the DIFS\ninterval, then SU decreases its\
    \ backoff counter one by one for each backoff slot time observed as idle.\nIn\
    \ Figure 3, the chosen backoff counter is 6. If no transmission by other SUs is\
    \ observed until the\nbackoff counter becomes 0, the transmitter broadcasts an\
    \ NTS packet to synchronize the spectrum\nsensing operation with the corresponding\
    \ receiver. The NTS packet keeps the neighboring SUs silent\nby updating their\
    \ NAVs until the spectrum sensing is done. If the receiver overhears the NTS packet,\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 241\n8 of 21\nit will then send an CTS packet to the transmitter.\
    \ The CTS packet makes the hidden SUs silent\nby updating their NAVs until the\
    \ packet transmission is over. Once the NTS and CTS packets are\nexchanged successfully,\
    \ the transmitter and receiver both can mutually conduct the spectrum sensing\n\
    operation to protect the PUs in their neighborhood. After the mutual septum sensing,\
    \ if there is no\nhidden PU active around the receiver, it returns the ATS packet\
    \ to the transmitter. If the hidden PU is\nactive otherwise, the receiver will\
    \ be blocked by spectrum sensing, and so it will hold the ATS packet.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ the transmitter will wait for the ATS packet assuming it is not blocked by the\
    \ active PUs in\nits neighborhood. The transmitter sends the DATA packet when\
    \ it decodes the ATS packet successfully,\nand the receiver returns the ACK packet\
    \ at the end. If there is an error-free environment the transmitter\ndecodes the\
    \ ACK packet correctly and completes one DATA packet transmission.\nDATA\nNTS\n\

    We mention that an PU can receive interference when it becomes active during the\
    \ exchange of\nNTS and CTS. However, such interference is acceptable in CR systems\
    \ because of the following two\nreasons. First, IEEE 802.22 standard requires\
    \ that SUs should necessarily vacate the channel within\n100 ms once PUs become\
    \ active [49]. For example, assuming the transmission rate of 1 Mbps and\nthe\
    \ packet size of 1000 bytes, the packet transmission time is 8 ms, much less than\
    \ “100 ms”. Hence,\nthe allowed time is good enough for the exchange of NTS and\
    \ CTS packets. Second, the activity rate of\nincumbent PUs for cognitive radio\
    \ networks is usually observed very low [50–52]. Hence, incumbent\nPUs are not\
    \ likely to remain active most of the time. Refer to the exchange of NTS and CTS\
    \ packets,\nit should be noticed that transmitter does not always receives the\
    \ CTS packet when there is a collision\namong multiple NTS packets. The detailed\
    \ operation under HSMA/CA is studied in Section 5.\n4.2. Spectrum Sensing Optimization\n\
    We now provide an analysis to demonstrate how the performance of the proposed\
    \ protocol could\nbe improved under the real environments while considering the\
    \ inefﬁciencies of spectrum sensing.\nWe optimize the spectrum sensing period\
    \ and the sensing threshold because both of the parameters\ncan otherwise affect\
    \ the performance of the proposed protocol. To improve the system performance,\n\
    we can optimize both of the parameters by minimizing the incidence of false alarm\
    \ and misdetection\nwith a given activity rate of hidden primary terminals (or\
    \ hidden PUs). In our model, we assume N\nspectrum sensing slots in a spectrum\
    \ sensing period. We denote the duration of each sensing slot as Ts.\nHence, the\
    \ length of a spectrum sensing interval can be written as,\nT = N × Ts,\n(5)\n\
    which is our design parameter. From Equations (1) and (3), we can derive false\
    \ alarm and misdetection\nprobabilities at a given sensing interval, so as to\
    \ calculate the network throughput. Let the hidden PUs\nare activated with an\
    \ activity factor A at each sensing slot time. Let h be the number of hidden PUs.\n\
    We can ﬁnd the hidden PUs’ interference probability, Pi, as a function of N, A,\
    \ and h as,\nPi = 1 −\n\x02\01 − A\n\x01h\x03N,\n(6)\nwhere the second term refers\
    \ to the no-interference probability to the hidden PUs. We hence can derive\n\
    the throughput of the system as,\n˜S = R(λ, N) ×\n\01 − Pi\n\x01\nC,\n(7)\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 241\n9 of 21\nwhere C is a given channel capacity and recall that\
    \ R is the clear channel probability as deﬁned in\nEquation (4). From Equation\
    \ (1), we can see that,\nλ = ˆλ × ν2,\n(8)\nwhere ˆλ is the normalized value of\
    \ the sensing threshold, λ and noise power, ν2 in the wireless channel.\nPlease\
    \ note that the optimization model is only designed to obtain the optimized value\
    \ of sensing\ninterval while considering the peculiarities of spectrum sensing\
    \ in a real environment. So, the network\nthroughput is derived to observe the\
    \ effects of our design parameters. We have investigated the\nperformance of our\
    \ proposed protocol with more detail in the following.\n5. Performance Analysis\n\

    5.1.1. NTS collision\nWe recall that under HSMA/CA the contending SUs are dispersed\
    \ with the backoff mechanism\nto avoid the collision. The backoff time of each\
    \ SU is deﬁned by its randomly chosen backoff counter,\nwhich is decreased by\
    \ one whenever the backoff slot is idle. The winner SU whose backoff counter\n\
    expires ﬁrst can transmit the NTS packet. However, more than one winner SUs can\
    \ cause NTS collision\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n11 of 21\nwhenever their backoff\
    \ counters expire at the same time. Suppose that SU i has the backlogged buffer\n\
    queue and the backoff counter 0. So, SU i transmits NTS packet to the SU j with\
    \ the transmission\ntrial probability denoted as Xi. After the timeout, SU i is\
    \ failed to receive the CTS packet since its\nNTS packet becomes collided with\
    \ another NTS packet. That situation, what we called as event e1,\nwill happen\
    \ with the probability,\np1 = Ri\n \n1 −\nK\n∏\nk=2\n\x02\n1 − XkRk\n\x03\n!\n\
    ,\n(9)\nwhere Xk and Rk respectively refer to the packet transmission trial probability\
    \ and the clear channel\nprobability for SU k. In the second term of Equation\
    \ (9), this can be helpful to notice that NTS packet\nof at least one SU will\
    \ collide to the NTS packet of SU i when k SUs, where k = 2, . . . , K, are not\
    \ trying\nto transmit with 1 − Xk probability. From Figure 4a, time delay of SU\
    \ i due to event e1 is,\nt1 = NTS + CTS + SIFS + DIFS,\n(10)\nwhere NTS and CTS\
    \ accounts for the transmission time of one RTS and that of one CTS, respectively.\n\
    5.1.2. Blocking at SU Transmitter\nSuppose that SUs i and j have exchanged the\
    \ NTS and CTS packets. Therefore, both SUs, thanks to\nNAV mechanism, mutually\
    \ conduct their spectrum sensing operations without receiving interruption\nfrom\
    \ the other SUs. However, SU i has sensed the neighboring PUs active and so it\
    \ is blocked by the\nspectrum sensing for a predeﬁned period, which is event e2\
    \ that encounters with probability,\np2 = 1 − Ri.\n(11)\nFrom Figure 4b, time\
    \ delay by the event e2 at SU i can be written as,\nt2 = NTS + CTS + SS+ 3SIFS\
    \ + DIFS,\n(12)\nwhere SS denotes the length of spectrum sensing time for one\
    \ mutual operation.\n5.1.3. Blocking at SU Receiver\nSuppose that SU i is not\
    \ blocked by the spectrum sensing, so it is waiting to receive the ATS\npacket\
    \ from the SU j. However, if SU j has sensed the hidden PUs as active, then it\
    \ will be blocked by\nthe spectrum sensing operation and so cannot send the ATS\
    \ packet. That is event e3, in which SU i\ntransmits packet to SU j with the packet\
    \ transmission probability θij. However, the timeout in SU i\nwill ultimately\
    \ fail the data packet transmission with probability,\np3 = Ri(1 − Rj) ∑\nj̸=i\n\
    θij\n \nK\n∏\nk=3\n\x02\n1 − XkRk\n\x03\n!\n,\n(13)\nwhere 1 − Rj denotes no channel\
    \ clearance probability for SU j. The last term in Equation (13) indicates\nthat\
    \ no transmitter out of k SUs, where k = 3, . . . , K, can interrupt SU i’s transmission.\
    \ From Figure 4c,\nthe time delay due to event e3 can be measured as,\nt3 = NTS\
    \ + CTS + SS + 3SIFS + DIFS.\n(14)\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n12 of 21\n5.1.4. Successful\
    \ Transmission\nNow we consider the successful transmission case, which we called\
    \ as event e4. Suppose that\nSUs i and j are not being blocked by the mutual spectrum\
    \ sensing operation. In that case, SU i will\npositively decode the ATS packet\
    \ if there is an error-free channel. Thereafter, SU i sends an DATA\npacket and\
    \ then it will correctly receive the ACK packet from the corresponding SU j. Meanwhile,\n\
    NAV mechanism keeps the other SUs silent for the respective time periods noticed\
    \ in the overheard\nNTS, CTS, and ATS packets. The occurrence probability of event\
    \ e4 can be written as,\np4 = RiRj\n\01 − Xj\n\x01 ∑\nj̸=i\nθij\n \nK\n∏\nk=3\n\
    \x02\n1 − XkRk\n\x03\n!\n,\n(15)\nwhere 1 − Xj represents reception state of SU\
    \ j. From Figure 4d, time delay by event e4 is given as,\nt4 = NTS + CTS + SS\
    \ + ATS + DATA\n+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS,\n(16)\nwhere ATS, DATA, and ACK respectively\
    \ denote the transmission time of one ATS packet, transmission\ntime of one DATA\
    \ packet, and that of one ACK packet.\n5.2. Normalized Throughput\nWe analyze\
    \ the performance of our proposed HSMA/CA protocol in terms of normalized throughput,\n\
    which is what is derived under the given set of assumptions:\n•\nThe topology\
    \ of the secondary network is composed of a fully connected complete graph, therein\n\
    SUs are directly connected to each other with a single hop distance.\n•\nThe secondary\
    \ network is saturated such that SUs have non-empty queues, in which there is\n\
    always an DATA packet to send at each station.\n•\nThe transmission channel is\
    \ error-free and there is no capture effect, so the packets are discarded\nwhen\
    \ they receive collision.\n•\nThe control and DATA packets are sent through a\
    \ single channel, which is shared among the SUs.\n•\nThe SUs use the same physical\
    \ layer and their data transmission rate is also constant.\nWe investigate the\
    \ backoff process of SUs in HSMA/CA system with a two-dimensional Markov\nchain\
    \ model as illustrated in Figure 5, in which backoff states at time t are deﬁned\
    \ by the values of two\nrandom processes of backoff stages m(t) and backoff counters\
    \ c(t). We can denote the backoff state of\nan arbitrary SU i being the value\
    \ of a backoff stage m − 1 and that of a backoff counter c − 1 as (m, c).\nThe\
    \ arbitrary SU i decreases it backoff counter from its contention window W whenever\
    \ the channel is\nobserved as idle. Once the backoff counter reaches 0, SU i can\
    \ begin data transmission process. In that\nprocess, if the transmission is successful,\
    \ then SU i returns to its initial backoff stage. Conversely,\nwhen SU i observes\
    \ collision, it increases its backoff stage from m to m + 1 upto a maximum retry\
    \ limit\nM. In that case, the backoff counter is chosen among m ∈ [0, Wm+1] provided\
    \ m ≤ M. We denote the\nsize of initial and that of maximum window as W0 and WM,\
    \ respectively. When SU i transmits with\nprobability p, it is a failed transmission\
    \ that happens either due to e1, e2, or e3. For SU i, we can obtain\nthe probability\
    \ of a failed transmission from Equations (1), (9), (11) and (13),\npi = αi +\
    \ p1 + p2 + p3,\n(17)\nwhich will be increased by the inevitable probability of\
    \ false alarm, αi, in a real environment.\nFrom Equations (3) and (15), we can\
    \ obtain the probability of a successful transmission as,\nqi = βi + p4,\n(18)\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 241\n13 of 21\nwhere p4 remains high due to misdetection probability,\
    \ βi, in a real sensing environment. From Figure 5,\nwe can obtain the state transition\
    \ probabilities of the Markov chain as Equation (20). We noticed that\nthe Markov\
    \ chain of our HSMA/CA protocol hase close resmblace to that in Chong et al. [53]\
    \ due\nto the common backoff process. We hence directly refer to the results in\
    \ Chong et al. [53] for the\ntransmission trial probability of SU i as Equation\

    \ system slots into empty slots and event slots. In the empty slots, SUs do\n\
    not attempt to transmit packets. However, SUs in the event slots observe one of\
    \ the four possible\nevents, as deﬁned in Equations (10), (12), (14) and (16),\
    \ whenever they attempt to transmit data packets.\nWe can readily obtain the occurrence\

    \ classify the event slots into transmission slots and no-transmission slots.\n\
    The slots in which transmissions happen successfully are transmission slots. From\
    \ Equation (18),\nwe already have obtained the successful transmission probability\
    \ under a real environment for SU i.\nHence, the occurrence probability of the\
    \ slots with successful data transmission can be written as,\nPr = ∑\ni\nXiqi.\n\
    (22)\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n14 of 21\nHowever, the no-transmission slots are\
    \ those slots who have observed the failed transmissions.\nWe can ﬁnd the occurrence\
    \ of no-transmission slots with probability Pn = 1 − (Pe + Pr).\nThe throughput\
    \ of the proposed HSMA/CA system can be expressed as,\nS = Average data paylod\
    \ bits transmitted in a slot\nAverage length of a slot\n.\n(23)\nWe assume an\
    \ autonomous system in which SUs have an average size of the data payload bits\n\
    E[P]. So, the average amount of the data payload bits successfully transmitted\
    \ in one slot is PtE[P].\nLet E[O] be the average length of a slot, which can\
    \ intuitively be computed as,\nE[O] = Peσ + PrE[Tr] + PnE[Tn],\n(24)\nwhere Tr\
    \ = t4 and Tn = t2(= t3). We assume t1(= t2 = t3) so that all SUs can keep pace\
    \ in the system.\nHence, Tn = t1(= t2 = t3). From Equation (16), we can observe\
    \ that\nE[Tr] = NTS + CTS + SS + ATS + DATA\n+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS\n= NTS + CTS\
    \ + SS + ATS(H + E[P])/E\n+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS,\n(25)\nwhere H and E respectively\
    \ represent the size of PHY plus MAC headers and the channel transmission\nrate.\
    \ From Equation (12), t2 is constant and so E[Tn] = t2. Conclusively, Equation\
    \ (23) becomes,\nS =\nK − 1\n\0PtE[P]\n\x01\nK\n\0Peσ + PrE[Tr] + PnE[Tn]\n\x01\
    ,\n(26)\nwhere the term K−1\nK\nrefers to the blocking effect such that only one\
    \ SU can at most be blocked due to\nspectrum sensing out of K users in the system.\n\
    6. Results and Discussion\nWe used energy detection model for spectrum sensing,\
    \ in which ﬁrst we need to determine the\noptimized value of the normalized threshold\
    \ and that of spectrum sensing slots. For that purpose,\nwe have derived the spectrum\
    \ sensor’s false alarm and misdetection probabilities as Equations (1) and\n(3),\
    \ respectively. We assume a 1 MHz channel and set the spectrum sensing sampling\
    \ rate with 6 MHz\nand SNR of the PU signal measured at SU is set to 0 dB. Further,\
    \ the number of spectrum sensing\nslots is assumed to be 20, with duration of\
    \ 0.035 ms each. We consider the activity rate of hidden PU\nas 1%. To validate\
    \ our analysis, we develop simulation in C++ code according to the details of\
    \ our\nHSMA/CA protocol. We average 1000 runs to obtain one simulation result.\
    \ In a nutshell, the default\nparameters used in the simulation are summarized\

    \ we have shown the effect of various design parameters over the spectrum sensing\n\
    errors in the system. We have evaluated the variations of misdetection probability\
    \ for the various\nvalues of normalized sensing threshold in Figure 6a. We can\
    \ see that misdetection probability remains\n0 when the threshold is less than\
    \ 0.9975, and it becomes sharply increases when the threshold is greater\nthan\
    \ 0.9975. We mention that the sensing threshold is bounded upper due to the requirement\
    \ on the\nmisdetection probability as ≤0.1 (or detection probability as ≥0.9).\
    \ With higher sensing threshold\n(i.e., >0.9975), the throughput of secondary\
    \ network increases but the PUs cannot protect enough.\nOn the other hand, the\
    \ false alarm probability remains high with threshold less than 0.9975 and then\
    \ it\ngoes down sharply when the threshold exceeds 0.9975, as shown in Figure\
    \ 6b. Hence, the achieved\noptimized spectrum sensing threshold by minimizing\

    \ the effect of the number of spectrum sensing slots over the system throughput.\n\
    We observe that the achieved throughput of the system increases with the increase\
    \ in the number\nof sensing slots until a certain limit and then decreases monotonically.\

    \ high probability of false alarm and thus the system\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n\

    \ the system throughput can\ndecrease due to the increased sensing overhead. We\
    \ can also see that there exists the optimal number\nof sensing slots (=5) and\
    \ accordingly the optimal spectrum sensing interval (=0.035 ms × 5) for the\n\
    best throughput. However, it depends on the system environment such as channel\
    \ model, sampling\nrate and the distance between PUs and SUs. In Figure 8, we\
    \ exhibit the effect of sensing threshold over\nthe throughput of the system.\
    \ We can see that system throughput remains low (=0) below the optimal\nthreshold\
    \ and thereafter it increases up to the maximum value due to the higher probability\
    \ of false\nalarm and misdetection, respectively. If the chosen threshold is higher\
    \ than the optimal value, the\nthroughput of the system can be achieved further\
    \ but at the cost of higher misdetection, which is not\ndesirable due to the protection\
    \ priority of PU in CR system.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\nNumber\

    We have shown the effect of hidden primary node activity rate over the system\

    \ values of throughput monotonically\ndecrease with the increase in activity rate\
    \ of the hidden primary node. This is because of the fact that a\nhidden PU can\
    \ interrupt more with higher activity rate and secondary network accordingly vacates\n\
    the channel to avoid interference that eventually leads to a decrease in system\
    \ performance. However,\nthe gap between the curves of throughput is attributed\
    \ due to the large number of hidden PUs, that can\nblock SUs with more probability\
    \ and so the achieved throughput of the system decreases sharply.\nFigure 10 illustrates\
    \ the effect of sensing errors in terms of false alarm and misdetection\nprobabilities\

    \ can\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n17 of 21\nsee that as long as the false alarm probability\
    \ decreases and the misdetection probability increases,\nthe throughput of the\
    \ system increases accordingly. This is because of the fact that a smaller value\
    \ of\nfalse alarm and a larger value of misdetection can generate the higher value\
    \ of throughput. On the\ncontrary, if the sensing errors and spectrum sensing\
    \ slots in the system are not optimized, then SUs’\nsystem performance and PUs’\
    \ protection both can degrade signiﬁcantly.\nWe now present the performance of\
    \ proposed protocol in terms of normalized throughput.\nIn Figure 11, we compare\
    \ the performance of the proposed HSMA/CA with CR-MEGA and\nMSMA/CA protocols.\
    \ We witness that our analysis is very accurate because our analysis results\n\
    closely follow the simulation results. We observe that the performance of the\
    \ secondary network\nremains low since the contention window becomes large for\
    \ the less number of SUs. On the other hand,\ncontention window becomes smaller\
    \ for a large number of SUs that lead to increase the RTS collisions.\nSo, the\
    \ system performance is decreased. We also observe that our proposed HSMA/CA outperforms\n\
    both CR-MEGA and MSMA/CA protocols due to its optimized sensing. This is how our\
    \ HSMA/CA\nprotocol avoids the sensing overhead to spare the fraction of bandwidth\
    \ for the transmission of more\ndata packets, which ultimately maximizes the system\
    \ performance. Given the best performance with\noptimal threshold and sensing\
    \ interval, it is safe to say that our HSMA/CA is a best candidate MAC\nprotocol\
    \ for CR-based IoT networks.\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n\

    \ Conclusions\nWe propose a Handshake Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance\
    \ (HSMA/CA)\nmechanism for CR-based IoT networks. Therein, the transmitter ﬁrst\
    \ conducts carrier sensing and\nthereafter it handshakes with the intended receiver\
    \ using NTS and CTS packets to keep the neighboring\nSUs silent. Once NTS and\
    \ CTS are exchanged, the transmitter performs mutual spectrum sensing\nin conjunction\
    \ with the receiver in order to detect active PUs and active hidden PUs, respectively.\n\
    When PU is active, spectrum sensing blocks the transmitter. Otherwise, it waits\
    \ to receive the ATS\npacket from the corresponding receiver before transmitting\
    \ a DATA packet. If the hidden PU is\nactive, then the receiver holds the ATS\
    \ packet to block the transmitter. Whenever the channel is\nclear, the transmitter\
    \ sends an DATA packet and receiver replies with an ACK in the sequel. In case\n\
    of collision, SUs follow a bakeoff procedure as that in standard CSMA/CA. This\
    \ is how our MAC\nprotocol protects priority right of PUs by resolving the hidden\
    \ primary terminal problem, in addition\nto protecting a densely deployed network\
    \ from the classical hidden and exposed terminal problems.\nOur HSMA/CA also adapts\
    \ the spectrum sensing period by maintaining inefﬁciencies in spectrum\nsensing\
    \ to avoid the sensing overhead. We investigate the performance of the proposed\
    \ protocol\nin terms of normalized throughput using the Markov model and duly\
    \ veriﬁed by the simulation.\nWe observe that our HSMA/CA outperforms existing\
    \ schemes due to optimized spectrum sensing.\nHence, the proposed HSMA/CA can\
    \ be a good candidate MAC protocol in the real environment.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    AI-Based Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and
    7 more April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that
    uses neural networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually
    relevant text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The
    models are trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and
    learn complex concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases,
    and styles. FlowDep - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle
    detection for aut... Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection
    is crucial for the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles
    such as palm-sized drones, it is a challenge to implement traditional methods
    like Lidar due to high costs and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning
    approaches, while accurate, are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles.
    To address this issue, we introduce Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm
    inspired by the low-resolution but efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects.
    Flowdep combines optic flow and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the
    depth of every image pixel. We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial
    neural network (Flowdep-ANN). Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    5.8 to 114.7 times faster than the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies
    of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep
    and Flowdep-ANN on a small autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing
    platform, and both models successfully performed real-time object detection. The
    present work demonstrates the potential of using optical flow as an efficient
    approach to estimate depth and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles.
    Misinformative Data Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April
    03, 2024 Sports are data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics
    and teams leverage data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which
    is created by media outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating
    narratives about the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data
    in the sports world, data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape.
    These data visualizations, while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers,
    can be misinformative; media creators often have incentives to present specific
    narratives which don''t always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing
    misinformative data visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to
    understand the techniques and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations
    in all domains, not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols
    Drew Scott April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are
    ubiquitous in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual
    authentication between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level
    communications. This is because tags should not share secret information with
    unknown parties and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication
    protocols designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate
    for RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy,
    small memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and
    practical authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID
    systems became prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols.

    and 2 more April 03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels
    on the performance of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of
    the signal received from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical
    analysis of the variation in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath
    is given. We present the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power,
    and we analyze the received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform,
    impulse waveform, and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of
    standard channel models. It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels,
    the change in power between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight
    channel. It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely
    cancels unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in
    a distributed array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip
    paths are coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence
    in complex channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way
    time transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April
    02, 2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory
    based on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,

    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s

    FR2-2 Short-Range Communications for... Yusuke Koda and 3 more April 02, 2024
    This paper proposes a comprehensive 3GPPcnaompatible channel model with statistical
    enhancement tailored for indoor short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications
    operating in the frequency range (FR) of 52.6-71.0 GHz termed FR2-2. Regardless
    of the existence of various channel models at this band for indoor communications,
    there will be a need for developing a channel model compatible with and understandable
    from the current 3GPP stochastic channel model (SCM) to facilitate the discussion
    in the 3GPP for developing such FR2-2 short-range D2D communication framework
    based on the fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR). Indeed, such a futuristic vision
    can be foreseen from the fact that the 3GPP is discussing the evolution of sidelink,
    referred to as a D2D communication framework; however, there are no 3GPP SCM-compatible
    channel models applicable to FR2-2 short-range D2D communications. To fill this
    void, we propose the channel model coined 3GPPCompFR2-InS that allows us to generate
    channel impulse responses (CIR) for computer simulations, which is suitable for
    various indoor short-range D2D communication scenarios while retailing the similarity
    in terms of the implementation policy of the 3GPP SCM. 3GPPCompFR2-InS is verified
    based on the real-world measurements at the 60 GHz band from the viewpoint of
    both the validity of the channel model parameters and that of the statistical
    behavior of the generated CIRs. Effective media models for wave propagation in
    prestressed fractured rocks with nonli... Li-Yun Fu and 3 more April 02, 2024
    Stress-induced progressive deformations in fractured rocks with increasing effective
    pressure generally undergo nonlinear elastic (due to the closure of compliant
    pores), hyperelastic (due to residual stress), and inelastic (due to fracture
    growth) deformations prior to mechanical failure. Wave propagation in such rocks
    involves the complex interaction of fracture-and stress-induced changes in both
    velocity and anisotropy. With attention to nonlinear elastic and hyperelastic
    deformations, we incorporate acoustoelasticity into the traditional Hudson/Cheng
    models to describe the coupling of fracture-induced and stress-induced anisotropies.
    The resulting acoustoelastic Hudson model (AHM) is valid for the crack density
    smaller than 0.1 whereas the Padé AHM could handle higher crack densities. We
    extend the Padé AHM to consider the stress-induced crack closure with nonlinear
    elastic deformations by incorporating the dual-porosity model. These models approach
    the coupled anisotropies with different accuracies and computational complexities.
    The plane-wave analyses and effective-moduli calculations of stressed fractured
    rocks with varying crack densities determine the accuracy of these models under
    the isotropic (confining) and anisotropic (uniaxial and pure shear) prestress
    conditions. The relevant Thomsen parameters are applied to experimental data to
    validate the applicability. Finite-difference simulations are implemented to identify
    the contribution of different anisotropies through the variety of wavefronts,
    depending on fracture orientation, crack density, prestress mode and magnitude,
    and loading direction. Particular attention is paid to the anisotropic prestress,
    where the coupled anisotropies are constructive or destructive interference, strongly
    related to the relativity between fracture strike and loading direction. The stress-induced
    crack closure will reduce the fracture anisotropy so that the stress-induced background
    anisotropy dominates the shape of wavefronts with increasing prestress. Security
    and Reliability Performance of a Cooperative Network with Self-Sustaining No...
    Amit Patel and 1 more April 02, 2024 In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance
    of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting self-sustaining
    nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). Performance of such
    networks is quite different from that with powered nodes. We consider optimal
    combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as
    well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Since availability of channel state information
    at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling.
    To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination.
    Assuming practical nonlinear EH, exact and approximate expressions are derived
    for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and
    the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated
    that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF just as with powered nodes.
    However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function
    of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve
    secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability
    trade-off (SRT) is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy
    performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical
    expressions. Scalable Dynamic Spectrum Access with IEEE 1900.5.2 Spectrum Consumption
    Models Prasad Netalkar and 5 more April 03, 2024 Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)
    is a key mechanism for meeting the ever-increasing demand for emerging wireless
    services. DSA involves managing and assigning available spectrum resources in
    a way that minimizes interference and allows RF coexistence between heterogeneous
    devices and systems. Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs)-defined in the IEEE 1900.5.2
    standard, offer a mechanism for RF devices to: (i) declare the characteristics
    of their intended spectrum use and their interference protection needs; and (ii)
    determine compatibility (non-interference) with existing devices. In this paper,
    we propose a novel SCM-based Spectrum Deconfliction (SD) algorithm that dynamically
    configures RF operational parameters (e.g., center frequency and transmission
    power) of a target transmitter-receiver pair aiming to minimize interference with
    existing devices/systems. We also propose sequential and distributed DSA methods
    that use the SD algorithm for assigning spectrum in large-scale networks. To evaluate
    the performance of our methods in terms of computation time, spectrum assignment
    efficiency, and overhead, we use two custom-made simulation platforms. Finally,
    to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our methods, we build a proof-of-concept
    implementation in the NSF PAWR COSMOS wireless testbed. The results reveal the
    advantages of using SCMs and their capabilities to conduct spectrum assignments
    in dynamic and congested communication environments. Advanced Cardiovascular Health
    in a Quantum AI-driven Healthcare Framework Sarvapriya M Tripathi and 2 more April
    02, 2024 With the advent of Healthcare 4.0, there is increased interest from researchers
    the world over in the application of modern, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) algorithms in solving healthcare
    challenges. The era of Quantum Computing (QC) promises to bring significant advancements
    in several areas of healthcare such that it may be sensible to give this hybrid
    Quantum/Classical paradigm its own name-Healthcare4Q. The potential of QC will
    extend the reach of Healthcare4Q with the help of diverse technologies such as
    quantum-enabled wearables, quantum-secure transfer and storage of data, and quantum
    computing at edge, fog, and cloud. All of these technologies promise to catapult
    Healthcare4Q to become the most capable healthcare framework in the advancement
    of medical innovations and improvement of patient care. An integral part of a
    person''s health lies in cardiovascular health, and thus prioritizing and optimizing
    cardiovascular health remains vital to the broader goals of public health and
    healthcare sustainability. In this study, under the paradigm of Healthcare4Q,
    we propose a framework called the Quantum AIdriven Heart Health Framework (QAIHHF)
    that can provide advanced predictive intelligence to healthcare providers by utilizing
    historical and real-time data and processing capabilities proposed in Healthcare4Q.
    We show that when applied to various diagnostics and health indicators such as
    ECG data, the Quantum AI provides accuracy at a level equal to or higher as compared
    to the classical methods thus proving itself to be the critical component that
    will herald the era of Healthcare4Q. QCDC-DR-GA: Optimizing Container Loading
    and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Docky... Md. Mahfuzur Rahman and 4 more
    April 01, 2024 This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and
    loading operations at ports, integrating quaycrane dual-cycling (QCDC) with dockyard
    rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations:
    ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing
    dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect
    in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically,
    optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase
    dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem,
    we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising 1dimensional
    and 2-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms
    four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard
    rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time
    for large vessels. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing
    QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized
    by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to
    QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads
    to inferior performance than our proposed QCDC-DR-GA. A Two-Stage Passive Matrix
    Addressing Method for Large-Scale Beam-Steering Arrays PengYuan Wang April 01,
    2024 This letter proposes a passive matrix addressing method to dramatically reduce
    the number of controlling (biasing) lines for large-scale beam-steering arrays.
    Phase shifting of each radiation element is accomplished in two stages by the
    row and column biasing lines located at two stacked layers, which offer a pair
    of orthogonal wave vectors. For an antenna array with M rows and N columns, conventional
    direct addressing designs need M * N biasing lines, while the proposed method
    needs only M+N biasing lines to complete the full-space beam-steering. The proposed
    method simplifies the routing of control lines and the design of driving circuits.
    Both theoretical and numerical analyses are provided to validate this method.
    Efficient Twiddle Factor Generation for Post Quantum Cryptography FALCON-based
    Number... Ghada Alsuhli and 4 more April 01, 2024 Area and power-efficient hardware
    implementations are crucial for the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography
    (PQC) algorithms like FALCON. One of the main operations in FALCON is the Number
    Theoretic Transform (NTT), which needs to be performed with many prime numbers.
    Having one set of twiddle factors (TFs) for each prime makes storing all of these
    TFs impractical. In this paper, we propose an architecture for generating TFs
    on the fly for FALCON-oriented NTT, designed for area and power efficiency. Our
    approach dynamically generates TFs during NTT computations, significantly reducing
    on-chip memory requirements. The ASIC implementation results demonstrate significant
    improvements, with the proposed design reducing on-chip memory requirements by
    99%, occupying 95% less area, and consuming 87.4% less power compared to the traditional
    ROM-based implementation. Furthermore, our design achieved a much higher maximum
    clock frequency, indicating superior performance in accessing twiddle factors.
    These findings highlight the potential of our proposed architecture for efficient
    hardware implementations of FALCON-based cryptographic systems. ← Previous 1 2

    rights and content Abstract While 5G is at the early deployment state around the
    globe, the research and industrial communities have already started concentrating
    their efforts on formulating the overall 6G vision comprising requirements, key
    enabling technologies, performance indicators, and applications. Following the
    trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks
    allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make
    6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks.
    However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to
    issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource
    manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues,
    a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus,
    we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive
    understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing
    an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we
    present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements.
    Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide
    a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects
    and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced
    while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions. Finally, future
    research directions are expounded to set the floor for further advancements in
    the blockchainized 6G. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    6G networksTelecommunicationsBlockchainDistributed Ledger Technology 1. Introduction
    The evolution of mobile networks has come a long way and has hitherto fulfilled
    the market demands as well as users’ expectations. The time has come for the world
    to experience and enjoy the services offered by the fifth-generation (5G) of mobile
    networks. It is going to radically change the way humans and machines communicate,
    interact and stay connected. Distinctively, 5G supports three different broad
    traffic classes namely eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), URLLC (Ultra-Reliable
    and Low Latency Communication), and mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications)
    [1], [2]. These are designed to meet heterogeneous and customized demands of individuals
    as well as network tenants such as industry verticals, mobile virtual network
    operator (MVNO), Over The Top (OTT) service providers [3]. Moreover, various new
    technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV), Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), Network Slicing (NS), Cloud Computing
    (CC), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), and massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
    (MIMO) drive the 5G ecosystem and help achieve the 5G vision [4], [5] (A list
    of important acronyms is given in Table 1). Table 1. Summary of important acronyms.

    community already has identified numerous gaps that will not be filled through
    5G even with its full capacity. For instance, 5G, in line with its predecessor
    generations, remains confined to cell-based communications that offer primarily
    ground coverage [6], [7], [8]. Further, even with 5G, a significant portion of
    the earth will remain unconnected and uncovered which includes large bodies of
    water, areas with low (or negligible) population, deep deserts, and mountains
    [9]. Hence, 5G’s state-of-art and its ongoing initial deployments reveal many
    limitations when one envisions future requirements [7]. Hence, in a decade or
    so, even with 5G technology it would be difficult to scale up and meet the diverse
    demands (in terms of traffic, connection density, and services) of the hyper-connected
    future era. This understanding has impelled a new wave of interest in the next
    generation of mobile networks which is touted as the 6G. At present, with a resurgence
    of research activities around the globe, the research and industrial community
    is formulating the overall vision, exploring the potential use cases, defining
    the future requirements, and identifying the key enabling technologies for 6G
    [1]. 6G, the future generation of wireless communication system, is envisioned
    to lay the foundation of a new era of hyper-connected and artificially intelligent
    societies [10]. It would enable complete digitization, mobilization, and automation
    with seamless integration of heterogeneous networks spanning over space, air,
    ground, underground and undersea, thereby paving the way for universal communication
    system [11]. For instance, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as Aerial
    Base Stations (ABS) will extend the reach of ground stations enabling better coverage
    and cell-free communications. Integrating heterogeneous networks in 6G calls for
    a unified framework comprising of key enabling technologies like Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), Blockchain, Visible Light Communication (VLC), quantum communications, and
    TeraHertz (THz) communications [7], [9], [12]. Moreover, 6G is believed to go
    beyond conventional RF-based communications and embrace various other propagation
    media like sonar waves for underwater, optical fiber for the fronthaul and the
    backhaul, and magnetic induction for underground communications [13]. Undoubtedly,
    6G has to meet the predicted explosive growth in terms of the number of connected
    devices as well as the exponentially increasing traffic demands. As per CISCO,
    by 2030, 500 billion devices would be connected across the globe, which will be
    of the order of 59 times more than the human population by then [10]. The traffic
    is estimated to be 607 exabyte/month by 2025 and 5016 exabyte/month by 2030 [14].
    Major contributors to this expected traffic will be video traffic and the M2M
    communications traffic [14]. The trend exhibits that the prominent users of 6G
    are going to be machines/devices thus network services will be more machine-centric
    than human-centric. The fascinating range of new devices that will proliferate
    the space of connected devices will be AR (Augmented Reality) glasses, VR (Virtual
    Reality) headsets, hologram devices, swarm robots, home appliances, range of sensors
    of autonomous vehicles, industrial machines, and Internet of Everything (IoE)
    devices [10]. 6G networks are envisioned to be softwarized, virtualized, customized,
    cloudified, edgified, intelligent, autonomous and self-sustainable [15]. Security
    and privacy of such open and programmable networks will be one of the indispensable
    architectural requirements. Some of the identified technologies that will play
    a cardinal role in this direction include blockchain technology, native Artificial
    Intelligence (AI), quantum computing and communication, and Physical Layer Security
    (PLS) techniques [9], [16]. Some of the captivating applications to be offered
    by 6G are VR, AR, MR (Mixed Reality) and XR (Extended Reality) applications [17],
    M2M type subscription and applications [14], 3D holographic imaging and presence
    [18], [19], 5D communications (sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste) [18], VLC
    (Visible Light Communications) [20], smart clothing and wearables, fully autonomous
    (Level-5 [21]) and connected vehicles, and accurate indoor positioning [22]. In
    a nutshell, the envisioned motive of 6G networks revolves around the following:
    • To offer a universal communication system integrating underwater, ground, air,
    and space networks. • To effortlessly accommodate a proliferation of heterogeneous
    devices emerging from IoE. • To proactively meet the futuristic traffic demands.
    • To offer strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) for new heterogeneous traffic classes
    and services. • To open a new landscape of business opportunities with strong
    consideration for network tenants and industry verticals. • To pave the way for
    an unseen fleet of real-time and AI-powered applications. Table 2. Section-wise

    motivation Blockchain, one of the most popular types of distributed ledger technology,
    has been identified as a key enabler for mobile communication systems. Already
    its applicability in 5G networks has been a hot research topic in the recent past
    [23], [24]. Since the future generation of mobile networks, especially 6G, is
    going to be increasingly softwarized, decentralized, and open systems thus the
    underpinning of blockchain technology is believed to be indispensability for secure
    and complete automation. In particular, there are technical aspects (such as security,
    privacy, network service management, resource utilization, and spectrum management
    discussed in detail in Section 5) and applications of 6G (such as healthcare,
    energy Internet, UAVs, CAVs, and XR presented in depth in Section 6) that are
    expected to be enhanced with the use of blockchain technology . In this context,
    researchers have already started exploring the role of blockchain in 6G networks
    [25], [26], [27]. 1.2. Selection method The aim of this paper is to put the integration
    of blockchain technology for 6G under the magnifying glass to provide an in-depth
    understanding of a wide range of benefits that can be achieved with the use of
    blockchain technology in 6G era. In particular, the motivation is to answer set
    of research questions when leveraging blockchain technology in conjunction with
    smart contracts for 6G. Table 2 provides section-wise research questions and the
    search keywords that were used for the search process. Various databases such
    as IEEExplore, ACM, Scopus, and Web of Science have been used to gather all the
    papers that fall within the scope of the this survey. Although, references used
    for this survey paper were published between 2002 and 2022, however, majority
    of the references (more than 200 out of total 380 references) are from year 2020
    and 2021. This is evident since research community gained momentum towards 6G
    since 2018, and specially the work regarding use of blockchain in 6G has picked
    up since 2019. Thus, this paper provides in-depth survey of latest research work
    that have been performed considering blockchain and smart contracts for next generation
    mobile networks, i.e., 6G. Table 3 summarizes the relevant works concerning the
    use of blockchain for 6G networks. Table 3. Summary of surveys related to the

    management, security, and privacy), and 5G applications (such as healthcare, smart
    cities, smart transportation, smart grid, and UAVs The primary focus of the paper
    is the integration of blockchain for 5G (technologies, services, and 5G IoT applications).
    Thus, no explicit focus on 6G’s trends, requirements, technical aspects, and applications.

    1.3. Paper contribution Given the fact that blockchain has been envisioned as
    one of the key enabling technologies for 6G mobile networks [15], [17], [33],
    it is imperative to study various opportunities and challenges foreseen with its
    usage. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no comprehensive
    survey that presents the broader and in-depth role of blockchain technology in
    6G. The current paper is the first attempt to exhaustively survey the cardinal
    role of blockchain technology in 6G networks considering both the technical aspects
    of 6G and the applications & use cases envisioned with the underpinning of 6G.
    The main contributions of this survey are as follow: • To explore the driving
    trends, applications, requirements, and key enabling technologies for 6G ecosystem:
    The paper discusses the trends that are propelling the futuristic 6G applications
    as well as outlines the distinct requirements of 6G along with the key enabling
    technologies. Blockchain is one of the key enabling technologies. • To provide
    an overview of blockchain and present a high-level view of its role towards 6G
    trends and applications: Given, the observed trends and the estimated requirements,
    a zoom-out view of what blockchain can offer for 6G is projected. This sets the
    floor to probe thoroughly the use of blockchain in 6G ecosystem. • To investigate
    blockchain-enabled improvements for 6G’s technical aspects: Next generation of
    mobile networks will demand significant enhancement of the existing technical
    aspects in the current generation as well as new technical building blocks. For
    every technical aspect considered, this paper, identifies the key challenges and
    investigates how blockchain can play an instrumental role in mitigating them.
    Furthermore, efforts have been made to fairly represent both the pros and cons
    of using blockchain for the considered technical aspects. • To gauge the use of
    blockchain for the envisioned 6G use cases and applications: The paper probes
    the role that blockchain will play in realizing a fleet of innovative 6G use cases.
    In particular, the motive is to comprehensively survey how the research efforts
    in the realm of blockchain-enabled 6G use cases are (and will be) shaping up.
    • To elaborate deployment challenges encountered with the use of blockchain for
    6G: Despite the promising role the blockchain can play for enabling various technical
    aspects and use cases of 6G, there exist deployment challenges. Use blockchain
    in 6G ecosystem on the one hand will bring numerous advantages, but on the other
    hand, will encounter integration challenges. Thus, the paper put the use of blockchain
    in 6G through the prism of challenges. Moreover, various possible solutions are
    also briefly discussed. • To present the lessons learned and the future research
    directions: As essence of our survey, the paper presents a concise discussion

    of 6G network 6G mobile networks are expected to be deployed within the next decade
    around the globe [12]. As experienced from previous mobile generations, a new
    mobile generation appears every ten years. Therefore, it is realistic to assume
    that 6G will emerge around 2030 [12], [35]. 6G is going to implement smart and
    intelligent mobile networks that can satisfy all the expectations not met with
    5G, as well as new requirements to be defined at a later stage. Download : Download

    path towards 6G networks [12], [15], [34]. 6G will play a vital role as the main
    communication infrastructure in 2030 and beyond. Therefore, the development of
    6G network will shape up by the future trends of the 2030’s world. As illustrated
    in Fig. 2, the future trends in the future world will define the new applications
    and services enabled by 6G network. To realize these new 6G applications and services,
    a new set of technologies will be integrated with mobile networks. Fig. 3 presents
    the high-level view of 6G architecture. Among other 6G technologies, the integration
    of AI, edge AI, and ML will play a vital role in 6G network [36], [37]. Download

    6G architecture [1], [12], [35], [38]. 2.1. 6G driving trends 6G will be the key
    communication infrastructure to satisfy the demands of future needs of hyper-connected
    societies in 2030 [12], [15], [34]. Thus, these future demands will drive the
    development and define the features of 6G networks. • Expansion of IoT: It is
    expected that the number of IoT devices in the world will grow up to 24 billion
    by 2030. Moreover, the revenue related to IoT will hit the market capitalization
    of USD 1.5 trillion by 2030 [39]. • Massive Availability of Small Data: Due to
    the anticipated popularity of 6G-based IoT devices and new 6G IoT services, 6G
    network will trend to generate an increasingly high volume of data. Most of such
    data will be small, dynamic, and heterogeneous in nature [35], [40]. • Availability
    of Self-Sustained Networks: 6G mobile systems need to be energy self-sustainable,
    both at the infrastructure side and at the device side to provide uninterrupted
    connectivity in every corner of the world. The development of energy harvesting
    capabilities will extend the life-cycle of both network infrastructure devices
    and end devices such as IoE devices [11], [41]. • Convergence of Communication,
    Sensing, Control, Localization, and Computing: Development of sensor technologies
    and direct integration of them with mobile network accompanied by low energy communication
    capabilities will lead to advanced 6G networks [35], [42]. Such a network will
    be able to provide sensing and localization services in addition to advanced communication
    and computing features [35], [42], [43]. • Zero Energy IoT: Generally, IoT devices
    will consume significantly more energy for communication than sensing and processing
    [44]. The development of ultra-low-power communication mechanisms and efficient
    energy harvesting mechanisms will lead to self-energy sustainable or zero energy
    IoT devices [44]. • More Bits, Spectrum, and Reliability: The advancement of wireless
    communication technologies including coding schemes and antenna technologies will
    allow the utilization of new spectrum as well as reliably send more information
    bits over existing wireless channels [12], [35]. • Gadget-free Communication:
    The integration of an increasing number of smart and intelligent devices and digital
    interfaces in the environment will lead to a change from gadget-centric to user-centric
    or gadget-free communication model. With such a transition, the user will be able
    to communicate with the hyper-connected digital surroundings without any devises.
    The “omnipotential” environment is smart enough to provide the necessary information,
    and digital services according to the user requirements [45], [46], [47]. • Increasing
    Elderly Population: Due to factors such as advanced healthcare facilities and
    the development of new medicines, the older population in the world is increasing
    rapidly. According to “An Aging World: 2015” report, nearly 17 percent (1.6 billion)
    of the world’s population will be aged 65 and over by 2050 [48]. • Emergence of
    New Technologies: By 2030, the world will experience new technological advancements
    such as stand-alone cars, AI-powered automated devices, smart clothes, printed
    bodies in 3D, humanoid robots, new AR devices, quantum computing, and space travel
    [12], [35]. 6G will be the main underlying communication infrastructure to realize
    these technologies. 2.2. 6G applications A new set of 6G applications will appear
    due to above-mentioned 6G trends. Some of these important 6G applications are
    discussed below: • UAV based Mobility: The popularity and progress of research
    and development (R&D) activities related UAV based services are improving around
    the globe. This will lead to use UAVs in new domains such as taxi services, logistics,
    passenger transport, and military operations [49], [50]. • Holographic Telepresence:
    is another exciting 6G application. Using holographic telepresence, it is possible
    to real-time project distant objects including people as full-motion 3D images.
    Due to a high level of realism to the actual physical presence, holographic telepresence
    useful for applications such as, meeting, conferences and news broadcasting [51],
    [52]. • Extended Reality (XR): 6G is believed to offer extended reality which
    can combine real and digital/virtual environments. XR terms expands over multiple
    technologies i.e., Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality
    (MR), and everything in between [53], [54]. • Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV):
    With more than 40 companies active contribution for R&D activities in CAV domain,
    the future human society will soon experience the fully autonomous, highly reliable,
    and commercially viable autonomous vehicles [55]. • Internet of Everything (IoE):
    Current IoT ecosystem will evolve further to the Internet of Everything (IoE)
    which interconnects not only things but also people, processes and data itself
    [56]. • Smart Grid 2.0: Energy networks will evolve from Smart grid 1.0 which
    is about installing interconnected smart meters and getting them integrated, to
    Smart Grid 2.0 which will actually do more advanced things such as automated meter
    data analysis, dynamic pricing, prepayments, and intelligent line loss analysis.
    Smart Grid 2.0 offers the distribution grid management automation via a self-healing,
    digitally controlled energy network for reliable electric power delivery [57].
    • Industry 5.0: 6G will provide a solid underpinning for next generation of industries,
    i.e., Industry 5.0. It enables co-working concept of people, intelligent robots
    and smart machines. In this manner, Industry 5.0 adds the personalized human touch
    to the automation and efficiency in Industrial Internet applications [58]. • Hyper-intelligent
    IoT: is a next generation of IoT application which relies mainly on AI technologies.
    It will use AI algorithms to mainly optimize the complex IoT data processing task
    to control automated devices such as robots and UAVs. In this way, hyper-intelligent
    IoT can use to implement intelligent digital services [59]. • Collaborative Robots:
    directly collaborate with people by work side-by-side with them. These collaborative
    robots can perform tedious, repetitive, and risky tasks which are difficult to
    do with humans. The use of co-robots can improve the health and safety of human
    workers and automate the production process [60]. • Personalized Body Area Networks(PBANs):
    is a short-range network which basically deploy around or within the human. PBAN
    are important to implement integrated mobile health (mHealth) systems. These mHealth
    systems are used to perform health monitoring and personalized health management.
    mHealth systems deploys multiple sensors within the human body to collect health
    information. PBAN interconnects these sensors to enable dynamic exchange of the
    collected information [61]. • Intelligent Healthcare: is the next generation of
    healthcare systems. Novel AI technologies will use in ehealth sector realize this
    new intelligent healthcare systems. New devices such as Intelligent Wearable Devices
    (IWD) and Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) will use to implement
    Hospital-to-Home (H2H) services and hyper-connected smart hospitals [38], [62].
    2.3. 6G technical requirements/vision The technical capabilities of 6G networks
    have to improved to realize new 6G applications. Thus, technical requirement of
    6G networks should extend the capabilities of 5G networks. 6G networking requirements
    can be divided into different categories as follows: • Further enhanced Mobile
    Broadband (FeMBB): The mobile broadband speed should exceed the limits of 5g network
    and offer the peak data rate at Terabits per second (Tbps) level. Moreover, the
    user-experienced data rate should also increase to Gigabits per second (Gbps)
    level [38]. • Enhanced Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency Communication (ERLLC/eURLLC):
    The E2E latency in 6G should be further reduced up to μ s level to enable new
    high-end real-time 6G applications [15]. • Ultra massive Machine Type Communication
    (umMTC): Connection density will further increase in 6G due to the popularity
    of IoT devices and the novel concept of IoE. These devices communicate with each
    other and offer automated services collaboratively [63], [64]. • Extremely Low-Power
    Communications (ELPC): The network energy efficiency of 6G will be improved by
    10x than 5G and 100X than 4G. It will enable extremely low power communication
    channels for resource-constrained IoT devices [15], [65]. • Long Distance High-Mobility
    Communications (LDHMC): With the support of fully integrated satellite technologies,
    6G will provide communication for extreme places such as space and the deep sea.
    Satellite communication is said to have potential to enable Internet of Remote
    Things (IoRTs) [66]. Moreover, AI-based automated mobility management systems
    and proactive migration systems will be able to support seamless mobility at speed
    beyond 1000 kmph [38]. • High Spectrum Efficiency: The spectrum efficiency will
    be further improved in 6G up to five times as in 4G and nearly two times as in
    5G networks [15]. • High Area Traffic Capacity: The exponential growth of IoT
    will demand the improvement of the area traffic capacity by 100 times than 5G
    networks. It will lead up to 1 Gbps traffic per square meter in 6G networks. In
    addition to the above network level requirements, 6G networks are expected to
    deliver high security, high privacy and high reliability to enable new 6G applications.

    6G enabling technologies Several technologies will play a crucial role in realizing
    novel 6G applications and satisfying the requirements of 6G networks. • AI/ML:
    The concept of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking
    and human behavior is called AI [67]. Machine learning allows machines to learn
    about a process or performing a task from analyzing only data without being programmed
    explicitly [68]. Thus, ML is considered a subset of AI. • Edge AI: is focusing
    on running AI algorithms locally at the edge of the network with limited resources
    and very low E2E latency. Due to limitations in edge computers, these edge AI
    models/algorithms can be pre-trained in the cloud for optimized results and can
    then be moved to the edge [69]. • Above 6 GHz Radio Frequency: With the greater
    use of small cells and emerging advances in communication technology, 6G will
    be able to support the use of higher frequencies in future use cases [70]. • Blockchain/DLT:
    Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a decentralized, secure and immutable database
    that is managed by multiple users. It will play a vital role in enabling many
    6G services [32]. • Swarm Networking: is the concept of managing a group of network
    elements or users as a part of a swarm. 6G will need to use swarm networking concepts
    to efficiently manage a swarm of edge devices, UAVs, or robots, due to the collaborative
    nature of these elements [71]. • Zero touch network and Service Management (ZSM):
    is the concept of enabling full end-to-end automation of network and service management
    to deliver services in an agile, high speed, and scalable manner [72]. • Smart
    Surfaces: In the near future, the novel smart surfaces will be inherently intelligent
    to offer services. They will evolve from the current form to integrate smart technology
    onto the surfaces of furniture, buildings, and vehicles. Thus, these smart surfaces
    will combine the materials science of smart materials with IoT and big data analysis
    to offer dynamic, reconfigurable, and digitally controllable surfaces [73]. •
    Quantum Communication: With the development of quantum computing research, 6G
    may utilize quantum information processing and quantum teleportation to enable
    quantum communication. One of the most interesting applications of quantum communication
    is the protection of information channels against eavesdropping using quantum
    cryptography [74]. 3. Overview of blockchain In recent years, the rise of DLT,
    in particular blockchain technology, has gained significant momentum and has been
    embraced by the industry and research communities. This section briefly covers
    the basic concepts, types of blockchain, smart contracts, and salient features
    of blockchain. 3.1. Blockchain - A type of DLT Blockchain is a type of distributed
    ledger which is maintained in a decentralized manner by the underlying P2P network
    of nodes. As the name implies, blockchain comprises of series of blocks of transactions
    that are logically chained or linked together to form a digital ledger. Transactions
    occurring in a given time frame are verified and then bundled together in a unit
    called as block. So, each block contains a finite set of transactions. All these
    blocks are logically linked together in the order of their creation using cryptographic
    hashes. This is to say that every block stores the hash value of the previous
    block in the ‘previous block hash’ field. The first block, aka genesis block,
    does not have any previous block. Thus, the previous block hash field of the genesis
    block is set to all 0’s. The digital ledger holds all the past transactions in
    chronological order and is cryptographically sealed [75]. Further, this ledger
    is replicated at all the participating nodes in a P2P blockchain network. With
    time, the distributed ledger keeps growing because the write operations are performed
    in exclusively append mode [76]. From a technological viewpoint, blockchain is
    considered as one single technological innovation which is a unique, and powerful
    mix of underlying concepts, techniques and technologies [77]. For instance, blockchain
    uses cryptographic techniques like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), hashing, digital
    signature, and Merkle tree. It also utilizes P2P technology for connecting nodes
    (aka miners) to establish a blockchain network. Furthermore, a consensus mechanism
    allows nodes in the blockchain network to be synchronized and to agree on the
    current state of the distributed ledger. Blockchain promises to solve the issues
    like exclusive peer-to-peer transactions without centralized third parties, fraudulent
    replication of digital asset/value or transaction (e.g., double spending), establishing
    trust with pseudonymity, transparent yet immutable record-keeping, provenance
    and auditable enabled distributed ledger, and digital signing and execution of
    legal agreements (between parties) in the form of softwarized contracts. The technology
    is also optionally driven by incentive mechanisms to attract more nodes to participate
    in the decentralized management of the digital ledger [78]. 3.2. Types of blockchain
    There exist different types of blockchain and many times the clear distinction
    between them is missing. Fig. 5 shows different types of blockchain and the classification
    is based on (i) who is allowed to read, write and commit transactions in blockchain
    (i.e., permission configuration) [77], and (ii) on what type of servers hosting
    is done [79]. The read permission allows a node to access and see all the past
    transactions, and the write permission enables nodes to create and broadcast a
    transaction to all the other nodes in the blockchain network. The commit permission
    empowers a node to update the distributed ledger [77]. Fundamentally, there are
    four different types of blockchain: (i) public, (ii) private, (iii) permissionless
    and (iv) permissioned blockchain. If a blockchain permits any node to acquire
    read permission by default, and public servers are used for its hosting then it
    is considered as public blockchain. On the contrary, if read permission is restricted
    and private hosting is used then such a blockchain is called as private blockchain.
    In other words, in public blockchain anyone can read whereas in private blockchain
    only the set of vetted nodes can read. Next, a blockchain is said to be permissionless,
    if all the nodes with read capability can also write and commit. However, in permissioned
    blockchain only the authorized subset of the participating nodes (who can read)
    are capable to write and commit. Based on these four basic types of blockchain,
    there are four combinations possible which are shown as the leaf nodes of the
    inverted tree structure in  Fig. 5. Public permissionless blockchain are the ones
    where anyone can join the blockchain network and perform read and write operations.
    Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of such blockchain. Public
    permissioned blockchain allows anyone to read but allows only the selected few
    nodes to write and commit. For instance, a supply chain ledger that can be read
    by customers but updated by only the authorized nodes under the control of company
    [79] or a blockchain-based voting system. Private permissionless blockchain is
    formed by only the set of restricted nodes which can perform read, write and commit
    operations. Such a type of blockchain is also called a consortium or federated
    blockchain. Finally, private permissioned blockchain enable all the nodes in the
    set of approved nodes to carry out read operation, however, the write and commit
    operations are exclusively performed by network operators (i.e., a subset of a
    set of approved nodes) [77]. Download : Download high-res image (415KB) Download

    contract Yet another important concept that has extended the capability of blockchain
    is smart contract. The idea of smart contract existed much before the birth of
    blockchain technology. It was first introduced by Szabo in 1994 [80]. It can be
    simply defined as a computer program that encodes all the terms and conditions
    of an agreement between participating entities and runs on top of blockchain [81].
    Any node in the blockchain network is capable of executing a smart contract either
    when it is called by initiating a transaction or when certain predefined conditions
    are met. Moreover, a smart contract can be established between untrusted and anonymous
    entities in the blockchain ecosystem without the need of a third party [82]. As
    and when the pre-defined encoded conditions are reached the corresponding smart
    contract gets self-executed thereby empowering automation. It is worth noting
    that once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it cannot be stopped
    by any entity within the system or outside the system [81]. 3.4. Salient features
    of blockchain This section briefly discusses salient features of blockchain technology.
    They are as follows: • Decentralization: Unlike, conventional centralized technologies,
    blockchain technology offers decentralized modus operandi. This implies there
    is no central authority that owns and controls a given system completely. Rather,
    the system is collectively operated by a dynamic set of nodes (or miners) such
    that any node can create new block comprising a set of transactions. Thus, blockchain
    decentralizes the decision-making and control of the entire system. • Immutability:
    Once any transaction or data is stored on the blockchain in general, there is
    no way that it can be tampered with or altered. This is due to the distributed
    digital ledger, use of cryptographic techniques, and consensus-based update procedure.
    Thus, it is important to note that immutability also implies irrevocability and
    non-deletion of content from the blockchain infrastructure. • Transparency with
    Pseudonymity: Transparency implies any node in the blockchain network has access
    to read any content present in the digital ledger. The level of transparency is
    highest for public permissionless blockchain and is minimum in private permissioned
    blockchain. Further, nodes in the P2P blockchain network can just see transactions
    happening between different digital addresses (account IDs), however, the information
    about which ID belongs to whom (i.e., an individual or an organization) is absent.
    Thus, blockchain allows transparency with pseudonymity. • Fast Processing and
    Lower Cost: Conventional (logically centralized) systems involve multiple intermediaries
    and/or trusted third parties. For the overall processing of a transaction, each
    of these intermediaries performs its set of dedicated tasks which incur some processing
    delay. Moreover, each intermediary charges some processing fee for the tasks performed.
    All these intermediaries collectively increase the total delay and inflate the
    overall cost to process a transaction. Thanks to the decentralized and disintermediated
    blockchain-based system, users can perform transactions directly at peep level
    without involving third parties or intermediaries. Any one node or miner in blockchain-based
    system can process a new transaction and this update gets registered in the distributed
    ledger. This results in fast processing and a reduction in the overall cost per
    transaction as compared to conventional centralized system. For instance, processing
    of international banking transaction using Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial
    Telecommunication (SWIFT) involves many intermediary banks which may take days
    to complete and charge high transaction cost [83]. However, blockchain-based system
    can process transaction fast and at low cost [83], [84]. • Consensus-based Decision
    Making: To add new content or to update the current blockchain, consensus needs
    to be established among the majority of the nodes in the blockchain network. Thus,
    blockchain dethrones the monopoly and embraces democracy in the system. The algorithm
    required to establish the overall agreement in blockchain infrastructure is called
    a consensus algorithm. A variety of consensus algorithms are available for example
    Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Faulty Tolerance
    (PBFT), Delegated Proof-of-State (DPoS), Proof-of-Burn (PoB), and Proof-of-Activity
    (PoA). Based on the suitability and a given use case, one must be used. • Automation
    Driven by Smart Contracts: Smart contract enhances the capabilities of blockchain
    technology and have been found to be versatile. In particular, smart contract
    helps in exercising tight access control and automating blockchainized systems.
    At any point in time, when the predefined conditions embedded in a smart contract
    are met, the smart contract gets self-executed and performs the required tasks
    without any human interventions. This results in achieving automation among multiple
    untrusting stakeholders in a system. 4. Blockchain for 6G trends and requirements
    - A high-level view This section provides a high-level view of the use of blockchain
    for 6G trends and requirements which were discussed in Section 2. Download : Download

    of blockchain for 2030’s world 6G driving trends. Table 4. Role of blockchain
    for to achieve 6G requirements. Blockchain has significantly outgrown its inceptive
    use in cryptocurrencies like in Bitcoin. It is rapidly emerging as a promising
    technology in other sectors such as supply chain management, healthcare, smart
    manufacturing, education, and other businesses and trades [85], [86]. It holds
    immense potential to transform the way peer transactions, log management, record-keeping,
    decentralized negotiation, trade agreements, audits and compliance, dispute settlements,
    access management, and secure automation (via digital contracts), are carried
    out. Continuing the fundamental trend we have witnessed with 5G, it is evident
    that 6G is going to entail increasingly softwarized, virtualized, intelligent,
    and programmable systems [15], [33]. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note the
    following. On the one hand, concepts like softwarization, virtualization, and
    programmability of the next-generation mobile networks would lead to enormous
    advantages such as agile and open network management and orchestration (MANO),
    multi and micro services, on-demand creation of virtual networks, and multi-tenancy.
    On the other hand, these concepts tend to exacerbate the issues like security
    vulnerabilities, privacy leakage, unauthorized access to user data, dispute-prone
    soft spectrum sharing, fake or corrupted software network functions and control
    APIs, illegitimate resource utilization, and inability to provide differential
    security for differentiated services [87]. Blockchain is entrusted to play an
    alleviating and central role in providing a feasible solution to these issues.
    For instance, 6G networks may witness the availability of open-source software
    for implementing various network functions at core, transport or access levels
    [10]. In such an open environment, blockchain can ensure the correct functioning,
    versioning, integrity, and overall security and trust management for the software
    available to be deployed. In essence, blockchain can be leveraged to improve and
    support the technical aspects of 6G mobile networks as well as uplift the applications
    and use cases envisioned with the realization of 6G. 4.1. Blockchain for 6G trends
    The blockchain and smart contract will play a vital role in 6G trends as well.
    Here we discuss the impact and added benefit of blockchain on the 6G driving trends
    mentioned in Section 2.1. • Massive Availability of Small Data: Blockchain can
    be used to eliminate the data silos and enable the trusted data sharing between
    unknown parties. Smart contracts can automate such transactions. • Availability
    of Self-Sustained Networks: The automation and management via smart contracts
    can reduce the extra overhead on network management and orchestration. Especially,
    decentralized access control and authentication will be used to fully enable energy-efficient
    communications. • Convergence of Communication, Sensing, Control, Localization,
    and Computing: The development of wireless technologies and semiconductor technologies
    will lead to more advanced devices with different capabilities. One device can
    support communication, sensing, control, localization, and computing. This will
    lead these devices to interact with multiple stakeholders simultaneously. For
    instance, sensing information can be shared with MNOs and spectrum regulatory
    bodies [88]. Due to the convergence, not only the collected raw data but also
    computed data models (e.g., in the Federated Leading (FL) use case [89]) can be
    shared with other stakeholders. In such cases, Blockchain can be used to establish
    distributed trust between different stakeholders, protect the integrity of shared
    data and automate the process via smart contacts which encourages the realization
    of convergence. • Expansion of IoT/Zero Energy IoT: Blockchain and smart contracts
    can automate a variety of IoT-related tasks such as authentication, data management,
    payment handling, and agreement management to support scalability. Such automation
    will lead to a reduction in operational costs. In addition, extra blockchain-based
    security and privacy mechanisms can be deployed to protect the IoT ecosystem and
    its stakeholders. • More Bits, Spectrum and Reliability: Blockchain with clearly-defined
    smart contracts can alleviate the spectrum shortcomings against extreme capacity/rates
    by sharing spectrum in a transparent, agile (paperless), and trustworthy manner.
    In other words, it can enable on-demand spectrum via secure and auditable transactions.
    • Gadget-free Communication: Blockchain can play a vital role in ensuring the
    required level of security and privacy. Especially, blockchain-based services
    can be deployed for the establishment of ad-hoc communication with different stakeholders
    in gadget-free environments. Moreover, the trustworthy sharing of user data between
    different stakeholders can also be enabled via blockchains. • Increasing Elderly
    Population: The increasing elderly population will raise different demands, such
    as high demand for health services, the need for more prolonged government services
    (i.e., welfare, pension), and user-friendly and affordable shopping options (e.g.,
    grocery delivery, food delivery). To tackle these requirements, several technological
    solutions are developed and also proposed. E.g., the use of e-health services
    will reduce the cost and stress on existing health services. E-government can
    offer faster and more scalable services than existing legacy government service
    models. UAVs can be used to deliver food and groceries. However, these new technological
    solutions will face deployment challenges such as trust establishment, automation
    support, need for privacy protection, lack of scalability, etc. To tackle these
    issues, blockchain with smart contracts can be used as a viable solution in many
    application domains including healthcare [90], e-governance [91], transport [92],
    and multimedia [93]. In such domains, blockchain and smart contracts can enable
    automation, reduce the cost of operation, support scalability, and provide extra
    security and privacy. • Emergence of New Technologies: Blockchain can be used
    as supporting technology for most of the novel technologies such as AI, humanoid
    robots, new AR devices, and quantum computing. For instance, blockchain can be
    used to eliminate the data positioning attacks on AI systems. Fig. 6 presents
    in nutshell the importance of blockchain for 6G trends. Moreover, the impact of
    blockchain in 6G trends will be discussed in detail under 6G technologies (Section
    5) and 6G applications (Section 6). 4.2. Blockchain for 6G requirements Table
    4 delineates the role of blockchain to support 6G requirements. • FeMBB: Decentrality,
    data sharing, and distributed computation features of blockchain along with smart
    contracts can prove to be instrumental to provide extremely high data rates. Moreover,
    service automation can be enabled with the use of blockchain as a secure and decentralized
    service platform. Nevertheless, the design of lightweight blockchain (in general
    DLT technology) is important because of the computationally intensive nature of
    blockchain. • umMTC: Blockchain-based ultra massive sensing applications, fast
    data exchange without the need of central entities, and trust-building can well
    support the extreme massive connectivity requirement of 6G. However, the design
    of a low-latency blockchain can further enhance the applicability of blockchain.
    • eURLLC: Park et al. [94] have proposed various solutions such as ML-based prediction,
    non-RF modality utilization, and co-design of communication and control for eURLLC.
    Blockchain can support these solutions. For instance, blockchain provides numerous
    benefits like data and model sharing, trusted decision making, and decentralized
    intelligence as presented by Liu et al. [29]. However, how to manage blockchains
    for different verticals and how to speed up the consensus finality need further
    attention. • ELPC: Use of private permissioned blockchain [95] or consortium blockchain
    [96] turns out to be applicable for low-energy communications. Deploying blockchain
    nodes at the edge of the networks or even at gateways [97] can enable power-constrained
    IoE devices to securely store and process data. Nonetheless, it is essential to
    access the impact of energy consumption of blockchain in 6G networks. Furthermore,
    computationally inexpensive consensus mechanisms tailored for ELPC are to be designed.
    • LDHMC: 6G networks will offer seamless connectivity independent of 3D location,
    time, and mobility. Blockchain can provide secure and trusted connectivity monitoring
    and clearing among different network service providers, especially for roaming
    cases. Nevertheless, the overall latency and distributed storage of data from
    the subscribers of heterogeneous networks need innovative solutions. In addition,
    privacy must be guaranteed for dispute-free coexistence. • High Spectrum Efficiency:
    Blockchain-enabled trustless and decentralized spectrum management can pave the
    way for highly spectrum efficient 6G networks. Xu et al. [25] proposed a basic
    blockchain-enabled framework for decentralized resource management. For harnessing
    the full potential, lightweight blockchain is required for small cells and its
    integration for RAN management is to be considered. 5. Blockchain for 6G technical
    aspects This section extensively discusses the use of blockchain to support and
    improve various technical aspects of 6G. The figure Fig. 7 is a panoramic view
    of the various benefits blockchain can bring to the technical aspects of 6G. Download

    of blockchain for improving technical aspects of universal communication system
    envisioned with 6G. 5.1. 3D networking 6G is destined to break the conventional
    two-dimensional (2D) nature of mobile communication systems and emerge as three-dimensional
    (3D) mobile networks to provide truly global coverage [11]. The aim is to extend
    the presence of mobile networks in air, space, underground, and sea. Thus, altitude
    is considered as the third dimension. Since the antennas installed at terrestrial
    base stations are optimized for ground users and cannot support high-elevation
    angles [98], flying technologies, such as UAVs, tethered balloons, and Low Earth
    Orbit (LEO) satellites have been proposed to contribute towards the extension
    of the mobile network ecosystem. In particular, UAV as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs)
    is characterized by flexible mobility, ease of maneuvering, varying capability,
    and Line-of-Sight (LoS) communications [98]. UAVs can provide coverage extension
    using UAV-to-user, UAV-to-UAV, UAV-to-base station, and UAV-to-satellite communication
    in future communication networks [99]. Thus, UAV ABSs can provide wide coverage,
    broadband and reliable wireless connectivity, cost-effective and flexible deployment,
    and pandemic and disaster management. In contract to 5G, satellite communications
    are envisioned as a key component for 6G systems to provide global coverage and
    services including multimedia [1], [100] 5.1.1. Key challenges Some of the impediments
    that exist in establishing a 3D networking paradigm are as follows: • Interoperability
    and data management for heterogeneous networks in a seamless, trustless, and automated
    fashion, turns out to be an important challenge. One way to overcome this issue
    would be to use a network of hierarchical trusted entities. However, such a solution
    is prone to all the issues related to a (logically) centralized system. • Adding
    altitude as a new dimension will open a new attack surface since the ABSs are
    not within the premises of their operators. Moreover, since attackers can easily
    get control of ABSs [101], secure key distribution and revocation are essential.
    • Another challenge is ensuring secure seamless movement of increasing number
    of flying connected devices within different heterogeneous networks. • In addition,
    3D localization, network planning, cell association, and spectrum sharing are
    yet another set of challenges that arise with the use of UAV ABS [98], [102].
    Table 5. Blockchain for 3D networking. Reference Key contribution Blockchain platform
    and consensus algorithm Remarks Sun et al. [103] Highlights the importance of
    using blockchain for SAGIN in terms of decentralized control, privacy, data auditing,
    registration and authentication. However, to overcome the high latency and large
    storage space issues associated with blockchains, authors proposed an architecture
    with multiple blockchains; space chain, air chain, and ground chain. Blockchain
    simulator (Go language), BFT consensus for space and air chains, and DPoS or BFT
    for ground chain. Dedicated efforts are required to ensure security of cross chain
    technology. Moreover, dynamic sharding or DAG to increase throughput and use of
    technique such as zk-SNARK to improve privacy are proposed. Tan et al. [104] To
    remove the dependency on any central authority such as base station, authors proposed
    lightweight blockchain-enabled distributed key management for heterogeneous FANETs.
    Rationale is to include cluster heads which are resourceful UAVs in addition to
    regular UAVs and modify the structure of block and transaction. Miner election
    scheme using distributed random generation (DRG) protocol. The major limitation
    is that cluster heads are assumed to be honest. A rouge cluster head can send
    fake transactions and may revoke benign UAVs from the system. Shi et al. [105]
    To overcome the issues with the centralized (AAA) management of LS-HetNet, authors
    proposed using of blockchain-enabled decentralized AAA scheme. The approach does
    not required use of ACL for exercising access control. Ethereum private blockchain
    Challenges that still need to be addressed are enabling secure routing within
    blockchain and make blockchain lightweight and secure at the same time. Dai et
    al. [106] Highlights the challenges being faced by the emerging Space-Air-Ground-Sea
    Integrated Network (SAGSIN) such as security and privacy issues as well as difficulty
    in resource sharing among heterogeneous networks. By integrating blockchain, network
    slicing and network softwarization, authors proposed frameworks for network management
    and brokerage services for SAGSIN. NA Optimization of large-scale cross-domain
    blockchain-based system is an open challenge to be addressed for maximum benefits.
    Approaches that can be used for cross-domain collaboration are game-theory and
    machine learning based. 5.1.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain has the required
    potential to offer secure and decentralized management of integrated heterogeneous
    mobile networks covering space, air, and ground [103]. In particular, blockchain
    and well-defined smart contracts can facilitate a decentralized solution for distributed
    key management, authentication, authorization, auditability. and trustless interoperability
    among heterogeneous networks (and even among various components of one network).
    Alladi et al. [107] reviewed the role of blockchain for UAVs and highlighted a
    wide range of benefits that can be achieved. Some of them are automated decision
    making, implementation of new business models, load balancing, detection of hijacks
    and data poisoning attacks, and avoidance of mid-air collisions [107]. To overcome
    the high latency and storage-intensive nature of blockchain for Space-Air-Ground
    Integrated Networks (SAGIN), Sun et al. [103] proposed the use of multiple blockchains,
    namely, space chain, air chain, and ground chain. Space chain is maintained by
    satellite network and to make this blockchain lightweight, Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    (BFT) consensus is used. The Air chain is maintained by air network (mostly UAV
    ABSs) and also by some trusted ground stations. Since ABSs are resource-constrained,
    authors used ground stations to perform computational tasks and ABSs simply acts
    like a mobile relay to flying users. Ground chain is maintained by mobile networks,
    ad-hoc networks and WiMAX. Additionally, for interoperability among three chains,
    the authors proposed the use of collaborative blockchain using side chain/relay
    technology. The authors carried out implementation using Ethereum. Their results
    show gains in terms of reduction in storage requirement, high average utilization,
    and reduced failure probability. Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) are considered
    important to realize 3D networking in 6G era by acting as airborne relays and
    providing on-demand extension of radio connectivity [108]. For distributed key
    management in the context of FANETs, blockchain is a promising technology, nevertheless,
    it incurs computational and storage overheads. Thus, to overcome the storage and
    computation issues associated with the use of blockchain for resource-constrained
    drones, Tan et al. [104] used heterogeneous FANETs containing resourceful drones
    (as cluster heads) in addition to usual drones. Moreover, to make use of blockchain
    lightweight for UAVs, authors modified the structure of a block as well as a transaction.
    In particular, the nonce and target difficulty fields were removed. Consequently,
    PoW consensus algorithm is not used. In fact, a miner election scheme is used
    which decides a miner who is given chance to generate the next block. The limitations
    of the proposed work are that the cluster heads are assumed to be honest and deployment
    of resourceful UAVs as cluster heads might be costly and at times not feasible
    for the state-of-art industrial UAVs. Shi et al. [105] deals with the issue of
    centralized management of data generated in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Networks
    (LS-HetNet). The authors put forward blockchain-based decentralized Authentication,
    Authorization, and Auditing (AAA) scheme for providing data access in LS-HetNet
    such that maintenance of Access Control List (ACL) is not required. Different
    phases are used for registration, access provisioning, and revocation of rights
    previously granted to the data consumers. To implement the proposed scheme authors
    used Ethereum private blockchain and evaluated throughput, storage overhead, and
    computation overhead. The results presented show the feasibility of the proposed
    scheme, nevertheless, rigorous testing on real-life testbeds is required to ensure
    efficacy. In [109], authors put forward a framework that comprises mobile mining
    nodes and communicating nodes. The latter types of nodes are connected via a high-bandwidth
    backhaul network and help former types of nodes to communicate mining results.
    Following this approach, authors in [26] integrated blockchain with federated
    learning for 6G edge to deal with disaster management. To ensure security, privacy
    and efficient resource sharing for Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Network (SAGSIN)
    in 6G era, authors in [106] proposed close integration of blockchain, network
    slicing and network softwarization. In particular, blockchain-based network management
    and blockchain-enabled brokerage services are presented for SAGSIN. Some of the
    important functionalities offered by decentralized blockchain-based network management
    of SAGSIN are ID management, authentication, authorization and firmware update
    management. Whereas blockchain-enabled brokerage service for cross-domain environment
    offers secure SLA, peer-to-peer payment settlement, and smart contract based tight
    access control. 5.1.3. Summary The use of blockchain for 3D networking can provide
    decentralized and secure solutions for data accessing, offloading, and interoperability.
    Moreover, the idea of using multiple blockchains along with hierarchical structure
    is highly appealing for 3D networks. Table 5 provides the summary of important
    related works using blockchain for 3D networks. Nevertheless, efforts are required
    to design lightweight encryption mechanisms and consensus algorithms to run blockchain-based
    solutions on UAVs. In the case of the use of multiple parallel blockchains, cross-chain
    security and isolation among blockchains need to be ensured [103]. Furthermore,
    efficient ways are needed to perform transaction prioritization in blockchain,
    and to handle interoperability when different networks have their decentralized
    platforms. 5.2. Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) Radio spectrum is a scarce and
    indispensable resource for mobile communication; thus, its overall management
    (allocation, sensing, and sharing) must be carried out efficiently in 6G networks.
    The traditional way of static spectrum allocation using Fixed Spectrum Access
    (FSA) policy by telecommunication regulatory bodies though ensures legitimate
    use of the spectrum but results in under-utilization of the allocated spectrum
    [110]. In recent years, various Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) mechanisms have
    emerged, such as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), Licensed Shared Spectrum (LSA),
    and Spectrum Access System (SAS) [111]. In general, the DSM system comprises two
    types of users: primary user and secondary user. The primary user (aka incumbent
    user) is an authorized entity with the exclusive right over the allocated spectrum;
    however, it might not be able to utilize the spectrum completely all the time.
    The secondary user is the one who gets access to the unused spectrum shared by
    the primary user. DSA allows the secondary user devices to assess the radio spectrum
    environment continually and automatically adjust operating frequencies to accommodate
    changing capacity/interference conditions [112]. However, the interference-free
    access and QoS is not ensured in DSA [113]. In LSA, the telecom regulatory body
    oversees the sharing agreement to overcome this issue  [114]. In other words,
    a secondary user must get an LSA license from the regulatory body to access the
    spectrum primary user (or the incumbent) is ready to share. MNOs or MVNOs are
    usually the secondary users. The requirement for DSM becomes even more critical
    in 6G era since the number of private networks or local operators are expected
    to increase and coexist with public networks [115]. The successful emergence of
    local (micro) operators calls for dynamic spectrum sharing between MNOs (or other
    incumbent users). 5.2.1. Key challenges • The traditional (centralized) way of
    spectrum allocation and management has numerous challenges. These are high administrative
    cost, security vulnerabilities, privacy leakage, unoptimized spectrum allocation,
    existence of intermediaries to purchase spectrum, slow process of establishing
    spectrum sharing agreement, and difficulty to ensure compliance to SLA transparently.
    • Although cognitive radio provides users the ability to exploit the unused spectrum,
    however, malicious unlicensed Secondary Users (SUs), using the spectrum-sensing
    mechanism, can randomly access the unused spectrum or channels by the licensed-Primary
    Users (PUs). Subsequently, they can launch attacks, such as primary user emulation
    or Denial of Service (DoS), affecting the cognitive radio network’s performance
    and security [116]. • In the case of shared spectrum, the primary issue with the
    private networks is the coexistence, i.e., managing Priority Access License (PAL)
    users and General Authorized Access (GAA) users to ensure how they can coexist
    by sharing the spectrum relatively [117]. Since private networks will continue
    to exist in 6G, designing a dedicated Spectrum Access System (SAS) will be crucial
    and challenging at the same time. 5.2.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain turns out
    to be a highly promising technology for dynamic spectrum allocation, sharing,
    accessing, and overall management, including auctioning and payment settlement.
    In particular, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has already identified
    the potential of blockchain for efficient management of spectrum [120]. Specifically,
    blockchain has immense potential to improve the localized visibility in spectrum
    usage and ease of auditability of overall activities for effective implementation
    of spectrum sharing rules [137]. Table 6. Blockchain for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing
    (DSM). Reference Key contribution Experimental setup Parameters evaluated Remarks
    [118] Considering the centralized dynamic spectrum sharing attack prone and non-transparent,
    authors proposed blockchain-enabled privacy-protected double auction mechanism
    for decentralized and auditable dynamic spectrum sharing. Truffle framework along
    with IPFS were used to develop a DApp Spectrum provider’s revenue and social welfare
    (difference of spectrum demanders’ utility and providers’ utility) The task of
    determining the winner of double auction mechanism is formulated as integer linear
    programming and solved using Hungarian algorithm. [119] To overcome the high administration
    cost and the privacy issues faced by the traditional CBRS, authors leveraged blockchain
    to propose distributed CBRS. Furthermore, ring signature is used to ensure users’
    privacy, and proof-of-strategy is proposed as a new lightweight consensus algorithm.
    Simulations using MATLAB platform Failure rate of system, recognition rate (of
    both authentic users and malicious users), and system utility were evaluated Genetic
    algorithm is used to solve the consensus puzzle which is a class of binary integer
    programming. [120] To improve the resource utilization in 6G networks, authors
    presented collaborative blockchain and AI for dynamic resource sharing. In particular,
    blockchain is used for achieving security, automation, regulation, and payment
    settlement, whereas, AI is used to attain improved pattern recognition and intelligent
    decision making. Simulation based setup is used and traffic is modeled using Poisson
    process Profit ratio and throughput per licensed time slot are evaluated Two-tier
    blockchain structure is used — local blockchain per area (comprises of mobile
    devices and base station of that area) and global blockchain (comprises of all
    the base stations). [121] To address the issue of low utilization efficiency of
    radio spectrum, authors proposed blockchain-based automated pricing model for
    secondary spectrum market trades among Primary Licensed Operators (PLOs). Simulation
    based experimental setup is used Total revenue of PLOs, floor values and sensitivity
    analysis are performed A new blockchain token named as spectrum dollar is used
    as incentive for spectrum trades in secondary markets. [122] To enable secure,
    privacy protected, and incentivized sharing of underutilized spectrum by H2H users
    for M2M communications, authors proposed blockchain based two-stage framework.
    In the first stage, H2H enters into contract with base station to share spectrum,
    and in second stage this shared spectrum is shared with M2M devices. Simulations
    based experiments are performed Amount of shared spectrum resources and utility
    of primary and secondary users are evaluated Contract theory is utilized to resolve
    the incentive optimization problem under information asymmetry. [123] To meet
    various challenges & functionalities required by increasing private local operators,
    authors put forward Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform. In particular, various
    functionalities such as subscription management for service registration, reputation
    management for service quality, fraud prevention for roaming instances, and data
    management are enabled in a decentralized and secure manner. Simulation based
    experiments using MATLAB and implementation using Ethereum test network Rinkeby
    are done Roaming cost, service charge, error rate, execution and transaction costs,
    and latency are evaluated. The structures used for various smart contracts used
    for DApp are given in the paper. [124] To effectively realize micro-operator based
    small cell deployments, authors presented blockchain and SDN integrated architecture
    where the complex service level agreements (SLAs) are coded as smart contracts.
    These smart contracts run on blockchain layer which logically sits on top of SDN
    layer. Ethereum private blockchain with PoW consensus algorithm and simulation
    module. Received signal strength, network throughput and transaction scalability
    are evaluated. Cost savings, and increase in network coverage with guarantee QoS
    are the main advantages of deploying micro-operator based small cell. Table 7.
    Summary of security attacks and tentative mitigation techniques with blockchain.
    Attack Description Blockchain based solution DDoS Attacks An attacker targets
    the resource consumption or protocol vulnerability of a single victim node by
    using malicious codes installed on several computers. Authors in [125] proposes
    a blockchain-based approach for intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation.
    They use smart contracts to facilitate collaboration among SDN-based networking
    domains. The work [126] use smart contracts for AI-based DDoS detection and mitigation.
    Eavesdropping An illegal action of a third party to secretly capture data being
    exchanged between both sides of communication. [127] adopts the blockchain platform
    (Ethereum) to decentralize a dynamic distributed honeypot system and store the
    port access data by delivering a private chain. Scanning attacks Send requests
    to all ports of a target host, aiming at exploring the opened ports and further
    exploiting associated bug to launch attacks. In [127], a private blockchain is
    used for encrypted communication and services transformation. It mitigates spoofing
    attacks with changing service IP addresses due to transformation property. Spoofing
    attacks This attack occurs when fake entities can trick users into sharing information
    for malicious activities. Use multi-layered blockchain framework for smart mobility
    data-market to enforce fair trade with smart contracts. The identity keys will
    reduce the number of fake users and node spoofing attack [128], [129]. Man-in-the-Middle
    This happens during data transmission where an adversary eavesdrops, intercepts
    and manipulates the information. The work [130] uses an ultra-lightweight RFID
    protocol targeted for integration in a supply chain management system that utilizes
    permissioned blockchain network. Sybil attack Adversaries create numerous fake
    identities to gain a disproportionately large influence. Trusted transaction mechanism
    is developed with permissionless tamper-proof blockchain-based data structure
    for storing transaction records of agents without central control [131]. Selfish
    mining attack When the selfish miners attempt to increase their rewards by deliberately
    keeping their blocks private Introduce a life-time or an expiry time for the blocks
    to prevent block withholding by selfish miners. Author in [132] formulate a set
    of Markov chains to capture the state transitions of private and public chains.
    Hijacking A network security attack divert traffic of legitimate users and network
    towards hijacked addresses. In [133], a blockchain based distributed prefix authentication
    protocol is used in ICN for authenticating mobile users. Each router in the network
    authenticates the prefix to verify the ownership before updating and forwarding
    the state of the network. Poisoning attack Attackers intentionally inject false
    data into the training pool of ML model. Replace the central authority by a blockchain
    system integrated with federated learning from the aspect of fog servers [134].
    The work [135] employs a private blockchain to deliver a collaborative deep learning
    task in IoT. Privacy attack Attackers intentionally capture personal data of the
    users and to impose attacks. Using digital signatures generated for a group of
    blockchain participants where group members remain anonymous [28]. Zero-knowledge
    arguments and proofs methods [28] and Coin mixers [136] are some other techniques
    to protect privacy. In contrast with the traditional exclusive frequency allocations,
    spectrum sharing by definition involves multiple entities with shared access rights
    to use the spectrum. Here, the users exchange spectrum usage rights to fulfill
    their needs [138]. In this regard, blockchain can be used to set-up a trustless,
    decentralized and open spectrum trading platforms. Nevertheless, blockchain-empowered
    open trading of spectrum resources may lead to privacy issues like revealing trading
    patterns or leakage of bids made in auction-based spectrum sharing. Various privacy-protection
    mechanisms based on blockchain and smart contracts can be used to protect the
    trading entities from such privacy threats. In this line of approach, Tu et al.
    [118] presented a double-auction scheme, which is deployed as a smart contract
    in a blockchain platform. To preserve the privacy of users, differential privacy,
    in addition to asymmetric encryption, is used during the bidding process. Furthermore,
    the problem of determining a winner in the double auction scheme, is formulated
    as Integer Linear Programming (ILP). With a similar aim to overcome the privacy
    risks plus the issues like administrative overheads and single-point-of-failure
    associated with traditional Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), Zhang et
    al. [119] proposed a distributed CBRS model using blockchain. CBRS, originally
    proposed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is regarded as a potential
    candidate to meet the high spectral efficiency requirement for 6G. Authors, in
    particular, put forward Proof-of-Strategy (PoS) as a new consensus algorithm that
    is not only lightweight but also integrates with the spectrum allocation process,
    i.e., the system reaches the consensus by evaluating the spectrum allocation strategy.
    Moreover, the use of ring signature technique protects privacy by ensuring unlinkability
    between users’ real-world identities and their pseudonyms. Similarly, Hu et al.
    [120] posited two-level hierarchical blockchain architecture powered by AI to
    manage spectrum resources effectively. In particular, authors manifest the use
    of blockchain to offer improved functionalities such as resource advertisement,
    spectrum regulation, a record of spectrum usage, and financial settlement. AI
    is suggested to provide usage pattern recognition using deep learning and intelligent
    decision-making using deep reinforcement learning. Moreover, the use of hierarchical
    blockchain reduces administrative costs, decreases computational and storage overheads,
    and minimizes the complexity of consensus algorithms. Nonetheless, blockchain
    overheads and techniques to acquire the training data for AI models with complete
    privacy compliance are still challenging. Furthermore, blockchain can enable guarantee
    SLA and dispute-free fast financial agreements for quasi-real time spectrum sharing
    (i) between different MNOs, and (ii) between MNOs and micro/local operators [139].
    For instance, Khan et al. [121] leveraged blockchain to carry out fair trading
    of spectrum in the future Secondary Spectrum Market (SSM) by eliminating the possible
    economic malpractices. In particular, the authors proposed tokenization of spectrum
    in form of a new virtual coin named ‘Spectrum dollar’. Thus, their proposition
    allows disintermediation of financial (central) exchanges and faster financial
    settlement. Moreover, the authors used the floor-and-trade rule to tune the price
    of a spectrum dollar to maximize the profit, minimize the loss, and ensure loss-free
    trading. Nevertheless, building confidence and onboarding MNOs and local operators
    to such decentralized solutions with spectrum tokenization will be challenging.
    Blockchain has been shown to assist the sharing of spectrum by Human-to-Human
    (H2H) users with mobile networks to cater to the massive connectivity needs for
    M2M communications. Zhou et al. [122] proposed a blockchain-enabled framework
    that (i) preserves privacy in terms of spectrum sharing cost announced by H2H
    users, which acts like primary users and share their spectrum, (ii) facilitates
    optimized incentives to H2H users by employing contract-theory, and (iii) optimizes
    the allocation of the shared spectrum (by H2H users) to M2M devices by developing
    a matching solution. In general, such a technique can be helpful in dynamic spectrum
    management in future convergence of heterogeneous networks towards 3D networks.
    Nevertheless, the scenario involving multiple services and multiple base stations
    still needs to be studied, as stated in their work. In context of MNOs augmented
    with micro/local operators, blockchain as a service has been proposed to automate
    the secure management of spectrum between MNOs and local operators. Such a service
    can provide: (i) selection of spectrum owners (i.e. MNOs acting as primary user),
    (ii) open auction in secondary spectrum market, (iii) direct P2P payment for spectrum
    sharing, and dynamic creation of agreement using smart contracts [123]. With similar
    intent, Okon et al. [124] implemented a blockchain-based mechanism for spectrum
    sharing and SLA compliance in a multi-operator scenario characterized by small
    cell deployment by micro-operator. The authors implemented blockchain network
    as an overlay on SDN infrastructure. 5.2.3. Summary In nutshell, the broad roles
    of blockchain for 6G spectrum management are (i) decentralized, open and privacy-protected
    platform for intelligent spectrum trading, (ii) dispute-free and fast setting-up
    of agreements, (iii) tokenization of spectrum and P2P fast payments, and (iv)
    ease of monitoring and auditing to ensure SLA compliance while sharing spectrum.
    In particular, blockchain can be used as a secure and decentralized database for
    spectrum management that can record all the activities related to spectrum management.
    Table 6 provides the summary of related works that focus on using blockchain for
    spectrum management. Though there are significant advantages in using blockchain
    for dynamic spectrum management, however, deployment of blockchain network within
    the premises of cognitive radio network is challenging keeping in mind the resource-constrained
    mobile users [110]. Other practical challenging task will be the onboarding MNOs
    and local operators to a blockchain-based open platform which has no central authority.
    5.3. Security Security is an all-time important property in telecommunication
    and networking. Starting from no security mechanism and hard handovers in 1G,
    authentication, anonymity, and encryption-based security were introduced in 2G
    [5]. In 3G, security features of 2G were enhanced by introducing Authentication
    and Key Agreement (AKA), two-way authentication, and 3GPP’s air-interface security
    and network authentication by users [7]. With 4G Enhanced Packet System-AKA (EPS-AKA),
    mutual authentication, trust mechanism, and handover key management were introduced.
    5G incorporated many advanced security features like better mutual authentication
    capabilities, Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI), Extensible Authentication
    Protocol-AKA (EAP-AKA) [140], and 5G-AKA, Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption
    Scheme (ECIES) based identification mechanism [141], [142]. In future 6G networks,
    many security challenges may encounter due to extremely large network of heterogeneous
    networks, and the expected extremely higher reliability requirements. In order
    to thwart more sophisticated adversaries, advanced and intelligent security mechanisms
    will be needed [31], [143], [144]. 5.3.1. Key challenges Following are few security
    challenges identified in the envisioned 6G networks. • Confidentiality and integrity
    will be challenging since the future 6G infrastructure may portray enormous threat
    surfaces with wireless connectivity and the massive data volume generated in the
    network. • Uninterrupted service accessibility will be another challenge because
    the broader threat surface and massive connectivity will enhance the risk of Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks [5], [145]. • The authentication and access control
    mechanisms need to be scaled-up to meet the diversification of 6G tenants, which
    are resource-intensive and may create bottlenecks in associated services. In particular,
    the centralized way of access control poses significant challenges in the design
    of future networks [7]. • Auditing will be another challenging security perspective
    due to the assessment requirements of a huge number of tenants (e.g., managing
    network slices among multiple tenants.). • With the emergence of ubiquitous intelligence
    in 6G, AI/ML based security attacks may also incur in 6G networks. In contrast,
    AI can be used as a tool for detecting, predicting, and mitigating security attacks.
    Therefore, the deployment of proactive security mechanisms and detection of zero
    day attacks will be vital security challenges in 6G [146], [147]. Download : Download

    attacks and challenges in 6G networks along with the security features which may
    accompany with blockchain. 5.3.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is emerging as
    an intriguing solution to implement security, accountability, surveillance and
    governance of mobile networks. Table 7 summarizes the possible security attacks
    that can occur in the next generation of mobile networks and their possible mitigation
    using blockchain. Blockchain-based 6G networks may resist the eavesdropping and
    hijacking threats using the blockchain properties such as immutability, transparency,
    non-repudiation, and provenance. Blockchain provides decentralized means of trust
    among untrusted users because it can withstand Sybil attacks [148], [149], [150].
    Notably, in a Sybil attack, an attacker creates a large number of fake identities
    in a peer-to-peer network-based system and gains higher influence because of the
    sheer size of fake identities. By using efficient consensus protocols, such as
    PoW, blockchain ensures only genuine users control the system [151], [152]. Also,
    as only the participating nodes can view or add new transactions, such a combination
    will mitigate the chance of data modification and man-in-the-middle attacks. In
    addition, authentication, access control and accountability are key security aspects
    that can be addressed by deploying well-designed smart contracts on top of the
    blockchain. Furthermore, as stated in [29], the use of blockchain allows (i) secure
    training of AI/ML models based on the immutable data stored on blockchain typically
    in heterogeneous network scenario, (ii) trust-building by transparently storing
    data related to the decision-making process in AI/ML based systems, and (iii)
    trustless collaborative optimization of ML models by secure exchange of model
    parameters. For AI/ML functions, it is vital to have trusted execution for security.
    Smart contracts provide a distributed mechanism for that purpose. For instance,
    the developed smart contract in [153] is used to detect network anomalies and
    malicious traffic, thus providing an analysis of network traffic between industrial
    IoT with a trained deep learning model in a secure distributed environment. El
    Azzaoui [154] proposed a framework ‘Block5GIntell’ where the support that blockchain
    can provide to AI for building secure 5G networks is discussed. Since will have
    AI at its core, blockchain has a significant role to play for 6G networks. From
    a different perceptive, 6G business ecosystem will be comprised of numerous stakeholders
    and business players, all working together to achieve common goals. Security will
    be of paramount importance to build trust among these players. In summary, Fig.
    8 provides an illustration of possible security attacks and challenges in 6G networks
    along with the security features which are offered by blockchain. The circles
    indicate two key components of a 6G network, namely distributed AI and intelligent
    radio, which have the closest relationship with the applicability of blockchain
    for the security landscape. The possible types of attacks for which blockchain
    based solutions can be adopted in the envisioned 6G networks are listed on the
    left side rectangle in the figure. The attacks may occur at different levels such
    as edge level, application level, device level, wireless air interfaces, external
    network, or different 6G verticals. Moreover, the security threats may be exacerbated
    with network softwarization and the use of AI/ML techniques. Among these categories,
    the specific attacks that can be mitigated using blockchain are discussed in Table
    7. Also, blockchain can be used for authentication, authorization and key management
    purposes in the communication networks [155], [156], [157]. Having a common communication
    channel in the form of blockchain will introduce trust among multiple stakeholders
    in 6G network to cooperate on a common platform even at unexpected failures of
    the networks [158]. 5.3.3. Summary Based on the above-related works, blockchain
    can be used as a security enabling technology in 6G networks to address the security
    features such as authentication, access control, communication integrity, availability,
    and accountability. Moreover, blockchain-based solutions can be formed to protect
    6G networks from several attacks as presented in Table 7 and Fig. 8. However,
    incorporating such blockchain based security solutions will still be challenging
    in the 6G networks due to increase in device heterogeneity, the convergence of
    heterogeneous networks towards 3D networking, growth in big-data, and additional
    computational resources required for blockchain. Moreover, the security issues
    of blockchain itself need to be addressed from the perspective of 6G. 5.4. Privacy
    Given that a significantly higher level of heterogeneity will characterize the
    6G ecosystem (in terms of users, devices, applications, services and stakeholders),
    privacy for such a complex ecosystem will be equally important, if not more, than
    security [159]. Preserving privacy while collecting, aggregating, and processing
    data in many application domains of 6G, such as healthcare, environmental protection,
    smart city, and social survey, will be essential [160]. Moreover, with every aspect
    of human lives getting connected and using of AI-enabled applications, both data
    privacy and user privacy must be protected. In addition, the novel 3D networking
    paradigm will allow the proliferation of flying connected devices. Despite the
    myriad of practical applications of UAVs, there are privacy concerns such as identity,
    trajectory (location), and mission privacy [161]. Thus, privacy will be an essential
    requirement for 6G networks, and compliance to privacy laws like GDPR [162] need
    to be ensured. 5.4.1. Key challenges Privacy preservation will be a significant
    consideration in the complex 6G network ecosystem. • The unauthorized access to
    virtualized networking resources can impose a high risk of connected users’ privacy
    [159]. Therefore, secure access control is one key challenge that arises for privacy
    preservation in vast data sets in 6G networks [107]. • With the emergence of massive-scale
    sensing systems (e.g., using UAVs) with cameras and sensors continuously collect
    data from surroundings, there can be many instances that may cause violation of
    data privacy. For example, crowd monitoring drones that collect information on
    large gatherings may impose threats on individual’s privacy. • Due to the enormous
    amount of data at centralized points such as data aggregation servers, data providers,
    and service providers, there can be the risk of privacy leakage [28]. • Since
    AI/ML are key enabling technologies of 6G, while collecting individual personal
    related data for training models, the risk of revealing data may create privacy
    attacks [146], [163]. 5.4.2. Role of blockchain Privacy is another technical aspect
    that can be met with the use of blockchain in 6G networks [28]. Having a common
    communication channel in the form of blockchain, can allow network users to be
    identified by pseudo names instead of direct personal identities [148]. Manogaran
    et al. [159] proposed a blockchain-based integrated security measure (dubbed as
    BISM) for 6G communication environment. In the proposed measure, virtualized resource
    access control and user privacy-preserving techniques are modeled with low time
    complexity and memory consumption. The authors considered the connected users
    and the virtualized resources, and the access control decisions are taken by maintaining
    the states of the resources using a Q-learning procedure. The performance of privacy
    preserving is measured by the user and resource level with respect to time complexity
    and memory consumption. However, the drawback is that the authors do not present
    the deployment of their proposed solution in a real blockchain platform. As stated
    in [164], the use of blockchain for 6G-enabled UAV communication is significantly
    efficient compared to the current communication networks. It may provide higher
    privacy and transparency during data acquisition and air traffic management while
    allowing fast uploading of data with higher bandwidth and lower latency among
    UAV applications. In [160], the authors proposed a blockchain-based privacy-aware
    distribution collection-oriented strategy for data aggregation. In their solution,
    privacy protection is achieved by improving blockchain with a new block header
    structure to decompose high sensitive tasks and actors into different groups.
    However, they do not provide the exact details on how the block header modification
    can be performed for data aggregation in a trustless network. Fan et al. [165]
    proposed a privacy preservation scheme that grants complete data ownership based
    on blockchain for content-centric 5G networks. The clearly defined access rules
    govern who gets to access the user’s data and when, i.e., time. Moreover, the
    adopted key management and the use of encrypted data strengthen privacy. The work
    considers the mutual trust between the users and the content providers and exploits
    a public blockchain. In addition to that, as stated in [166], blockchain technology
    can be applied together with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption techniques
    for enabling privacy preservation in 6G. Privacy preservation using machine learning
    is an emerging research area. In [167], authors design a blockchain-based architecture
    for secure data sharing among distributed entities by incorporating privacy-preserved
    federated learning. More specifically, federated learning is used to build and
    share data models instead of sharing the actual data, and differential privacy
    is used to protect data privacy. However, on one hand Blockchain is using as a
    tool for privacy preservation, on the other hand the transparency in the blockchain
    networks may affect the privacy requirements in the 6G networks. Particularly,
    in the permissionless blockchains, transparency and openness may create harmful
    effects to the user privacy [168]. Mixing services are integrated as a solution
    to achieve on-chain transaction privacy. For instance, the mixing services allow
    different users to collaboratively form one transaction with multiple inputs and
    outputs. Thereby the attacker is unable to distinguish the connectivity between
    the transaction inputs and the corresponding outputs. 5.4.3. Summary Although
    preserving privacy will always add an extra overhead, it is quite important as
    it will be an implicit indicator that ensures trust among the stakeholders in
    future 6G networks. However, ensuring the proper accountability to assure the
    privacy protection aspects of fully automated AI-driven systems in future networks
    will be a challenging research area. As described in the above section, the existing
    literature reveals the efforts of exploiting blockchain for privacy preservation
    in 6G as well as the drawbacks. The use of blockchain for 6G privacy needs to
    be handled carefully for keeping the correct balance between data privacy protection
    and the system performance for computational overhead. 5.5. Resource management
    Efficient resource management and sharing have become crucial due to the scarcity
    of networking, computing, and memory resources. In 5G networks, softwarization
    and virtualization based technologies such as SDN, NFV, and NS, have enabled efficient
    management of resources. Nevertheless, with the ever-growing number of subscribers
    and their connectivity requirements of more data-hungry and computationally advanced
    applications, resource management will be more challenging in 6G. On the other
    hand, the emergence of micro-operator-driven local networks promises to serve
    customized and location-aware needs of industry verticals and other organizations
    [169]. Although these local networks deployed as small cell can guarantee QoS
    and reliability, however, for their successful deployment, on-demand infrastructure
    sharing is essential [123]. Thus, the resource management in the next generation
    of networks must undergo drastic improvements to minimize the cost and maximize
    the utilization of the resources while catering to the existing and the new range
    of services and applications. 5.5.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges
    pertaining to resource management in 6G networks are as follows. • As the number
    of network tenants (e.g., industry verticals) are increasing in parallel to the
    number of traditional mobile users; resource management will become more complicated
    [170]. In particular, the complexity arises not just due to massive connectivity
    requirements but also due to the time-varying and heterogeneous (at times orthogonal)
    service demands. Optimized management of physical and virtual resources under
    such dynamic scenarios will be challenging. • Centralized orchestration of resource
    trading would not be able to scale-up and meet various demands of network tenants
    and infrastructure providers in terms of security, transparency, and trustless
    trading. • The next-generation networks are becoming more distributed systems.
    Therefore, the networking and computational resources have to be managed by considering
    local availability and global requirements. 5.5.2. Role of blockchain The role
    of blockchain in 6G networks can be closely coupled with the dynamic resource
    management of next-generation networks. There are numerous alleviating roles that
    blockchain can play in future network softwarization related services. These services
    are automatic slice brokering, secure and optimized VNF placement, proactive service
    migrations to the edges, and transparent incentive mechanisms for sharing of unused
    resources. Blockchain-based network slice brokering is used to enable the dynamic
    interoperability and resource trading requirements of market players such as infrastructure
    providers, consumers, and mobile network operators in trading the network and
    computational resources [171], [172]. In addition to facilitating on-demand resource
    allocation and resource trading for RAN, computational resources, and storage,
    the slice broker performs admission control based on traffic monitoring and forecasting,
    including mobility, based on a global network view. In [173] authors studied the
    feasibility of blockchain and smart contracts to enabled network slice brokering
    in 5G networks. In particular, secure and autonomous network slice creation for
    industrial automation use case has been analyzed. Various industrial automation
    microprocesses such as testing, resource croudsourcing, sorting, grafting and
    streamlining have been considered and the applicability of blockchain-enabled
    5G network slice broker for these microprocesses has been explored. Another pertinent
    work is [174] where authors proposed a blockchain-based decentralized resource
    trading and distributed task assignment scheme for IoT devices. Game theory based
    smart contracts are used for the process of optimal resource trading among the
    participants. The consensus mechanism in their solution guarantees the reliability
    and security of distributed resource trading and task assignment. Likewise, in
    [175], the Stackelberg game theory model is exploited in edge computing resource
    trading for mobile blockchain. In particular, they consider the offloading of
    mining computation tasks to the edge computing service providers in a multi-user
    environment. In [176] also, the authors propose the use of public blockchain for
    MEC network with a Stackelberg game-based learning framework. Blockchain has also
    been exploited for edge caching and slice orchestration at the edge of the network
    [177], [178], [179]. In [177], the authors consider a joint resource allocation
    in blockchain-based MEC using a double auction mechanism. Using a tamper-proof
    ledger in blockchain, the authors could prevent the malicious edge servers from
    tampering with the player information. The resource management in edge clouds
    will be challenging due to the requirements of reliability, scalability, and fair
    service allocation. As stated in [180], blockchain can be used to face these challenges
    since it does not need a centralized scheduler, can handle intelligent contracts
    and ensure security. When the blockchain-based resource management schemes do
    not require a centralized scheduler, it can improve the robustness of the edge
    computing paradigm. Furthermore, blockchain capabilities can be utilized when
    spare or unused computational capabilities of nearby mobile and other devices
    need to be harnessed. In this scenario, smart contracts along with tokenized rewards
    can be used to compensate such nearby devices for sharing their resources [181].
    However, in terms of device performance, the resource management in 6G with blockchain
    has two-fold problems. On the one hand, it has to develop lightweight blockchain
    solutions for low-cost low-performing devices. On the other hand, high-performance
    blockchain and decentralization for the vertical industries and future networks.
    Moreover, the use of public blockchains for resource management may create privacy
    breaches [182]. 5.5.3. Summary Throughout this section we have identified few
    research efforts where blockchain is used for resource management in 5G and 6G
    networks in terms of resource trading with network slice brokers, edge caching,
    and wireless resource utilization. Table 8 provides the summary of important related
    works using blockchain for network resource management. Based on the above related
    works, the key limitations encountered with the use of blockchain for resource
    management include the extra overhead and the privacy breaches. Table 8. Blockchain

    service providers in order to make it a promising approach for more complex future
    networks. However, the feasibility of the proposed solution is proposed only with
    the simulation results. Asheralieva et. al. [176] Propose a hierarchical learning

    and the privacy of users. No implementation is provided in this work. 5.6. Ubiquitous
    intelligence In 6G, the concept of hyper-intelligence envisions a smart and autonomous
    networks which will facilitate key operational functions such as self-configuration,
    self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization with minimal human effort
    and intervention [183]. Furthermore, the network services and applications will
    be hyper-flexible, customizable, and adaptive in a self-driven manner to provide
    the best user experience ubiquitously. This cognitive network inherently aims
    to integrate AI/ML as a native element in future networks, i.e., ubiquitous intelligence.
    For instance, the first step towards hyper-intelligent networks is ETSI ZSM architecture
    entailing closed-loop operation and AI/ML techniques with pervasive automation
    of network management operations [184]. Furthermore, distributed learning and
    intelligence schemes such as Federated Learning will be widely used across the
    network as a mechanism for distributed AI in heterogeneous settings [185]. 5.6.1.
    Key challenges The key challenges for ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks can
    be summarized as follows: • Complexity and optimization for AI/ML: The diversity
    and complexity of 6G networks will lead to challenges in terms of human-in-the-loop
    management and system optimization tasks. Autonomic and self-driven management
    and optimization schemes are crucial. However, the complexity of such intelligent
    schemes and how they can be optimized are challenging questions [12]. The overall
    complexity is to be managed, and the AI/ML adoption should be optimized. • Integration
    of trusted nodes into distributed learning settings: The distributed nature of
    intelligence in 6G calls for an integrated operation of disparate parties for
    smart infrastructure. This is also due to the multi-party and multi-domain structure
    of softwarized and service-based architecture inherited from 5G networks and extended
    further [186]. However, trustworthiness for AI/ML agents is a not trivial attribute
    and may impair the intelligence performance in 6G networks. • Secure data sharing
    for pervasive intelligence: The centralized storage and management feature in
    6G AI applications may incur threats to data security (e.g., stealing or malicious
    tampering due to compromise of the server), resulting in privacy violation and
    interference with normal network functions [27]. This is an important challenge
    for large-scale and multi-party networked systems such as 6G. • Large-scale AI/ML
    applications: The ubiquitous intelligence for various use cases and applications
    will lead to a more decentralized data storage and exchange architecture in 6G.
    This drive is also related to the cooperative and federated services and infrastructure
    flexibly bound together for smart immersive environments and objects. An important
    challenge is how to devise and integrate technologies to enable such scalability
    for ubiquitous intelligence. 5.6.2. Role of blockchain Since the pervasive use
    of AI/ML will be realized in a distributed and large-scale 6G system for various
    technical aspects including network management, distributed AI/ML techniques are
    supposed to enforce rapid control and analytics on the extremely large amount
    of generated data in 6G networks. Blockchain can provide important functionalities
    towards ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks. One such aspect is AI governance
    and data sharing. Governing and sharing the learning results efficiently, reliably,
    and safely are hampered by the heterogeneity and non-confidence among edges. For
    instance, in [187], Qiu et al. elaborated on the concept of blockchain energized
    edge intelligence for B5G networks and develop a distributed and immutable record
    of learning results, namely, Ai-Chain. Furthermore, the authors developed a new
    learning-based consensus protocol called proof of learning (PoL) that considers
    the results of local training processes running at edge learning nodes as a race
    that needs a consensus on the winning node. However, their work assumes every
    edge node to have the same number of neural cells and the same number of layers
    in their neural network. In realistic scenarios, this might not always be feasible.
    Another important role of blockchain is to support context awareness and autonomicity.
    Hyper-intelligent 6G networks have to be context-aware for network management
    as well as providing smart digital services. It is possible with ultra-scale sensing
    functions (discussed in the following paragraph), which will support such context-aware
    operation. Additionally, they need to be self-driven and autonomic to be able
    to meet performance KPIs. Blockchain will provide trusted execution with smart
    contracts and data sharing for context-awareness and, consequently, autonomic
    operation. However, the complexity of blockchain-based solutions for that purpose
    may lead to a burden. Ultra-scale sensing is another important capability as the
    integration of advanced sensor technologies with mobile networks accompanied by
    low-energy communication capabilities will lead to pervasive intelligent sensing
    and localized services [188]. Blockchain will also serve as a decentralized and
    trustworthy data stratum for ultra-scale sensing and big data analytics in 6G.
    This is a crucial utility of blockchain since sensing is a foundational pillar
    for intelligent services and networks. As an application of blockchain for intelligent
    sensing in Beyond 5G networks, Reebadiya et al. proposed a blockchain-based secure
    and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for CAVs using beyond 5G communication
    networks in [189]. Their proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and object
    tracking through blockchain by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers while
    the B5G network enables low latency and high reliability communications for serving
    these time-sensitive applications. For 6G networks, the anticipated services require
    very stringent and consistent QoE/QoS performance. This is only possible through
    a very effective and smart resource management framework in the network access.
    However, the resource scarcity and efficiency requirements make this kind of operation
    challenging. Control of massive-scale intelligent surfaces is a particular management
    challenge in 6G. The use of programmable intelligent surfaces to cover man-made
    structures (e.g., buildings, roads, indoor walls) allows intelligent control of
    the transmission environment in wireless systems [190]. Such intelligent surfaces
    are going to play an important role for 6G networks and will be beneficial the
    quality of radio signal is degraded. In a blockchainized 6G network, blockchain
    provides the key capability of facilitating federated control among disparate
    intelligent surfaces. Moreover, intelligent surface control functions from different
    administrative domains (e.g., different network operators) can exchange synchronization
    and reconfiguration information using blockchain. 5.6.3. Summary Blockchain can
    serve as an enabler for implementing pervasive intelligent networks via secure
    data sharing, immutability, and decentralized architecture. The decentralized
    paradigm also provides a more robust intelligence stratum for the entire network
    ranging from smart devices to cloud services. It can facilitate federated very
    large-scale AI/ML applications for smart and autonomous digital connected services.
    Therefore, a decentralized and secure data sharing technique without a so-called
    trusted third entity or intermediary, i.e., blockchain is promising in future
    6G [27]. However, the overhead, scalability, and interoperability challenges of
    blockchain are especially apparent on the way to achieve the ubiquitous intelligence
    objective of 6G. For instance, the energy consumption due to blockchain functions
    such as consensus and cryptographic operations are challenges limiting the utility
    of blockchains. This phenomenon heralds the critical need for analysis of the
    energy and environmental impact of pervasive blockchain adoption in 6G, and thus
    research for its minimization is essential. Moreover, the scalability aspect needs
    to be improved for realizing ultra-scale intelligence solutions. There are also
    new attacks emerging which try to impair the reliability and accuracy of AI/ML
    solutions using blockchains, which the research community needs to heed more elaborately
    in the future [28]. 5.7. Mobility management Since 6G networks will be a super-dense
    network of networks and will make use of a higher frequency spectrum (GHz/THz
    range), the 2D cell boundaries would shrink to a few meters [8]. This drastic
    reduction in 2D cell size would require more base stations to cover the same area,
    and so the expected number of handovers for mobile users will also increase exponentially.
    Furthermore, because of the non-optimized handover mechanisms for various overlapping
    and small coverage base stations (such as Picocell, Femtocell, and UAV-based ABSs),
    the handover probability (HOP), Handover Failure Probability (HFP), Handover Ping-Pong
    Probability (HPPP) effect, and Radio Link Failure (RLF) will increase significantly
    [191]. Subsequently, it will have an adverse impact both on throughput and delay.
    On the other hand, the advent of 3D networking will support 3D mobility of flying
    users, requiring new mobility management techniques since handover will also happen
    in vertical direction [2]. As 6G aims to offer ultra-reliable low-latency communication,
    the efficient management of mobility is very crucial [191]. 5.7.1. Key challenges
    Some of the challenges pertaining to mobility management in next-generation networks
    are as follows. • Distributed Mobility Management (DMM), an initiative of IETF,
    has numerous security issues such as impersonation attack, session hijacking,
    DoS attack, man-in-middle attack, and attacks by malicious entities involved.
    These issues make DMM’s use challenging for mobility management. • To ensure the
    secure handovers and avoid performance degradation, forward secrecy is crucial,
    which protects the past session keys (and corresponding communications) even if
    the long-term secrets of UE and APs are compromised in the future. In addition
    to the forward secrecy, simultaneously achieving other requirements (e.g., mutual
    authentication, key agreement, traceability, and robustness) is a significant
    challenge [192], [193]. • Use of centralized authentication server for mobility
    management leads to both performance and security issues. • Roaming fraud due
    to inefficient and delay-prone data exchanges between a home network and a visitor
    network causes high economical losses [194]. Such roaming fraud can be a critical
    challenge in future 6G networks because of the densification of networks, 3D networking,
    and popularity of micro-operators powered local/private networks [123]. 5.7.2.
    Role of blockchain The combination of blockchain and smart contracts can establish
    trust among mobile users and mobile networks in a distributed and anonymized fashion.
    Various use of blockchain to efficiently manage mobility in wireless networks
    are discussed as follows. DMM aims to overcome the issues (e.g., single-point-of-failure
    and sub-optimal routing) related to traditional centralized mobility management
    [195]. The rationale of DMM is to distribute the control of mobility across the
    network. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Sharma et al. [196], DMM suffers from
    security issues like session hijacking, DoS attack, and attacks by Mobile Anchors
    and Access Routers (MAARs). These issues are mainly because security is implemented
    in a centralized manner. Thus, authors in [196] proposed blockchain-based DMM,
    which provides distributed security, fault-tolerance, and identity management.
    Though their scheme has been shown to be promising, however, high storage redundancy
    due to multiple distributed ledgers is challenging. Furthermore, how the initial
    authentication of mobile devices happens is not discussed and is assumed to happen
    using a private secure channel. Lai et al. [197] provides a solution to handover
    authentication for group communication scenario in VANETs where mobility of fleet
    of vehicles is to be managed. The authors used aggregate message authentication
    code, one-time password, and blockchain to reduce the handover overload. The proposed
    protocol uses Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) algorithm for session key management.
    The protocol uses blockchain in which the vehicle, control mobility databases,
    and mobility access routers, store the vehicle’s key information, which mobility
    access routers can use later to authenticate the vehicles. In addition to fulfilling
    the security requirements such as session key confidentiality and immunity towards
    reply attack and sybil attack, the authors demonstrate that the proposed scheme
    is effective in the context of handover latency and computation and communication
    overheads. Similarly, the use of blockchain for authentication during handover
    while protecting user’s privacy in SDN-based 5G Networks has been presented by
    Yazdinejad et al. [198]. As 6G will use SDN and NVF to manage the networks efficiently,
    it is expected that blockchain can play a significant role in mobility management.
    The authors in [192] proposed RUSH, which provides anonymous mutual authentication
    with key authentication, robust traceability, and perfect forward secrecy by using
    chameleon hash functions and blockchains. In RUSH, after the initialization phase,
    a user registers in a network to get the service. Subsequently, the user prepares
    for the handover phase. It first chooses a pseudo-identity, computes various parameters
    to prove the legitimacy of his identity, and submits the authentication parameters
    to the access point. The access point checks the freshness of the information
    to prevent replay attacks and verifies the legitimacy of the authentication parameters.
    The authors compared the proposed mechanism in terms of authentication message
    sizes and the storage cost and concluded that both the parameters decrease in
    the proposed scheme. The authors used Burrow-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic to check
    the security properties of the proposed anonymous mutual authentication. Furthermore,
    to formally verify the proposed authentication mechanism, the authors used AVISPA
    model checkers. For ensuring the secure handover key management with complete
    forward key separation, Lee et al. [199] proposed a novel approach, named Parallel
    Blockchain Key Derivation Function (PB-KDF). Their proposed architecture comprises
    an entity named Authentication Center, which initially collects the public keys
    of all the Base Stations and then puts them together to form a genesis block.
    This genesis block is then shared with all the Base stations in a geographical
    area belonging to one administrative domain. By doing so, all the base stations
    get public keys of all the other base stations that they can use for secure communication.
    When a user device joins a base station, the base station sends the genesis block
    to the user device. Upon receiving the genesis block, the user device sends its
    public key and a timestamp to the base station. The base station shares this information
    with other base stations. Hence, each base stations have the same data about the
    user, which is used for creating a proof-of-work challenge. Similar to [192],
    the authors in [199] used BAN logic to prove various security objectives and evaluated
    the performance of their system in terms of packet loss vs. distance between base
    stations, latency incurred because of handover failure rates, and key derivation
    time. With the same intent to provide forward secrecy and meet the lightweight
    requirement for resource-constrained mobile devices and protect the privacy of
    users, Hu et al. [193] proposed an anonymous, temper-resistant and seamless handover
    authentication scheme. Their proposed scheme uses a chameleon hash function and
    blockchain-protected user certificate to perform handover authentication. When
    a user registers at the authentication server, the latter generates a unique certificate
    and uploads it to the blockchain. When the user moves to a new access point, s/he
    is authenticated by cross-checking with the original certificate available on
    the blockchain. The authors analyzed the security and efficiency of the proposed
    authentication scheme. They showed that their scheme provides conditional privacy
    based on the pseudonymity feature of blockchain, immunity to various attacks (like
    replay, man-in-middle, and passive eavesdropping attacks), and perfect forward
    secrecy of session key. Mobility of UE can also result in a roaming situation
    when the source and destination base stations belong to two different networks.
    The home network is where the UE is officially registered, and the visitor network
    is the one that has a prior agreement signed with a home network to provide services
    to the customers of the home network. Usually, it takes significant time to establish
    such roaming agreements, and also they are static in nature. The latter implies
    that traditional roaming agreement is apt when there are a standard set of services
    [200]. However, for heterogeneous, agile, and customized services as offered in
    5G (and are expected with 6G), dynamic agreements are needed. Blockchain and smart
    contracts are considered to realize such dynamic roaming agreements [123]. Another
    vital issue associated with the current roaming system is roaming frauds that
    result in significant revenue loss. The primary cause behind roaming fraud is
    the presence of third-party entity called Data Clearing House (DCH). This DHC
    stands as an intermediary between a home and a visitor network and introduces
    a significant delay that hinders the home network from charging mobile UE under
    roaming, precisely [194]. To overcome the issue of roaming frauds, authors in
    [123], [194], [201] proposed the use of blockchain. In particular, authors in
    [194], [201] make use of blockchain and Stackelberg game theory based economic
    model to ensure secure communication, enable fast and decentralized data exchange
    between home and visitor network, and maximize profits of involved parties. 5.7.3.
    Summary Blockchain has been shown to have the potential to provide key derivation
    (with full forward secrecy) during handover, maintaining anonymity during authentication,
    reducing overall authentication overload, deploying fair economic incentive policies
    and mitigating roaming frauds. Significant research work has already manifested
    blockchain as an efficient tool to implement secure mobility management for MNOs,
    local operators, VANET, fog networks, and in general wireless mobile networks.
    Its role in 6G will continue to solve similar issues. However, the cost paid to
    use blockchain for mobility management is in the form of high storage requirements
    and additional computation resources to implement blockchain. Also, achieving
    transparency and verification while ensuring a fair incentive mechanism in a mobile
    environment is challenging as the number of UE estimated to use 6G networks are
    going to highly mobile and very volatile. 5.8. Other emerging technical aspects
    Some of the other technical aspects that can be ameliorated with the use of blockchain
    are discussed as follows. 5.8.1. Zero-touch network and service management (ZSM)
    ZSM, an initiative of ETSI, is an emerging paradigm to achieve the E2E network
    and service automation. The ultimate goal of ZSM is to realize a hundred percent
    autonomous networks capable of self-configuration, self-optimization, self-monitoring,
    self-healing, and self-scaling without any human intervention [202]. Thus, ZSM
    leads to flexible and agile delivery of services by ensuring economic sustainability
    in the diversified networks [72]. The ZSM architecture is formed using intent-based
    interfaces, closed-loop operation, and AI/ML techniques to empower full automation
    of the management operations. 6G complex ecosystem is envisioned to be comprised
    of multi-tenants, multi-operators (strengthened by local/micro operators), and
    multiple (virtual network) service providers. Thus, ZSM will play an instrumental
    role for 6G networks in achieving E2E automation of network resources and services
    that fall under different parts of a mobile network (e.g., core, transport, and
    radio access) spanning over multiple operators and service providers. Blockchain
    and AI-driven operations may support cross-domain security and trust orchestration
    mechanisms in the proposed ZSM architecture by assisting service lifecycle automation
    in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments [203]. DLTs like blockchain
    can be adopted to implement distributed security and trust through smart contracts
    among both trusted and non-trusted multiple parties (i.e., multi-tenant and multi-operator
    scenarios) [204]. This approach can be further combined with distributed AI for
    cognitive network orchestration, leading to zero-touch network automation. Thus,
    blockchain has the potential as a promising technology to promote trust in zero
    touch network management. However, it is still challenging to maintain the proper
    balance between data privacy and trust in a blockchain-based automated system
    to operate with assured information security. 5.8.2. Edge Computing (EC) and Federated
    Learning (FL) Edge Computing (EC) will continue to play a key enabling role in
    6G networks by extending the computing and caching facilities offered by cloud
    servers to the edge of the mobile networks, i.e., very close to the end-users.
    Some of the well-known advantages of using EC are the closest proximity, extremely
    low latency, location and context awareness, real-time access, and high bandwidth
    capacity. Further, the potential use of AI/ML techniques within the premises of
    edge computing is popularly called Edge AI. However, for AI/ML based systems,
    there is a need to frequently send a significant volume of raw data to a centralized
    server to perform the training of AI/ML models. This uploading of raw data can
    lead to possible challenges in terms of data and user privacy, communication overheads,
    and extra load on resource-constrained mobile devices [205]. To overcome these
    issues Federated Learning (FL) turns out to be a promising distributed AI solution.
    In FL, statistical models are collaboratively trained directly at the participating
    devices with the locally generated (private) data. Thus, instead of sharing the
    raw data, FL allows devices to upload the locally trained model to the server.
    Blockchain is being considered as tool for Edge AI [187] and edge-based FL platforms
    [89] to provide trust, security, and strict access control. AI-native 6G is envisioned
    to offer intelligent predictive pre-caching at the edges to meet the needs of
    network tenants, efficiently. However, to carry out such analytics and prediction,
    logs of user’s activities are fed to AI/ML algorithms that raise privacy concerns.
    In this regard, Sun et al. [177] developed blockchain-driven edge caching architecture
    that aims to optimize both the cache hit rate and the redundancy rate while ensuring
    security and user’s privacy. There is an increasing number of works that aim to
    harness the synergy between FL and EC using blockchain. For instance, Lu et al.
    [206] use digital twins to improve the reliability of EC applications by creating
    digital twins of IoT devices in the EC server and performing data analysis on
    the digital replica present on the edge servers. Here, the authors used a blockchain-based
    FL to secure and protect data privacy of digital twins. In [207], authors proposed
    blockchain-enabled FL scheme for digital twin edge computing platform serving
    a huge number of IoT devices in 6G era. With the help of numerical results, the
    authors showed that their proposal can boost the communication security and preserve
    data privacy. 5.8.3. Interference management The process of managing the radio
    spectrum to minimize the interference and maximize the efficiency of spectrum
    utilization is referred to as interference management. Different types of interference
    are co-channel interference, adjacent channel interference, out-of-band interference,
    and remote interference. Co-channel interference occurs when two or more users
    transmit on the same frequency in the same geographic area. It reduces Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR), hence reducing the throughput [208]. Adjacent channel interference
    happens when the receiver cannot reject off-channel signals of the desired signal
    at reference sensitivity level due to an adjacent channel signal. It occurs because
    the adjacent channel interferer’s modulation products are falling in the receiver’s
    IF passband [23], [209]. Out-of-band interference, also known as sideband noise,
    happens when transmitter emissions fall outside the transmitter’s intended channel
    bandwidth. This noise permeates into the adjacent channels or other bands and
    adds to the thermal noise floor of the receiver. Remote interference takes place
    when, during certain atmospheric conditions, downlink transmissions travel a large
    distance and interfere with uplink reception of another base station despite the
    guard period as the downlink generally has much higher transmit power than the
    uplink [210], [211]. It is a large-scale phenomenon, and thousands of base stations
    may interfere with each other at the same time [212]. Gamal et al. [213] emphasized
    the fact that the inference management for the next-generation wireless networks
    will see a significant difference as compared to the current generation wireless
    networks. In particular, the authors focused on Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP)
    communication, which can boost the rate gains at the reduced delay. Nevertheless,
    CoMP suffers from unequal gains for participating users in every channel. To overcome
    the issue, the authors proposed a blockchain-based monetary mechanism that drives
    a greedy distributed strategy to avoid interference. The blockchain-based monetary
    mechanism uses a coin that is traded between the participating nodes. A node represents
    a transmitter–receiver pair. A node i pays a coin to node j , either when node
    i produces interference at the node j ’s receiver or when node i rents the transmitter
    of node j . Though their proposition is promising, however, the work needs to
    be evaluated with a prototypical implementation. Another interesting work by Vishal
    et al. [214] suggested using blockchain-enabled on-demand drones to support inter-service
    operability with minimal interference in the network. The authors presented the
    idea of forming an aerial blockchain comprising drones from different vendors.
    Thus, these drones are said to socialize via blockchain and form a common platform
    to provide interference-free fronthaul communication for a highly dense user environment.
    In summary, blockchain-based solutions can improve interference management by
    enabling dynamic collaboration and trust among the users. Furthermore, using blockchain
    for allocating frequency spectrum based on fair and trusted economic schemes can
    also avoid interference among primary and secondary users [25]. However, remote
    interference management would be complex, especially as 6G envisions to provide
    connectivity to UAV; remote interference would create problems both for UAVs and
    base stations. 5.8.4. Tactile Internet The evolution of the internet from mobile
    Internet to the Internet of things (or everything) is now moving towards Tactile
    Internet that aims to communicate physical, tactile experiences in real-time [215].
    Thus, Tactile Internet requires ultra-reliable, ultra-responsive, and ultra-secure
    network connectivity with extremely low latency. Since these requirements match
    the 6G KPI, Tactile communications are envisioned to be rolled out in 6G era.
    Nevertheless, the key issue is to maintain data integrity and access control while
    delivering real-time control using tactile communication [216]. As in tactile
    communication, information related to the kinesthetic perception (such as applied
    force, the exact position, and velocity) and tactile perception (such as surface
    texture and necessary friction) will be transmitted to be reproduced at the receiver.
    Thus, any kind of security and privacy vulnerabilities will have a severe impact.
    For instance, in telesurgery, the consequences can be fatal. The use of blockchain
    has been looked upon as a possible solution to deal with security and privacy
    issues in Tactile Internet [217]. Hassija et al. [218] proposed a blockchain-based
    framework for drone-mounted base stations in the Tactile Internet environment.
    The authors used permissioned blockchain with authorized nodes and smart contracts
    to prevent any dispute. These nodes run on drones mounted with small cell stations
    and cellular base stations. Hassija et al. [219] put forward the use of blockchain
    to perform secure mobile data offloading in Tactile Internet scenario. The authors
    highlight that conventional blockchain suffers with poor scalability, inefficiency,
    and no provision of timestamp-based ordering required to handle mission-critical
    time-sensitive applications. To overcome these issues, the authors make use of
    (i) Hashgraph, which is based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and (ii) game-theoretic
    bargaining model. The use of Hashgraph offers consensus timestamp and Asynchronous
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT) mechanism, which is immune to colluding nodes,
    and the use game-theoretic model allows cost-effective negotiation for offloading.
    5.8.5. Quantum Communication Quantum Communication (QC) is an emerging communication
    paradigm that encodes the information in a quantum state using photons or quantum
    particles and transfers these quantum states from one place to another [15], [74].
    The security comes from the fact that the information cannot be accessed or cloned
    without tampering the quantum state because of quantum principles like the correlation
    of entangled particles, quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, the no-cloning
    theorem, and inalienable law [11], [53], [220]. There are several applications
    of QC, such as quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing in long-distance
    communication with improved data rates due to the superposition nature of qubits.
    For instance, Liao et al. [221] have exhibited intercontinental QC between earth
    stations located in China and Austria using Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite as
    a relay. The distributed secure data storage and smart contract based strict access
    control features of blockchain can well support quantum (or semi-quantum) communication
    based applications in 6G era. Due to the complexity of quantum devices and their
    high prices, at present semi-quantum techniques are proposed. They aim to integrate
    quantum with classical cryptographic techniques. Zhu et al. [222] put forward
    two semi-quantum reflection protocols using blockchain technology for security
    enhancement and efficient management of Internet of Vehicle (IoV) scenario. The
    authors considered all the exchanges (as part of the semi-quantum protocol) over
    quantum channels as ‘transactions’ in blockchain parlance. Their proposed IoV
    architecture is shown to be immune to most of the attacks under the no-cloning
    theorem and unbiased-chosen basis (UCB) assumption. Nevertheless, more research
    efforts are required to gauge the clear benefits that blockchain can bring to
    QC, especially the role of blockchain for routing in multi-hop quantum communication
    [223], quantum entanglement and quantum parallelism based MAC protocols [224],
    and for error detection and correction in QC [13]. Download : Download high-res

    Industry 5.0 applications. 6. Blockchain for 6G use cases and applications Distributed
    ledger technologies such as blockchain are expected to play a vital role in future
    6G communication networks to enable numerous trending applications such as industry
    5.0 enabled factories, holographic teleportation, extended reality, and connected
    autonomous vehicles [31], [95], [225]. Furthermore, [226] evaluates blockchain
    and IoT use cases and presents that blockchain and smart contracts align well
    together with the microprocesses related to value creating resource configuration
    that is capable of being realized through modern microservice technologies. In
    addition, the shift from conventional value chains to decentralized platforms
    will also lead to value propositions towards the end-to-end business ecosystem.
    This section elaborates on several 6G-enabled use cases and applications that
    are envisaged to harness the capabilities of blockchain. Each application is described
    highlighting the key challenges and how blockchain can act as an enabler to realize
    them. Table 9 summarizes the role of blockchain for 6G-enabled use cases in terms
    of features offered, types of blockchain used, consensus algorithms used, expected
    throughput and latency, and the potential blockchain platforms. 6.1. Industrial
    applications in Industry 5.0 Industry 4.0 aimed to increase the productivity and
    efficiency of smart industries by intensively using Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS)
    that harness the mMTC and URLLC capabilities of 5G networks [227]. Industry 5.0
    will advance the Industry 4.0 concept with the efficient use of machines and human
    workers in a synergistic environment to personalize autonomous manufacturing [58].
    Notably, in Industry 5.0, humans will be expected to perform high-level and creative
    tasks while the autonomous machines will be conducting mundane and time-consuming
    work. Industry 5.0 applications will leverage AI/ML technologies together with
    VR/AR/XR, digital twins and advanced robotics. This gamut of technologies will
    facilitate human–robot co-working (with collaborative robots aka cobots) and customized
    manufacturing processes while increasing production efficiency, minimizing wastage
    and environmental pollution [228]. 6.1.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges
    related to Industry 5.0 in future 6G communication networks are given below. •
    Scalable communication infrastructure will be required for Industry 5.0 to connect
    a large number of devices facilitating human–machine interactions on top of automated
    applications [229]. Moreover, storage and processing of the generated Big Data
    will also be a challenge for Industry 5.0. • The overall network should be secured
    against possible attacks while personal and sensitive data are being gathered.
    In particular, human–robot interactions can raise privacy concerns as they may
    collect personal data [230]. Thus, privacy compliance will be indispensable, and
    the challenges will be automated monitoring and secure auditing. • Efficient utilization
    and security of AI/ML techniques are essential for Industry 5.0 applications to
    enable automated decision making. • Although the existing cloud manufacturing
    has numerous advantages, however, it is prone to all the issues related to centralized
    systems and dependency on third-party entities [231]. • Federated and optimized
    use of computational resources available in the surroundings will be essential
    to meet the future dynamic requirements of industrial applications. However, the
    challenge will be how to incentivize and automate such resource pooling. 6.1.2.
    Role of blockchain It is envisaged that blockchain will play a key role in facilitating
    Industry 5.0 applications in future 6G networks in the coming decade [232]. The
    role of blockchain towards enabling Industry 5.0 in future 6G networks is illustrated
    in Fig. 9. According to Wu et al. [233], blockchain enables many features towards
    establishing industry infrastructure by enabling enhanced scalability, security,
    and privacy. In particular, blockchain integrated with edge computing is capable
    of offering the above features in the IIoT scenario by distributing computing
    across the IIoT infrastructure and offloading computationally intensive tasks
    to the edge servers. In this direction, a blockchain-based secure edge intelligence
    platform is proposed by Zhang et al. [225] to facilitate edge services in an IIoT
    environment. In this work, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques are utilized
    to improve the efficiency of the blockchain-based distributed edge resource utilization.
    The nodes that contribute towards edge intelligence by performing tasks such as
    transaction validation in the blockchain are rewarded with a novel credit-differentiated
    transaction approval scheme. This scheme is reliable and incentivizes the nodes
    to participate in blockchain-related operations. However, the realization of this
    approach requires efficient AI processing mechanisms and smooth interoperability
    between diverse blockchain technologies. A communication protocol that uses blockchain
    and smart contracts to enable autonomous agents to make independent decisions
    on economic actions in industries is presented in [234]. This protocol arranges
    economic interactions that are performed between autonomous agents using a P2P
    network that is based on blockchain. Authors used Ethereum for implementation,
    where the smart contracts were linked with the Robot Operating System (ROS) communication
    framework of autonomous agents. The connection between physical sensors and the
    Ethereum blockchain is performed through Open Platform Communications United Architecture
    (OPC UA) while InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed storage system,
    is used for storage. However, the smooth operation of this protocol requires autonomous
    agents to be equipped with sufficient RAM and computing resources. The limitations
    imposed by the centralized framework in the existing cloud manufacturing architecture
    can be solved by introducing blockchain driven decentralized architectures. For
    instance, blockchain-based cloud manufacturing architecture is proposed in [231]
    to facilitate on-demand secure services, secure data exchange, and effective collaboration
    between multiple parties. In the proposed architecture, the user part of the architecture
    consists of the end-user, while the blockchain cloud manufacturing part consists
    of the core layer, blockchain networks, and the cloud manufacturing layer. Here,
    the important challenge is to virtualize cloud manufacturing in the blockchain
    network. Blockchain can provide a high level of security by storing all the data
    and transactions in the shared ledger which is replicated at all the nodes in
    the network. To meet this requirement of secure and efficient exchange of big
    data in an industrial environment, Zheng et al. [235] proposed an IIoT data management
    system the harnesses the best of blockchain and distributed off-chain storage
    system like IPFS. Furthermore, the authors used Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structured
    IOTA Tangle to meet the high scalability, immutability, and low operational cost
    requirements. This method facilitates better data exchange among IIoT devices
    to facilitate advanced data-driven techniques in Industry 5.0. Blockchain capabilities
    can be utilized when spare or unused computational capabilities of nearby mobile
    and other devices need to be harnessed. In this scenario, smart contracts along
    with tokenized rewards can be used to compensate these devices [158]. Furthermore,
    in case of dispute or ownership violation, blockchain-assisted management of Intellectual
    Property (IP) rights will be a rescue [236]. 6.1.3. Summary Based on the existing
    works, it can be concluded that blockchain turns out to be a promising technology
    for Industry 5.0. It can enable Industry 5.0 applications by providing features
    such as improved security and privacy of data and stakeholders, secure use of
    AI and ML for autonomous operations, optimized cloud manufacturing, and agile
    and dispute-free business agreements between companies, their partners and customers.
    However, there are aspects that require more efforts such as building of standard
    application programming interface (APIs) for development of DApps, enhancing scalability
    and security of blockchain-enabled IoT system, and optimized allocation of networking,
    storage, and computing resources for running blockchain [233]. These gaps are
    yet to be filled towards utilizing blockchain as an enabler of Industry 5.0 in
    future 6G era. 6.2. Smart healthcare 6G communication networks will revolutionize
    the smart healthcare sector by going beyond space and time barriers [38]. 6G technology
    will be able to meet the stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of healthcare
    applications such as ultra-high reliability, extremely low latency, and high mobility
    [237]. Intelligent Wearable Devices (IWDs) will be instrumental in health monitoring
    and early detection of various health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease [238].
    The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will form a network of medical devices,
    equipment, and people, aiming to exchange healthcare data seamlessly [239]. Moreover,
    in the 6G era, the convergence of smart devices and the use of AI/ML techniques
    will lead to Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) facilitating early
    diagnosis and intelligent preventive healthcare [38]. Patient visits to hospitals
    can also be minimized by enabling medical staff to be virtually present using
    technologies such as XR applications to discuss patient issues [240]. Hospital-to-Home
    (H2H) services will be implemented on a mobile vehicle platform that will be facilitated
    with medical equipment and will have minimum dependence on hospital resources,
    including medical professionals [38]. Telesurgery with 6G enabled tactile internet
    can use fully automated robots or robots that work in collaboration with humans.
    Thus, 6G as underlying communication infrastructure will realize a complex, intelligent
    and connected healthcare paradigm. 6.2.1. Key challenges The smart healthcare
    applications in the 6G era require overcoming a significant number of challenges
    as follows. • Besides a wide range of benefits offered by the digitization of
    healthcare systems with the use of smartphones, IoMTs, and cloud services, there
    has been a significant increase in privacy breaches in the healthcare industry
    [241]. Thus, the key challenge of 6G-envisioned intelligent healthcare system
    is to ensure complete privacy protection. • Future healthcare systems require
    extremely high reliability and availability ( > 99 . 99999 % ) [1]. • Decentralized
    operation of IIoMT devices comprising cyber–physical systems in smart healthcare
    applications should be facilitated. • Managing a large number of IIoMT devices
    requires autonomous operation between devices. • Providing harmonious cooperation
    between different stakeholders such as hospitals, government agencies, and insurance
    companies to provide better healthcare services. Download : Download high-res

    6G networks for smart healthcare. 6.2.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is emerging
    as a promising candidate to support the future 6G-envisioned smart healthcare
    ecosystem. Fig. 10 illustrates the envisaged use of blockchain in the healthcare
    domain. According to [242], the management of Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
    is one of the popular use-cases of blockchain in healthcare. MedRec, GHN, HealthChain,
    MedBlockm, and BlockHIE are some of the reported blockchain-based applications.
    Since privacy-protection of medical data is very crucial, thus in this context,
    Dwivedi et al. [243] proposed a decentralized healthcare blockchain for secure
    management of healthcare-related big data for IoT environment. Their system combines
    the benefits offered by blockchain together with lightweight cryptographic approaches.
    In particular, a lightweight ring signature is used to ensure the anonymity of
    transactions and the ARX algorithm (a type of symmetric key encryption) is used
    to encrypt data to be uploaded on the blockchain. Moreover, Diffie–Hellman technique
    is used to securely exchange keys using public channel. The use of lightweight
    mechanisms alleviates the system from satisfying the powerful computational and
    bandwidth requirements of blockchain such as consensus algorithms (e.g. PoW).
    Therefore, their proposed system is more suitable for a resource-constrained IoT
    environment. However, the proposed system is still prone to attacks like DoS attack.
    With a similar intent, Zghaibeh et al. [244] presented a blockchain-enabled healthcare
    platform named as Smart-Health (SHealth) to ensure features such as security,
    availability, reliability, trustworthiness, and efficient data management. SHealth
    is based on three layers; government, users, and IIoMT devices. The proposed system
    uses a permissioned blockchain implemented on a modular hypeledger fabric utilizing
    the PBFT consensus mechanism. Smart contracts are capitalized to automate the
    process of facilitating user requests such as medical appointments, tests, and
    access to medical history. However, realizing such a comprehensive system would
    require multiple blockchain platforms to seamlessly interoperate and integrate
    with the existing standalone medical platforms. Real-time telesurgery is another
    application that is expected to be realized in the future by 6G-enabled smart
    healthcare sector. In this regard, a blockchain-based framework named HaBiTs is
    proposed by Gupta et al. [245]. The work emphasizes achieving interoperability
    and security using smart contracts on top of blockchain for telesurgery in healthcare
    4.0. This framework suggests the use of permissioned blockchain platforms such
    as hyperledger fabric (or consortium blockchain). Being a distributed platform
    owing to the usage of blockchain, this platform does not require multi-level authentication
    while the system performance and cost efficiency are enhanced. However, the implementation
    of such a proposition and its testing under various types of attacks would be
    necessary for a clear understanding of the pros and cons of blockchain-based telesurgery.
    Blockchain has also been identified as a key technology to deal with global pandemic
    like COVID-19 [246]. Such unprecedented situations demand sharing of healthcare
    data among various stakeholders across the borders. In the context of COVID-19,
    contact tracing has been implemented as a mechanism to monitor close physical
    interactions among the people. In case an individual is diagnosed with the disease,
    people who had close contact with the infected person can be identified based
    on the information collected from the contact tracing application. However, such
    contact tracing applications must overlook patient’s/user’s privacy. Accordingly,
    Zhang et al. [247] proposed the integrated use of 5G and blockchain for a privacy-preserving
    contact tracing scheme named PTBM. In particular, the authors used 5G as underlying
    high-speed communication infrastructure and used blockchain together with bloom
    filter and Public-Key Cryptosystem with Distributed Decryption (PCDD) for privacy
    (identity and location) protection. The authors used two different blockchains;
    permissionless blockchain accessible to the people using contact tracing application
    and permissioned blockchain providing restrictive access to medical organizations,
    medical centers and fog nodes. Hyperledger fabric was used to show the high computation
    efficiency and low cost of communication. Nevertheless, large-scale testing and
    benchmarking of such blockchain-enabled contact tracing are essential. Furthermore,
    with the emergence of 6G, AI/ML techniques, and big data analysis, blockchain-enabled
    could be used to predict, model and analyze future epidemics. Yet another important
    challenge being faced by the healthcare domain is the fair and transparent acquisition
    of data for research, commercial products, and drug development. This challenge
    can be well-addressed by blockchain, as discussed by Mamoshina et al. in [248].
    The authors proposed a blockchain-powered framework to build a marketplace that
    uses LifePound as a new crypto utility token. Such a marketplace helps user to
    sell their biomedical data directly to the consumer and earn LifePound. Furthermore,
    to allow the exchange of large-sized files, cloud storage services (which can
    be made to comply with privacy laws like HIPAA) are used, thereby making the solution
    scalable with off-chain storage. Furthermore, the authors suggest the use of threshold
    encryption to boost security. In threshold encryption willingness of multiple
    parties is necessary for the decryption of data. Nevertheless, building an effective
    real-time pricing model for data selling/buying is still an important question
    to be answered. 6.2.3. Summary Blockchain has proven itself to be a suitable candidate
    to resolve security, privacy, trust, and auditability issues of smart healthcare
    applications in the future 6G era. Specifically, blockchain in healthcare can
    help realize telesurgery, avoid counterfeit medical equipment and drugs, enable
    secure and remote patient monitoring, automated processing of health insurance
    claims, and establishment of an open market for profitable medical data acquisition.
    However, blockchain technology should mature in several directions, including
    improving interoperability, scalability, and transaction speed. Furthermore, privacy
    laws and regulations should also see appropriate amendments to facilitate the
    decentralized storage and operation of sensitive health data. 6.3. UAV applications
    UAVs, colloquially called drones, are another interesting application that is
    expected to flourish with the dawn of 6G [53], [249]. The market capitalization
    of drones for industrial and commercial applications was 19.3 billion USD in 2019
    and is projected to grow up to 45.8 billion USD by 2025 [250]. UAVs are considered
    to emerge as an another key application of future 6G mobile networks. While UAVs
    had their inception in military applications, their role is rapidly growing in
    civilian applications. Some of the civilian applications of UAVs are management
    of ground traffic in smart cities, video coverage of live events, video surveillance
    at industrial scale, remote sensing, wildlife survey, delivery of goods and packages,
    smart agriculture, smart construction, and short distance air taxis [1], [107].
    Furthermore, UAVs can enable intelligent transportation systems [251]. The key
    features of UAVs are ease of deployment, line-of-sight connectivity, and controlled
    mobility [252]. In addition, UAV-to-Everything (U2X) networks are also envisaged
    together with the developments of 6G and IoE [253]. Moreover, UAV or Unmanned
    Aerial Systems (UAS) require a solid UAV Traffic Management (UTM) system to operate
    fully autonomous UAVs safely beyond visual line of sight [254]. UTMs require efficient,
    secure, and risk-free communication to manage their movement in the urban airspace.
    It is envisaged that 6G will enable a UTM ecosystem focusing on terrestrial and
    non-terrestrial features supporting mobile, aerial and satellite communication.
    6.3.1. Key challenges The deployment of UAV-based applications in 6G communication
    systems will encounter many challenges; some of them are discussed as follows:
    • UAV applications in B5G and 6G communication networks need to be highly available,
    reliable, and fault tolerant [250]. • UAV networks are prone to different types
    of security vulnerabilities such as cyber-attacks, jamming, hijacking, eavesdropping,
    and privacy attacks [255]. Therefore, ensuring security and privacy in UAV applications
    are considered to be pivotal [256]. • The latency should be minimized to facilitate
    UAV applications. • The operation of large UAV swarms should be automated efficiently.
    6.3.2. Role of blockchain The use of blockchain offers many unique features that
    can help better realize 6G-enabled UAV applications. For instance, Mehta et al.
    [250] discussed the integration of blockchain with UAV networks to solve the inherent
    issues such as fault tolerance, reliability, energy efficiency, latency, QoS,
    and bandwidth. The distributed nature of blockchain offers increased fault tolerance
    for UAV networks if one or more nodes are disconnected. These nodes will be synchronized
    once they are reconnected. Furthermore, the security vulnerabilities of UAV communication
    can be addressed through blockchain owing to decentralized security management
    techniques. The energy efficiency and latency issues can be solved through lightweight
    blockchain architectures. Trusted access point groups are utilized to improve
    the access efficiency, and thereby QoS and blockchain-enhanced cloud platforms
    with efficient cryptographic algorithms are suggested to facilitate low latency
    [250]. Sharma et al. [257] proposed a blockchain-based method to utilize drones
    as on-demand caching nodes towards facilitating ultra-reliable communication in
    MEC. This neural blockchain based drone caching approach banks on blockchain to
    ensure high reliability, availability, and survivability amongst peers. Blockchain
    is used as a distributed ledger shared with all nodes in the network which are
    identified through their public keys. Moreover, Kuzmin et al. [258] presented
    a blockchain-based approach for performing secure operations in semi-autonomous
    UAVs. In this approach, each UAV in the UAV communication network (UAVNet) acts
    as a blockchain node. To minimize the threat on the communication channel between
    UAV and ground station, the fly route is included as a smart contract in the blockchain.
    Thus, UAVs can consider sensor data and the flight schedules of other UAVs to
    avoid any collision when operating autonomously. The consensus algorithm used
    in this blockchain UAV network is Proof-of-Game (PoG). However, the successful
    implementation of this requires facilitating the dynamic participation of UAV
    groups and autonomous information exchange mechanisms, while memory limitations
    of UAVs should be addressed. Furthermore, blockchain based privacy preservation
    methods in 5G and beyond UAV communication networks are presented in [259]. For
    instance, blockchain can be used for an efficient UAV ID management system, which
    will be robust, tamper-proof, and minimize single point attacks. Furthermore,
    smart contracts can be used to automate the process of ID management. In addition
    consensus mechanisms such as PoW and PBFT can make UAV networks resistant against
    malicious attacks, including Sybil attacks. Protecting drone trajectory information
    through blockchain-based access control and authentication methods is another
    way of preserving user privacy. However, several aspects of blockchain need more
    research and development, such as low efficiency and resource overhead of consensus
    algorithms, research constraints of UAVs, and scalability of blockchainized UAV
    networks. In addition, [260] explores UTM related security issues and proposes
    UTM-Chain, which is a lightweight blockchain-based security solution. This security
    solution is based on utilizing hyperledger fabric for UTM of UAVs in low-altitude
    by addressing computational and storage resources limitations of UAVs. The proposed
    method integrates the blockchain technology with UTM components. The architecture
    of the proposed system is based on a permissioned blockchain network. Blockchain
    is also utilized to store transactions and control the access to flight data that
    are securely stored in a decentralized off-chain database. The access is controlled
    through blockchain and smart contracts. Therefore, the proposed UTM-Chain also
    provides secure and reliable data transmission between UAVs and ground stations
    in envisaged 6G networks. 6.3.3. Summary Blockchain is emerging as a viable technology
    to realize UAV applications in the future 6G networks. It offers unique features
    such as decentralized decision-making, strong security while exchanging data between
    UAVs and between UAVs and ground stations, privacy protection of the sensed data,
    automated collaboration, identity management, mission secrecy, and tight access
    control through smart contracts. However, several issues, including increased
    scalability, lower latency, and resource constraints in UAVs, need further research.
    6.4. Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) Another prominent use case of the future
    networks will be Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which will demand advanced
    technologies for real-time sensing, secure connectivity, and automate vehicle
    decisions [261]. CAVs evince, on the one hand, the convergence of connected vehicles
    powered by V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communication facilitated through dedicated
    short-range communications (DSRC) and mobile networks, and fully autonomous vehicles
    on the other hand [262], [263]. 6G will provide a solid underpinning for the deployment
    of CAVs as an emerging industry vertical [264]. CAVs with various types of sensors
    (e.g., camera, ultrasound, radar, lidar, and other V2X sensors) will provide information
    related to safety, navigation, mapping, and infotainment to users [263]. In addition,
    CAVs will resolve the existing problems in transportation systems, such as traffic
    congestion, road safety, fuel wastage, and air pollution [265]. 6.4.1. Key challenges
    There are several challenges to be addressed to facilitate the deployment of CAVs
    in the 6G era. • CAV applications driven by future networks will need reliable
    support for real-time operations. Providing such time-critical services with non-stop
    availability will be challenging with centralized management because it is prone
    to single-point-of-failure and is costly [266]. • CAV applications require AI/ML/FL
    techniques to support the intelligent processing of big data. However, sharing
    of data for training purposes or sharing of locally trained models for global
    optimization may encounter security breaches [267]. • CAVs will give rise to a
    new range of services like optimized ride-sharing, trusted payments, automatic
    insurance renewal and claim settlement, smart parking, and location-specific personalized
    services. Security aspects like authentication, integrity, privacy, and trustworthiness
    must remain intact for these services-related CAVs [268]. 6.4.2. Role of blockchain
    Blockchain is envisaged to play a substantial role in enabling CAV applications
    of future 6G networks. Authors in [269] have surveyed the integration of Internet
    of Vehicles (IoV) together with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) towards
    realizing CAV. Accordingly, blockchain is capable of providing decentralized operation
    and management, peer-to-peer trading [270], improving system performance, and
    high trust, security, and privacy in CAV applications. Blockchain and smart contracts
    have the potential to offer data protection management for secure and safe driving.
    In this context, [271] presents a framework incorporating consortium blockchain
    with AI named Blockchain-enabled intElligent Safe-driving as-sessmenT (BEST) towards
    enabling safe-driving while ensuring the security of vehicle information and other
    data in CAVs. This method utilizes blockchain as a distributed data management
    platform to ensure the trust as data are immutable and transparent to the users.
    The consensus method used in this system is byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated
    proof-of-stake (BFT-DPoS). In this, BFT is added as an extra layer to DPoS to
    further ensure the robustness and validity while minimizing the consensus delay.
    However, challenges such as resource limitations in CAVs, vehicles not willing
    to actively share their information, and adapting to highly dynamic road conditions
    remain yet to be addressed. Blockchain can enable a new range of services emerging
    from CAVs like ride-sharing, trusted payments, automatic insurance renewal and
    claim settlement, smart parking, and location-specific services. Rathee et al.
    [272] presented a framework using blockchain towards securing CAVs and providing
    Connected Vehicles as a Service (CVaaS). This framework enables confidentiality
    and transparency among various parties (e.g., customers and vehicle owners) using
    blockchain to extract information from IoT devices and store records securely
    and transparently. All the records related to documenting, controlling and monitoring
    are securely stored in a blockchain ensuring that any alteration, deletion or
    compromise of IoT device is identified in an efficient and timely manner. However,
    this system needs to harness efficient AI/ML capabilities towards enhancing system
    intelligence. Another work presented in [273] presents a Blockchain based Framework
    for Auto-insurance Claim and Adjudication (B-FICA) for CAVs. B-FICA provides an
    access control mechanism using partitions to prevent unauthorized access evidence
    while protecting evidence from alteration through dynamic validation. This method
    uses permissioned blockchain together with multi-signed transactions as a proof
    of interaction-execution method. Also, block validation plus dynamic, lightweight
    consensus mechanism enables updating the data states while ensuring data security
    against any alteration. Furthermore, proof of interaction-execution also ensures
    non-repudiation while facilitating investigations of insurance claims. Blockchain
    has the capacity to enable energy trading among the CAVs and between the CAVs
    and electricity charging service providers. For instance, Zhao et al. [270] put
    forward a blockchain and smart contract based decentralized architecture for trading
    electricity among autonomous Electric Vehicles (EVs) since they are equipped with
    bidirectional charging points. Their proposed solution comprises conceptually
    three entities; supplier EV that will discharge, consumer EV that will charge,
    and Road Side Units (RSUs). The authors used permissioned blockchain which is
    maintained at the RSUs. The system allows automated negotiation between supplier
    and consumer vehicles based on the trust values of EVs, economic status of consumer
    EV, and demand/supply parameters exchanged between consumer and suppliers. Such
    a kind of decentralized P2P energy trading among EVs can have numerous advantages
    like decreasing charging queues during peak hours, reducing energy loss by trading
    surplus energy and earning immediate economic rewards of selling energy. Nevertheless,
    testing and formal verification of such solutions are required before they can
    be entrusted. As an instance of blockchain-enabled automated energy trading between
    electric CAVs and electricity charging service providers, Gabay et al. [274] proposed
    a framework for charging EVs, including authentication and scheduling. In particular,
    the authors made integrated use of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument
    of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), blockchain, and smart contracts to enable privacy-protected
    authentication and charging process. Their implementation setup made use of Zokrates
    for zkSNARKs and Ethereum test network Ropsten for deploying smart contracts.
    6.4.3. Summary Blockchain has unique capabilities to support 6G-enabled CAV applications
    in future communication networks. Specifically, it will enable automation through
    smart contracts, decentralized management, transparent P2P electricity trading,
    new services based on CAVs, and privacy protection. However, there are still some
    challenges like improving scalability, minimizing latency, overcoming resource
    constraints in CAVs, and effectively integrating edge intelligence capabilities
    with CAVs, which are to be addressed. 6.5. Energy Internet Energy Internet (EI)
    or Smart Grid 2.0 is the evolution of Smart Grid, which enables the integration
    of heterogeneous energy sources and energy storage systems that can be monitored
    and controlled using communication networks [57]. EI is also visualized to be
    a key application realized through the capabilities of future 6G communication
    networks [1]. Multiple decentralized and self-operating electric charging points
    need to be placed to facilitate the charging of autonomous vehicles, unmanned
    aerial vehicles, and self-operating robots [275]. Distributed energy sources that
    can be in the form of solar power generators, and wind power generators in households
    or commercial entities, will contribute to the smart grid to cater to the substantial
    energy demands of nearby devices [276]. Using such distributed energy sources
    would reduce the losses incurred during power transmission and increase the power
    quality of the consumer. Having more renewable energy resources and minimizing
    the losses will also minimize the carbon footprint. Energy markets will facilitate
    the trade and supply of energy generated using various sources using wholesale
    peer-to-peer energy trading platforms [277]. Cryptocurrencies and energy tokens
    will be used in these energy marketplaces to perform secure and transparent transactions.
    6.5.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges that should be addressed to deploy
    EI in the future are as follows. • The existing centralized business model will
    suffer scalability and management issues when used for renewable energy sources,
    which are distributed in nature [278]. Thus, EI requires an open and decentralized
    marketplace for future energy businesses. • EI will encounter growing number of
    stakeholders in terms of suppliers and consumers, and they will be varying in
    real-time. Thus, for such dynamic (at times ephemeral) energy trading developing
    a complete automated system will be challenging but essential. • Security and
    privacy of EI, if not instilled precisely, will result in stealing of energy,
    unavailability of services, leakage of sensitive information, and damages to costly
    equipment and appliances. • Measures of energy sharing amongst various IoT devices,
    including EVs should be facilitated. 6.5.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is envisioned
    to play a cardinal role in enabling EI through future communication networks.
    For instance, a study on how blockchain will enable future smart grid applications
    is presented in [279]. Blockchain facilitates decentralized smart grid management
    while ensuring security privacy and trust in the EI. One of the blockchain applications
    in EI is Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) that enables energy suppliers
    and consumers to interact with each other. Smart meters can send time-stamped
    records to create a new block in the distributed ledger once a transaction happens.
    Also, edge intelligence capabilities combined with blockchain can strengthen energy
    security in EI. Similar other applications include decentralized energy trading,
    open marketplaces, and monitoring, measuring and controlling the grid. Nevertheless,
    issues including less number of transactions per second, and prevailing security
    and privacy vulnerabilities in blockchain should see developments towards realizing
    blockchain-enabled EI. Furthermore, [280] proposes the use of a blockchain based
    marketplace as a business model archetype for the energy trading industry. This
    can function without the requirement of an orchestrator and will lead towards
    providing full autonomy to the energy market stakeholders. Authors introduce a
    system-oriented architectural insight in to the structure and management resulting
    in a orchestrator-led energy market that is capable of decentralizing the peer-to-peer
    energy market realized banking on blockchain. Furthermore, a decentralized access
    control mechanism using blockchain for smart grids is presented in [281]. This
    method operates without the involvement of a trusted third party and is capable
    of bringing data from service providers from smart meters. Each block in the private
    blockchain is verified using a leader selection process in the network. The leader
    runs the consensus algorithm in order to validate blocks by peer nodes using PBFT.
    Also, the encryption algorithm used to encrypt transactions is ECC. Khalid et
    al. [282] proposed blockchain to perform load balancing in decentralized hybrid
    P2P energy trading market for Smart Grids. Their work intends to minimize cost
    and electricity peak to average ratio. Khalid et al. [282] proposed blockchain
    to perform load balancing in decentralized hybrid P2P energy trading market for
    Smart Grids. Their work intends to minimize cost and electricity peak to average
    ratio. The proposed solution for the energy trading market is fully decentralized
    allowing members to trade energy with each other without the involvement of a
    third party. Smart contracts are utilized to impose the rules and regulations
    related to energy trading. Three smart contracts are presented towards implementing
    the hybrid energy trading market. They are the main smart contract (to perform
    user registration and data storage), peer-to-peer smart contract, and prosumer-2-grid
    smart contract. Another application of blockchain, as presented in [283], is to
    realize secure and distributed power transfer in UAV networks. More specifically,
    the authors proposed a blockchain-enabled UAV-assisted wireless power transfer
    framework named aerial-ground chain to charge low-power smart devices. In particular,
    their framework utilizes consortium blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
    Energy micro-transactions are verified by UAVs through heterogeneous consensus,
    where a cumulative weight based consensus mechanism is utilized in aerial nodes
    while the ground nodes use a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus scheme.
    The time-out for energy micro-transactions is confirmed through access points
    utilizing consortium blockchain. Also, this method develops a resource cooperation
    mechanism to motivate UAVs to take part in wireless power transfer actively. Access
    points that contribute to verify micro-transactions cooperatively are also incentivized.
    Payments are made through energy tokens, a new cryptocurrency that is managed
    and stored by wallets of participating nodes. 6.5.3. Summary Blockchain is recognized
    as a key enabler of EI or Smart Grid 2.0 applications in future communication
    networks. Blockchain combined with smart contracts enables many EI features, including
    decentralized grid management and autonomous operations, secure logging of smart
    meter readings, transaction verification, decentralized marketplace for energy
    trading, and enhanced security, privacy, and trust. Further research and development
    work in improving blockchain scalability, transaction speed, and addressing blockchain-related
    security and privacy issues will be instrumental in realizing EI applications
    through future communication networks. Moreover, establishing blockchain-based
    large-scale infrastructure for energy with well-defined APIs can accelerate the
    development in the EI sector. Table 9. Role of blockchain for 6G use cases with
    expected operational parameters and potential platforms (see [284], [285], [286],
    [287], [288], [289], [290], [291], [292], [293], [294], [295], [296], [297], [298],
    [299], [300], [301]). Table 10. Mapping deployment challenges to 6G technical
    aspects and 6G applications and use cases ([302], [303], [304], [305]). 6.6. Other
    use cases 6.6.1. Extended reality Extended reality (XR) is another use case visualized
    with 6G. In particular, XR is expected to harness the extremely highly reliable
    connectivity, massive data rate, and ultra-low latency offered by 6G networks
    [306], [307], [308]. XR incorporates AR, MR and VR to a wide range of applications,
    ranging from smart healthcare, education, haptics, CAVs, to Brain–Computer Interfaces
    (BCI) [35]. Moreover, XR-enabled applications are expected to revolutionize manufacturing
    by providing new methods for designing, prototyping, marketing, and maintenance
    [309], [310]. Blockchain integrated 6G networks will be instrumental in facilitating
    XR applications. For instance, blockchain can offer its subscribers to enjoy live
    events (e.g., music, sports, interactive games) with a fully immersive and virtual
    experience. Such offering can be a part of a subscription as a value-added service
    or can be purchased explicitly. In either case, blockchain can be utilized for
    creating a marketplace for virtual experience [299]. Moreover, blockchain can
    resolve the issue of incorrect file formats, which arises with the increasing
    use of VR/AR applications in heterogeneous domains [299]. Authors in [311] propose
    blockchain-powered 6G-enabled Information-Centric massive Internet of Things (ICmIoT)
    for Ubiquitous VR/AR services. In particular, they utilize permissioned blockchain
    and introduce a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Cache-Offloading (PoCO).
    In general, the intrinsic security features of blockchain with decentralized nature
    can provide security and privacy to XR applications. However, blockchain technology
    is expected to evolve, specifically by minimizing the processing delay and scalability
    towards facilitating XR applications in 6G communication networks. 6.6.2. Holographic
    telepresence (teleportation) The growth of extended reality applications together
    with ultra-reliable, high throughput, and extremely low latency communication
    networks in 6G will enable holographic teleportation [312]. Holographic teleportation
    is expected to teleport users to a computerized virtual environment that resembles
    the real world to create a sense of presence while collaborating with others in
    virtual spaces [313]. It is expected that a plethora of new services based on
    fully immersive holographic experiences will be introduced with the dawn of holographic
    communication, such as virtual schools and universities, virtual tourism, and
    virtual sports and activities [232]. The use of blockchain can help the realization
    of holographic applications. For instance, large amounts of raw data obtained
    through cameras and sensors supporting holographic communication can be processed
    efficiently using edge intelligence nodes facilitated through blockchain and smart
    contracts. Higher data rates in the wireless access network or wireless backhaul
    could also be achieved by minimizing interference related issues using blockchain
    based spectrum sharing [314]. Network security and user privacy can be ensured
    owing to the inherent security features of blockchain. Faster processing, scalability,
    and blockchain security and privacy need further research to realize holographic
    telepresence applications utilizing blockchain-based 6G networks. 6.6.3. Smart
    cities Smart cities are envisaged to cater to the requirements of over 70% of
    the world population by the year 2050 [315]. Moreover, these requirements are
    expected to be diverse and complex in the future. Thus, the future smart cities
    are to be equipped with modern information and communication infrastructure [316].
    Environmental pollution, energy management, traffic management, and disaster management
    are a few of the applications of ICT tools in future smart cities. These will
    be facilitated through heterogeneous IoT devices and sensors towards IoE. The
    Big Data extracted through these IoT devices need to be analyzed using advanced
    learning techniques to obtain insights on city planning and city development activities
    [317]. Blockchain is considered to be an enabling technology of smart cities.
    One of the major blockchain applications towards smart cities is to ensure information
    security and privacy [318]. Blockchain also offers enhanced fault tolerance, better
    reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, blockchain is instrumental in weaving
    a communication platform that can connect a large number of heterogeneous and
    distributed IoT devices and sensors in a smart city environment. For instance,
    the authors in [319] present a hybrid network architecture combining Software
    Defined Networking (SDN) and blockchain. This architecture consists of a core
    network and an edge network to enable distributed networking applications. In
    addition, a blockchain-based vehicle network architecture for smart cities, named
    Block-VN, is presented in [320]. This architecture facilitates reliable, secure,
    and distributed functioning of vehicle networks. However, scalability in terms
    of transactions per second and storage turns out to be a bottleneck to use blockchain
    for 6G-enabled smart cities. 6.6.4. Digital twins The underpinning of 6G will
    support an effective realization of DTs which is an emerging paradigm for smart
    industries, smart cities and smart healthcare facilities [321]. The concept of
    DTs is about creating an exact digital replica of any physical entity or process
    in a computerized virtual world. Thus, any given physical entity (either living
    or non-living) has existence in both the physical world and the virtual world.
    These replicas in physical and virtual worlds are called as DTs and they enable
    tight integration via seamless exchange of relevant data between themselves [322],
    [323]. Systems based on DTs have huge potential in the field of manufacturing,
    healthcare, aviation, and smart cities [323], [324]. In particular, DTs has potential
    to enable 3D visualization and simulations, virtual testing, predictive maintenance,
    and various type of analytics (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive) which
    pave the way for 6G-enabled industrial applications [322], [324]. Despite the
    myriad of advantages, an important challenge to successfully realize DTs is to
    ensure security, privacy, transparency, and trust while communicating and exchanging
    data between physical and virtual twins as well as with surrounding environment
    and external parties involved. In this direction, Yaqoob et al. [322] identified
    various alleviating roles of blockchain for DTs such as decentralized and tamper-persistent
    data exchanges, providing DTs’ proof of legitimacy and identities, tight access
    control based on smart contracts and strict adherence to distributed policies
    and ensuring transparent tracking and accountability. For industrial manufacturing
    use case, Zhang et al. [325] proposed the use of permissioned blockchain while
    considering a digital twin manufacturing cell scenario. In particular, authors
    implemented a prototype of a Manufacturing Blockchain of Things (MBCoT) architecture
    using hyperledger fabric and demonstrate that their solution can achieve high
    throughput and low latency while being secure and traceable. Putz et al. [326]
    developed a Decentralized Application (DApp) using Ethereum blockchain and off-chain
    data storage. However, simulation data is used for the experiments. 7. Deployment
    challenges Despite the advantages that blockchain can bring to the 6G realm, there
    are challenges that will be encountered, and thus, must be investigated to harness
    the maximum potential of blockchain in 6G. This section expounds on various deployment
    challenges, their importance to the 6G ecosystem, and possible solutions to mitigate
    them. Towards the end of this section, Table 10 maps the deployment challenges
    to the 6G technical aspects and 6G applications. 7.1. Scalability (data) - Throughput
    and storage For blockchainized systems, scalability in terms of throughput and
    storage is still challenging. Throughput indicates the number of transactions
    being successfully processed per unit time. The increasing size of the ledger
    highlights the need for higher storage capacity at all the full nodes in the blockchain
    network. Throughput depends on numerous factors such as hardware capacity, network
    latency, block size, size of the ledger, size of the P2P blockchain network, and
    complexity of both the cryptographic techniques and the smart contracts used.
    In general, due to the restriction on the maximum size of a block, the time required
    to perform transaction validation, and establishing consensus, the throughput
    of blockchainized systems is less than conventional centralized systems. 7.1.1.
    Importance in context of 6G Since 6G will cater to a new range of applications
    and use cases that demand ultra-high data rate (Tbps) and extremely high connection
    density, high throughput and efficient storage requirements are a must for successful
    use of blockchain in the 6G realm. Furthermore, with the open business 6G ecosystem,
    an increasing number of stakeholders (of all sizes) will participate, which will
    lead to a high access rate and, at the same time, would require higher storage
    capacity to maintain logs of their activities. 7.1.2. Possible solutions A variety
    of solutions have been explored to improve the scalability of blockchainized systems.
    To improve the throughput solutions like sharding [327] (for processing and storing),
    multiple blocks per leader [328], Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Payment Channel
    Network (PCN) [329]. Compared to traditional systems, the difference in throughput
    of blockchainized systems is significantly large for the public permissionless
    type of blockchain. Thus, the use of private permissioned (or consortium) type
    blockchain can narrow down the difference in the performance (throughput), making
    blockchain suitable for 6G networks. Solutions such as off-chain storage, block
    (data) compression, sidechain, and hierarchical blockchain are being explored
    to deal with storage scalability [330]. Interestingly, emerging multi-peer permissioned
    blockchains leveraging microservice-based architecture (such as Rahasak [331]
    and Mystiko [332]) have the potential to meet high scalability demands of 6G ecosystem.
    Instead of conventional full node data replication which is resource inefficient
    and increases latency, Rahasak carries out limited data replication using sharding
    algorithm. Moreover, actor-based smart contracts ‘Aplos’ [333] can enable concurrent
    execution of transactions by executing a given transaction only once at one of
    the blockchain peers. 7.2. Measure of decentrality Decentralization fundamentally
    refers to a property of a system that ensures that every user has equal control
    over the system; hence no single user or a group of users could control a system’s
    assets or impose changes that other users do not consent to [334]. Hence, decentralization
    removes the dependency on a central authority by increasing the number of decision-makers
    [335]. This is a key requirement for blockchainized 6G networks. However, the
    measure of decentrality in those systems is a challenge. 7.2.1. Importance in
    context of 6G For security in 6G, this property needs to be maintained for any
    blockchain-based solution. A blockchainized system itself needs to be inspected
    carefully for properties, including decentrality and verified/validated operation.
    As blockchain is supposed to provide decentralized means of trust among untrusted
    users by withstanding a large number of fake identities in a peer-to-peer network-based
    system and prohibiting them from gaining higher influence, decentralization is
    an important requirement in that regard. 7.2.2. Possible solutions The authors
    in [336] identify the emergence of centrality in the governance, network, and
    storage layers of blockchain-based systems. Subsequently, they presented various
    metrics to measure decentrality in respective layers. In particular, metrics such
    as Gini coefficient, entropy, Euclidean distance, and Minkowski distance are used
    to measure decentrality in the governance layer. Similarly, degree centrality,
    betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality metrics are used to measure decentrality
    in the network layer. For the storage layer, the distribution index is used, which
    measures the extent to which the information is stored in a distributed way. Baran
    et al. discussed the importance of measuring these properties in centralized,
    decentralized and distributed systems in [337]. Buterin discussed the meaning
    of decentrality in a blockchain system [338]. In [334], an entropy method from
    information theory is proposed to quantify the decentralization of blockchains.
    Using this technique, the discrete degrees of blocks mined and address balances
    are calculated to quantify the degrees of decentralization for Bitcoin and Ethereum
    systems. In [339], the authors define a new metric centralization level where
    a blockchain is N ϵ centralized if the top N nodes perform more than 1 − ϵ fraction
    of transactions. Given the same ϵ , a blockchain is more centralized if it has
    a smaller N . In blockchainized 6G, such a decentrality measurement and monitoring
    system should be a part of the general security architecture to ensure proper
    operation of network functions. However, how that integration will be achieved
    in that multi-party and large-scale system is still an open question. 7.3. Security
    and privacy Although blockchain is identified as an enabling technology to tackle
    security and privacy issues in the networking and telecommunication industry,
    using blockchain itself may create security and privacy issues making this a double-edged
    sword. In particular, the transparency of the records and transactions in the
    blockchain may create potential privacy breaches with in the network. Each transaction
    in the blockchain is signed using asymmetric keys and a list of several transactions
    joins together to form a block. Each block contains a hash pointer of the previous
    block and a hash of the listed transactions. This makes the transactions or the
    blocks immutable and secure. However, this will no longer be secure with a powerful
    adversary capable of breaking the cryptographic materials. In addition to that,
    several other security attacks related to blockchain have been identified, e.g.,
    majority 51% attack, double-spending attacks, re-entrancy attack, sybil attacks,
    authentication access control attacks, security misconfigurations, and privacy
    attacks. 7.3.1. Importance in context of 6G There are many potential scenarios
    in 6G that can be secured by blockchain, such as advancing spectrum sharing security,
    eliminating tampering of the lease records, and assuring trust among market players.
    However, how the blockchain can be protected from many security threats, including
    Sybil attacks and privacy leakages, are yet to be addressed. In the long run,
    6G is expected to use the devices in the post-quantum era with higher processing
    capability. Therefore, it is highly likely that the security and privacy solutions
    developing with the current blockchain technology will be no longer safe for quantum-based
    security threats. The combined use of AI/ML and blockchain will also create additional
    security threats while protecting the integrity of AI data which are shared among
    different stakeholders. 7.3.2. Possible solutions It is clear enough that when
    the blockchain-based security solutions are adopted in 6G networks, it is necessary
    to design possible mechanisms to mitigate the blockchain-specific security threat.
    The introduction of post-quantum cryptography to the blockchain and the use of
    quantum key management schemes may make the blockchain-based security solutions
    quantum-safe in 6G. When the adversaries become unconquerable with the quantum
    level powers, the existing public-key encryption and signature schemes will no
    longer provide secure connectivity. The security of quantum cryptography can be
    proven mathematically without imposing any restrictions on the abilities of an
    eavesdropper. The longer symmetric key derived and distributed by quantum cryptographic
    approaches will ensure the lifetime security of many schemes and digital systems.
    Therefore, a gradual shift to quantum-resistant cryptography will be necessary
    for blockchain technology. Another possible solution, to prevent security attacks
    and threats related to miners, is to model, verify and ensure correctness of secure
    and trustworthy blockchain-based systems. The security of the consensus protocol
    will be ensured by formally specifying security properties such as persistence,
    liveness, safety, fault tolerance and fraud resilience. Similarly, the trust of
    the consensus protocol shall be assured by formally defining trust properties,
    i.e., miner and verifier trust to prevent their malicious behaviors [340]. For
    such verification and assurance goals in blockchain-based systems, formal methods
    can be used [341]. In particular, model checking can be used for the formal verification
    of the consensus protocol as it successfully uncovers errors in the model in the
    form of counter examples [342]. In detail, formal specification language, such
    as, Communicating Sequential Processes can be used to formally specify the consensus
    protocol. Subsequently, the correctness of the protocol will be verified using
    formal verification tools, such as, Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model checker
    [343]. However, the appropriate modeling and verification techniques are still
    open research questions for blockchains in large-scale systems like 6G networks.
    7.4. Consensus algorithms The consensus algorithm plays a vital role in running
    the blockchain system. Different types of consensus algorithms are developed and
    used in different applications. However, most general purpose consensus algorithms
    such as PoW are not optimal for mobile networks and the associated service. Specially,
    the direct utilization of generic consensus algorithms of well-known blockchains
    in pre-6G telecommunication networks had several negative impacts such as high
    operational cost and extended latency [344], [345]. For example, PoW like consensus
    algorithms are highly computationally intensive, and it is very costly to operate
    mining nodes. Moreover, a considerable amount of energy gets wasted just to perform
    some cryptography operations that have no benefits other than selecting the winning
    node. 7.4.1. Importance in context of 6G The greening of networks is a fundamental
    driver for the design and implementation of future networks, including 6G as evidenced
    by the recent regulatory and policy developments [346]. However, blockchain will
    be a big challenge against this goal due to its computationally intensive and
    high-energy consuming consensus algorithms. Moreover, with the positive development
    of quantum computing, 6G networks may have to address the issues related to the
    post-quantum era. Specially, most of the existing contemporary cryptographic mechanisms
    used in current consensus algorithms (e.g., PoW currently utilized hash scheme
    such as like SHA256 or KECCAK256 [347], [348]) can be easily breakable with quantum
    computing. Thus, using such legacy computation-oriented and energy-intensive consensus
    algorithms may not be possible in 6G networks, especially for ELPC use cases.
    7.4.2. Possible solutions To mitigate the above challenges, new custom-made consensus
    algorithms for 6G should be developed. For instance, a quantum-safe consensus
    algorithm can be designed by focusing on randomness than computational difficulty
    [349]. As a wireless communication medium, 6G networks will also consist of a
    variety of random data sources. For instance, wireless channel state information,
    user traffic and mobility patterns, and interference level are possible sources
    with random nature. Such sources can be used to design consensus algorithms. Moreover,
    6G specific consensus algorithms can be designed in a way that miners have to
    focus on useful tasks such as spectrum sensing, abnormality detection, and traffic
    pattern analysis than meaningless cryptography operations such as hash value calculations
    [137]. That will also eliminate the extra energy use and wastage to run consensus
    algorithms. 7.5. Standards, policies and legal issues As an emerging technology
    for various use cases including future networks, blockchain is still in its infancy
    terms of standardization and regulations. The popularity of cryptocurrencies and
    various pitfalls and negative incidents have also painted blockchain as a high-risky
    technology in public perception. Therefore, to reap the benefits of the standardization
    and help the stakeholders, community-driven standardization and well-informed
    blockchain regulations are crucial. These regulations should also foster the blockchain’s
    role in addressing various challenges to fulfill potential impact on future 6G
    systems. 7.5.1. Importance in the context of 6G The integration of blockchain
    into 6G networks will require well-defined and industry-approved standards. The
    6G infrastructure is supposed to be multi-X (multi-vendor, multi-technology and
    multi-domain) network of networks. Moreover, telecommunication networks are tightly
    regulated for a service-level agreement based user experience and service quality.
    From a practical point of view, interoperability and clear guidelines on how to
    use blockchain in network infrastructure and use cases are crucial. To realize
    their key benefits in digital infrastructure including 6G networks, blockchains
    should be interoperable between themselves and with incumbent systems in other
    domains [350]. Moreover, high-gain use cases should be identified and addressed
    first to boost the blockchain’s role in 6G networks. 7.5.2. Possible solutions
    ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG) Permissioned Distributed Ledger (PDL)
    is actively working on the foundations for the operation of permissioned distributed
    ledgers to improve the trust and dependability of digital services supported by
    global and open telecommunications networks [305]. They have developed a reference
    architecture framework specification and published it as ETSI GS PDL 012 in May
    2022 [351]. As an industry organization of mobile operators, GSMA has already
    developed “GSMA eBusiness Network”, a new private-permissioned industry-wide blockchain
    network, focusing on the wholesale roaming clearing and settlement process as
    the first application [352]. Similarly, ITU SG3 working on tariff and accounting
    principles and international telecommunication/ICT economic and policy issues
    has an active work item on usage of DLT to handle accounting, policy, regulatory
    and economic issues in the international telco/ICT domain [353]. Such solutions
    will be more important with the pervasive 6G user experience, which should be
    seamless across different serving networks and minimize roaming overhead among
    service providers. ITU SG13 on future networks and emerging network technologies
    is developing recommendations on requirements and architecture for network resource
    sharing including site-sharing and RAN-sharing [354]. NIST Blockchain group has
    been investigating blockchain technologies at multiple levels ranging from use
    cases to protocols, security guarantees, and cryptographic mechanisms [355]. The
    fundamental contributions from this standardization organization may provide input
    to 6G networks in terms of blockchain design, interoperability and access control.
    ISO Technical Committee ISO/TC 307 Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies
    has been actively developing widely-applicable standards on various aspects including
    use cases, interoperability and security of blockchain and DLT [356]. These fundamental
    standards are all currently under development and will be important not just for
    future 6G networks, but for ICT systems in general. Regarding oversight and policy
    making, policymakers could provide two-pronged contribution to the use of blockchain
    in digital infrastructure such as 6G networks: to clarify existing oversight mechanisms,
    including regulations, or create new mechanisms to ensure appropriate oversight
    of blockchain applications [357]. They should identify legal actors and responsibilities
    in a well-defined framework and establish accountability for relevant stakeholders.
    In that regard, an important effort is by EU: It has a strategy on blockchain
    aiming to build a pan-European public services blockchain while promoting legal
    certainty and increasing funding for research and innovation [350]. Overall, these
    activities will have a profound impact on how blockchain can be integrated in
    future networks and exploited for realizing the envisaged benefits. 7.6. Interoperability
    The existing blockchain ecosystem incorporates multiple blockchain platforms.
    However, these platforms are not fully compatible with each other. One of the
    main reasons for this phenomenon is the lack of governance of various blockchain
    platforms through protocols and standards, especially in the case of communication
    networks. However, this may give rise to interoperability issues with multiple
    blockchain platforms envisaged in future 6G communication networks. Presently,
    functions such as sending tokens, authentication, executing smart contracts, and
    validating data are not possible among multiple blockchain systems [358]. Such
    issues should be resolved to realize blockchain/DLT as an integral part of future
    communication networks. 7.6.1. Importance in context of 6G The envisaged blockchain-based
    6G networks demand the seamless integration and operation of multiple blockchain
    platforms. For instance, smart contracts are expected to execute seamlessly regardless
    of the platform to enable the automation of many 6G features. Also, umMTC requires
    support for scalability via distributed control, universal identity management,
    and automatic authentication and access control irrespective of the platform used.
    Moreover, network security through security orchestration and automation, and
    privacy measures through DApps should operate flawlessly across multiple blockchain
    platforms that are envisaged with blockchainized 6G. Therefore, enabling seamless
    interoperability among multiple blockchain platforms is essential towards realizing
    blockchainized 6G networks. 7.6.2. Possible solutions Establishing interoperability
    among multiple blockchain platforms has been explored in several research and
    development work. A trustless cryptocurrency exchange in terms of atomic cross-chain
    swaps to allow different cryptocurrencies to swap assets was presented in [359].
    However, to ensure that no assets are destroyed in case of atomic swaps, cross-blockchain
    tokens can be used to hold assets in any required blockchain. Furthermore, a secure
    cross-platform token transfer mechanism and inter-blockchain communication protocols
    are developed, facilitating the incompatibility of consensus mechanisms, hash
    algorithms, smart contract interactions, and data exchanges. In addition, interoperability
    issues across blockchain systems can also be solved using blockchain gates [358],
    [359]. Also, ETSI is developing interoperability guidelines while Ethereum and
    Hyperledger are also taking measures to minimize the issues raised due to blockchain
    interoperability [303], [304], [360]. 8. Lessons learned and future research directions
    This section discusses the lessons learned, and based on these lessons, synthesizes
    the future research directions that can pave the way for a profitable blockchain
    integrated 6G ecosystem. 8.1. 6G requirements 8.1.1. Lessons learned Blockchain
    related works from the 6G requirements perspective lead to the following lessons
    learned: Extreme Data Rate: Blockchain-based optimized resource management has
    the potential to achieve extremely high data rates requirement for 6G. Its use
    is particularly beneficial for flat network structures with less centralized control.
    Moreover, the required cooperative nature of 6G RAN can be realized using blockchain
    [361]. Extreme Reliability: Despite the tangible security gains via the encryption
    and digital signature enabled by blockchain integration into IoT for extreme reliability,
    security is still a key concern in such systems due to potential vulnerabilities
    of blockchain-integrated IoT systems [362]. Extreme Connectivity: A promising
    approach to enable massive connectivity is to use heterogeneous and multi-tiered
    networks such as integrated aerial and terrestrial networks [363]. To this end,
    blockchain can enable extreme connectivity by helping multi-mode connectivity
    in heterogeneous networks. The openness of permissionless systems provides more
    degrees of cooperation among different RAN elements of a 6G network to boost capability
    for ubiquitous coverage. For instance, blockchain can support extreme coverage
    by operating network clusters with intermittent connectivity where it can be used
    to manage the operations within the cluster [364]. However, such systems are more
    complex and may require more advanced security measures. Thus, a trade-off exists
    between the openness of a blockchain system for expanding coverage versus the
    complexity and security issues. Extreme Sensing: The current goal of supporting
    small-packet and sensing-based URLLC services in 5G systems will be challenged
    and disrupted for an entirely new degree of massive connectivity. This level of
    connectivity requires blockchains to enable ultra massive sensing applications
    in 6G. 8.1.2. Future directions Some of the important research directions on how
    to better utilize the blockchain to address 6G requirements are as follows: •
    Position-based optimization: Accurate indoor positioning is vital for capacity
    management since the location of users and devices provide crucial inputs for
    optimization. However, positioning accuracy and reliability are boosted with cooperative
    techniques. For instance, blockchain is used to enable a crowdsourced indoor navigation
    system in [27]. In that regard, how to develop blockchain driven data sharing
    among disparate entities in the network infrastructure is an important research
    direction for 6G networks. • Roaming frauds in 3D networks: Already, secure and
    transparent roaming against frauds is a big challenge in current networks. Moreover,
    roaming in 6G networks will become more complicated due to the existence of 3D
    networks and their roaming requirements [98]. Therefore, efficient integration
    of blockchain for 3D roaming frauds involving heterogeneous networks is an interesting
    research question. • Trustless sharing ecosystem: Pragmatic blockchain-driven
    mechanisms for “X-sharing” for capacity maximization and efficiency is a promising
    research direction. • Blockchain for heterogeneous networks: Though blockchain
    is considered as a promising solution for data sharing and distributed control
    for network monitoring and management in the 6G ecosystem comprising of heterogeneous
    networks. Nonetheless, an important research question is how to control latency
    overhead due to blockchain integration in these disparate and physically distant
    networks in 6G ecosystem. Multi-peer blockchain clusters [331] and dockerized
    micro-services [333] turns out to be proposing solutions to effectively implement
    scalable and trustless mobile network of heterogeneous networks. • Management
    of blockchain-based solutions for decoupling eURLLC verticals in case of hazards/risks:
    The concept of blockchain is inherently promising for cooperation and sharing
    among 6G verticals. However, the drawback can be the strong coupling among different
    verticals, a situation which may sporadically impair the latency performance of
    various verticals in case of malicious events or security incidents occur in an
    eURLLC vertical [94]. Therefore, management schemes and modular approach in such
    malfunctions and performance issues form an important research direction. • Fundamental
    limits on the applicability of blockchain to eURLLC: A fundamental research question
    to explore is the theoretical limits of blockchain schemes with respect to their
    applicability to various eURLLC applications. Such research can shed light on
    what the valid and invalid vertical scenarios are for the blockchain in the eURLLC
    regime. Moreover, use of multi-peer permissioned blockchains has potential to
    push the performance limitations of conventional peer-to-peer monolithic blockchains
    [331]. • Rigorous testing of 6G consensus algorithms: While the design of energy-efficient
    and secure consensus algorithms is already an active research topic from a 6G
    perceptive, the developed solutions still need to be thoroughly tested at large
    scale test networks and accordingly may need further improvements. 8.2. 6G technical
    aspects 8.2.1. 3D networking Following are the lessons learned and future research
    directions for using blockchain for 3D networking in 6G. Lessons Learned: With
    the emergence of altitude as a third dimension and the proliferation of flying
    technologies (particularly UAVs and LEOs), the next-generation mobile networks
    aim to extend radio footprints both horizontally and vertically. This implies
    ultra-tight integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks in 6G era
    which will offer a multitude of benefits including global coverage. Nevertheless,
    3D networking will give rise to new challenges such as automated and trustless
    interoperability, privacy-protected and decentralized data exchanges, secure control
    plane functionalities, avoiding air-collisions of ABSs, and automated decision
    making. In this context, blockchain has been considered to mitigate these challenges,
    thanks to its intrinsic features. Future Directions: To overcome the downside
    of using blockchain for 3D networks, which are high latency, large storage facility,
    significant computational and communication overheads, researchers have proposed
    a wide range of solutions, including multichain, modified structure of the block,
    and mix of resourceful and resource-constrained ABSs. However, experimental testing
    using real-world mobile network test-beds is still missing. Also, issues like
    flexible interoperability between heterogeneous (decentralized) networks, lightweight
    consensus mechanism, and cross-chain security and isolation among multiple blockchains
    are yet to be improved upon. 8.2.2. Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) The lessons
    learned and future research directions for using of blockchain for spectrum management
    for 6G networks are as follows. Lessons Learned: To maximize the use of the radio
    spectrum, its management in 6G should be more dynamic and real-time than static
    allocation. In this regard, DSM can improve spectrum efficiency by enabling effective
    sharing between primary (incumbent) and secondary users. Although DSM has clear
    advantages, the inherent centralized management counteracts and results in high
    administrative cost, security and privacy vulnerabilities, existence of centralized
    entities for spectrum trading, slow process of creating spectrum sharing agreement
    and less transparency in actual spectrum usage. Moreover, using cognitive radio,
    unlicensed secondary users can maliciously access unused spectrum and mount various
    attacks. To overcome these issues, blockchain can play a cardinal role. The spectrum
    management activities where blockchain can strengthen are spectrum (auction-based)
    trading, spectrum allocations, payment settlement based on spectrum usage, and
    secure recording of all the activities involved during spectrum trading. Thanks
    to decentralized decision making and disintermediation of centralized entities,
    its use can eliminate dependency on trusted third parties such as spectrum licensees,
    band managers, and spectrum access system administrators [25]. Also, to ensure
    that the primary users are compensated for sharing their licensed bands with secondary
    users, the sharing and leasing policies can be coded into smart contracts to enforce
    the contractual agreements between parties digitally [137]. Future Directions:
    Despite numerous advantages that can be gained using blockchain technology, an
    important hurdle is the on-boarding of various entities to a blockchain-based
    decentralized and open spectrum management system. This requires proper standardized
    APIs and well-defined architectural procedures. Furthermore, privacy preservation
    must be exclusively dealt within (or outside) blockchain to ensure trade secrets
    are not leaked. The reason being a blockchain, by default, does not guarantees
    privacy. 8.2.3. Security in 6G Following are the lessons learned and future research
    directions for using blockchain to strengthen security in 6G networks. Lessons
    Learned: The envisaged massive connectivity, native-AI capabilities, complete
    network automation, heterogeneous and specialized service demands, never-seen-before
    use cases, various business entities of different scale, and blending of new technologies
    would demand pervasive security by design in a complex 6G ecosystem. Blockchain
    is an envisioned enabler for facilitating the expected pervasive security and
    trust in 6G networks as presented in Section 5.3. Future Directions: Although
    blockchain has the potential to meet security requirements for 6G networks, however,
    a blockchain-based implementation itself needs to be inspected carefully for security
    properties such as decentrality and verified operation. Specifically, the correctness
    of the consensus protocol needs to be verified as the consensus protocol is the
    backbone of every blockchain-based system. Therefore, the protocol should be clearly
    modeled, the correctness should be adequately verified, and all its desired properties
    should be validated [365]. Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult because of
    the distributed nature of blockchain. Moreover, the security of the consensus
    protocol will be ensured by formally specifying security properties such as persistence,
    liveness, safety, fault tolerance and fraud resilience. Similarly, the trust of
    the consensus protocol shall be assured by formally defining trust properties,
    i.e., miner and verifier trust to prevent their malicious behaviors [340]. 8.2.4.
    Privacy-protection in 6G The lessons learned and future research directions for
    protecting privacy in 6G using blockchain are as follows. Lessons Learned: With
    everything and every aspect of human lives getting connected in the envisioned
    6G networks, privacy will be indispensable. Typically, both data privacy and user
    privacy need to be carefully handled. Blockchain has been considered as an enabler
    for preserving privacy for 6G networks in terms of decentralized identity management,
    tight access control using well-defined smart contracts, modified/tailored block
    structure to hide sensitive information, and obfuscation intended blockchain-based
    encryption like homomorphic encryption. Future Directions: Despite the potential
    use of blockchain to preserve privacy in the 6G network, the enhanced privacy-protected
    blockchain solutions come with a performance trade-off. Hence, a balance needs
    to be maintained between the level of blockchain-based privacy and the system
    performance. Furthermore, a well-defined framework and formulation of test cases
    are required to check the level of privacy offered by blockchain-powered solutions
    in mobile networks. Also, blockchain-based experiments and testing on real testbeds
    networks need to be explored to understand better the pros and cons of rolling
    out blockchain-enhanced privacy. 8.2.5. Resource management The lessons learned
    and future research directions for using blockchain in 6G are discussed as follows.
    Lessons Learned: Efficient resource management leads to increased utilization
    efficiency, reduced cost, improved QoS, and higher revenue generation. However,
    with the ever-growing number of subscribers, connected IoE devices, and industry
    verticals, there is no wonder that resources management as a whole will be challenging
    for the 6G networks. The resources include networking, computation and storage
    resources, and these can be virtualized or made available physically. In addition
    to the massive connectivity demands, what makes resource management complicated
    is the heterogeneity and time-varying nature of demands. Hence, conventional centralized
    management is not the best match. Moreover, the availability requirement for 6G
    networks impels secure resource management against threats and attacks [25]. Blockchain
    provides visibility and memory to multiple parties regarding the current and past
    network resource conditions due to its immutable and transparent logging operation.
    Moreover, blockchain-based decentralized slice brokering offers a way to carry
    out secure resource trading between network tenants, infrastructure/resource providers,
    local network operators and mobile network operators. Such a platform can allow
    automatic trading (i.e. negotiation, leasing of resources and payment settlement)
    between unknown entities in the telecommunication ecosystem. Some of the other
    uses of blockchain in resource management are securing the life-cycle management
    of VNF (involving network operator, edge platforms, and third-party VNF providers)
    and incentivizing the sharing of nearby unused resources. Future Directions: Although
    blockchain is introduced as a solution for resource management in the future networks,
    the research is still in its infancy stage. A substantial amount of work should
    be focused on integrating blockchain-based resource management solutions in wireless
    networks and proceeding with the standardization process. As usual, the inherent
    security and privacy issues of blockchain technology need to be tackled. In a
    fully automated 6G network management architecture, resource management needs
    to be performed with higher intelligence in a very responsive manner. Monitoring
    and updating network resource availability should be performed in real-time, and
    they can be fed as inputs for intelligent resource trading. 8.2.6. Ubiquitous
    intelligence Following are the lessons learned and future research directions
    for the ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks. Lessons Learned: Much deeper integration
    of AI at all levels of the 6G network communications is visualized with the ultimate
    goal to make our society super-smart, super-efficient and greener. In particular,
    the advantages of native-AI based 6G networks are seen at the network management
    level with complete automation in heterogeneous settings (multi-tenants, multi-operators,
    and multi-vendors), at the network service level with flexibility, customization
    and self-adaptability, and also at the application level. However, the optimized
    adoption of AI in the complex 6G ecosystem, the trustworthiness of AI/ML agents,
    the efficacy of distributed AI system, and the scalability of ubiquitous intelligence
    are the challenges. Blockchain has been found to be apt to meet these challenges.
    For instance, blockchain is capable of handling the secure exchange of training
    data for AI-driven solutions [366] and uploading of locally trained ML model in
    FL-based solutions [367]. Thus, different operators, tenants, or mobile end users
    in 6G networks can securely share their data for training or incremental updates
    of AI models as in federated learning [232]. Also, blockchain can make the decision
    process of the AI/ML methods more coherent and auditable as all the underlying
    elements on which the decisions are made can be traced back. Moreover, since blockchain
    provides a distributed database, it can protect a massive amount of data expected
    to be processed by AI in 6G, leading to enhanced security and transparent operation
    against corruption and hacking. Specially designed consensus algorithms can provide
    fault tolerance, reduced requirement of computational resources, and efficient
    and coherent learning at the same time. Furthermore, ultra-large-scale sensing
    and tracking in 6G will be well supported by blockchain. Future Directions: The
    convergence of blockchain and AI has huge potential for 6G networks, and thus
    there are many research avenues for research. Computationally light, attack immune,
    and learning-based consensus algorithms need to be developed to ascertain the
    use of blockchain for native-AI 6G networks. Another direction for successful
    integration of blockchain and AI/ML is setting up of platforms and testbeds to
    put such solutions through rigorous testing. This would require collective efforts
    from blockchain alliances and telecommunication regulatory bodies. The key challenges
    for ubiquitous intelligence in 6G have two aspects: the challenges against realizing
    ubiquitous intelligence and the challenges once intelligence is embedded in every
    layer of 6G networks (from the PHY layer functions to applications). Although
    we focus on the former, the latter is also a critical research topic and may be
    integrated with blockchain technology, e.g., how to enable flexible and secure
    resource sharing with network intelligence [95] or for trust scoring for ICN contents
    in B5G networks [96]. 8.2.7. Mobility management The lessons learned and future
    research directions for blockchain-based mobility management in the 6G network
    are discussed below. Lessons Learned: On the one hand, small cell size (due to
    the high-frequency spectrum) and 3D network will result in high mobility and a
    large number of handovers both in horizontal and vertical directions. On the other
    hand, the 6G requirements pose mobility management to happen transparently and
    with high reliability. Thus, mobility management will be a crucial technical aspect
    to achieve ultrahigh-speed with low-latency communications in the 6G era. Numerous
    key requirements for mobility management are immunity to security attacks, perfect
    forward secrecy, mutual authentication and key agreement, traceability, decentralized
    authentication facility, and immunity to roaming frauds. Blockchain has been found
    capable of resolving many of these issues. In particular, blockchain can enable
    session key confidentiality, secure authentication during handover, decentralized
    authentication server, dynamic roaming agreements, preventing roaming frauds,
    fair economic incentive policies and immunity towards numerous attacks like reply
    attack and Sybil attack. However, high storage redundancy due to the distributed
    ledger and computational overheads is the downside of using blockchain. Future
    Directions: One of the challenges to support mobility is to manage handover among
    diverse wireless technologies as different handover strategies affect the signaling
    overhead and handover delay. Even though blockchain has been found beneficial
    for secure and decentralized mobility management, there are few areas where blockchains
    role needs to be explored. For example, blockchains role for physical layer fingerprinting
    based authentication during mobility has yet to be explored. Similarly, the impact
    of blockchain to manage the resource constraint problem during handover is an
    open research topic. The existing blockchain systems have a low block throughput
    to reach a consensus about new block addition. So, ensuring higher block throughput
    in a dynamic and mobile environment is still an open research question. While
    continuous improvements are being observed from the low throughput consensus protocol,
    like PoW, to high throughput consensus protocol, like Mystiko [332], there is
    still a need for better mechanisms to achieve higher throughput to meet the 6G
    requirements. 8.3. 6G applications 8.3.1. Industrial applications in Industry
    5.0 Following are the lessons learned and future research directions for the use
    of blockchain for 6G-powered industrial applications. Lessons Learned: Future
    industrial applications in Industry 5.0 with underpinning of 6G will see machines
    and humans coming together on the same floor and working in a synergistic environment
    with close interactions. 6G-enabled integration of technologies like VR/AR/XR,
    advance robotics (in form of cobots), AI/ML techniques, and Brain Control Interface
    (BCI) will help humans to perform creative, high-level, controlled and finer tasks
    in Industry 5.0 era. Nevertheless, there are concerns like connection scalability,
    secure and privacy-protected storing and processing of generated Big data by human
    robot interaction, centralized management of on-demand cloud manufacturing, secure
    logging of trade secrets, and automated detection of copyright violation or patent
    infringements. Blockchain potentially can resolve many of these concerns as discussed
    in Section 6.1. Moreover, industrial applications that requires powerful computational
    resources can be securely offloaded to edge servers using blockchain. This significantly
    improves the performance of these applications while keeping the latency minimal.
    Furthermore, blockchains and smart contracts can also be instrumental in automating
    the agreement processes between companies and their partners or customers. Future
    Directions: In spite of promising roles the blockchain can play in Industry 5.0,
    there is need to build standard platforms where smart contracts are integrated
    with industry-scale robotic operating systems, and APIs are made available for
    wide adoption DApps in industrial environment. Moreover, blockchain-based industrial
    ecosystem can also be crippled with availability-targeting attacks such as incentive-based
    DoS attacks (e.g., Blockchain Denial-of-Service (BDoS) [368]) or non-malicious
    glitches during the operation (e.g., due to bugs [369]) [370]. Hence, the extreme
    high reliability objective requires more effort in the blockchain domain for adaptability
    and usability in IoE-enabled 6G industrial application scenarios. 8.3.2. Smart
    healthcare The lessons learned and future research directions for blockchain empowered
    smart healthcare in 6G era. Lessons Learned: 6G-powered smart healthcare ecosystem
    will revolutionize the landscape of medical services like real-time monitoring,
    intelligent preventive healthcare, early diagnosis, H2H services (i.e. mobile
    hospitals), and tele-surgeries with holographic presence of doctors. Although,
    on the one hand, the increasing digitization of healthcare activities with the
    integration of numerous technologies (e.g., IWDs, AI/ML, IIoMTs, and big data
    analytics) and the solid underpinning of 6G, will offer numerous advantages. However,
    on the other hand, the increased digitization is also highly prone to security
    and privacy breaches of medical data. Such medical data breaches result in exposing
    the sensitive/personal information, economic losses, faulty treatment, and permanent
    or long-time damages [241]. Blockchain together with smart contracts and lightweight
    cryptographic techniques can elevate the performance of 6G-powered smart healthcare
    platforms. Specifically, decentralized medical data management, enhanced security
    from attacks (both external and internal attacks), strict access control, and
    uninterrupted service availability are some of the offerings of blockchain in
    healthcare sector. Future Directions: Despite the promising benefits blockchain
    can bring to the realm of 6G-enabled healthcare ecosystem, strong privacy by design
    is required for such systems. This should be followed with real-life rigorous
    testing and formal verification of these systems. Also, blockchain-based unified
    healthcare ecosystem would need required update to the existing legal frameworks
    to allow decentralized storage and processing of private medical data. Especially,
    if blockchain nodes are spread across countries [246]. Also, a well-defined system
    to check the compliance to privacy laws of medical world. 8.3.3. UAV applications:
    The lessons learned and future research directions for blockchain supported 6G-enabled
    UAV applications. Lessons Learned: UAVs, initially conceptualized and developed
    for military applications, have demonstrated their immense applicability in public
    and civil domains as well. With the availability of 6G networks, wide range of
    UAV-based advance use cases such as flying fire brigades, airborne short distance
    taxis, and flying cargo services, will become reality. However, UAVs will be easy
    victim of security attacks like route or mission hijacking, jamming, eavesdropping,
    and rouge device. Moreover, privacy will be at stake since UAVs with its easy
    maneuvering, small size and controlled aerodynamics can silently enter personal
    space. Blockchain has demonstrated its benefits in overcoming these challenges.
    For instance use of blockchain for identity management can efficiently detect
    rouge UAVs. Blockchain based secure logging of UAV’s trajectory, decentralized
    route and resource management, trustless cooperation, and smart contract based
    storage and computational offloading some other use of blockchain for 6G-envisioned
    UAV applications. Future Directions: However, further research is required in
    several areas such as improving privacy, scalability in terms of number of transactions
    per second, security in terms of 51% attacks, and resource utilization in terms
    of power and energy. 8.3.4. CAVs Following are the lessons learned and future
    research directions for the use of blockchain for 6G-enabled CAVs. Lessons Learned:
    Convergence of fully connected and highly autonomous vehicles in form of CAVs
    will be another popular 6G automation use case. Some of the much awaited advantages
    of CAVs are reduction in accidents and fatal consequences, decrease in insurance
    claims, less traffic congestion, effective and automated route planning, P2P vehicular
    resource trading, and even reduction in fuel consumption. However, since with
    every advancements there are associated challenges, the ones with CAVs are support
    for real-time and computational decentralized services, strong security towards
    the use of AI/ML/FL techniques, all time service availability, and trustless and
    privacy protected P2P resource trading. Blockchain along with smart contracts,
    lightweight cryptographic techniques, edge intelligence has shown encouraging
    solutions towards solving these issues. Future Directions: An interesting open
    questions on how to reconcile data protection and privacy issues with immutability
    and transparency in blockchain. Moreover, use of multiple chains and their interoperability
    may be required but to find effective way to do that is still a challenging task.
    8.3.5. Energy Internet (EI) The lessons learned and future research directions
    in context of EI are as follows. Lessons Learned: EI is an emerging internet-based
    paradigm that integrates variety of energy sources (including renewable sources),
    heterogeneous storage systems and advance control and monitoring techniques. With
    the advent of 6G, EI will receive the underlying support to meet the future energy
    demands. However, there are number of impediments that need to be addressed before
    one can achieve full benefit of EI. These are scalability issues with current
    centralized energy business models, nonavailability of complete automation keeping
    in mind the growing number and the time-varying nature of renewable energy sources,
    non-existence of large scale dynamic energy trading platforms, and strict security
    provisions. Recent research demonstrate the applicability of blockchain to mitigate
    many of these issues. For instance, decentralized smart grid management, secure
    logging of smart meter’s readings, decentralized market place for energy trading,
    auditing with strict access control and load-balancing are some of the appealing
    benefits that blockchain can bring to 6G-enabled EI. Future Directions: In future,
    establishment of blockchain-based energy infrastructure and associated APIs will
    ease the advancements in EI sector. Moreover, efficient consensus algorithms will
    be required that can sense and adapt based on energy related parameters. 8.4.
    Relation to other 6G enabling technologies Following the 6G vision and capabilities
    in the previous parts of this section, the most outstanding research opportunities
    for 6G enabling technologies regarding blockchain technology are elaborated in
    this subsection. 8.4.1. Internet of Everything (IoE) The distinguishing role of
    IoE as discussed in [371] will be the total transformation of business processes
    and business models. By the optimization and automatization of such processes
    with intrinsic digital technology, new business models and value chains in different
    industries become feasible. From the business perspective, it will be worthwhile
    to the impact of integrating IoE in future ICT systems [372]. Particularly, the
    unprecedented business velocity and agility will lead to a high competition pressure
    among businesses. To this end, the pros and cons of integrating blockchain-based
    technologies for enabling interoperability among different entities and industries,
    e.g., charging and billing, is an important research topic. 8.4.2. Data storage
    and analytics As the IoE concept is realized in future networks, an enormous number
    of things and objects will continuously generate and stream new data in real-time.
    That phenomenon leads to the fundamental requirement of efficient and capable
    centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in 6G. Blockchain enabled
    technologies for data storage, management and processing can play a key role to
    address this challenging need. However, it is an open question how to distribute
    and synthesize these technologies in different network domains (e.g., edge, fog,
    and cloud). Moreover, research on data analytics methods will be critical to analyze
    and then extract the crucial elements out of this large amount of data for effective
    and accurate decision making. The appropriate methods mainly depend on the type
    of use cases and applications. The four main categories of methods in that regard
    are descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive
    analytics as listed by [373]. As a future research direction, investigation on
    efficient ways to integrate these data analytics methods with a blockchain based
    distributed data storage and smart contracts for process automation can be studied.
    8.4.3. Quantum Computing There are specific vulnerabilities of blockchain technology
    manifested by the development of quantum computers. Namely, the security of distributed
    ledger technology depends on the difficulty of solving certain cryptographic problems
    which are undermined by the potential of quantum computation [374]. However, two
    research questions for blockchain are relevant to quantum computing era in 6G:
    (i) Hashing security: A key assumption for hashing security is that inversion
    is computationally difficult. However, a quantum computer can mitigate this barrier.
    Then the authenticity of the upstream blockchain is not guaranteed anymore and
    the blockchain entries can be compromised in terms of authentication. (ii) Quantum
    informational modeling: With quantum computing in operation, quantum informational
    versions of systems such as blockchain are essential. In that regard, an envisaged
    research direction is quantum resistant cryptography, also known as post-quantum
    cryptography, which further studies potential attacks exploiting a quantum computer
    for the analysis of conventional cryptographic algorithms. With the parallel developments
    in quantum computing and blockchainized 6G networks, this is an important research
    question to have future-proof 6G specifications and standardization. 8.4.4. Edge
    computing Edge computing is an inherently distributed environment that needs mechanisms
    for secure and trustworthy data as well as computation fluidity [375]. Therefore,
    blockchain is to be integrated into edge computing in 6G networks [376]. It is
    possible for resource owners to join the ecosystem and to lend the compute resources
    as needed. IoT devices can offload some of the edge computation to the resource
    owner nodes when required [377]. In [378], the integration of smart contracts
    with the edge nodes acting as a platform hierarchical and distributed control
    systems is presented. The executive process control is based on a micro-services
    architecture where Docker containers implement function blocks with Kubernetes
    platform used as the edge orchestrator. Blockchain technology has also emerged
    as a solution for managing MEC services, with consensus protocols and data integrity
    checks that enable transparent and efficient distributed decision-making [35],
    [379]. An existing blockchain cannot be directly applied to an edge network since
    it requires all participants to store the entire history of the data provenance,
    which clearly cannot be achieved by most end devices under certain resource constraints
    [380]. To summarize, existing security and fault tolerance approaches pose unrealistic
    expectations on compute, network, or storage in the context of edge computing.
    For edge computing in 6G, blockchain driven scalability enhancement and resource
    management is an interesting research direction [376]. Blockchain provides techniques
    to address these aspects albeit also bringing forth its own challenges (e.g.,
    complexity and scalability). Blockchain can also support self-organization due
    as an enabler for distributed data exchange and control. Furthermore, how to provide
    security is a crucial research question as the case for the overall 6G network.
    9. Conclusion 6G wireless networks, driven by the vast and heterogeneous demands
    of hyper-connected existence of everything, will indeed give rise to new use cases
    as well as business avenues. In line with ongoing resurgence of research activities
    centered around 6G, this paper took a deep dive to comprehend multitude of benefits
    that can be achieved with integration of blockchain in 6G. In particular, the
    survey began with tracking the trends, requirements, applications and key technological
    enablers for 6G, which revealed the panoramic view of current 6G evolution. Then,
    the paper assimilated various technical aspects of 6G by presenting the key challenges
    and benefits that blockchain can usher. Further, the paper presented that blockchainized
    6G ecosystem can offer diverse and substantial underpinning to future envisioned
    use cases and applications. Towards the end, dedicated efforts have been put to
    delineate numerous research opportunities. In summary, blockchain has immense
    potential that can be harnessed for designing next generation of mobile networks,
    however, more research efforts are required to ensure the extent to which it can
    be pragmatically used. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    \ Internet of Things Systems\nby\nAnastassia Gharib, B.Sc.\nA thesis submitted\
    \ to the\nFaculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Aﬀairs\nin partial fulﬁllment of\
    \ the requirements for the degree of\nMaster of Applied Science in Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\nOttawa-Carleton Institute for Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nDepartment of Systems and Computer Engineering\nCarleton University\n\
    Ottawa, Ontario\nApril, 2018\nc⃝Copyright\nAnastassia Gharib, 2018\nAbstract\n\
    The emerge of Internet of Things (IoT) brings up revolutionary changes to the\
    \ ﬁeld\nof wireless communications. Providing connection to billions of IoT devices\
    \ together\nwith challenging IoT environments lead to the need of new technologies\
    \ in order\nto fulﬁll IoT spectrum demands. Cognitive radio (CR) technology can\
    \ be seen as\none of the prominent solutions to the spectrum scarcity issue in\
    \ IoT, where multi-\nband cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is the key.\nIn this\
    \ thesis, we consider\nheterogeneous distributed learning-based CR networks (CRNs).\
    \ Focus is given to\nlearning approaches named as incremental, consensus, and\
    \ diﬀusion. We perform a\ncomparative study to investigate which one of them best\
    \ ﬁts cognitive IoT demands.\nSimulation results are performed illustrating potentials\
    \ of diﬀusion and consensus\nalgorithms and disadvantages of incremental for cognitive\
    \ IoT systems.\nLack of centralized control, increase in number of devices, and\
    \ dynamic envi-\nronments place a room for lots of challenges in the CSS process.\
    \ Conventional CSS\ntechniques have to be improved in order to fulﬁll sophisticated\
    \ IoT requirements. One\nof the main challenges is cooperative secondary users’\
    \ (SUs’) scheduling to sense a\nsubset of channels. To overcome the aforementioned\
    \ challenge, in this thesis, we pro-\npose a novel multi-band CSS scheme, named\
    \ as heterogeneous multi-band multi-user\nCSS (HM2CSS). The proposed scheme allows\
    \ heterogeneous SUs to sense multiple\nchannels and works by selecting cooperative\
    \ SUs in two stages. Only SUs owning\ndiﬀerent information about channels are\
    \ chosen to be cooperative. This is done by\nselecting leaders for each channel\
    \ in the ﬁrst stage and corresponding cooperative\nSUs in the second stage. Careful\
    \ choice of leaders reﬂects the selection of cooperative\nSUs and hence, improves\
    \ system performance. Then, diﬀusion learning algorithm is\nused to exchange locally\
    \ sensed information among cooperative SUs for all channels.\nFurther, the decision\
    \ on the availability of channels is made.\nExtensive simulation results illustrate\
    \ that the proposed HM2CSS scheme satisﬁes\nthe IEEE 802.22 detection performance\
    \ standard. Detection performance and CRN\nii\nthroughput results are improved\
    \ compared to the existing multi-band CSS schemes.\nFurthermore, it is shown that\
    \ the proposed HM2CSS scheme is scalable in terms of\ndetection performance. This\
    \ allows new nodes to join the CRN without additional\nhuman intervention to bring\
    \ the performance level back. Compared to the existing\nmulti-band CSS schemes,\
    \ system’s detection performance does not degrade when in-\ncreasing the CRN’s\
    \ size. In addition, the proposed HM2CSS scheme provides fair\nenergy consumption\
    \ for CSS on all channels and illustrates lower aggregate energy\nconsumption\
    \ for the system in total. Nevertheless, HM2CSS has its own drawbacks\nyet to\
    \ overcome. It introduces higher computational complexity and power consump-\n\
    tion per channel for certain detector types. Finally, future research insights\
    \ are given\nin order to improve and overcome the drawbacks of HM2CSS and existing\
    \ multi-band\nCSS schemes.\niii\nList of Publications\n• Oral presentation, Scalable\

    Secondary User\nxv\nChapter 1\nIntroduction\nIn heterogeneous Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) systems, spectrum scarcity is believed to be\none of the most crucial\
    \ problems [1,2]. Supporting the large number of IoT devices’\npervasive connectivity\
    \ is a hard task to achieve. Keeping pace with spectrum demands\nwill require\
    \ new technologies that can oﬀer acceptable intercommunication between\nIoT nodes.\
    \ In order to address the spectrum scarcity issue, cognitive radio (CR) has\n\
    drawn drastic attention as a potential technology for future IoT systems [3,4].\
    \ The\nprinciple of CR networks (CRNs) lies in identifying additional frequency\
    \ beings on\nthe same frequency spectrum band with the main spectrum users without\
    \ disturbing\ntheir communication [5]. Those additional CR users are also called\
    \ secondary users\n(SUs), while the main spectrum users are known as primary users\
    \ (PUs).\nGenerally, wide-band spectrum is divided into non-overlapping channels\
    \ causing\nmulti-band structure in CRNs. Within CR, spectrum sensing is a key\
    \ component. In\nmulti-band cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), instead of sensing\
    \ all channels, each\nSU senses multiple channels to determine their occupancy\
    \ due to hardware limitations\nand energy consumption constraints. Multi-band\
    \ CSS based on the CR technology\ncan be a necessary component to fulﬁll the spectrum\
    \ demand of future IoT systems\nowning large numbers of IoT sensor nodes.\nTraditionally,\
    \ CSS can be done in centralized or distributed ways [6].\nIn the\ncentralized\
    \ approach, SUs cannot communicate with each other. They forward local\nsensing\
    \ information to a central entity, also called fusion center (FC). FC controls\
    \ the\nsystem and makes decisions on the availability of channels based on the\
    \ feedback from\nSUs. However, in the distributed approach, SUs exchange their\
    \ local observations\nwith the corresponding cooperative SUs to determine the\
    \ availability of channels.\nCentral entity is not needed in this case as the\
    \ system is decentralized. The nature\n1\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n2\nof IoT systems\
    \ is distributed [3]. In addition to this, IoT networks place focus on\nlearning\
    \ and feedback information about the environment [4]. Therefore, distributed\n\
    approach tends to be more favorable in the IoT scenario.\n1.1\nMotivation\nIn\
    \ traditional distributed multi-band CSS, SUs sense channels owned by PUs indepen-\n\
    dently, using a single detector type. Then, distributed learning algorithms are\
    \ used\nto make cooperative decisions on the availability of channels [6]. However,\
    \ the nature\nof IoT comes up with revolutionary ideas. CSS for IoT systems has\
    \ to consider spec-\ntrum analysis, history and prediction, network reconﬁguration,\
    \ and computational\ncomplexity of secondary IoT-nodes [3]. Cognitive IoT systems\
    \ have to take into ac-\ncount prior information available about signals carried\
    \ over channels. In addition,\nscalability is another key IoT-driven requirement,\
    \ which implies network growth with\ntime [7]. SUs deployed in CRNs may have diﬀerent\
    \ types of spectrum detectors due to\nthe heterogeneous nature of IoT systems.\
    \ Nevertheless, supplementary heterogeneous\nSUs may cause system performance\
    \ degradation, leading to extra human interven-\ntion in order to get the acceptable\
    \ performance level back. Therefore, in order to\nhave stable system performance\
    \ for all channels, it is essential to study and improve\ndistributed multi-band\
    \ CSS schemes by considering IoT demands mentioned above.\n1.2\nProblem Formulation\n\
    In this thesis, we propose a heterogeneous multi-band multi-user CSS (HM2CSS)\n\
    scheme for distributed IoT systems. Due to the fact that system model is set to\n\
    be heterogeneous, we consider three types of detectors for local spectrum sensing,\n\
    which include energy detector (ED), pilot tone-based detector (PD), and orthogonal\n\
    frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based detector (OD). Each SU is equipped\n\
    with one of the available detectors due to hardware limitations of secondary IoT\n\
    nodes.\nThe design of IoT-based multi-band CSS is very challenging mainly because\
    \ of\nSUs’ scheduling to sense a subset of channels. Correct choice of cooperative\
    \ SUs\nmay signiﬁcantly increase system performance level and reduce latency [8].\
    \ Further-\nmore, heterogeneous multi-band multi-user CRNs place serious challenges\
    \ in terms of\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n3\nfairness in the cooperative SU-selection\
    \ process. Choosing cooperative SUs owning\nnon-similar information about PUs’\
    \ signal levels is essential for the learning process\nto be accomplished. In\
    \ addition, stable system performance as the network size grows\nis essential\
    \ in distributed cognitive IoT systems due to the lack of overall centralized\n\
    control. Hence, a cooperative SU-selection problem is formulated and solved in\
    \ two\nstages.\nIn the ﬁrst stage, SU-leaders, best SUs to listen to for each\
    \ channel, are\nformed. An optimization problem of SU-leaders’ selection for all\
    \ channels is formu-\nlated depending on the type of the prior information available\
    \ about the channel.\nWe then analyze the correlation between leaders’ and other\
    \ SUs’ received signal en-\nvelopes. This information is later on used to formulate\
    \ another optimization problem\nin order to decide on the best cooperative SUs\
    \ for the corresponding channels in the\nsecond stage. In our scheme, only SUs\
    \ with diﬀerent information owned for the same\nchannel are chosen to be cooperative,\
    \ which improves the performance of cognitive\nIoT systems. Consequently, cooperative\
    \ SUs sense channels and the diﬀusion learning\nalgorithm is used to determine\
    \ the occupancy of channels. While implementing the\nproposed HM2CSS scheme, we\
    \ solve the challenges of heterogeneity, provide scalabil-\nity and improvements\
    \ in terms of detection performance, enhance CRN throughput,\nand accommodates\
    \ fair energy consumption on sensing for all channels.\n1.3\nThesis Outline and\
    \ Contributions\n1.3.1\nThesis Outline\nThe outline of this thesis is as follows.\
    \ Chapter 2 provides a brief background of\nIoT as well as CR. It discusses incorporation\
    \ of the CR technology into IoT sys-\ntems. Then, the multi-band CSS problem is\
    \ formulated, and existing CSS schemes\nare described. We further present several\
    \ performance measures including detection\nperformance, aggregate CRN throughput,\
    \ and energy consumption on the sensing\nprocess. In Chapter 3, three diﬀerent\
    \ network architectures of cognitive IoT systems,\nnamed as centralized, distributed,\
    \ and hybrid, are discussed. The advantages and\ndisadvantages of each one of\
    \ them are revealed taking into account the nature of\nIoT. In addition, challenges\
    \ of multi-band CSS for cognitive IoT systems compared\nto those for conventional\
    \ CRNs are explained thoroughly. We consider issues and re-\nquirements in designing\
    \ new multi-band CSS schemes within cognitive IoT systems.\nChapter 4 addresses\
    \ the importance of learning schemes for the distributed approach.\nCHAPTER 1.\
    \ INTRODUCTION\n4\nOur objective is to investigate, which learning schemes are\
    \ suitable to be used for\ncognitive IoT systems. Hence, a comparative study between\
    \ several existing learning\napproaches is performed, taking into account the\
    \ challenges of cognitive IoT systems\ndiscussed in Chapter 3. Motivated by the\
    \ requirements of IoT systems, we propose\na novel HM2CSS scheme in Chapter 5.\
    \ Simulation results are provided comparing\nthe proposed HM2CSS scheme to the\
    \ existing distributed and centralized schemes.\nFinally, Chapter 6 provides a\
    \ conclusion with potential future research directions.\n1.3.2\nMain Contributions\n\
    The main contributions of this thesis are as follows:\n1. A comparative study\
    \ between three mostly used learning algorithms for dis-\ntributed CRNs, named\
    \ as incremental, consensus, and diﬀusion-based learning,\nis performed.\n(a)\
    \ Simulation results are provided illustrating the learning process for cases\n\
    of no link failure and 30% link failure. System robustness is analyzed in\nthis\
    \ way.\n(b) Simulation results are performed demonstrating the average number\
    \ of\niterations needed to accomplish the learning process for diﬀerent values\
    \ of\ncooperative SUs. These results are further used in order to decide on the\n\
    scalability abilities of the learning approaches.\n(c) Based on this study, we\
    \ decide on the best suitable learning schemes for\ncognitive IoT systems. The\
    \ results illustrate potentials of diﬀusion and\nconsensus-based algorithms and\
    \ reveal the disadvantages of the incremen-\ntal approach for future IoT-based\
    \ CRNs.\n2. We propose a novel multi-band CSS scheme for distributed learning-based\
    \ cogni-\ntive IoT systems named as HM2CSS, which solves the challenges of heterogene-\n\
    ity, provides scalability and improvements in terms of detection performance,\
    \ en-\nhances CRN throughput, and provides fair sensing energy consumption among\n\
    SUs and channels.\n3. SU-selection is one of the key requirements for CSS. Hence,\
    \ the proposed\nHM2CSS scheme ﬁrst selects leaders among SUs for each channel\
    \ and then,\nchooses corresponding cooperative SUs to sense these channels:\n\
    CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n5\n(a) We formulate an optimization problem to choose\
    \ SU-leaders for all chan-\nnels. This is done based on the information available\
    \ about the channels,\nsuch that selected SU-leaders are the best SUs to listen\
    \ to for the corre-\nsponding channels.\n(b) We then formulate an optimization\
    \ problem to select corresponding co-\noperative SUs for each channel, such that\
    \ SUs with similar information\nsensed are not selected to be cooperative for\
    \ the same channel. This is\ndone by means of received signals’ correlation analysis.\
    \ We provide fair\ndistribution of energy consumed on the sensing process for\
    \ all channels.\n(c) We adopt the branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm to solve the\
    \ aforemen-\ntioned optimization problems.\nFor each one of them, the optimization\n\
    process is performed concurrently with respect to all channels, indepen-\ndently\
    \ of the prior information available about them.\n4. Simulations are performed\
    \ to demonstrate the performance of the proposed\nHM2CSS scheme. The results are\
    \ compared to the existing multi-band CSS\nschemes. Simulation results show to\
    \ improve and provide scalability in terms\nof global probability of detection,\
    \ enhance CRN throughput, and provide fair\nsensing energy consumption among all\
    \ channels.\n1.4\nNotations\nIn this thesis, we focus on the discrete-time signal\
    \ type. Therefore, all signals are\nformed as column vectors, having the dimensions\
    \ of N × 1, where N is the number\nof samples used to sense a signal. Boldface\
    \ characters are used to express vectors,\nand boldface upper-case characters\
    \ are used to express matrices. The corresponding\nexamples are, the received\
    \ signal x= [x1 x2 ... xN]T, where (.)T indicates the transpose\noperator, and\
    \ the identity matrix I. In addition to this, N(µ, σ2) and CN(µ, σ2) stand\nfor\
    \ real and complex Gaussian random variables (RVs), respectively, with mean µ\
    \ and\nvariance σ2. All random processes are assumed to be independent and identically\n\
    distributed (IID). Finally, Q(x)\n∆=\nR ∞\nx\n1\n√2×π × exp( −t2\n2 )dt is used\
    \ as a deﬁnition to\nthe standard Gaussian distribution function with Q−1(.) as\
    \ its inverse [9]. Hence, if\nX ∼ N(µ, σ2), then Pr(X ≥ x) = Q\n\0 x−µ\nσ\n\x01\
    \nis the probability that X ≥ x.\nChapter 2\nBackground\n2.1\nIntroduction\nIn\
    \ IoT systems, spectrum scarcity is believed to be one of the most crucial problems.\n\
    In this section, we provide an overview of IoT and CR. Further, we discuss how\n\
    incorporating CR into IoT can be one of the solutions to address the spectral\
    \ eﬃciency\n(SE) issue in IoT systems.\n2.1.1\nInternet of Things Concept\nNowadays,\
    \ IoT can be deﬁned as [10]:\n“a loosely coupled, decentralized, and dynamic system\
    \ in which billions (even tril-\nlions) of everyday objects are endowed with intelligence\
    \ (smartness) to increase their\nown capabilities and seamlessly communicate and\
    \ cooperate despite their physical /\nfunctional heterogeneities, becoming active\
    \ participants in business, logistics, infor-\nmation and social processes”.\n\
    According to [11], the number of devices connected to the Internet is already\n\
    exceeding the world population as illustrated in Fig. 2.1. It is shown that in\
    \ 2020,\nthere will be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet. Thus, it\
    \ is believed that 75%\nof network traﬃc will be accounted for IoT-based devices\
    \ in 2020 [7]. Most IoT nodes\nare low-power and are fundamental building blocks\
    \ of large scale IoT systems. For\neach IoT node, there should be enough energy\
    \ and spectrum to transmit information.\nMoreover, it should be able to communicate\
    \ reliably and eﬃciently. However, this\nplaces a room for great challenges particularly\
    \ in the physical layer design of IoT\nsystems. Not surprisingly, studies claim\
    \ that in order to support IoT systems, next\n6\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n7\nFigure\

    generation networks (NGNs) should have eﬃcient enhancements compared to the\n\
    current ones: increase in SE 5-15 times, energy eﬃciency (EE) 100+ times, and\
    \ cost\neﬃciency (CE) 100+ times [12]. Clearly, IoT challenges should be analyzed\
    \ from both\nrequirement perspectives, system level and the device one.\nThe scope\
    \ of applications deployed by IoT is widely broad ranging from health\nmonitoring\
    \ and safety to transportation and smart cities. Fig. 2.2 reveals the main\ndomains\
    \ of IoT applications such as health, agriculture, industry and automation,\n\
    smart cities, body area networks, security and emergency, connected objects /\
    \ pets\nand smart homes, smart grid and metering, as well as intelligent transportation\
    \ [13].\nConcluding, such a wide, heterogeneous, and scalable concept as IoT leads\
    \ to lots\nof challenges in terms of physical layer connectivity. Providing communication\
    \ for\nan enormous number of heterogeneous devices is one of the hardest tasks.\
    \ Keeping\npace with spectrum and energy demands will require new technologies\
    \ that can oﬀer\nacceptable intercommunication between IoT nodes. The following\
    \ sections will discuss\nthe CR concept and its potentials to provide solutions\
    \ for the challenges facing IoT\nsystems mentioned above.\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n\
    8\nFigure 2.2: Major application domains of IoT.\n2.1.2\nCognitive Radio Overview\n\
    Traditionally, channels are allocated in a static way, which implies the existence\
    \ of\nPUs only. Each licensed spectrum band is assigned to a speciﬁc licensed\
    \ service and\nits PUs. Hence, reallocation of licensed spectrum bands is not\
    \ allowed. However, this\nleads to spectrum underutilization [14–17]. In some\
    \ communication systems, users\nare most of the time in the idle mode, and frequency\
    \ channels are left unallocated.\nAn example of such scenario is the case of ﬁeld\
    \ spectrum measurements, which took\nplace in New York, showing the maximum aggregate\
    \ wireless spectrum occupancy of\n13.1% for the bands of 30 MHz to 3 GHz [18].\
    \ This reveals the disadvantage of static\nspectrum allocation. Although static\
    \ spectrum allocation has its own advantages of a\nmore secure and less interference\
    \ communication, dynamic approach can help utilize\nspectrum eﬃciently solving\
    \ the spectrum scarcity problem of the future [19].\nCR technology appears to\
    \ be one of the most promising technologies of dynamic\nspectrum allocation that\
    \ solves spectrum issues mentioned above. CR roots can be\ntracked back to 1999,\
    \ when it was ﬁrst introduced by J. Mitola [20]. In CRNs, CR\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n\
    9\nusers / SUs can opportunistically access the spectrum without aﬀecting the\
    \ transmis-\nsion of legitimate users / PUs [5]. CR is believed to be a key technology\
    \ to address\nspectrum demands in NGNs [4, 21]. The key of CR lies in self-organizing\
    \ networks\nand awareness of the environment. It implies main objectives of highly\
    \ reliable com-\nmunication and eﬃcient utilization of radio spectrum by learning\
    \ from the ambient\nenvironment and adapting according to the knowledge gained\
    \ [22]. The IEEE 802.22\nstandard for wireless regional area networks is being\
    \ developed supporting the CR\ntechnology to operate over television broadcast\
    \ bands in an unlicensed way [16].\nThe CR system architecture consists of three\
    \ diﬀerent parts [23]. The ﬁrst one\nis the primary network (PN), which represents\
    \ a set of PUs having the priority to\naccess the spectrum. The secondary part,\
    \ named as CRN, is a set of SUs, which also\nneed spectrum to communicate, but\
    \ have less priority to access it. The third part of\nthe system is spectrum itself\
    \ together with the environment. Conventionally, the CR\ntechnology consists of\
    \ four diﬀerent modules: spectrum sensing, spectrum decision,\nmobility, and spectrum\
    \ sharing, as illustrated in Fig. 2.3. The main cycles of CR\nare formed as sensing\
    \ the spectrum, selecting the best frequency bands, coordinating\nspectrum access\
    \ with other users, and sharing the spectrum with PUs when allowed\nFigure 2.3:\

    \ opportunistic spectrum access, underlay, and over-\nlay.\n[24]. The concept\
    \ of CR lies in allowing SUs to communicate without interrupting\nPUs by using\
    \ one of three diﬀerent paradigms [5]: opportunistic spectrum access,\nunderlay,\
    \ and overlay. Fig. 2.4 illustrates the three CR paradigms mentioned above.\n\
    A widely studied form of CR is opportunistic spectrum access [25–27]. It is believed\n\
    to be the most fundamental CR approach. White spaces are searched in this case.\n\
    This means that currently unoccupied by PUs bands can be used by SUs. SUs sense\n\
    channels and decide if PUs are in idle or active modes. In case PUs are not present,\n\
    SUs are allowed to use the spectrum. However, PUs and SUs cannot coexist on the\n\
    same channels at once. This means that as soon as PUs appear, SUs have to vacate\n\
    the corresponding channels. On the other hand, underlay and overlay CR paradigms\n\
    allow SUs to share spectrum resources concurrently with PUs. The underlay paradigm\n\
    permits SUs to access the licensed bands of PUs under a certain threshold constraint\n\
    of the SUs’ transmitting power, also called interference temperature [5]. Interference\n\
    temperature is a metric that evaluates the allowed interference level coming from\
    \ SUs\nto be experienced by PUs. In this case, SUs are usually limited to transmitting\
    \ at low\ndistance ranges due to power level restrictions. As for the overlay\
    \ paradigm, detailed\ninformation of PUs’ codebooks and messages is required to\
    \ be owned by SUs [5].\nIn this way, SUs are allowed to transmit with higher power\
    \ levels. Essentially, the\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n11\nFigure 2.5: IoT-based CR\
    \ cycle.\ncommunication of PUs and SUs is based upon helping each other in this\
    \ case. SUs\nact as relays for PUs, while being allowed to co-share PUs’ spectrum\
    \ bands. One of\nthe major drawbacks of the overlay paradigm is the need of feedback\
    \ links. In larger\nnetworks, feedback may cause overhead. Nevertheless, the technique\
    \ is still believed\nto be useful and eﬃcient for smaller networks.\n2.1.3\nIncorporating\
    \ Cognitive Radio into Internet of Things\nIncorporating CR into IoT brings up\
    \ additional modules to the CR cycle, which in\ntotal consists of [3]: spectrum\
    \ sensing, spectrum analysis, history and prediction,\nspectrum decision, spectrum-aware\
    \ routing, security and privacy, spectrum-mobility,\nand reconﬁguration, as illustrated\
    \ in Fig. 2.5. Introducing CR to IoT can bring\nthe advantages of greater accessibility,\
    \ better usability, improved adaptability, en-\nhanced interconnectivity, scalability,\
    \ and enhanced reliability [26]. CR is expected to\nminimize human intervention\
    \ in IoT through learning and adaptation.\nMulti-band CR technology has drawn\
    \ drastic attention as a potential solution to\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n12\nfuture\
    \ IoT networks’ spectrum access issues [3, 7, 27–29]. It is believed to be a nec-\n\
    essary component to fulﬁll the spectrum demand of future IoT systems. Multi-band\n\
    CR addresses spectrum underutilization and scarcity problems by allowing SUs to\n\
    share spectrum together with PUs during their idle mode or concurrently by apply-\n\
    ing some interference constraints on secondary IoT-nodes. It brings up the advantages\n\
    of spectrum scarcity relief, cost reduction for spectrum holders, massive connectiv-\n\
    ity in crowded areas, minimization of human intervention, mobility, monitoring\
    \ of\nenvironment, and learning to IoT systems [3,7,12]. Nevertheless, together\
    \ with ad-\nvantages, there are several disadvantages in applying it to IoT systems.\
    \ Among those\nare interference between PUs-SUs and SUs-SUs, quick out-date of\
    \ sensed information,\nrequirement of prior information of the PU signal for certain\
    \ detector types, security,\netc. However, those disadvantages can be formed as\
    \ challenges to be addressed in\nnew multi-band CSS schemes for cognitive IoT\
    \ systems.\nResearchers from academia and industry are investigating CR issues\
    \ in IoT sys-\ntems. Various projects devoted to spectrum scarcity and IoT were,\
    \ are in present, and\nare approved to be funded in the next few years. A proposal\
    \ for experimental infras-\ntructure creation, reconﬁguration, and extension called\
    \ “Large-scale Experimentation\non Dynamic Spectrum Sharing in IoT” was accepted\
    \ by European Commission De-\ncision for 2016-2017 years [30]. Furthermore, “5G\
    \ Long Term Evolution29” facing\nstrategies for spectrum sharing and usage optimization\
    \ in licensed and unlicensed\nbands of heterogeneous IoT systems is approved for\
    \ 2019-2020 years [31]. These ex-\namples of projects and research works reveal\
    \ the importance of the topic for future\nIoT systems.\nThe rest of the chapter\
    \ is structured as follows. In Section 2.2, the multi-band\nCSS problem is formulated.\
    \ Then, an overview on existing CSS schemes is given in\nSection 2.3. Performance\
    \ measures are presented, which will be used in analyzing the\nproposed HM2CSS\
    \ scheme in Section 2.4. Finally, Section 2.5 concludes the chapter\nwith a brief\
    \ summary.\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n13\n2.2\nThe Multi-band Cooperative Spectrum\
    \ Sens-\ning Problem\nIn non-cooperative spectrum sensing, each SU senses all\
    \ channels and then, sepa-\nrately decides if the sensed channels are occupied\
    \ or not [24]. In contrast with non-\ncooperative spectrum sensing, CSS is using\
    \ cooperation of multiple SUs by sharing\nsensed information with each other in\
    \ order to determine the availability of chan-\nnels. Cooperation brings the beneﬁt\
    \ of an increase in reliability of the system. This\ninformation is later on used\
    \ to make decisions on spectrum access by SUs.\nMost of the recent research in\
    \ CSS has focused on the single-band case. However,\nmulti-band CSS can signiﬁcantly\
    \ enhance the performance by providing access to a\nwider range of spectrum, reducing\
    \ spectrum hand-oﬀ, and minimizing energy con-\nsumption on spectrum sensing by\
    \ assigning a subset of channels to each SU [6, 8].\nMulti-band approach improves\
    \ system’s performance, allowing utilization of carrier\naggregation by means\
    \ of adaptive spectrum support management [32]. Range of low\nto high communication\
    \ bandwidths can be implemented, which brings up combin-\ning two or more channels\
    \ to be able to use larger bandwidth for spectrum-hungry\napplications.\nFig.\n\
    2.6 illustrates the multi-band CSS process as a fundamental part of the\nCR technology.\
    \ In multi-band CSS, wide-band spectrum can be divided into non-\noverlapping\
    \ channels, also called sub-bands, i.e., M = {m1, m2, ... mM}. Each SU\nfrom K\
    \ = {SU1, SU2, ... SUK} senses multiple channels to determine their occupancy.\n\
    Due to hardware limitations and energy consumption issues, the maximum amount\n\
    of channels allowed to be sensed by one SU is I, where I < M. This means that\
    \ in\npractical CRNs, SUs may have diﬀerent capabilities to sense diﬀerent channels\
    \ based\non their location and channel state information. Selecting cooperative\
    \ SUs can help\novercome an overhead, especially if several SUs are in deep fade\
    \ with respect to certain\nchannels or owe similar information after the local\
    \ sensing process. In addition to\nthis, it helps to reduce the amount of energy\
    \ consumed on sensing. However, selecting\ncooperative SUs is a challenging task,\
    \ which depends on the nature of the network.\nAfter cooperative SUs are selected,\
    \ they have to sense channels assigned to them.\nEach SU from the cooperative\
    \ SU-cluster has to solve multiple binary hypothesis\nproblem in the following\
    \ way:\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n14\nTotal amount of SUs: ܭ\nTotal amount of channels:\

    \ wk\nm is the circularly symmetric complex Gaussian noise with zero mean\nand\
    \ (σk\nm)2 variance, i.e., wk\nm ∼ CN(0, (σk\nm)2I). The solution of the demonstrated\n\

    \ In case test statistics is greater than the threshold,\nthe PU is believed to\
    \ be in the active mode. Nevertheless, if test statistics is less than\nthe corresponding\
    \ threshold, the PU is believed to be in the idle mode and a SU is\nallowed to\
    \ access the channel. Later, depending on the network structure of either\ncentralized\
    \ or distributed types, certain rules or learning algorithms are being used,\n\
    respectively, to cooperatively decide on the occupancy of channels.\n2.3\nRelated\
    \ Work\nThere have been a plethora of research eﬀorts in recent years in the area\
    \ of CSS. This\nsection gives a brief state-of-the-art summary of this ﬁeld.\n\
    To begin with, authors propose an energy-eﬃcient reliable decision transmission\n\
    scheme for IoT-based CSS in [33]. The proposed scheme has a centralized system\n\
    model which uses the OR / AND-rule and improves the probability of detection as\
    \ well\nas reduces energy consumption on the sensing process. However, the aforementioned\n\
    work does not take into account the multi-band approach. Recently, several multi-\n\
    band spectrum sensing schemes are proposed in literature. The non-uniform sensing\n\
    duration of multi-band spectrum access is analyzed for centralized CRNs in [15].\n\
    Authors in [34] propose an eﬃcient ED-based centralized multi-band CSS scheme,\n\
    which uses the detection threshold optimization to minimize energy consumption\n\
    on the sensing process. A basic centralized multi-band spectrum sensing scheme\
    \ is\nproposed in [8] to reduce the complexity of the spectrum sensing process.\
    \ Authors\nprovide a thorough throughput analysis of the proposed system. Nevertheless,\
    \ all\nworks mentioned above do not take into account either the heterogeneous\
    \ aspect of\nSUs or the distributed system topology.\nIn [35], an optimal multi-band\
    \ distributed homogeneous CSS scheme is proposed,\nwhich maximizes the CRN throughput\
    \ with constraints on energy and signal pro-\ncessing resources consumed on sensing.\n\
    Moreover, in [36], authors propose a ho-\nmogeneous distributed persistent spectrum\
    \ sensing strategy (PSSS), which uses PU\ntraﬃc patterns to determine channels\
    \ to be sensed for multi-band spectrum sensing of\ncentralized CRNs. Further,\
    \ authors propose an adaptive spectrum sensing strategy,\nwhich uses PSSS or random\
    \ spectrum sensing strategy (RSSS) to select channels to\nbe sensed. In [37],\
    \ a heterogeneous centralized system using k-out-of-K rule is ana-\nlyzed. Centralized\
    \ and distributed consensus learning-based heterogeneous CRNs are\nCHAPTER 2.\
    \ BACKGROUND\n16\ncompared in terms of CRN throughput analysis in [6]. There,\
    \ cooperative SUs that\nsense a certain number of channels are chosen arbitrarily,\
    \ i.e., in a random manner.\nNevertheless, random SU-selection may lead to system\
    \ performance degradation as\nthe network size increases.\nThere exists plenty\
    \ solutions for cooperative SU-selection schemes for single-band\nCRNs. In [38],\
    \ a single channel CRN is assumed, where one user is chosen randomly\nand then,\
    \ Cramer-Von Mises (CVM) test values are calculated to select the rest\ncooperative\
    \ SUs. Only those SUs are selected to be cooperative, for which CVM\ntest values\
    \ are greater than the calculated threshold. In [39], a distributed heuristic\n\
    algorithm is proposed to reduce the energy consumption of the system by minimizing\n\
    the number of cooperative SUs selected. However, in this system, SUs located within\n\
    a certain distance to a PU are not allowed to use the spectrum and act only as\
    \ sensing\nunits. As it can be seen, the works mentioned above do not consider\
    \ SU-selection in\nthe heterogeneous multi-band context.\nConcluding, non-arbitrary\
    \ ways of assigning channels to be sensed by participating\nSUs in heterogeneous\
    \ multi-band multi-user distributed CRNs are not considered\nin the existing literature.\
    \ Hence, we propose a multi-band CSS scheme, named as\nHM2CSS, for distributed\
    \ CRNs to accommodate heterogeneity and improve detection\nperformance and CRN\
    \ throughput of IoT systems.\n2.4\nPerformance Measures\nIn this section, a brief\
    \ overview is given to the performance metrics that will be\nemployed to test\
    \ and evaluate the proposed HM2CSS scheme.\n2.4.1\nDetection Performance\nTraditionally,\
    \ spectrum sensing performance is evaluated by analyzing two probabili-\nties\
    \ as follows: 1) the probability of detection, which represents the probability\
    \ that a\nSU detects a PU correctly, while the PU is in the active mode and 2)\
    \ the probability\nof false alarm, which reveals incorrect decision of a SU that\
    \ a PU is present while the\nPU is in the idle mode. Mathematically, the probability\
    \ of detection, also called PU\nprotection level, is expressed as follows:\nPd(ζm,k)\n\
    ∆= Pr\n\x10\nΛ(xk\nm) > ζm,k|Hm,k\n1\n\x11\n= 1 − FΛ|Hm,k\n1\n(ζm,k),\n(2.3)\n\
    CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n17\nwhereas the probability of false alarm can be expressed\
    \ as follows:\nPf(ζm,k)\n∆= Pr\n\x10\nΛ(xk\nm) > ζm,k|Hm,k\n0\n\x11\n= 1 − FΛ|Hm,k\n\
    0\n(ζm,k),\n(2.4)\nwhere FΛ|Hm,k\n1\n(.) and FΛ|Hm,k\n0\n(.) are the cumulative\
    \ distribution functions (CDFs) of\nΛ(xk\nm) under Hm,k\n1\nand Hm,k\n0\n, respectively.\n\
    The two parameters mentioned above introduce two degrees of freedom to spec-\n\
    trum sensing problems. In particular, the higher the Pd value is the more the\
    \ PN is\nprotected from the interference caused by the CRN. This interference\
    \ occurs, when\na PU is incorrectly detected to be absent, hence both PU and SU\
    \ use the channel.\nFurthermore, the lower the Pf values are, the higher the CRN\
    \ throughput can be\nachieved. This can be explained by the fact that when a PU\
    \ is not using the wire-\nless spectrum and a SU incorrectly detects that the\
    \ PU is present, the spectrum is\nnot being utilized. This trade-oﬀ leads to the\
    \ rationale behind the Neyman-Pearson\nframework, where the objective is to maximize\
    \ the value of Pd subject to a predeter-\nmined value of Pf [40]:\nPd = 1 − FΛ|Hm,k\n\
    1\n(F −1\nΛ|Hm,k\n0\n(1 − Pf)),\n(2.5)\nwhere F −1\nΛ|Hm,k\n0\n(.) is the inverse\
    \ function of FΛ|Hm,k\n0\n(.).\nDiﬀerent detector types imply diﬀerent detection\
    \ probabilities for the correspond-\ning probabilities of false alarms. As mentioned\
    \ before, we consider either ED, PD\nor OD-based scenarios for local spectrum\
    \ sensing by each SU. In order to determine\nthe availability of a channel in\
    \ the ED-based case, the received signal power is esti-\nmated, whereas for the\
    \ PD-based scenario, the orthogonality property between the\npilot tone and the\
    \ data-carrying signal is used [6,41]. As for the OD-based case, us-\ning the\
    \ knowledge of cyclic preﬁx and the OFDM symbol length, the inherent signal\n\
    correlation incurred by the cyclic preﬁx repetition is taken into consideration\
    \ [42].\nThis is why diﬀerent PU signal structures in three diﬀerent cases lead\
    \ to diﬀerent PU\nprotection levels of the corresponding probabilities of false\
    \ alarm.\n2.4.1.1\nEnergy Detection\nWhen a SU does not have any prior information\
    \ about the PU signal across the m-th\nchannel, it is usually modeled as a random\
    \ Gaussian signal with zero mean and (σm\ns )2\nvariance, i.e., sm ∼ N(0, i.e.(σm\n\
    s )2I). Mathematically, the probability of detection for\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n\
    18\nthe k-th ED-based SU sensing m-th channel is expressed as follows [6]:\nP\
    \ E\nd,mk = Q\n\a\nQ−1(Pf) −\n\b\nN k\nm × SNRmk\n√SNRmk + 1\n\t\n,\n(2.6)\nwhere\
    \ N k\nm is the corresponding number of samples for the k-th SU to sense the m-th\n\
    channel, SNRmk is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value of the k-th SU for the\
    \ m-th\nchannel, and Q(.) as well as Q−1(.) are the standard Gaussian distribution\
    \ function\nand its inverse, respectively.\nFig. 2.7 illustrates a block diagram\
    \ of the ED-based detection case. Due to the\nfact that ED-based detection is\
    \ done by estimating the received energy level of the\nPU signal, regardless the\
    \ noise level is high or low, together with the PU signal it is\ndetected. In\
    \ case noise level is high and the PU is in the idle mode, a SU may decide\nthat\
    \ the PU is present. This is why the SNR value of the channel plays an important\n\
    role in this type of detection. The test statistics for the ED-based detection\
    \ can be\nexpressed as follows:\nΛE(xk\nm) =\n1\nN k\nm\n× ||xk\nm||2,\n(2.7)\n\
    and the corresponding threshold for the ED-based detection is denoted as [43]:\n\
    ζE\nm,k =\n1\nN k\nm\n× Q−1(Pf) + 1.\n(2.8)\n2.4.1.2\nPilot Tone Detection\nWhen\
    \ a SU has the information about the pilot tone of the PU signal sent across\n\
    the m-th channel, then PD-based detection can be used in order to determine the\n\
    Figure 2.7: Block diagram of the ED-based case.\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n19\noccupancy\
    \ of the m-th channel.\nFig.\n2.8 illustrates a block diagram of the PD-\nbased\
    \ scenario. In this case, the PU data-carrying signal part is still modeled as\
    \ a\nrandom Gaussian signal with zero mean and (σm\nsd)2 variance, i.e., sm,d\
    \ ∼ N(0, (σm\nsd)2I).\nHowever, the pilot tone of this signal, sm,p, is known\
    \ and is believed to be orthogonal\nto the data-carrying part. Mathematically,\
    \ a PU signal can be expressed as:\nsm =\n√\nθ × sm,p +\n√\n1 − θ × sm,d,\n(2.9)\n\
    where sm,d is the data-carrying part, sm,p is the pilot tone part of the m-th\
    \ PU signal,\nand θ is the power allocation fraction to the pilot tone. The probability\
    \ of detection\nfor the k-th PD-based SU sensing m-th channel is expressed as\
    \ follows [41]:\nP P\nd,mk = Q\n\x05\nQ−1(Pf) −\n\b\n2 × θ × N k\nm × SNRmk\n\x06\
    \n.\n(2.10)\nDue to the fact that the data-carrying part of the PU signal is orthogonal\
    \ to the\nknown pilot tone signal, the detection is done by estimating the pilot\
    \ tone signal,\nignoring the presence of the data-carrying part. The test statistics\
    \ for the PD-based\ndetection can be written as follows:\nΛP(xk\nm) =\n1\nN k\n\
    m\n×\nNk\nm\n\nn=1\nxk\nm(n) × sm,p(n).\n(2.11)\nThe corresponding threshold for\
    \ the PD-based detection is expressed as:\nFigure 2.8: Block diagram of the PD-based\
    \ case.\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n20\nζP\nm,k =\n\v\nP × (σk\nm)2\nN k\nm\n× Q−1(1\
    \ − Q(\n\b\n2 × N k\nm × θ × SNRmk − Q−1(Pf)))\n+ P ×\n√\nθ,\n(2.12)\nwhere P\
    \ is the total power allocated for the PU signal consisting of the data-carrying\n\
    part and the pilot tone and (σk\nm)2 is the corresponding noise power.\n2.4.1.3\n\
    OFDM-based Detection\nWhen the PU signal is known to be OFDM, the OD-based scenario\
    \ can be used.\nFig. 2.9 illustrates a block diagram of the OD-based case. Using\
    \ the knowledge of\ncyclic preﬁx and the OFDM symbol length, the inherent signal\
    \ correlation incurred\nby cyclic preﬁx repetition is utilized to detect the PU\
    \ signal. Mathematically, the\nprobability of detection for the k-th OD-based\
    \ SU sensing m-th channel is expressed\nas follows [42]:\nP O\nd,mk ≈ Q\n\a\n\
    Q−1(Pf) −\n\b\n2 × N k\nm × SNRmk\n√4 × SNRmk + 1\n\t\n.\n(2.13)\nGenerally, an\
    \ OFDM signal is assumed to be the summation of narrow-band\nphase shift keying\
    \ (PSK) or quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) sub-carriers.\nAn OFDM signal\
    \ may consist of several blocks, each one having a cyclic preﬁx added\nFigure\
    \ 2.9: Block diagram of the OD-based case.\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n21\nto the\
    \ front. Mathematically, the test statistics for the OD-based scenario can be\n\
    speciﬁed as [44]:\nΛO(zmk\n1 , zmk\n2 ) = 2 ×\nP2×Nk\nn=1 m\nzmk\n1 (n) × zmk\n\
    2 (n)\n||zmk\n1 ||2 + ||zmk\n2 ||2\n.\n(2.14)\nwhere zmk\n1\nand zmk\n2\nare expressed\
    \ as follows:\nzmk\n1\n= [xk\nm,r(1) xk\nm,i(1) xk\nm,r(2) xk\nm,i(2) ... xk\n\
    m,r(N k\nm) xk\nm,i(N k\nm)],\nzmk\n2\n= [xk\nm,r(Td + 1) xk\nm,i(Td + 1) xk\n\
    m,r(Td + 2) xk\nm,i(Td + 2) ...\nxk\nm,r(Td + N k\nm) xk\nm,i(Td + N k\nm)],\n\
    (2.15)\nwith Td being the number of symbols in one OFDM block and xk\nm,r as well\
    \ as xk\nm,i de-\nnoting the real and imaginary vectors of xk\nm, respectively.\
    \ The corresponding thresh-\nold for the OD-based case can be expressed as follows:\n\
    ζO\nm,k =\n1\nN k\nm\n× Q−1(2 × Pf).\n(2.16)\nFig. 2.10 illustrates an analytical\
    \ overview of the detection performance for the\nthree diﬀerent methods discussed\
    \ above in a single SU single-band scenario under the\nadditive white Gaussian\
    \ noise (AWGN) channel conditions. The number of samples\nsensed and the probability\
    \ of false alarm for the ED, PD, and OD-based scenarios are\nset to be N = 2000\
    \ and Pf = 10%, respectively. It is clear that the more information\na SU owns\

    \ Radio Network Throughput\nThe eﬀectiveness of CSS is mainly measured by the\
    \ achievable CRN throughput. Tra-\nditionally, in CRNs a SU can access a channel\
    \ whether the PU is in the idle or active\nmode by means of opportunistic or underlay\
    \ / overlay CR paradigms, respectively [5].\nIn case of underlay / overlay, it\
    \ is important to analyze the aggregate throughput of\nboth PN and CRN. However,\
    \ in our analysis the opportunistic paradigm is used,\nwhere spectrum is being\
    \ accessed by a SU only when the PU is in the idle mode.\nThis is why the PN throughput\
    \ analysis can be omitted as the CRN does not provide\ninterference to the PN.\
    \ Yet, the CRN throughput analysis stays of great importance.\nCHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND\n\

    \ the multi-band CSS problem was discussed as a\npart of supporting billions of\
    \ IoT devices’ pervasive connectivity. In addition to this,\na summary on the\
    \ existing IoT-based CSS schemes was given. Finally, performance\nmeasures to\
    \ be used in the thesis in order to evaluate the proposed HM2CSS scheme\nwere\
    \ presented, including the detection performance, CRN throughput, and energy\n\
    consumption on the sensing process.\nChapter 3\nMulti-band Cooperative Spectrum\n\
    Sensing in Cognitive IoT Systems:\nArchitectures and Challenges\n3.1\nIntroduction\n\
    Providing spectrum access to billions of IoT devices is one of the paramount issues\n\
    for IoT systems. CR is believed to be a prominent solution to spectrum scarcity\n\
    caused by IoT applications, where multi-band CSS is a key component. Nevertheless,\n\
    cognitive IoT systems expose a number of challenges yet to overcome in the design\
    \ of\nmulti-band CSS. Conventional multi-band CSS techniques can be improved in\
    \ order\nto meet the challenges of IoT systems.\nThe outline of this chapter is\
    \ as follows.\nSection 3.2 introduces the potential\ncognitive IoT system architecture\
    \ types. Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 discuss centralized\nand distributed cognitive\
    \ IoT system architectures, respectively, whereas the potential\nstrength of the\
    \ hybrid topology combination is revealed in Section 3.2.3. In addition\nto this,\
    \ we provide a pervasive list of challenges associated with the design of multi-\n\
    band CSS schemes for cognitive IoT systems in Section 3.3.\nFinally, Section 3.4\n\
    concludes the chapter with a brief summary.\n3.2\nIoT-based System Architecture\n\
    Traditionally, CSS for cognitive IoT systems can be done in either centralized\
    \ or\ndistributed ways. This leads to the existence of three main architecture\
    \ structures:\n25\nCHAPTER 3. COGNITIVE INTERNET OF THINGS SYSTEMS\n26\ncentralized,\
    \ distributed, and the hybrid combination of centralized and distributed\napproaches.\
    \ Cognitive IoT systems place a great challenge in terms of network ar-\nchitecture\
    \ due to the variety of applications supported and their needs. All these\nnetwork\
    \ architectures oﬀer their own advantages and disadvantages. For instance,\ncentralization\
    \ shows better performance and security, whereas distributed systems\nallow system\
    \ adaptation and no single point failure. However, it is up to the IoT\napplication\
    \ to determine which topology works best in speciﬁc scenarios.\n3.2.1\nCentralized\
    \ Cognitive IoT Network Architecture\nIn centralized networks, a central entity,\
    \ also called FC, collects the sensing data\nfrom secondary IoT-nodes and based\
    \ on it, makes decisions on the availability of\nspectrum channels using OR /\
    \ k-out-of-K / majority / AND rules [8]. An example\nof such system can be seen\
    \ in Fig. 3.1(a). Here, a heterogeneous secondary IoT\nnetwork is presented. This\
    \ type of networks provides great system performance due\nto high system control\
    \ level. However, because of the fact that information exchange\nis performed\
    \ only with an FC only, in case a link is in deep fade the performance may\ndegrade\
    \ drastically [6]. Moreover, problems occur when a FC fails as the network\nstops\
    \ working. Finally, one of the main issues with centralized CRNs is latency. In\n\
    addition to sensor processing and network transmission, FC processing is another\n\
    source of latency for centralized CRNs. For instance, when a typical white space\n\
    lasts for dozens of milliseconds, yet due to the FC processing its detection takes\n\
    hundreds of milliseconds. This means that the exploitation of these white spaces\
    \ is\nunjustiﬁed [45].\n3.2.2\nDistributed Cognitive IoT Network Architecture\n\
    In distributed networks, secondary IoT-nodes cooperate by exchanging locally sensed\n\
    information between each other and using learning algorithms come up with the\
    \ com-\nmon decisions on the availability of channels. The system is completely\
    \ decentralized,\nwhich means it lacks the overall control. An example of such\
    \ a system is illustrated\nin Fig. 3.1(b). Despite lower performance than the\
    \ centralized one, distributed net-\nworks are easily adapted in real time and\
    \ are robust against topology changes. This\npresents a huge advantage to mobile\
    \ and scalable IoT systems. In addition to this,\nlocality represents great importance\
    \ in IoT systems [46]. In contrast to the centralized\nCHAPTER 3. COGNITIVE INTERNET\
    \ OF THINGS SYSTEMS\n27\nFigure 3.1: Heterogeneous secondary IoT-based networks:\
    \ (a) centralized, (b) dis-\ntributed, and (c) hybrid.\ncase, distributed network\
    \ architecture allows network analysis not only on the global\n/ wide level but\
    \ local as well. It is proved that user experience improvement can be\nachieved\
    \ while integrating local and wide area as a new form of cooperation in IoT\n\
    systems [12,21]. This is why cognitive IoT systems are mainly focused on distributed\n\
    network architectures.\nCHAPTER 3. COGNITIVE INTERNET OF THINGS SYSTEMS\n28\n\
    3.2.3\nHybrid Cognitive IoT Network Architecture\nIoT systems represent a summation\
    \ of networks, which can be centralized and dis-\ntributed.\nHence, this leads\
    \ to the existence of hybrid system topology.\nIn fact,\nhybrid systems may be\
    \ suﬃciently used in analyzing the borders of centralized and\ndistributed networks.\
    \ To begin with, self organizing networks is one of the forms of\nhybrid topologies\
    \ [10]. Hybrid systems support spectrum management coordination\nbased on adjustment\
    \ of both centralized and distributed cases and can utilize a dy-\nnamic architecture\
    \ choice depending on the application. Another approach of the\nhybrid topology\
    \ is the umbrella one [47]. Depending on the application, centralized\nor distributed\
    \ femto / pico-cell IoT-based CRNs can coexist under a PU macro-cell.\nA femto\
    \ / pico-cell clustering scheme is believed to manage wireless resources of the\n\
    heterogeneous IoT systems.\nFig.\n3.1(c) illustrates an example of the hybrid\
    \ IoT\nnetwork. Due to high mobility and transmit power limitations, not all secondary\n\
    IoT-nodes are able to communicate with the FC. In this case, they can communi-\n\
    cate with the neighboring secondary IoT-nodes in order to send / receive information\n\
    about channels’ availability. Moreover, in case the FC fails the system does not\
    \ stop\nworking, but transforms into a distributed case.\n3.3\nCooperative Spectrum\
    \ Sensing Challenges in\nCognitive IoT Systems\nThe complexity of cognitive IoT\
    \ systems place numerous challenges for CSS. As dis-\ncussed before, CR modules\
    \ for IoT systems are diﬀerent than those of the conven-\ntional ones. While the\
    \ conventional CR module structure consists of spectrum sens-\ning, spectrum decision,\
    \ spectrum sharing, and mobility, in the IoT case they include\nadditional entries\
    \ and, in total, are presented as [3]: spectrum sensing, spectrum anal-\nysis,\
    \ history and prediction, spectrum decision, spectrum-aware routing, security\
    \ and\nprivacy, spectrum-mobility, and reconﬁguration. The addition of novel entries\
    \ lead\nto new challenges, which include application-centric processing, mobility,\
    \ scalability,\nhigh integrity, heterogeneity, cooperation and learning, EE, fairness\
    \ and secondary\nIoT-node selection, computational complexity, sensing duration\
    \ and synchronization,\ninterference and user experience. All those challenges\
    \ are discussed in details in the\nfollowing sub-sections.\nCHAPTER 3. COGNITIVE\
    \ INTERNET OF THINGS SYSTEMS\n29\n3.3.1\nApplication-Centric Approach / Treatment\n\
    Traditionally, while designing CSS schemes applications are not taken into considera-\n\
    tion. However, the context of application support is of great importance to cognitive\n\
    IoT systems [48], such as smart cities, smart homes, smart grids, wearables, health-\n\
    care, connected cars, etc. All those applications of IoT systems are in need of\
    \ diﬀerent\napproaches of bandwidth access, network topologies, mobility, interference\
    \ tolerance,\netc. This means that CSS schemes for cognitive IoT systems should\
    \ be designed to\ngive a degree of ﬂexibility to be tailored to learn, adapt,\
    \ and make decisions.\n3.3.2\nMobility of Users\nDepending on the application,\
    \ the state of users’ mobility is diﬀerent. Some users\nmay have high mobility\
    \ at all times, others in certain time slots, while several maybe\nconstantly\
    \ ﬁxed at the same place. In order to achieve successful seamless connectivity\n\
    in all cases, CSS schemes have to overcome the challenges of adaptive in time\
    \ and\nspace mobility, spectrum assignment, and sensing and bandwidth allocation\
    \ in order\nto be applied to cognitive IoT systems [6,47]. Leading by the hardness\
    \ of satisfying the\nquality of service (QoS) of application-centric IoT, exploring\
    \ the nature of mobility\ndirections is a stream that may help in design and decisions\
    \ of CSS schemes.\n3.3.3\nScalability, High Integrity, and Heterogeneity\nScalability\
    \ is the key requirement of any IoT system, which implies network growth\nwith\
    \ time [7].\nHowever, by adding users, system performance as well as network\n\
    eﬃciency and throughput may degrade. Moreover, node types in any IoT system\n\
    are heterogeneous [49, 50]. This means that each secondary IoT-node may own a\n\
    diﬀerent type of detector, built into it as well as diﬀerent transmission requirements.\n\
    The challenge of scalability arises in designing CSS schemes for cognitive IoT\
    \ systems,\nsuch that it is possible to expand the system without the overhead\
    \ of additional human\nintervention and overall network performance degradation\
    \ issues.\n3.3.4\nCooperation and Learning\nNGNs place a focus on learning and\
    \ feedback information about the environment\nin cognitive IoT systems by bringing\
    \ up cooperation of secondary IoT-nodes as an\nCHAPTER 3. COGNITIVE INTERNET OF\
    \ THINGS SYSTEMS\n30\nessential part of the distributed learning process [4].\
    \ Various learning schemes can be\nused in the distributed CSS process like incremental\
    \ [51], consensus [52], diﬀusion-\nbased [53], etc. One of the main tasks is to\
    \ choose the most appropriate learning\nscheme, depending on the information available\
    \ about the network and the char-\nacteristics of secondary IoT-nodes. Another\
    \ main challenges here are the optimal\namount of beneﬁt that can be gotten, the\
    \ amount of iterations needed for the learn-\ning process to be completed, and\
    \ requirements such that the learning process and\ncooperation can be accomplished\
    \ .\n3.3.5\nMaintaining Energy Eﬃciency\nLow-power IoT-nodes are not capable of\
    \ performing spectrum sensing over all chan-\nnels in cognitive IoT systems due\
    \ to energy consumption limitations. This is why the\namount of channels selected\
    \ to sense by each user should be limited. After the spec-\ntrum sensing process,\
    \ secondary IoT-nodes can learn from each other by exchanging\nthe information\
    \ they have. In this way the EE of CSS schemes can be enhanced by\nreducing the\
    \ amount of power spent on the sensing process. Furthermore, energy har-\nvesting\
    \ (EH) can be used as a potential solution for EE improvement in cognitive IoT\n\
    systems, where each node can have the characteristics of ﬂexible switching between\n\
    the operation modes of sensing, harvesting and transmission depending on the time\n\
    slot and certain network conditions [54].\n3.3.6\nFairness and Cooperative Secondary\
    \ IoT-nodes Selec-\ntion\nCooperation has been validated to be an eﬃcient way\
    \ of sensing wireless spectrum [12].\nHowever, it creates serious challenges for\
    \ cognitive IoT systems in terms of fairness\nin the multi-band channel sensing\
    \ process [55]. Assuming all channels are equally\nlikely unoccupied by PUs, it\
    \ is unfair to put more eﬀorts on sensing one channel\nthan others. For example,\
    \ consuming more power on sensing a certain channel may\nresult in more accurate\
    \ decisions about the availability of that channel. Nevertheless,\npower consumption\
    \ is limited per system, resulting in less power to be consumed on\nsensing other\
    \ channels. This leads to performance degradation across other channels\nas PUs\
    \ may be mis-detected. In unfair CSS, detection performance may be the same\n\
    as for the fair case in average.\nHowever, detection performance per channel may\n\
    CHAPTER 3. COGNITIVE INTERNET OF THINGS SYSTEMS\n31\nbe unacceptable for some\
    \ of them and very high for others. In contrast, fair CSS\nprovides acceptable\
    \ detection performance across all channels separately. Hence, it is\nessential\
    \ to develop eﬃcient and fair channel sensing and access mechanism in order\n\
    to have stable system performance across all channels. Moreover, it is required\
    \ that\ncooperative secondary IoT-nodes own diﬀerent information for the learning\
    \ process to\nbe accomplished. Choosing secondary IoT-nodes with similar outcomes\
    \ may result in\nenergy loss as no new information can be learned by each one\
    \ of them. Correct choice\nof cooperative secondary IoT-nodes may signiﬁcantly\
    \ increase system performance,\nreduce latency as well as the energy consumption\
    \ of the system.\n3.3.7\nComputational Complexity\nIn many applications, IoT-nodes\
    \ are not as computational eﬃcient as central-entities\n/ gateways. Most of the\
    \ them are low-power and / or low-cost ones with hardware\nlimitations, which\
    \ leads to limited data storage and processing issues. This brings\nup the computational\
    \ simplicity and network eﬃciency trade-oﬀ [3,12]. CSS schemes\nfor cognitive\
    \ IoT systems have to be carefully optimized to address this challenge,\nwhile\
    \ dealing with the cooperative secondary IoT-node selection as well as the sensing\n\
    process.\n3.3.8\nSensing Duration and Synchronization\nSensing duration period\
    \ has always been leading to a trade-oﬀ between system re-\nliability and delay,\
    \ which is critical in delay-sensitive applications [56].\nChoosing\nappropriate\
    \ sensing time for each application brings reliability and does not delay the\n\
    process. However, IoT-based systems should be highly integrated, interconnecting\n\
    various applications altogether, which awakens the challenge of time synchronization.\n\
    Cooperation in distributed networks requires high synchronization within a channel.\n\
    How to provide high synchronization and not degrade the performance of the system\n\
    at the same time is one of the greatest challenges of CSS for distributed cognitive\
    \ IoT\nsystems.\n3.3.9\nInterference Management\nThe plethora of IoT devices forms\
    \ an increasing demand in shared wireless spec-\ntrum management in order to avoid\
    \ interference between PN and CRN. Interference\nCHAPTER 3. COGNITIVE INTERNET\
    \ OF THINGS SYSTEMS\n32\nsensitive applications are in need of opportunistic spectrum\
    \ access approach in or-\nder to completely avoid interference from the CRN side.\
    \ However, others may use\nthe underlay or overlay technique, when secondary IoT-nodes\
    \ are allowed to use the\nspectrum concurrently with PUs providing certain interference\
    \ constraints. Further-\nmore, advances in antenna techniques like adaptive 3D\
    \ tractable beamforming can\nbe a solution integrated with CSS together to decrease\
    \ the interference and required\ntransmit power by means of antenna nulling in\
    \ selected network topologies [3].\n3.4\nSummary\nThis chapter discussed the three\
    \ diﬀerent types of cognitive IoT network architec-\ntures: centralized, distributed,\
    \ and hybrid. Furthermore, it addressed challenges and\nhighlighted important\
    \ parameters to be considered during the design process of CSS\nschemes for cognitive\
    \ IoT systems. From the challenges discussed above it can be\nconcluded that CSS\
    \ schemes for IoT systems can be carefully improved to further\nmeet heterogeneous,\
    \ mobile, highly scalable, adaptive, and application-centric IoT\nsystems. Finally,\
    \ due to the distributed nature of IoT systems, in this thesis, we will\nfocus\
    \ on distributed multi-band CSS. This is why it is important to study distributed\n\
    learning approaches to reveal, which one of them can be used in the cognitive\
    \ IoT\nscenario.\nChapter 4\nDistributed Learning Approaches\n4.1\nIntroduction\n\
    The role of learning and adaptation is becoming increasingly essential with IoT.\
    \ Con-\nventionally, learning implies changes within a system that, over time,\
    \ enables it to\nperform more eﬀectively within its environment by reusing past\
    \ experiences [51].\nHowever, we consider learning as an adaptation process. In\
    \ this thesis, distributed\nlearning implies adaptation in learning through making\
    \ adjustments in the locally\nsensed results within each cooperative SU-cluster.\
    \ Each SU is not only capable of\nsensing data and experiencing the environment\
    \ directly, but it also receives infor-\nmation through interactions with its\
    \ neighboring SUs, processes, and analyzes this\ninformation to achieve a common\
    \ decision about channels’ availability [51]. There-\nfore, from now on, we will\
    \ be using the term learning to refer to distributed learning\nadaptation discussed\
    \ above.\nPerformance, computational cost, number of iterations needed to reach\
    \ the con-\nsensus point, reliability, immunity to link failures, etc. are diﬀerent\
    \ characteristics\nof learning algorithms, which may vary. Incremental, consensus,\
    \ and diﬀusion-based\nare most commonly used learning schemes in distributed multi-band\
    \ CRNs [51–53].\nIt is essential to understand the diﬀerence between them, their\
    \ pros and cons in order\nto be able to apply them to CSS schemes for cognitive\
    \ IoT systems. This is why, in\nthis chapter, focus is given to distributed learning\
    \ approaches named as incremental,\nconsensus, and diﬀusion.\nThe rest of the\
    \ chapter is organized as follows. In Section 4.2, we provide a brief\noverview\
    \ of centralized systems’ rules in order to point out the diﬀerence in detection\n\
    33\nCHAPTER 4. DISTRIBUTED LEARNING APPROACHES\n34\nperformance measurements between\
    \ centralized and distributed ways. Further, dis-\ntributed learning approaches\
    \ are discussed in Section 4.3, providing the comparison\nbetween incremental,\
    \ consensus, and diﬀusion-based learning techniques. Section 4.4\nillustrates\
    \ simulation results for distributed learning approaches mentioned above.\nFinally,\
    \ a brief summary is given in Section 4.5.\n4.2\nCentralized Rules / Algorithms\n\
    Centralized cognitive IoT systems use speciﬁc rules to decide on the availability\
    \ of\nchannels. Traditionally, there are four diﬀerent centralized rules, which\
    \ include OR,\nk-out-of-K, majority, and AND rules [6,37]. In case of the OR rule,\
    \ the results from\nall cooperative SUs are obtained according to the OR logic,\
    \ which implies by itself\nat least one SU to detect the PU signal to be present.\
    \ The k-out-of K and majority\nrules decide that the PU is in the active mode\
    \ when in total k out of K cooperative\nSUs and the majority of all cooperative\
    \ SUs detect the PU signal, respectively. As\nfor the AND rule case, all cooperative\
    \ SUs have to detect the PU signal in order to\nmake a decision that the PU is\
    \ in the active mode. Otherwise, it is assumed that the\nchannel is not used by\
    \ the PU.\nIn case of centralized cooperative multi-band detection, the probability\
    \ of detec-\ntion and false alarm for the m-th channel become [8]:\nQd,m =\nK\n\
    X\nq=k\n\x12K\nq\n\x13\n×\n( qY\ni=1\nPd,mi ×\nK−q\nY\nj=1\n(1 − Pd,mj)\n)\n,\n\
    Qf,m =\nK\nX\nq=k\n\x12K\nq\n\x13\n×\n( qY\ni=1\nPf,mi ×\nK−q\nY\nj=1\n(1 − Pf,mj)\n\
    )\n.\n(4.1)\nIn case the OR, majority, and AND rules are used, the corresponding\
    \ k value becomes\n1, K\n2 and 0, respectively. As for the k-out-of-K rule, the\
    \ value of k will depend on the\npercentage of SUs needed to detect PU signals,\
    \ such that channels are believed to be\noccupied. The corresponding aggregate\
    \ probability of detection for the CRN can be\ncalculated as:\nQd = 1\nM ×\nM\n\
    X\nm=1\nQd,m.\n(4.2)\nCHAPTER 4. DISTRIBUTED LEARNING APPROACHES\n35\n4.3\nDistributed\
    \ Learning Algorithms\nIn contrast to centralized cognitive IoT systems, distributed\
    \ networks use learning al-\ngorithms to decide on the availability of the channel.\
    \ Cooperative SUs exchange the\ninformation sensed and learn from each other in\
    \ order to reach the consensus value,\nwhich corresponds to similar information\
    \ owning by each cooperative SU. Later, in\norder to calculate the corresponding\
    \ aggregate probability of detection, the results of\ndetection probabilities\
    \ of all channels are averaged in a similar manner to the central-\nized case,\
    \ as speciﬁed in (4.2). In this section, we are focusing on the learning process.\n\
    The comparison between three diﬀerent learning approaches, named as incremental,\n\
    consensus, and diﬀusion-based learning, is provided to discover which one of them\n\
    best suits the IoT demands.\n4.3.1\nIncremental-based Approach\nThe incremental\
    \ approach can be implemented in a connected network, where using\na certain trajectory,\
    \ sensing nodes are being visited one by one [51]. Learning can\nbe performed\
    \ only by one user at a time. In particular, k-th secondary IoT-node\ncombines\
    \ a small portion of a previously visited cooperative secondary IoT-node’s\ntest\
    \ statistics information, Sm\nj , with its own, Sm\nk , at each iteration i with\
    \ µm\nk as a\nlearning step size for the m-th channel as follows:\nSm\nk (i +\
    \ 1) = Sm\nk (i) + µm\nk ×\n\0Sm\nj (i) − Sm\nk (i)\n\x01\n.\n(4.3)\nCompleting\
    \ one cycle means going one by one through all secondary IoT-nodes in a\nnetwork\
    \ trajectory and complies completing one iteration. By visiting each sensing\n\
    node, a portion from the previously visited node’s information is being interchanged.\n\
    One of disadvantages of this learning mechanism is the mandatory trajectory\n\
    creation.\nCooperative secondary IoT-nodes have to form kind of a ring topology\n\
    within themselves in order to be able to exchange the information and learn. In\
    \ case\nof one of the users fails, the whole learning process is left unaccomplished\
    \ due to\ndisruption of this virtual ring topology. Thus, the mechanism has to\
    \ be repeated over\nagain. Moreover, learning only from one user at a time instance\
    \ is ineﬃcient and leads\nto high system delays, which is critical in delay sensitive\
    \ applications, especially when\nthe system is growing in size. This brings diﬃculties\

    Consensus-based mechanism appears to be more appealing for cognitive IoT systems\n\
    than the incremental one. This comes from the way the algorithm is accomplished.\n\
    Here, neighboring cooperative secondary IoT-nodes exchange sensed information\
    \ with\neach other at once. In particular, k-th secondary IoT-node combines a\
    \ small portion\nof all other cooperative secondary IoT-nodes’ test statistics\
    \ information with its own\nat each iteration i in the case of Qm cooperative\
    \ secondary IoT nodes with µm\nk as a\nlearning step size for the m-th channel\
    \ as follows [52]:\nSm\nk (i + 1) = Sm\nk (i) + µm\nk ×\nQm\nX\nj = 1,\nj ̸= k\n\
    \0Sm\nj (i) − Sm\nk (i)\n\x01\n.\n(4.4)\nThis means that the process represents\
    \ a certain virtual mesh topology, which leads\nto the fact that the system is\
    \ more stable in case of link failures. Finally, due to the\nfact that all secondary\
    \ IoT-nodes are updated simultaneously, the consensus process\nitself is faster\
    \ by a factor of the total cooperative secondary IoT-nodes number for\na selected\
    \ channel in the system than the incremental one.\nThis means that the\nalgorithm\
    \ can be implemented for scalable IoT systems.\n4.3.3\nDiﬀusion-based Approach\n\
    Another learning algorithm for distributed networks is based on diﬀusion adapta-\n\
    tion [53]. As discussed previously, in consensus, each secondary IoT-node uses\
    \ its\nown information as the base point.\nThis leads to the asymmetry in the\
    \ learning\nprocess among all users. However, the diﬀusion-based algorithm addresses\
    \ the issue\nof asymmetry in learning processes of the incremental and consensus\
    \ cases. This is\nrevealed as the only diﬀerence in implementation of consensus\
    \ and diﬀusion-based\nalgorithms. In the diﬀusion case, secondary IoT-node’s test\
    \ statistics information is\nbeing replaced by the weighted average test statistics\
    \ information of all cooperative\nsecondary IoT-nodes, which is deﬁned as follows:\n\
    Sm\navg(i + 1) =\nQm\nX\nj=1\nαm\nj × Sm\nj (i),\n(4.5)\nwhere Sm\nj is the test\
    \ statistics of each j-th cooperative SU for the m-th channel and\nCHAPTER 4.\
    \ DISTRIBUTED LEARNING APPROACHES\n37\nPQm\nj=1 αm\nj = 1. In particular, k-th\
    \ secondary IoT-node combines a small portion of all\nother cooperative secondary\
    \ IoT-nodes’ test statistics information with the weighted\naverage of all test\
    \ statistics at each iteration i in the case of Qm cooperative secondary\nIoT\
    \ nodes with µm\nk as a learning step size for the m-th channel as follows:\n\
    Sm\nk (i + 1) = Sm\navg(i) + µm\nk ×\nQm\nX\nj = 1,\nj ̸= k\n\0Sm\nj (i) − Sm\n\
    avg(i)\n\x01\n.\n(4.6)\nThe use of the weighted average of cooperative users’\
    \ test statistics brings symmetry\nin learning in addition to making the learning\
    \ process much faster, as will be seen in\nthe next sections.\nTable 4.1: Comparison\

    The summarized characteristics’ comparison of three diﬀerent algorithms in terms\
    \ of\nlink failure immunity, single iteration node execution, scalability, speed,\
    \ complexity\nper single iteration, total complexity, energy consumption, diﬀerence\
    \ in the ﬁnal\nconsensus point result, and symmetry in learning are exposed in\
    \ Table 4.1.\nFor the diﬀusion-based approach, in case of a link failure, the\
    \ process is never\ninterrupted and always converges, which cannot be oﬀered by\
    \ either incremental or\nconsensus approaches. This can be justiﬁed as follows.\
    \ In case of link failures, the\nincremental algorithm will not converge because\
    \ the virtual link topology is broken.\nAs for the consensus algorithm, the algorithm\
    \ does not converge, when the noise level\nover a certain number of sensed samples\
    \ is very high. However, the appeared high\nnoise level fades due to the averaging\
    \ for the diﬀusion-based case, leading to persistent\nconvergence. This impacts\
    \ the stability of the system and reveals diﬀusion-based\nalgorithm as the most\
    \ stable of all discussed above.\nIn addition to this, as the number of cooperative\
    \ secondary IoT-nodes increases,\nthe time needed to perform one iteration rises\
    \ up for the incremental approach. This\nis why it is believed to be non-scalable,\
    \ which is critical for IoT systems. On contrast,\nconsensus and diﬀusion-based\
    \ algorithms need much less time to perform the learning\nprocess. For instance,\
    \ if the time needed for the consensus algorithm per iteration\nis Tlearning,cons,\
    \ the corresponding incremental learning process will take the following\namount\
    \ of time:\nTlearning,inc = Tlearning,cons × Qm.\n(4.7)\nTable 4.2: Comparison\

    39\nThis can be explained by the fact that the consensus algorithm performs learning\n\
    in parallel for all nodes, while the incremental algorithm does it node by node.\
    \ In\naddition to this, although due to the averaging in the diﬀusion-based learning\
    \ the\ntime taken by one iteration is slightly higher than for the consensus algorithm,\
    \ the\ndiﬀusion learning is much faster in total.\nMoreover, computational complexity\
    \ is another factor of interest. Computational\ncomplexity is illustrated in the\
    \ number of additions and multiplications in Table 4.2.\nAlthough, the diﬀusion\
    \ algorithm brings higher computational complexity per itera-\ntion than incremental\
    \ and consensus-based algorithms, in total, it requires the lowest\nnumber of\
    \ iterations needed to reach the consensus point. This is why the diﬀusion-\n\
    based distributed cognitive IoT system requires less cost and energy to be consumed\n\
    during the learning process than the incremental or consensus-based systems. It\
    \ rep-\nresents an advantage for IoT devices with certain hardware limitations\
    \ and low power\nconsumption.\nFinally, as it will be seen from simulation results\
    \ provided in Section 4.4, all three\nlearning schemes eventually lead to the\
    \ same ﬁnal convergence point in case similar\nlearning step sizes used.\nFigure\

    \ diﬀusion algorithm needs less\nnumber of iterations to reach consensus and proves\
    \ the diﬀusion-based algorithm to\nbe the quickest in terms of speed.\nIn addition\
    \ to this, simulation results illustrating the average amount of iterations\n\
    needed to reach the consensus as the number of cooperative secondary IoT nodes\
    \ grow\nare conveyed in Fig. 4.5. For this purpose, we add new SUs to the system.\
    \ We also\nassume that the new nodes join the cooperative SU-cluster of channel\
    \ 2. It is clear\nthat for the incremental approach as the number of cooperative\
    \ secondary IoT-nodes\nincrease, the number of iterations needed to terminate\
    \ the learning process, in other\nwords reach the consensus point, grows. This\
    \ means that scaling up the system based\non the the incremental learning approach\
    \ is not a good idea as the amount of energy\nand time needed on the learning\
    \ process increases together with the network size.\nThis explains why the algorithm\
    \ is not the best choice for growing IoT systems. To\naddress the scalability\
    \ issue of cognitive IoT systems, both consensus and diﬀusion-\nbased approaches\
    \ appear to be eﬃcient solutions.\nFigs.\n4.5(b) and (c) illustrate\nthat increasing\
    \ the number of cooperative secondary IoT-nodes does not aﬀect the\namount of\
    \ iterations needed for the process to be accomplished for both algorithms,\n\
    which means no systematic delay or extra energy consumption per user. Moreover,\n\
    it is clear from Fig. 4.5 that compared with the incremental approach, even at\
    \ very\nlow values of cooperative secondary IoT-nodes, the amount of iterations\
    \ needed to\nreach the consensus is much less for both consensus and diﬀusion-based\
    \ approaches.\nIt can be concluded that consensus and diﬀusion algorithms can\
    \ be successfully used\nin cognitive IoT systems. However, the diﬀusion-based\
    \ algorithm has proved to be\nmore eﬃcient than the consensus one in terms of\
    \ link failure stability and number\nof iterations needed to reach the consensus\
    \ point. This is why from now on, the\ndiﬀusion-based algorithm will be used in\
    \ this thesis.\n4.5\nSummary\nWe provided the analysis of diﬀerent learning schemes\
    \ as incremental, consensus, and\ndiﬀusion-based for distributed CRNs. After analyzing\
    \ the aforementioned algorithms\nfrom diﬀerent prospectives, the diﬀusion-based\
    \ algorithm can be concluded to be most\npromising one concerning the IoT system\
    \ demands.\nCHAPTER 4. DISTRIBUTED LEARNING APPROACHES\n45\nFinally, enabling\
    \ breadth into IoT spectrum usage can be a hard task to achieve,\nhowever, multi-band\
    \ CSS is believed to be an eﬃcient way of doing that. By carefully\ndesigning\
    \ and developing CSS schemes, billions of devices can communicate in future\n\
    cognitive IoT systems. Eﬃcient and reliable CSS schemes are required for accessing\n\
    spectrum opportunistically. In the next chapter, we propose a novel CSS scheme,\n\
    named as HM2CSS.\nChapter 5\nHeterogeneous Multi-band Multi-user\nCooperative\
    \ Spectrum Sensing\n5.1\nIntroduction\nIn this chapter, we propose a novel CSS\
    \ scheme, called HM2CSS. As it was stated\nbefore, HM2CSS stands for heterogeneous\
    \ multi-band multi-user CSS. We select co-\noperative SUs for distributed multi-band\
    \ CSS in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, we\nformulate an optimization problem\
    \ to select an SU-leader for each channel. We then\nformulate another optimization\
    \ problem to select corresponding cooperative SUs to\nperform local spectrum sensing\
    \ for each channel in the second stage. After coopera-\ntive SU-selection is made,\
    \ the sensing process takes place and using diﬀusion-based\nlearning algorithm,\
    \ cooperative SUs exchange sensed information in order to deter-\nmine the availability\
    \ of channels. The proposed scheme is designed in a way to enable\nscalability\
    \ and improve detection performance, enhance CRN throughput, and pro-\nvide fair\
    \ energy consumption for spectrum sensing on all channels.\nThe rest of the chapter\
    \ is organized as follows. In Section 5.2, system model is\ndiscussed. We investigate\
    \ the proposed HM2CSS scheme thoroughly in Section 5.3.\nIn Section 5.4, extensive\
    \ simulation results are presented. The proposed distributed\nHM2CSS scheme is\
    \ compared to existing distributed and centralized schemes. Finally,\nconclusions\
    \ are made in Section 5.5.\n46\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER\
    \ CSS\n47\n5.2\nSystem Model\nWe investigate a distributed heterogeneous CRN,\
    \ which consists of M channels, i.e.,\nM = {m1, m2, ..., mM}, owned by PUs and\
    \ K SUs, i.e., K = {SU1, SU2, ..., SUK},\nwith M < K. Each PU is assumed to be\
    \ either in an active or idle mode. SUs\nsense channels cooperatively and decide\
    \ whether they are occupied by PUs or not.\nFor this purpose, each SU is assumed\
    \ to be equipped with one detector, such that in\ntotal there are KE ED, KP PD,\
    \ and KO OD-based SUs as illustrated in Fig. 5.1, i.e.,\nK = KE +KP +KO. The SNR\
    \ value for each SU sensing the m-th channel is random\nwith the ﬁxed average\
    \ SNR value for all channels. Communication is assumed to be\nperformed over the\
    \ Rayleigh fading channel.\nAs shown in Fig. 5.1, only certain SUs in the CRN\
    \ can communicate with each\nFigure 5.1: Heterogeneous distributed multi-user\
    \ CRN topology.\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER CSS\n48\nother.\
    \ This is because of the geographic location and fading environment. However,\n\
    all SUs participate in the CSS process. Each k-th SU performs local spectrum sensing\n\
    using N k\nm samples for each channel m ∈ M assigned to it. Then, cooperative\
    \ SUs\ncan exchange their sensing information to determine the occupancy of channels.\
    \ It\nis assumed that each SU can sense minimum one and maximum I channels, where\n\
    I < M.\nIn addition, some of SUs are chosen to fulﬁll the role of SU-leaders for\n\
    channels, which involves assisting in cooperative SU-selection for each channel.\n\
    Depending on the information available about a channel, certain SUs are chosen\
    \ to\nsense it. Three main channel types considered are with no prior information\
    \ about the\nPU signal, with known pilot tone of the PU signal, and the channel\
    \ with an OFDM\nPU signal being sent over it. We assume that M N is the total\
    \ number of channels with\nno information available about them, M P is the total\
    \ number of channels with the\nknown pilot tones, and M O is the total number\
    \ of channels known to carry an OFDM\nsignal. This means that, M = M N + M P +\
    \ M O. Based on this information, SUs\nare divided into cooperative SU-clusters,\
    \ which sense the assigned channels. In cases\nno information is known about the\
    \ channel, the pilot tone of the channel’s signal is\nknown, and the signal of\
    \ the channel is known to be an OFDM one, the ED, PD, and\nOD-based users are\
    \ selected to sense the channel, respectively. Finally, we assume\nthat the system\
    \ contains suﬃcient amount of SUs to detect each channel type.\n5.3\nHeterogeneous\
    \ Multi-band Multi-user Coop-\nerative Spectrum Sensing\nA ﬂow chart for the proposed\
    \ HM2CSS scheme is represented in Fig.\n5.2.\nThe\ninputs for the proposed HM2CSS\
    \ scheme are K heterogeneous SUs, containing KE\nED, KP PD, and KO OD-based sensors\
    \ and M channels, where each SU can sense\nmaximum I channels, i.e., I < M. The\
    \ available information about all channels is\ndiﬀerent. According to the information\
    \ present about channels, the ﬁrst stage of the\nproposed HM2CSS scheme is to\
    \ select an SU-leader for each channel m ∈ M. In\ncase no information is available\
    \ about the PU signal, i.e., mN ∈ M N, the SU-leader\nis selected from the ED-based\
    \ SUs subset, KE ∈ K.\nIf the pilot tone is known,\ni.e., mP ∈ M P, the SU-leader\
    \ is selected from the PD-based SUs subset, KP ∈ K.\nOtherwise, if the signal\

    \ the signal is known to be OFDM, cooperative SUs are chosen to be from the\n\
    ED, PD, OD-based SUs subsets, respectively. This is necessary in order to provide\n\
    synchronization to the learning process and use the most out of information available\n\
    for sensing. The two stages mentioned above are discussed in details in the following\n\
    sub-sections. After the cooperative SU-selection process is accomplished, diﬀusion-\n\
    based distributed learning is performed by each cooperative SU-cluster to determine\n\
    whether the channels are occupied or not. Those channels, which are determined\n\
    to be in the idle mode, are available for SUs’ transmission, meaning that SUs\
    \ with\nhighest priorities to use channels can transmit for the time duration\
    \ T. As for the\noccupied channels, SUs are not allowed to use them. Thus, they\
    \ have to wait for time\nduration T and then, repeat the process from the beginning.\n\
    5.3.1\nStage 1: Leader Selection\nOptimal leader selection implies determining\
    \ the best SU to listen to for each channel\nm. Leaders will be responsible to\
    \ select cooperative SUs for distributed spectrum\nsensing. This is why it is\
    \ essential to make the correct choice of a leader for each\nchannel. We can deﬁne\
    \ a binary indicator bmk to show whether the k-th SU is chosen\nas a leader for\
    \ the m-th channel or not:\nbmk =\n\n\n\n1,\nif k-th SU is selected as a leader\
    \ for channel m\n0,\notherwise.\n(5.1)\n5.3.1.1\nEnergy Detector Based Leader\
    \ Selection\nDue to the fact that ED-based detection is done by estimating the\
    \ received energy\nlevel across the channel, whether the noise level is high or\
    \ low, together with the PU\nsignal it is detected. In case the noise level is\
    \ high and the PU is in the idle mode, an\nED-based SU may decide that the PU\
    \ is present. This is why the SNR value of the\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND\
    \ MULTI-USER CSS\n51\nchannel plays an important role in this type of detection.\
    \ Let SNRavg be the average\nSNR value across each channel. In order to select\
    \ cooperative SUs with both higher\nand lower SNR values, the leader of channel\
    \ mN ∈ MN should have low correlation\nin its signal envelope with the signal\
    \ envelopes of its cooperative SUs. This is why\nfor channels with no prior information\
    \ available about them, the objective is to select\nleaders with the smallest\
    \ diﬀerence between SNRmNkE and SNRavg values, i.e., SUs\nwith SNR close to SNRavg.\
    \ The optimization problem formulation to select leaders\nfor mN ∈ MN channels\
    \ can be deﬁned as follows:\nmin\nbmN kE :\nKE\nX\nkE=1\nMN\nX\nmN=1\nbmNkE ×\
    \ |SNRmNkE − SNRavg| ,\ns.t. C1 :\nMN\nX\nmN=1\nbmNkE = cE\nk , ∀ kE ∈ KE,\n(5.2)\n\
    C2 :\nKE\nX\nkE=1\nbmNkE = 1, ∀ mN ∈ MN,\nwhere cE\nk is the binary value, which\
    \ equals to 1 if SU E\nk is a leader of one of the\nchannels from a subset of\
    \ MN and 0 otherwise. C1 ensures that same SU cannot be\nselected as a leader\
    \ for more than one channel. Whereas C2 conﬁrms that only one\nleader can be selected\
    \ for each channel.\n5.3.1.2\nPilot-tone Detector Based Leader Selection\nFor\
    \ PD-based sensed channels, the orthogonality property between the pilot tone\
    \ and\nthe data-carrying part of the signal is used for detection purposes. This\
    \ is why noise\nexistence here is not as crucial as in the ED-based case. Due\
    \ to the fact that we\nown the information about the pilot tone of the PU signal,\
    \ we require such a leader\nthat we can easily recognize the pilot tone in it.\
    \ Hence, a leader for each channel\nmP ∈ MP is selected with highest SNR value.\
    \ The optimization problem formulation\nfor PD-based leader selection can be deﬁned\
    \ as follows:\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER CSS\n52\nmax\nbmP\
    \ kP :\nKP\nX\nkP =1\nMP\nX\nmP =1\nbmP kP × SNRmP kP ,\ns.t. C1 :\nMP\nX\nmP\
    \ =1\nbmP kP = cP\nk , ∀ kP ∈ KP,\n(5.3)\nC2 :\nKP\nX\nkP =1\nbmP kP = 1, ∀ mP\
    \ ∈ MP,\nwhere cP\nk is the binary value, which equals to 1 if SU P\nk is a leader\
    \ of k-th channels\nand 0 otherwise. C1 ensures that same SU cannot be selected\
    \ as a leader for more\nthan one channel. Whereas C2 conﬁrms that only one leader\
    \ can be selected for each\nchannel.\n5.3.1.3\nOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing\
    \ Detector Based\nLeader Selection\nAs for the OD-based detection, using the knowledge\
    \ of cyclic preﬁx and OFDM\nsymbol length, the inherent signal correlation incurred\
    \ by cyclic preﬁx repetition is\nused to detect the PU signal. Due to the fact\
    \ that suﬃcient amount of information\nis available about the PU signal, there\
    \ is no need for the speciﬁc leader choice or an\noptimization problem formulation\
    \ as it only increases the complexity of the algorithm\nin this case. Hence, this\
    \ property of the OD-based scenario allows us to randomly\nselect a leader for\
    \ each channel mO ∈ MO from the subset of KO SUs.\nIt is essential to note that\
    \ for all three channel types mentioned above, the SU-\nleader selection is independent\
    \ and performed concurrently. This comes from the fact\nthat only ED-based SUs\
    \ may be selected as leaders for each channel mN ∈ MN,\nPD-based SUs for each\
    \ channel mP ∈ MP, and OD-based SUs for each channel\nmO ∈ MO. However, it is\
    \ clear from (5.2) and (5.3) that leader selection among\nchannels of the same\
    \ type is dependent as only one SU-leader is allowed per channel,\nand the same\
    \ SU cannot be a leader for more than one channel.\nFinally, the problems in (5.2)\
    \ and (5.3) are of mixed integer linear programming\n(MILP) type. Each one of\
    \ them includes a linear objective function and constraints.\nIn both problems,\
    \ all variables are binary. To solve these problems, we adopted the\nB&B algorithm\
    \ [57]. The B&B algorithm searches the complete space of solutions for\nCHAPTER\
    \ 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER CSS\n53\nthe best one within a given\
    \ problem by branching a tree. For each iterative search,\nthere exists an incumbent\
    \ solution, which denotes to the best found feasible solution\nin the branching\
    \ tree. If the solution is worse than the existing incumbent solution,\nthen the\
    \ branch is fathomed. The algorithm stops as soon as no subset is remained,\n\
    which has to be still fathomed, and the best incumbent solution is denoted as\
    \ the\noptimal value.\n5.3.2\nStage 2: Cooperative Secondary User Selection\n\
    The second stage of the proposed HM2CSS scheme is to select SUs for each channel\n\
    m ∈ M, which together with SU-leaders cooperatively sense channels. To begin with,\n\
    the received signals’ envelopes for each sample n are calculated as follows:\n\
    rm\nk (n) =\nq\n(gm\nI,k(n))2 + (gm\nQ,k(n))2\n(5.4)\nwhere gm\nI,k(n) and gm\n\
    Q,k(n) are the in-phase and quadrature components of the received\nsignal by k-th\
    \ SU sensing channel m, respectively. Then, the CVM test matrix is\nformed by\
    \ calculating the received signals’ envelopes correlation values and ﬁnding\n\
    the diﬀerence in the correlation of the sensed signal envelopes with the sensed\
    \ leaders’\nones for each channel m ∈ M. Thus, the CVM test matrix entries are\
    \ calculated\nas [38]:\nTj,k =\n1\n12N +\nN\nX\nn=1\n\x12\nFj(rm\nk (n)) − 2n\
    \ − 1\n2N\n\x132\n,\n(5.5)\nwhere Fj(.) is probability distribution of the received\
    \ signal by j-th SU acting as a\nleader for channel m. It should be noted that\
    \ for each channel m test values have to\nbe computed only for those SUs, which\
    \ are one hop away from the leaders. Otherwise,\nthe test value is set to 0.\n\
    Our objective is to select SUs with the lowest correlation compared to the leader\n\
    for CSS of the m-th channel. This implies selecting cooperative SUs with highest\n\
    CVM test values as they provide lowest correlation between SUs’ signal envelopes\n\
    and leaders’ signal envelopes. Assuming βjk to be a binary variable, which shows\n\
    whether k-th SU is selected for CSS or not, we have:\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS\
    \ MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER CSS\n54\nβjk =\n\n\n\n1,\nif k-th SU is selected as\
    \ cooperative with leader j\n0,\notherwise.\n(5.6)\nThen, an optimization problem\
    \ for cooperative SU-selection can be formulated as:\nmax\nβjk :\nK\nX\nk=1\n\
    M\nX\nj=1\nβjk × Tjk × ajk,\ns.t. C1 :\nM\nX\nj=1\nβjk ≥ 1,\n∀ k → non-leaders\
    \ of each m ∈ M,\nC2 :\nM\nX\nj=1\nβjk ≥ 0,\n∀ k → leader of each m ∈ M,\nC3 :\n\
    M\nX\nj=1\nβjk ≤ I,\n∀ k → non-leaders of each m ∈ M,\nC4 :\nM\nX\nj=1\nβjk ≤\
    \ I − 1,\n∀ k → leader for each m ∈ M, (5.7)\nC5 :\nK\nX\nk=1\nβjk ≤ K × I\nM\n\
    − 1,\n∀ j → leader of each m ∈ M,\nC6 : L ≤\nKE\nP\nkE=1\nSNRjkE × βjkE\nKE\n\
    P\nkE=1\nβjkE\n≤ U,\n∀ j → leader of each mN ∈ MN,\nC7 : L = (1 − p) × SNRavg,\n\
    0 ≤ p ≤ 1,\nC8 : U = (1 + p) × SNRavg,\n0 ≤ p ≤ 1,\nwhere ajk is the binary value\
    \ 1, if k-th SU can be selected as cooperative with leader\nj and 0, otherwise,\
    \ p is the tolerance probability for SNRavg, and L as well as U are\nlower and\
    \ upper bounds for SNRavg of all cooperative SUs of each channel mN ∈ MN,\nrespectively.\n\
    The constraints (C1)-(C5) are introduced to balance the energy consumption\namong\
    \ all channels and devices fairly. For each Tjk matrix column, minimum of 1\n\
    (C1) and maximum of I (C3) entries are chosen for the non-leader columns, whereas\n\
    CHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER CSS\n55\nminimum of 0 (C2) and\
    \ maximum of I −1 (C4) entries are chosen for the leader ones.\nIn order to limit\
    \ the energy consumption of the system, constraint in (C5) sets the\nmaximum number\
    \ of SUs, which can sense one channel to K×I\nM . In addition to this,\nconstraints\
    \ (C6)-(C8) are introduced only for the channels, which we own no prior\ninformation\
    \ about the signal being carried by them, i.e., ED-based sensed channels.\nIt\
    \ ensures fair selection of the number of ED-based SUs from lower and higher SNR\n\
    values than the average SNR one with the help of lower (C7) and upper (C8) bounds\n\
    for the total SNRavg of cooperative SUs.\nThe problem in (5.7) is also of MILP\
    \ type with linear objective function and\nconstraints. To solve problem (5.7),\
    \ we adopted the B&B algorithm as well. Here,\nthe variables are of binary and\
    \ integer types. In general, the B&B algorithm has\nthe worst case complexity\
    \ scenario equal to the exhausted search.\nHowever, the\ncomplexity depends on\
    \ the input variables and constraints fed to the algorithm. In the\nbest case\
    \ scenario, the complexity is linear as simple parallelism and incorporation of\n\
    heuristics may reduce the relaxed problem as well as the tree size [57]. The parallelism\n\
    mentioned is the ability of the MILP tree nodes to be processed independently.\
    \ In\nthe formulated problem the constraint matrix is highly sparse, which reduces\
    \ the\ncomplexity as well. Hence, the average complexity of the B&B algorithm\
    \ is low and\nmaybe considered as a reasonable performance metric [57].\nThe problem’s\
    \ output can be seen as the optimized cooperative SUs’ vector for\neach channel\
    \ m ∈ M as Q = [Q1 Q2 ... QM]T, where Qm is the number of cooperative\nSUs for\
    \ channel m, and is equal to:\nQm =\nK\nX\nk=1\nβjk,\n(5.8)\nwhere j is the index\
    \ of a SU, which is the leader for channel m.\nThe selected cooperative SU-clusters\
    \ use diﬀusion-based learning, discussed in\nSection 4.3.3, to exchange the locally\
    \ sensed information upon which it is decided\nif PU signals are present or not.\
    \ Reaching the consensus point, the point where all\ncooperative SUs have the\
    \ same information about the test statistics for the channel,\nimplies performing\
    \ a total of iT iterations.\nThen, the resulted test statistics are\ncompared\
    \ with the thresholds, which diﬀer depending on the detector types, to decide\n\
    if channels are occupied or not. Finally, the unoccupied channels can be assigned\
    \ to\nSUs with the highest priority for transmitting data.\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS\
    \ MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER CSS\n56\nIn general, two stage optimization problems may\
    \ lead to a sub-optimal solution.\nHowever, the reason why joint optimization\
    \ is not considered in our case is the co-\noperative SU-selection dependence\
    \ on leaders. Leader selection of the ﬁrst stage acts\nas a benchmark in selecting\
    \ cooperative SUs for the second stage. The second op-\ntimization problem has\
    \ to be solved by leaders only instead of all SUs. Therefore,\nsuch a conﬁguration\
    \ allows complexity reduction of the system in total. Moreover,\nselecting correct\
    \ leaders helps in an eﬃcient selection of corresponding SUs, which\nresults in\
    \ detection performance improvements. As it will be seen in the next section,\n\
    the two stage solution in our case is proved to have stable system performance\
    \ and\noutperform the existing multi-band CSS schemes.\n5.4\nSimulation Results\n\
    In this section, the performance of the proposed HM2CSS scheme is investigated.\n\
    Three diﬀerent network sizes are considered for simulation results. Those are\
    \ M = 50\nchannels and K = 100 SUs, M = 25 channels and K = 50 SUs, and M = 5\
    \ channels\nand K = 10 SUs. On the event that only one network size is used, the\
    \ M = 50\nchannels and K = 100 SUs scenario is assumed. The information available\
    \ about\nchannels is divided according to Table 5.1, such that for each case of\
    \ M there are\nM N channels with no prior information about PU signals, M P channels\
    \ with known\npilot tones of PU signals, and M O channels with OFDM signals being\
    \ sent over them\nby PUs. No prior information PU signals are modeled as random\
    \ Gaussian, as it\nhas been discussed in Chapter 2. PU signals with known pilot\
    \ tones are assumed to\nhave binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulated pilot\
    \ tones and random Gaussian\nTable 5.1: Number of channels with the certain information\
    \ available about them\nfor the total of M channels.\nM\nM N\nM P\nM O\n50\n20\n\

    \ CSS\n57\ndata-carrying signal parts, where 10% of the total PU signal power\
    \ is allocated for\nthe pilot tone. As for OFDM PU signals, 16 QAM modulation\
    \ is used. In total,\n100 blocks are used to construct one OFDM signal, where\
    \ the number of symbols\nis assumed to be 32 with the cyclic preﬁx length of 8\
    \ for each block. In all cases,\nthe amount of ED, PD, and OD-based SUs are assigned\
    \ to be approximately 40%,\n40%, and 20%, respectively. In an IoT-based CRN, 100\
    \ secondary IoT-nodes is a\nreasonable number due to the fact that many sensor\
    \ nodes can connect with each one\nof them. For instance, assuming 10 sensors\
    \ nodes per house, each network represents\nby itself 4000 sensor nodes in smart\
    \ homes applications [58]. All parameters set to the\nnetwork model are as follows,\
    \ unless speciﬁed. The minimum and maximum amount\nof channels sensed by one SU\
    \ is set to be 1 and I = 5, respectively. SNRmk is chosen\nrandomly, with the\
    \ SNRavg value of −10 dB for each channel. In addition to this, a\nﬁxed number\
    \ of samples Nm is used by SUs while sensing each channel. This is done\nfor synchronization\
    \ purposes of the diﬀusion-based distributed learning. The number\nof samples\
    \ sensed by one ED, PD, and OD-based SU per channel are considered\nNED = 2000,\
    \ NPD = 500, and NOD = 4000, respectively.\nAs for the spectrum\nsensing energy\
    \ consumption, 40 nJ of energy is assumed to be consumed by an SU\nper sensing\
    \ one sample [59]. The IEEE 802.22 standard is taken into account when\nperforming\
    \ simulation results, according to which the total probability of detection\n\
    should be greater than 90%, while the false alarm probability should be less than\n\
    10%.\nSimulation results are illustrated in terms of diﬀusion learning, receiver\
    \ operat-\ning characteristics (ROC), aggregate PU protection level vs SNRavg,\
    \ aggregate CRN\nthroughput, and energy consumption level on the sensing process.\
    \ The results are\ncompared to the existing distributed and centralized schemes.\
    \ RSSS is chosen as a\nbenchmark for the existing distributed scheme due to its\
    \ simplicity and low compu-\ntational complexity favored by IoT devices. In RSSS,\
    \ cooperative SUs are chosen in\nan arbitrary manner, i.e., randomly [6, 36].\
    \ As for the existing centralized schemes,\nOR, k-out-of-K, majority, and AND\
    \ rules are chosen to be compared to the pro-\nposed distributed HM2CSS scheme\
    \ [6]. The k-out-of-K rule considered assumes that\nfor channels to be assumed\
    \ busy, minimum 20% of SUs sensing channels detect the\npresence of PUs.\nThe\
    \ following sub-sections provide a thorough explanation and\ncomparison of the\
    \ achieved results.\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER CSS\n58\n\

    \ cooperative SUs,\nthe ones with similar information sensed for the m-th channel.\
    \ However, this does\nnot mean that the number of chosen cooperative SUs to sense\
    \ channels decreases.\nFor the proposed HM2CSS scheme it depends on the correlation\
    \ of received signal\nenvelopes, while for the existing RSSS scheme it is random.\
    \ This means that the\nenvironment and channel conditions may aﬀect the choice\
    \ for the proposed HM2CSS\nscheme. Nevertheless, the number of cooperative SUs\
    \ is restricted by the constraints,\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER\

    \ of false alarm Qf of a bit higher than 10%.\nMoreover, it can be noticed that\

    \ This can be explained by the\nway the RSSS scheme is accomplished or, in other\

    \ cooperative SUs are chosen in a random\nmanner, the chances to get cooperative\

    SU aﬀects the aggregate ROC performance of both, the proposed HM2CSS and the\n\
    existing RSSS schemes. It can be seen that in case of the proposed HM2CSS scheme,\n\
    the enhancement of ROC results stops at a certain point of increasing I. This\
    \ allows\nus to have decreased energy consumption per SU as sensing of additional\
    \ channels\nrequires extra power to be consumed on both sensing and transmission\
    \ processes. It\ncan be seen that the aggregate detection probability for the\
    \ cases of I = 2 and I = 5\nis slightly higher than the one for I = 8 in case\
    \ the aggregate false alarm probability\nis low, i.e., Qf ≤ 5%. This is due to\
    \ the fact that the selection of cooperative SUs for\nthe proposed HM2CSS scheme\
    \ is being optimized. Choosing best 5 channels to sense\nby each SU can provide\
    \ us with the better performance than sensing higher numbers\nof channels as 8\
    \ in case some of them are in the deep fading state with respect to SUs.\nThis\
    \ places another advantage for low-power IoT devices, which are not capable of\n\
    sensing more than a certain number of channels at a time instance. However, for\
    \ the\nexisting RSSS technique, the system performance keeps growing up by increasing\
    \ the\nnumber of channels sensed by one SU. The more randomly selected cooperative\
    \ SUs\nare selected to sense channels, the better the system performance is. Randomness\
    \ in\nthe process can not guarantee that the selected channels to be sensed by\
    \ a certain SU\nare not in deep fade state with respect to the SU. This is why\
    \ choosing more channels\nto sense can enhance the performance in this case. It\
    \ is a certain disadvantage of\nthe RSSS process as higher amount of energy is\
    \ needed to sense greater number of\nchannels, which can create power consumption\
    \ problems for IoT systems.\nWhile Figs. 5.6 and 5.7 illustrate the proposed distributed\
    \ HM2CSS scheme with\nanother existing distributed scheme, Fig. 5.8 compares HM2CSS\
    \ with the existing\ncentralized techniques. Generally, it is a well known fact\
    \ that the centralized schemes\nof OR and k-out-of-K rules tend to outperform\
    \ distributed schemes in terms of ROC\nbecause of the high control level accommodated\
    \ by an FC [60]. However, Fig. 5.8\nillustrates that the proposed scheme outperforms\
    \ most of the centralized rules as\nk-out-of-k, majority, and AND-rule and provides\
    \ the performance of approximately\nthe centralized OR-rule one.\nBoth, the proposed\
    \ distributed HM2CSS as well as\ncentralized OR-rule satisfy the global probability\
    \ of detection Qd = 90% at the global\nprobability of false alarm Qf of less than\

    \ dB. Moreover, at the SNRavg value of −10 dB, all\nthree cases considered have\
    \ the global detection probability of approximately 95%.\nHowever, in the case\
    \ of RSSS, the increase in the global probability of detection makes\ndiﬀerence.\
    \ For the given I values of 8, 5, and 2, the corresponding global probability\n\
    of detection reaches 90% at the values of −9 dB, −8 dB, and −6 dB, respectively.\
    \ This\nmeans that at the SNRavg value of −10 dB, the IEEE 802.22 standard requirement\n\
    of Qd ≥ 90% is not reached. The global probability of detection at the SNRavg\
    \ value\nof −10 dB is 86%, 83%, and 78% for the I values of 8, 5, and 2, respectively.\
    \ This\nbrings an advantage of HM2CSS as in case a SU is not capable of sensing\
    \ I channels\ndue to power limitations and has to decrease its value, the system\
    \ performance will\nnot experience sensible changes.\nFig. 5.12 takes into account\

    \ This can be explained as follows. At very low SNR\nvalues noise level is high,\

    reduced energy consumption on sensing as shown in Fig. 5.17. This can be explained\n\
    in the way that the more information is available about the channel, the less\
    \ number\nof cooperative SUs is chosen to sense it. Finally, Fig. 5.18 illustrates\
    \ that in total,\nthe aggregate amount of energy needed to be consumed on the\

    \ availability of the prior\ninformation about channels for both proposed and\
    \ existing schemes.\n5.5\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we proposed a novel diﬀusion\
    \ learning-based HM2CSS scheme for\ndistributed multi-band CRNs. The proposed\
    \ HM2CSS scheme consists of two stages.\nCHAPTER 5. HETEROGENEOUS MULTI-BAND MULTI-USER\
    \ CSS\n76\nWe formulated optimization problems in order to provide an eﬃcient\
    \ way of selecting\ncooperative SUs for all channels. The ﬁrst stage consists\
    \ of selecting a SU-leader based\non which cooperative SUs can be selected in\
    \ the second stage. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed HM2CSS scheme brings\
    \ improvements in terms of global detection\nprobability and CRN throughput results.\
    \ While the existing distributed scheme’s\nperformance starts degrading as soon\
    \ as the network size increases, HM2CSS is proved\nto enhance the performance\
    \ as the system size grows. This indicates HM2CSS as a\nscalable scheme in terms\
    \ of detection performance and allows the network size grow by\nadding supplementary\
    \ SUs without extra human intervention needed to keep system\nperformance level\
    \ stable.\nChapter 6\nConclusions and Future Work\n6.1\nConclusions\nDue to the\
    \ IoT emerge, distributed learning-based multi-band multi-user cognitive\nIoT\
    \ systems are believed to be a part of future communication. However, lack of\n\
    centralized control together with the increase in number of devices and dynamic\n\
    environments place room for lots of challenges.\nAt ﬁrst, we have discussed three\
    \ diﬀerent cognitive IoT system architectures,\nnamed as centralized, distributed,\
    \ and hybrid. We pointed out advantages and dis-\nadvantages of each one of them.\
    \ In total, cognitive IoT systems are believed to be\nhybrid, which include both\
    \ centralized and distributed networks. However, due to\nthe distributed nature\
    \ of IoT and the focus placed on learning and feedback, dis-\ntributed systems\
    \ are of great importance. We have provided a list of challenges to be\naddressed\
    \ in designing multi-band CSS schemes for cognitive IoT systems compared\nto conventional\
    \ CSS schemes. These include application-centric approach, mobility\nof users,\
    \ scalability, high integrity and heterogeneity, cooperation and learning, main-\n\
    taining EE, fairness and cooperative SU-selection, computational complexity, sensing\n\
    duration and synchronization, and interference management. The description of\
    \ each\none of them has been discussed in details.\nIn addition to this, we have\
    \ examined the abilities of three diﬀerent learning-\nbased approaches to be incorporated\
    \ in distributed cognitive IoT systems, named as\nincremental, consensus, and\
    \ diﬀusion. The comparison has been provided, pointing\nout pros and cons of each\
    \ one of them. Simulation results have been performed in\nterms of learning curves\
    \ for the cases of no link failure and 30% link failure and the\namount of iterations\
    \ needed as the number of cooperative SUs grows. It has been\n77\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS\
    \ AND FUTURE WORK\n78\nproved that the diﬀusion-based learning algorithm is more\
    \ eﬃcient than the others\nmentioned above for cognitive IoT systems due to low\
    \ complexity, relatively high\nspeed of convergence, immunity to link failures,\
    \ etc.\nOne of the main challenges in heterogeneous distributed learning-based\
    \ CSS is\ncooperative SUs’ scheduling to sense a subset of channels. To overcome\
    \ this chal-\nlenge, in this thesis, we propose a novel multi-band CSS scheme\
    \ called HM2CSS.\nThe proposed scheme is designed to solve the scalability in\
    \ terms of detection per-\nformance, heterogeneity, fairness in cooperative SU-selection,\
    \ sensing duration, and\nsynchronization challenges of multi-band CSS in cognitive\
    \ IoT systems. The pro-\nposed HM2CSS algorithm consists of two stages. The ﬁrst\
    \ stage involves selecting an\nSU-leader for each channel of the multi-band spectrum\
    \ commodity. We formulate op-\ntimization problems depending on detector types\
    \ used. Based on selected SU-leaders,\ncooperative SUs are selected in the second\
    \ stage. For this purpose, an optimization\nproblem is formulated. Then, cooperative\
    \ SUs exchange locally sensed information\nusing diﬀusion learning to determine\
    \ the availability of channels. Simulation results\nshow that the proposed HM2CSS\
    \ scheme outperforms existing distributed and cen-\ntralized schemes in terms\
    \ of global detection probability and CRN throughput. The\nproposed HM2CSS scheme\
    \ is proved to enhance system performance as the CRN size\ngrows. This indicates\
    \ the proposed HM2CSS scheme as scalable in terms of detec-\ntion performance.\
    \ It allows adding supplementary SUs without additional human\nintervention of\
    \ bringing the performance level back. The proposed HM2CSS scheme\nsatisﬁes the\
    \ IEEE 802.22 detection performance standard, provides heterogeneity,\nand high\
    \ performance in terms of global detection probability and CRN throughput\nfor\
    \ distributed cognitive IoT systems. The proposed HM2CSS scheme provides fair\n\
    energy consumption for CSS on all channels and illustrates lower aggregate energy\n\
    consumption for the system in total. Finally, one of the possible applications\
    \ for\nthe proposed scheme is smart transportations. Electrical vehicles can be\
    \ equipped\nwith sensing technologies and small computers, which are capable of\
    \ performing the\npresented optimization problems. Nevertheless, HM2CSS has its\
    \ own drawbacks yet\nto overcome as higher computational complexity and power\
    \ consumption per channel\nfor certain detector types. The scheme may still represent\
    \ challenges for small IoT de-\nvices. Thus, future research insights are given\
    \ in the next section in order to improve\nand overcome the drawbacks of HM2CSS\
    \ and existing multi-band CSS schemes.\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\
    79\n6.2\nFuture Work\nThe research on the distributed CSS has mostly been limited\
    \ to small scale networks.\nThis thesis provides a uniﬁed problem formulation\
    \ of distributed multi-band CSS\nto address challenges of cognitive IoT systems.\
    \ The insights attained in this open\ndemanding future research direction, including,\
    \ but not limited to are:\n• We can consider involving and comparing diﬀerent\
    \ compressive spectrum sens-\ning and multi-co-set spectrum sensing techniques\
    \ in order to decrease individual\nSU as well as system’s sensing energy consumption\
    \ in total.\n• We have demonstrated that for the proposed HM2CSS scheme, there\
    \ exists a\nmaximum number of channels to be sensed by each SU, which illustrates\
    \ the\noptimal systems performance. For example, in this thesis we did not have\
    \ to\nsense eight channels per each SU as sensing ﬁve channels corresponded to\
    \ similar\ndetection performance. However, this was determined by means of simulations.\n\
    In future, we are going to optimize the number of channels being sensed by each\n\
    SU subject to the system performance analytically.\n• In this thesis, we have\
    \ assumed that each SU has suﬃcient amount of energy to\nperform diﬀusion-based\
    \ learning. In future works, we are planning to investigate\nthe case, when a\
    \ SU can switch between diﬀusion and consensus-based learning\nto reduce the energy\
    \ consumption of the system.\n• Incorporating machine learning techniques to the\
    \ learning process is another\ninteresting topic of investigation. Machine learning\
    \ can help in selecting coop-\nerative SUs based on predictions and analytics.\n\
    • In this thesis, we have considered network-based reconﬁguration, when each\n\
    SU owns one detector. However, for some IoT applications owning strong SUs,\n\
    which are able to have multiple CR units with diﬀerent detector types, device-\n\
    based reconﬁguration can be considered.\n• This thesis considers opportunistic\
    \ spectrum access in cognitive IoT systems.\nOther CR techniques can be considered\
    \ for cognitive IoT systems as well. For\ninstance, the underlay CR paradigm,\
    \ where secondary IoT-nodes and PUs are\nallowed to share spectrum concurrently\
    \ with interference constraints placed\non secondary IoT-nodes.\nWe also encourage\
    \ the analysis of the overlay CR\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n80\n\
    mechanism, where secondary IoT-nodes share spectrum with PUs concurrently\nby\
    \ means of helping PU-transmitters to deliver the information to PU-receivers,\n\
    i.e., acting as relays.\n• Incorporating radio frequency EH (RFEH) techniques\
    \ in order to increase the\nenergy eﬃciency of the system is another approach\
    \ to be considered. In case a\nSU is in the waiting mode or is not allowed to\
    \ transmit, it could switch to the\nRFEH mode instead. This may further reduce\
    \ human intervention as it can\ndecrease the number of battery replacements in\
    \ secondary-IoT nodes.\n• This thesis highlights the importance of learning algorithms\
    \ due to the dis-\ntributed IoT nature. However, we as well mention that IoT networks\
    \ will have\na mixed topology of hybrid type. This is why investigating the borders\
    \ of cen-\ntralized and distributed systems, i.e., parts where the two diﬀerent\
    \ network\ntopologies meet, is an important research topic to be considered.\n\
    • As discussed in this thesis, due to the distributed nature of IoT systems, the\n\
    centralized network topology oﬀer several disadvantages to IoT. Another way of\n\
    overcoming them is by applying drone base stations as mobile cluster heads [61].\n\
    The analysis of hybrid network topologies with mobile drone base stations acting\n\
    as cluster heads can be an interesting investigation.\n• In hybrid IoT systems,\
    \ when a FC fails, one of the SU nodes can take its role.\nIn this case the chosen\
    \ SU node is selected only if it is capable of performing FC\ntasks. An example\
    \ of such systems is smart grid networks [62]. The problem\nmay be set in the\
    \ following way: given a network of 100 SUs, 10 from which\nare super-nodes, i.e.,\
    \ have the capabilities of performing FC tasks, what is the\nbest way of choosing\
    \ the new FC. In this case, at each time instance Tinstance,\nthe best super-node\
    \ is chosen to perform FC tasks.\n• One of the most important elements associated\
    \ with distributed IoT systems\nis the ability to deal with local sensing.\nLocality\
    \ is very important in IoT.\nHowever, it is not well-explored yet.\nGeo-location\
    \ and stochastic geometry\ntechniques can be combined together with the proposed\
    \ scheme to increase\nsystem performance [63].\n• In distributed cognitive IoT\
    \ systems, it is essential to analyze time duration,\nwhen cooperative SU-selection\
    \ has to be repeated. This problem is still open\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE\
    \ WORK\n81\nfor research explorations and may depend on various factors, such\
    \ as mobility\nof SUs, environmental changes, etc.\n• Finally, it is important\
    \ to investigate the response of the proposed algorithm\nto system changes. Currently\
    \ addition of new users to the system requires the\ncooperative SU-selection process\
    \ to be repeated over again.\nHowever, there\nmay be more eﬃcient solutions to\
    \ this. The environment can be investigated\ntogether with the properties of new\
    \ users and hence, decisions made whether it\nis better to repeat the process\
    \ again or simply allow users join several sensing\nclusters.\nList of References\n\

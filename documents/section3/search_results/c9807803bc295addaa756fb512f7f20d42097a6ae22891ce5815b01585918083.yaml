    \x06\a\nAbstract: Data collection is one of the main operations performed in Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks\n(WSNs). Even if several interesting approaches on data collection\
    \ have been proposed during the\nlast decade, it remains a research focus in full\
    \ swing with a number of important challenges. Indeed,\nthe continuous reduction\
    \ in sensor size and cost, the variety of sensors available on the market,\nand\
    \ the tremendous advances in wireless communication technology have potentially\
    \ broadened\nthe impact of WSNs. The range of application of WSNs now extends\
    \ from health to the military\nﬁeld through home automation, environmental monitoring\
    \ and tracking, as well as other areas of\nhuman activity. Moreover, the expansion\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in an important\namount of heterogeneous\
    \ data that are produced at an exponential rate. Furthermore, these data are\n\
    of interest to both industry and in research. This fact makes their collection\
    \ and analysis imperative\nfor many purposes. In view of the characteristics of\
    \ these data, we believe that very large-scale and\nheterogeneous WSNs can be\
    \ very useful for collecting and processing these Big Data. However,\nthe scaling\
    \ up of WSNs presents several challenges that are of interest in both network\
    \ architecture\nto be proposed, and the design of data-routing protocols. This\
    \ paper reviews the background and\nstate of the art of Big Data collection in\
    \ Large-Scale WSNs (LS-WSNs), compares and discusses on\nchallenges of Big Data\
    \ collection in LS-WSNs, and proposes possible directions for the future.\nKeywords:\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks; data collection; Big Data; IoT\n1. Introduction\n\
    1.1. Background\nAccording to the United Nations, the world’s population is estimated\
    \ at 7.6 billion in 2018.\nIn addition, more than 2 billion people are regularly\
    \ connected to the Internet and roughly 5 billion of\nthe world’s population use\
    \ various kinds of connected objects. During the last decade, the amount\nof global\
    \ generated data has exploded with the increasing use of connected objects, and\
    \ especially\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), which continuously produces most heterogeneous\
    \ data. Cisco reported\nthat, by the end of 2019, the IoT will annually generate\
    \ more than 500 zettabytes of structured and\nunstructured data, and that number\
    \ is expected to exponentially grow [1]. Moreover, a number of\nindustries’ forecasts\
    \ are projecting 50 billion connected devices to the Internet by 2020 [2].\nFurthermore,\
    \ in recent years, with the expansion of the IoT and recent technological advancements,\n\
    a growing number of intelligent information-aware devices, such as sensors, actuators,\
    \ smartphones,\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474; doi:10.3390/s18124474\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 4474\n2 of 34\nsmart wristbands, tablets, devices based on readers’\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) and\nMachine-to-Machine (M2M), have led\
    \ to the exponential growth of generated-data volume [3–9].\nIn general, these\
    \ devices, and especially sensors, are used both in industry and research to collect\n\
    data in various application contexts, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring,\
    \ and precision\nagriculture [10]. The signiﬁcant advance in research and engineering\
    \ has introduced novel architectures\nfor data acquisition, transmission, large-scale\
    \ data storage, and processing. Moreover, the emerging\nBig Data paradigm, mainly\
    \ used to describe massive data, is experiencing renewed interest in both the\n\
    industrial and scientiﬁc world [11]. A number of domains, such as the IoT, artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence, and\ndata science, are beneﬁting from digital transformation allowed\
    \ by Big Data.\nMoreover, Internet-based companies, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook,\
    \ and Amazon, motivate\nthe current thrust of Big Data research, where real-time\
    \ data originating from human sources, which\ninclude e-mails, online shopping\
    \ history, as well as tweets, are used in large-scale data mining and\nfor data\
    \ analysis to produce a number of value-added services [12]. Fundamentally, Big\
    \ Data may be\nseen as a very large number of structured, semistructured, and\
    \ unstructured data of a wide variety\nof data types that is generated with high\
    \ velocity and has the potential to help us in understanding\nhidden information\
    \ in datasets, and also in managing and organizing these datasets [13]. Usually,\n\
    the Big Data process relies on four steps: data generation, acquisition, storage,\
    \ and analysis. Contrary\nto traditional data, Big Data need more real-time analysis\
    \ given the fact that they include massive\namounts of unstructured data of various\
    \ types.\nNowadays, IoT devices are commonly used in a large spectrum of critical\
    \ application domains,\nincluding eHealth, smart environments, smart cities, smart\
    \ building, as well as precision agriculture.\nThe massive data collection enabled\
    \ by IoT technology, leads to the emergence of a huge number of\nsensor-based\
    \ applications. Given the virtual abstraction of smart objects enabled by IoT\
    \ technology,\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become the most commonly used\
    \ IoT-based platforms for\ndata collection [14]. Therefore, WSNs are known to\
    \ be a fundamental component that allowed the\ndevelopment of the IoT system.\
    \ In such networks, a large number of sensors are deployed in the order\nof thousands,\
    \ collaborating to collect and transfer information to the base station [15,16].\n\
    Increasingly, there is a growing trend towards large-scale sensor networks for\
    \ data collection.\nAlthough they represent a new generation of sensor networks,\
    \ their use is subjected to many constraints,\nincluding adaptability with existing\
    \ methods for network scaling. Several important challenges need\nto be addressed\
    \ in order to allow a network to effectively play its role. Among these challenges,\
    \ we can\nmention the optimal deployment of sinks, the minimization of sensors’\
    \ energy consumption, as well as\ntheir lifetime [17,18]. In a Big Data context,\
    \ with a massive amount of high-speed, regularly changing,\nand variable data,\
    \ large-scale WSNs (LS-WSNs) may provide valuable solutions for massive data\n\
    collection [19].\nHowever, power-aware Big Data gathering in large-scale sensor\
    \ networks remains, therefore,\na challenging research issue. In a computer vision\
    \ domain, for example, managing a large number of\nlearning instances of images\
    \ is not an easy task [20]. Nevertheless, in LS-WSNs, real-time data\ngeneration\
    \ and acquisition are achieved by various sensors, such as gathering information\
    \ on\nproximity, location, humidity, and movement. Unfortunately, data generated\
    \ and acquired from\nindividual sensors may not seem signiﬁcant. However, the\
    \ global various types of data generated by\na number of sensors in LS-WSNs can\
    \ produce signiﬁcant Big Data [21]. Moreover, data collection in\nLS-WSNs requires\
    \ two important challenges to be addressed, that is, monitoring in large geographic\n\
    environments with unconnected regions, and power-aware data collection.\nA number\
    \ of studies that provide a background to WSNs and Big Data on the one hand, and\n\
    overviews of data-collection schemes in the context of LS-WSNs on the other, have\
    \ been proposed in\nthe recent literature. We reviewed most of the latest existing\
    \ papers related with the topics examined\nin this paper. In this light, Rawat\
    \ et al. (2014) [22] proposed a review of recent developments in WSNs\nby surveying\
    \ the leading research projects, platforms, standards, and technologies related\
    \ with sensor\nnetworks. Bouaziz et al. (2016) [23] as well as Sanchez et al.\
    \ (2018) [24] have reviewed recent trends\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n3 of 34\nof\
    \ mobility management in WSNs while highlighting applications and platforms. Di\
    \ Francesco et al.\n(2011) [25] provided an extensive survey and taxonomy of the\
    \ data-collection process with mobile\nelements in WSNs. In addition to sensors,\
    \ there has been a recent tendency to use unmanned aerial\nvehicles like drones\
    \ for data acquisition. In this context, swarm intelligence schemes based on bacterial\n\
    foraging optimization have been successfully used to collect massive data in LS-WSNs\
    \ [26,27].\nIn 2014, Takaishi et al. [21] proposed a Big Data gathering scheme\
    \ in densely deployed WSNs\nthat exploit sink mobility. In the same year, Wu et\
    \ al. [28] proposed a Big Data collection scheme based\non the structure-ﬁdelity\
    \ approach. The authors provided a framework for collecting structured data\n\
    and to maintain data ﬁdelity in terms of structural similarity in continuous sensing\
    \ applications in\nWSNs. After deﬁning what really represents a big sensor data\
    \ system, Ang et al. (2017) [29] surveyed\nthe progress made in the development\
    \ and applications of big sensor data research, especially in the\ncontext of\
    \ smart cities. In order to enhance Big Data collection in an IoT system, Ang\
    \ et al. (2018) [12]\nproposed a way to collect Big Data in LS-WSNs using mobile\
    \ collectors to optimize energy consumption.\nThe authors adopted a data-collection\
    \ scheme using a date mule and mobile access point, which are\nthe mostly used\
    \ components in data-collection models in sensor networks.\nAccording to the literature,\
    \ we reviewed select research in the context of this study. We established\nthat\
    \ much less research has been done on Big Data collection with sensor-based systems\
    \ compared with\nstandard Big Data systems. Standard Big Data technology using\
    \ stored data is subject to challenges\nrelated to the speed capacities of communication\
    \ networks. Useful technologies, such as Hadoop or\nMapReduce, combined with cloud-computing\
    \ technology are actually used to address communication\nnetworks by integrating\
    \ distributed processing.\nCertainly, future 5G systems, which include a promising\
    \ cloud-based radio access network\nmodel and a more powerful mmWave spectrum,\
    \ will be more ﬂexible, agile, converged, and useful\nfor automating data analytics\
    \ with machine-learning or swarm-intelligence algorithms. However,\nunstructured\
    \ large volumes of data gathered from IoT-based systems, such as LS-WSNs, need\
    \ more\nattention. The focus of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the potential\
    \ of WSNs and Big Data is studied,\nwith particular emphasis on data collection.\
    \ Then, existing data-collection schemes in the literature\nare reviewed and discussed.\
    \ This paper gives a global overview of Big Data collection in LS-WSNs\nwith the\
    \ challenges to be addressed. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide useful\
    \ insights\nto research and industry into this promising research area, and motivate\
    \ the development of new\nschemes, models, and frameworks for Big Data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs.\n1.2. Author’s Contributions\nThis work aims at increasing readers’\
    \ knowledge by providing a sufﬁcient and comprehensive\nbackground in the schemes,\
    \ algorithms, and models used for resolving different data-collection\nchallenges\
    \ in LS-WSNs. The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is enabling novice readers to\
    \ understand\nthe mechanism and operation of large-scale wireless sensor networks\
    \ for massive data collection.\nSecondly, we propose an architecture for a WSN\
    \ dedicated to Big Data collection. Then, we lay the\ngroundwork for our future\
    \ work, which consists on the one hand of proposing a deployment model of\nlarge-scale\
    \ WSNs, which should maximize coverage, and, on the other hand, proposing efﬁcient\
    \ and\nlightweight algorithms for Big Data collection in LS-WSNs.\n1.3. Organization\
    \ of the Paper\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst provide\
    \ an overview of WSNs in Section 2.\nWe then propose a background on Big Data\
    \ in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on Big Data collection in\nLS-WSNs. In Section\
    \ 5, we reviewed data transferring schemes in the context of LS-WSNs. This is\n\
    followed in Section 6 by a discussion on the challenges of Big Data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs. Finally,\nwe conclude the paper in Section 7.\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n4 of 34\n2. Overview of WSNs\nA WSN is an ad hoc network consisting of\
    \ a set of sensor nodes, randomly ﬁxed or dispersed\nin a given geographical area,\
    \ communicating via a wireless link to autonomously collect, process,\nand transmit\
    \ data in their environment to a special node, considered the collection point,\
    \ called\na sink [16,22,30–32]. The geographical area where the sensor nodes operate\
    \ is called the ﬁeld or\narea of interest. In a WSN, sensor nodes are able to\
    \ self-organize to collect information about the\nenvironment where they are deployed.\
    \ The transmission of the collected data can be done periodically\nor event-based,\
    \ depending on the nature of the implemented application. The sink is a node with\n\
    two or more network interfaces that act as a bridge between the WSN and the end-user’s\
    \ network\n(for example, a local area network or the Internet). The user can send\
    \ requests to other nodes in the\nnetwork via the sink, for example, to specify\
    \ the type of data to be collected. For illustration purposes,\nFigure 1 shows\
    \ the basic architecture of a WSN. The sensor nodes randomly deployed in a zone\
    \ of\ninterest and the sink located at the end of the zone are responsible for\
    \ recovering the data collected\nby the sensors. Most often, the sink collects\
    \ and processes network data, thus sending only relevant\ninformation to the user.\
    \ It can also receive commands to run on the internal network from it (the user).\n\
    The collected data are processed and analyzed by the user.\nFigure 1. General\
    \ architecture of a wireless sensor network (WSN).\n2.1. Hardware Architecture\
    \ of a Wireless Sensor\nA wireless sensor is a small electronic device capable\
    \ of measuring a physical quantity\n(e.g., temperature, light, pressure) and communicating\
    \ it to a collection center directly or via other\nsensor nodes that act as routers\
    \ [10]. Given the advances in microelectronics, wireless transmission\ntechnologies\
    \ and software have made it possible to produce microsensors of a few cubic millimeters\
    \ in\nvolume that can operate in a network at a reasonable cost [22]. A sensor\
    \ node consists of four base\nunits and two optional units [10,33] (see Figure\
    \ 2):\n•\nAcquisition unit. This consists of two subunits: a sensor and an analog-to-digital\
    \ converter (ADC).\nThe sensor collects digital measurements on environmental\
    \ parameters and transforms them into\nanalog signals. The ADC converts analog\
    \ signals into digital signals.\n•\nProcessing unit. This is also composed of\
    \ two units: a data-storage unit, and a processor responsible\nfor data-processing\
    \ and control procedures allowing the collaboration of the sensor with the others\n\
    in order to carry out acquisition tasks.\n•\nCommunication unit. Its function\
    \ is information transmission and reception. It is equipped with\na transmitter/receiver\
    \ pair. It allows communication within the network, in our case, by radio\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n5 of 34\nfrequency (radio waves). However, there are other transmission\
    \ possibilities (e.g., optical and\ninfra red)\n•\nPower unit. Power supply is\
    \ a critical element of sensor architecture. It is responsible for supplying\n\
    energy to all other units. It most often corresponds to a battery, feeding the\
    \ sensor, whose limited\nresources make it a problem speciﬁc to this type of network.\
    \ However the recent realization of\nsolar-panel power unit is trying to provide\
    \ a solution for extending sensor life [33].\n•\nMobilizer. Optionally, this is\
    \ used to move the node to complete the task to be processed.\n•\nLocation-Finding\
    \ System. Optionally, this provides information on the location required by the\n\
    application and/or routing.\nFigure 2. Architecture of a wireless sensor.\n2.2.\
    \ Types of WSNs\nDepending on the deployment environment on land, underground,\
    \ or underwater, there are\nseveral types of WSNs [10] (see Figure 3):\n•\nTerrestrial.\
    \ This kind of WSNs is intended to be deployed in a terrestrial space. In these\
    \ networks,\nhundreds of thousands of sensors are deployed randomly or deterministically\
    \ over a given area.\nThis type of WSN is much more useful in the ﬁeld of environmental\
    \ monitoring and natural\nphenomena; however, it represents a challenge for the\
    \ sustainability of the network in terms of\nenergy management [34].\n•\nUnderground.\
    \ These networks consist of very special sensor nodes known for their high cost\n\
    and the logistics necessary for their implementation and maintenance. In this\
    \ type of network,\nthe sensor nodes are installed in the ground. They ﬁnd their\
    \ application in agriculture or in\nmineﬁelds, where they are used to monitor\
    \ conditions in the soil. However, in this type of\nnetwork, there is a ground\
    \ node that has a role in transmitting the information detected by the\nunderground\
    \ nodes to the base station [35].\n•\nUnderwater. This particular type of WSNs\
    \ is networks hidden under the sea. Because of the\nhostility represented by the\
    \ environment of their deployment, this type of network remains an\ninteresting\
    \ research challenge. These nodes are more expensive than terrestrial sensors,\
    \ wireless\ncommunication is acoustic, bandwidth is limited, signal loss is recurrent,\
    \ and propagation delays\nand synchronization problems are frequent [36,37].\n\
    •\nMultimedia. These WSNs are designed to monitor and trace data such as images,\
    \ videos, and\nsound. These sensors are equipped with cameras and microphones.\
    \ This type of network requires\ngood bandwidth and good quality of service, which\
    \ implies high power consumption for data\nprocessing and compression. Preplanning\
    \ is required for the deployment of these sensors [38].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    6 of 34\n•\nMobile. This is the most recent type of WSN, and it uses mobile nodes\
    \ that can autonomously\nreposition and reorganize the network. After initial\
    \ deployment, the nodes disperse to gather\ninformation. There is also a hybrid\
    \ network consisting of a combination of mobile and ﬁxed\nsensors [12,25,26,37,39–42].\n\
    Figure 3. Types of WSNs.\n2.3. Topologies of WSNs\nUsually, an LS-WSN is composed\
    \ of a large number of high-density nodes deployed in a detection\narea, with\
    \ one or more base stations within or near the area. The base station communicates\
    \ with\nthe sensors via requests or commands, and the sensors communicate with\
    \ each other via wireless\ncommunications. They participate in performing data-detecting\
    \ and -sending tasks to the base station.\nIn sensor networks, the energy consumed\
    \ for communication is much higher than that required\nfor detection or computing.\
    \ For example, the transmission of a single bit of data is equivalent to\n800\
    \ instructions [43]. A wireless sensor network can be organized according to different\
    \ topologies,\nincluding star, mesh, and hybrid topologies.\n2.3.1. Star Topology\n\
    In this communication topology, the network consists of a single station that\
    \ can send and/or\nreceive messages from a number of remote sensor nodes. Sensor\
    \ nodes are not allowed to communicate\nwith each other.\nThis topology has the\
    \ advantages of being easy to deploy, and guaranteeing\ncommunication and low\
    \ latency between remote sensor nodes and the base station [44].\n2.3.2. Mesh\
    \ Topology\nThis topology uses a multihop network scheme to cover all connected\
    \ sensor nodes, that is,\nthe signal goes from one sensor node to another until\
    \ it reaches the base station. The communication\nrange of each node is not limited\
    \ by distance; we can, however, add an intermediate sensor node to\nextend it\
    \ [45]. The main advantage of this topology is that it maintains connectivity\
    \ in the network, but\nits major disadvantage lies in the number of jumps that\
    \ increase from one communication to another,\nincreasing energy consumption in\
    \ the network.\n2.3.3. Hybrid Topology\nHybrid topology combines both the star\
    \ and mesh topologies [45]. It provides a robust network\nwith several communication\
    \ functions while keeping sensor energy consumption to a minimum.\nSensors 2018,\
    \ 18, 4474\n7 of 34\nSensor nodes that have higher energy capacities are enabled\
    \ to provide multihop communications,\nwhile low power nodes are disabled.\n2.4.\
    \ WSN Communication\nA sensor node can communicate directly, without detour, thanks\
    \ to single-hop communication\nwith the sink, or using multihop communication,\
    \ passing the information to its neighbors [33].\n2.4.1. One-Hop Communication\n\
    One-hop communications lead to transmissions over long distances resulting in\
    \ a signiﬁcant\nincrease in energy consumption. Figure 4 illustrates this type\
    \ of communication.\nFigure 4. One-hop communication.\n2.4.2. Multihop Communication\n\
    Using multihop communication reduces transmission distance, thus reducing energy\
    \ loss in order\nto increase the service life of the network. In multihop transmissions,\
    \ network architecture plays a\nmajor role. Multihop network architectures are\
    \ typically divided into ﬂat or hierarchical architectures.\nFigure 5 illustrates\
    \ this type of communication.\nFigure 5. Multihop communication.\n2.5. Speciﬁc\
    \ Characteristics of Sensor Networks\nSensor networks have intrinsic characteristics,\
    \ both at the sensor nodes (energy power, processing\ncapacity, storage capacity,\
    \ and reach), and at the level of the network constituted by these sensors\n(bandwidth,\
    \ density, and network topology) [33].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n8 of 34\n2.5.1.\
    \ Sensor-Node Features\nIndividually, sensor nodes have their own characteristics\
    \ that usual sensors do not have. Indeed,\nsensor nodes have energy autonomy,\
    \ and this resource is essential to the survival of a WSN because,\nin most cases,\
    \ the sensor’s battery is irreplaceable.\nIn addition, sensors have limited capacity,\n\
    such as with regard to storage and data processing, as well as narrow sensor transmission\
    \ range.\nHere, we detail the main features. More information is available in\
    \ the literature [22].\n•\nEnergy consumption. Sensors have energy autonomy, and\
    \ they usually use tiny batteries as energy\nresources. In most cases, WSNs are\
    \ deployed in hard-to-reach areas. This makes it difﬁcult or\nalmost impossible\
    \ to recharge or replace the batteries. This difﬁculty leads us to deduce that\
    \ the\nlife of a sensor is essentially dependent on the life of the battery. Therefore,\
    \ energy-consumption\nmanagement is a major constraint in this type of network.\n\
    •\nTransmission scope. This is an important criterion for the deployment of a\
    \ WSN. It is limited\nby the radiation capacity of the antennas used and the signal\
    \ strength involved. For example,\nthe communication between two sensor nodes\
    \ can only take place if the distance between them\nis not too great, i.e., a\
    \ few tens of meters in practice. The longer the distance is, the higher the\n\
    energy cost. This is especially true if there are physical obstacles between the\
    \ two nodes that may\nprevent communication.\n•\nStorage and processing power.\
    \ An intrinsic characteristic of these sensors is their low storage capacity.\n\
    Although they also have a processor, the sensors cannot perform very large operations\
    \ due to\ntheir relatively low processing power. For example, “mote”-type sensor\
    \ nodes are composed of\nan 8-bit 4 MHz microcontroller, 40 KB of memory, and\
    \ a radio with a bit rate of about 10 Kbps.\nThis remains true even for midrange\
    \ nodes, such as “UCLA/ROCKWELL’S WINS”, which have a\nstrong ARM 1100 processor\
    \ with 1 MB ﬂash memory, 128 KB of RAM, and a 100 Kbps radio.\n2.5.2. WSN Features\n\
    In addition to the sensor nodes’ intrinsic characteristics, there are other characteristics\
    \ that are\nrelated to the network: sensor self-conﬁguration, scalability, fault\
    \ tolerance, communication capacity,\nnetwork topology, bandwidth, and density.\n\
    •\nSensor autoconﬁguration. In a WSN, sensors are deployed either in a random\
    \ manner by a missile,\ndrone, or airplane, or manually deployed by a human or\
    \ a robot, inside or around an observed\nphenomenon such as a ﬁeld of war, volcanic\
    \ surface, or sick patient [46]. Thus, each sensor\nnode has the ability, on the\
    \ one hand, to self-conﬁgure in the network, and, on the other hand,\nto collaborate\
    \ with other nodes in order to dynamically reconﬁgure the network in case of\n\
    network-topology changes [41]. As a reminder, each sensor in a WSN has a transmitting/receiving\n\
    unit that allows it to communicate with the sensors that are close to it. By exchanging\
    \ information\nwith them, the sensor can then discover its neighbors and thus\
    \ know the routing method that it\nwill adopt according to the needs of the application.\
    \ Autoconﬁguration appears to be a necessary\nfeature in the case of WSNs since,\
    \ on the one hand, their deployment is done randomly in the\nmajority of applications,\
    \ and, on the other hand, the number of sensors is very high.\n•\nScalability.\
    \ Unlike traditional wireless networks (personal, local, or extended), a WSN consists\
    \ of a\nvery large number of sensors (hundreds or thousands) [33]. The sensor\
    \ network is scalable in that\nit has the ability to accept a large number of\
    \ sensors that work together to achieve a common goal.\n•\nFault tolerance. In\
    \ case of a sensor malfunction (lack of energy, interference with observation\n\
    environment) or if new sensors are added to the network, the existing sensor nodes\
    \ in the WSN\nmust continue to normally operate without interruption [33]. This\
    \ explains the fact that a WSN\ndoes not adopt a ﬁxed but rather dynamic topology.\n\
    •\nCommunication ability. It can take one of two aspects, multihop or one-hop.\
    \ Multihop communication\nis less energy-intensive, and it remains the most sought-after\
    \ type of communication for WSN\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n9 of 34\napplications\
    \ that require low energy consumption. Finally, it should be noted that WSNs use\
    \ a\nnonstandardized protocol stack. However, the majority of scientiﬁc work that\
    \ deals with the WSN\nissue is based on the protocol stack proposed in 2002 by\
    \ Akyildiz et al. [33], which is presented in\nSection 2.6.\n2.6. Protocol Architecture\n\
    The role of the protocol architecture given in Figure 6 is to standardize communication\
    \ between\nnetwork components so that different vendors can develop compatible\
    \ products (software or hardware).\nThis protocol stack combines energy routing\
    \ and management, and integrates the data with the\nnetwork. It communicates efﬁciently\
    \ (in terms of energy) through the wireless medium and promotes\nco-operative\
    \ efforts among sensor nodes [45]. Depending on detection tasks, different types\
    \ of\napplication software can be designed and used in the transport layer. A\
    \ WSN can be seen as a\nseries of connections between sensors that enable them\
    \ to communicate. The content, scope, size,\nspeed, and connectivity of the network\
    \ depend on the set of protocols and their implementation.\nThis includes application,\
    \ transport, network, link, and physical layers, and energy-, mobility-, and\n\
    task-management plans.\n•\nApplication layer. Depending on the functionality of\
    \ the sensors, different applications can be used\nand built on this layer.\n\
    •\nTransport layer. It is used to maintain the ﬂow of data when needed in the\
    \ applications used,\nespecially when connected to the Internet.\n•\nNetwork layer.\
    \ This deals with the routing of data provided by the transport layer.\n•\nData-link\
    \ layer. As the sensor network environment is noisy and nodes can be mobile, the\
    \ MAC\nlayer must ensure low power consumption in the data broadcast of neighboring\
    \ nodes.\n•\nPhysical layer. This deals with data-transmission, -reception, -modulation,\
    \ and -encryption techniques.\n•\nEnergy-, mobility-, and task-management levels\
    \ are responsible for controlling the consumed energy,\nnode movements, and task\
    \ distribution across the entire protocol stacks. These levels allow\nsensors\
    \ to co-ordinate their tasks and minimize energy consumption.\nFigure 6. WSN protocol\
    \ stack [33].\n2.7. Dedicated Applications\nWSNs are in use in many areas, and\
    \ most often with a varied architectural design. Moreover,\nsensor networks correspond\
    \ to speciﬁc types of applications, as can be seen in Figure 7. A 2012\nstudy\
    \ by IDTechEx has reported that the worldwide market for sensor networks is growing,\
    \ and is\nexpected to grow from 0.45 billion to 2 billion between 2012 and 2022.\
    \ We distinguish four types of\nWSN applications [32]: event-driven applications,\
    \ periodic data-collection applications (also called\ntime-driven applications),\
    \ recommended execution applications or query-oriented applications, and\nhybrid\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n10 of 34\nFigure 7. Dedicated WSN applications.\n\
    2.7.1. Event-Driven\nThis type of application is the most representative of WSN\
    \ applications (see Figure 8). As an\nexample, we can mention the detection of\
    \ a forest ﬁre or an earthquake, or the monitoring of the air\nquality in a given\
    \ region. In this class of applications, sensor nodes must be able to detect an\
    \ event\nthat could happen at any time in any location in the area of interest.\
    \ Thus, the sensor nodes must\ncontinuously collect this information and immediately\
    \ react to abrupt changes in the sensed values.\nFor this application category,\
    \ no periodic control is required by the sink, and the data processing by\nthe\
    \ sensor nodes is simple: each node must compare the measured data with a ﬁxed\
    \ critical threshold.\nAs soon as this value exceeds the threshold, the sensor\
    \ node sends the data to the sink. In order to\nprovide better performance, these\
    \ applications must meet certain criteria, such as:\n•\nA high density of sensor\
    \ nodes is required to ensure high probability of event detection. This\nimplies\
    \ that the network must have very good coverage.\n•\nGood coverage of sensor nodes\
    \ that usually depends on the type of event to be detected.\n•\nAn exact location\
    \ of all sensor nodes in the network is required. This is to locate the event\
    \ through\nthe sensor node in which the event occurs. Note that distributed location\
    \ algorithms could be\nused for this purpose.\n•\nGood network connectivity linked\
    \ to transmission coverage so that communication protocols\nallow the alarm sent\
    \ by sensor nodes to arrive at the sink with high probability and in the\nshortest\
    \ time.\nFigure 8. Event-driven applications.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n11 of 34\n\
    2.7.2. Query-Driven\nIn query-oriented applications (see Figure 9), the deployed\
    \ sensor network tracks information\nonly at the explicit request of a base station.\
    \ This category of applications is intended for the speciﬁc\nneeds of the user.\
    \ The latter may seek, for example, to request information speciﬁc to a certain\
    \ region,\nor to interrogate the sensors to acquire measures of interest. Generally\
    \ In this case, the topological\nknowledge of the network and the geographical\
    \ location of the sensors are necessary.\nFigure 9. Query-driven applications.\n\
    2.7.3. Time-Driven\nIn this category, applications aim to periodically evaluate\
    \ the measurements of the given physical\nquantities. Note, for example, the application\
    \ of WSNs in the monitoring of the atmospheric pressure\nof a large area or variations\
    \ in ground temperature at a small volcanic site [47]. These applications react\n\
    in a given period sink. The sensors take a sample of the environment and transmit\
    \ it by means of an\nappropriate communication protocol to the ﬁnal sink. For\
    \ the smooth operation of these applications,\nwith better quality of service,\
    \ it is important: that the sampling frequency is sink-chosen, that the\nconnectivity\
    \ of the network is kept under control, and to have communication protocols adapted\
    \ to\nthat kind of data. The sensor nodes used in this type of application can\
    \ sleep, i.e., turn off their radio\nduring periods of inactivity in order to\
    \ manage the energy consumption of the network.\n2.7.4. Hybrid\nThis category\
    \ of applications group the resulting applications of the two previous categories.\n\
    Examples are home-automation applications, where we can evaluate the temperature\
    \ of a room\n(event-oriented), or/and monitor a newborn (time-driven).\n2.8. WSN\
    \ Application Areas\nThe increasingly smaller size of the sensors, the ever-lower\
    \ cost, the wide range of available sensor\ntypes (thermal, optical, vibration,\
    \ etc.), as well as wireless-communication support, have widely spread\nthe use\
    \ of solutions based on WSNs [33]. Needs in terms of WSNs’ applications are growing\
    \ every day.\nIn 2006, the works of Ekici et al. [48] broke down sensor-network\
    \ applications into four main areas, as\ndescribed in Figure 10: environmental,\
    \ health, security, and other applications. Furthermore, existing\napplications\
    \ are extended in order to facilitate the design of other systems, such as the\
    \ control and\nautomation of industrial production lines.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    12 of 34\nFigure 10. WSN applications.\n2.8.1. Environmental Applications\nNowadays,\
    \ environmental problems, such as ﬂoods, ﬁres, and pollution, are the most recurrent.\n\
    The use of WSNs in environmental applications is becoming increasingly important\
    \ and common, thus\nimproving environmental awareness and the effectiveness of\
    \ control methods [22,47,49]. Therefore,\nWSNs can contribute to the development\
    \ of risk-response systems, natural-disaster detection, energy\nmanagement, and\
    \ other systems. Environmental applications can be broken down into ﬁve classes,\n\
    as shown in Figure 10: weather monitoring, geological monitoring, habitat monitoring,\
    \ pollution\nmonitoring, and energy monitoring.\n2.8.2. Medical Applications\n\
    The health sector is increasingly using WSNs for healthcare needs, such as medical\
    \ treatment,\npre- and posthospital patient surveillance, and rescue operations\
    \ [32]. In addition, sensor networks\ncan help in solving important social problems,\
    \ such as caring for the chronically ill and people with\nintellectual and physical\
    \ disabilities. The ﬁeld of healthcare includes patient follow-ups, invalid\n\
    assistance, life-saving, biosurveillance, and intelligent environments. Furthermore,\
    \ WSNs are used for\nmonitoring physiological measurements [33]. They can also\
    \ be used, for example, to monitor the vital\nfunctions of the elderly or people\
    \ with health problems in order to alert medical devices. Similarly,\nwe can analyze\
    \ different physical measurements collected from athletes, the possibilities offered\
    \ by a\nWSN to lighten data-collection devices.\n2.8.3. Security Applications\n\
    Some institutions can be monitored in real time by WSNs to prevent possible theft\
    \ or ﬁre. Another\nexample is the application of sensor networks in intelligent\
    \ transportation systems for monitoring\nroads or railways to prevent accidents\
    \ [50]. In the military domain, these networks are used for\nsurveillance inside\
    \ and outside the theater of operations and in espionage. In the security ﬁeld,\
    \ sensor\nnetworks can signiﬁcantly contribute to the reduction of ﬁnancial expenses\
    \ dedicated to the security\nof locations and human beings. Thus, the integration\
    \ of sensors in large structures, such as bridges\nor buildings, could help detect\
    \ cracks and alterations in the structure following an earthquake or the\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n13 of 34\naging of the structure. Deploying a motion-sensor\
    \ network can be an alarm system that can detect\nintrusions into a surveillance\
    \ zone [41].\n2.8.4. Other Applications\nOther applications of WSNs include [51,52]\
    \ structural monitoring, construction monitoring and\ncontrol, automobile surveillance,\
    \ trafﬁc monitoring, control of industrial processes, and warehouse\nsurveillance.\
    \ Usually, WSNs are particularly suitable for monitoring critical areas, thanks\
    \ in particular\nto their autonomy and smaller size. In addition, possible applications\
    \ include ﬂood prevention,\nforest-ﬁre detection, and the monitoring of nuclear\
    \ facilities [53]. This type of network opens up new\nopportunities for managing\
    \ the many problems that our present and future cities face, like trafﬁc\ncongestion,\
    \ and energy and waste management.\nMoreover, WSNs provide elements of answers\
    \ to issues that remain relevant. They help ﬁnd\nsolutions for trafﬁc observation\
    \ and the management, especially the management of the trafﬁc lights,\nthe regulation\
    \ of public street lamps, or the monitoring and management of centralized waste\
    \ collection.\nFurthermore, in every-day life, home-automation and smart-building\
    \ applications are particularly\npopular [45]. WSNs in these contexts provide\
    \ innovative solutions for comfort, energy savings, and\nsecurity [54]. For these\
    \ applications, ZigBee alliance technologies offer a complete wireless protocol\n\
    stack for different types of applications.\n2.9. Challenges of WSN Design and\
    \ Deployment\nIn most cases, the deployment of a WSN is closely related to the\
    \ nature of the intended application.\nThere is no generic model for these applications.\
    \ However, several factors inﬂuence WSN design and\ndeployment. The design of\
    \ the WSN must ﬁnd a compromise solution for the following challenges:\n•\nEnergy.\
    \ A sensor node, by its size, is limited in energy resources, storage capacity,\
    \ and processing.\nOne of the most serious concerns is the lifespan of the sensor\
    \ node, which is entirely determined\nby the amount of energy available and the\
    \ rate of energy consumption (that is, the average energy\nconsumption). Since\
    \ improving the energy capacity of small batteries still requires a lot of effort,\n\
    the goal of a long service life is difﬁcult to achieve by increasing the amount\
    \ of available energy.\nAs a result, the design of energy-efﬁcient MAC protocols,\
    \ communication strategies, operating\nsystems, and energy-efﬁcient routing mechanisms\
    \ provides effective ways to extend the life of the\nnode [36]. The use of energy-recovery\
    \ technologies for sensor-node power supplies has also been\nan alternative in\
    \ recent years.\n•\nQuality of Service (QoS). Quality is deﬁned by the ability\
    \ to interpret the information collected\nby the sink. In spite of the fact that\
    \ the QoS requirements vary according to the different\nWSN applications, the\
    \ two main measures of QoS are data reliability and latency [33]. Usually,\na\
    \ successful data-exchange rate between the sensor nodes and the sink must be\
    \ above a certain\nthreshold to ensure network reliability and functionality.\
    \ Reliability can be further maximized, but\nthis could be at the cost of increased\
    \ energy consumption. Therefore, a compromise is necessary.\nIn case of latency,\
    \ for certain types of applications, the reception of the data detected on the\
    \ sink is\nstrictly timed, so that latency data can cause delay problems and lead\
    \ to bad decisions, particularly\nin industrial-surveillance applications.\n•\n\
    Security and privacy. WSNs ﬁnd their applications in various areas of life. Some\
    \ applications\nmanipulate private data. Moreover, WSNs are networks whose topology\
    \ is very frequently subject\nto change. The deployment of sensor nodes is sometimes\
    \ done in accessible areas; they may\nencounter technical interference or human\
    \ intrusion, which can lead to conﬁdentiality issues.\nThus, the network should\
    \ allow the detection of intrusions. It is therefore necessary to design\nrobust\
    \ and lightweight algorithms for data encryption, authentication mechanisms for\
    \ privacy\nprotection, and secure routing for data relays to protect the entire\
    \ network against passive and\nactive attacks, and denials of external service\
    \ providers [55–57].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n14 of 34\n•\nAdaptability. The design\
    \ of a WSN must be sufﬁciently ﬂexible and adaptable to be deployable\nacross\
    \ a wide range of application scenarios. The entire network should be kept functional\n\
    regardless if the number of sensor nodes is hundreds, thousands, or very small.\
    \ Due to the\nmobility of sensor nodes and observed events, as well as the possibility\
    \ that a sensor node can fail\nin the network, the overall topology of the network\
    \ may be subject to frequent change. Therefore,\nthe design of a WSN must be sufﬁciently\
    \ intelligent and robust to deal with these dynamic\ntopology scenarios [10,31].\n\
    •\nLocalization.\nWSNs play an important role in the problem of locating elements\
    \ in a given\ndeployment area. Certainly, GPS is a well-known tracking system\
    \ and the most used location\nsystem. However, it is not satisfactory for this\
    \ use, because it accumulates handicaps. It is only\navailable outdoors and if\
    \ no obstacle obstructs the ﬁeld of view of the receivers. In addition, an\noperation\
    \ under dense foliage or in cities with narrow streets is not possible, which\
    \ are very bad\nconditions. Moreover, it is particularly expensive, both in terms\
    \ of hardware, multiplied to many\ncopies in a network with high sensor density.\
    \ Moreover, signal reception is very energy-greedy,\nwhich is not compatible with\
    \ management problems of battery service life. Location is done in\ntwo steps:\
    \ distance estimation to the other nodes, and triangulation. The development of\
    \ new\nlocalization techniques has become a major concern for WSNs [33,58].\n\
    3. Overview of Big Data\nThis section aims at presenting an overview of the Big\
    \ Data concept by presenting its\ncategorization through the three-V model actually\
    \ extended to ﬁve Vs, with an emphasis on different\ngeneration sources of these\
    \ data. Moreover, a number of technologies on Big Data have been proposed\nin\
    \ both industry and research applications. In view of its characteristics, the\
    \ problem of Big Data\nis different from that of business intelligence, so Big\
    \ Data challenges in the process of extracting\nknowledge from data are studied.\
    \ These challenges are grouped into three phases: storage, processing,\nand exploitation\
    \ of results. Therefore, using LS-WSN to collect, process, and exploit knowledge\n\
    extracted from Big Data is an emerging trend.\nHowever, we must say that the term\
    \ Big Data is still an abstract concept. Sometimes called massive\ndata or metadata,\
    \ Big Data is an increasingly heterogeneous dataset, which is growing in volume\n\
    such that it is difﬁcult to process these data with conventional database-management\
    \ tools [11,13].\nIn this context of data deluge, McKinsey, in its June 2011 publication\
    \ “Big data: the next frontier for\ninnovation, competition, and productivity”\
    \ advocates the new era of Big Data [59]. Unfortunately, Big\nData appeared much\
    \ earlier, more than a decade ago, without being named, with the emergence of\n\
    large data that cannot be processed using traditional techniques [29]. Large IT\
    \ companies, such as\nYahoo and Google, were the ﬁrst to offer their own Big Data\
    \ solutions. They were confronted very\nearly with issues related to the storage\
    \ and processing of large volumes of data. Therefore, Big Data is\na new generation\
    \ of solutions for collection, storage, real-time processing, and data analysis.\n\
    3.1. Characterization of Big Data\nCharacterization of Big Data is generally done\
    \ according to the three Vs: Volume, Variety, and\nVelocity. Other complementary\
    \ Vs are added, such as Value and Veracity.\n3.1.1. Volume\nVolume is certainly\
    \ the one best described by the term Big in “Big Data”. Volume refers to the\n\
    amount of too-large information to be acquired, stored, processed, analyzed, and\
    \ distributed by\nstandard tools. This data volume is constantly growing. With\
    \ the exponential growth in the number\nof electronic smart devices, the world\
    \ is steadily becoming more connected. Moreover, connected\nobjects will continue\
    \ to grow over the coming years. For instance, according to computer company\n\
    IBM, 2.5 exabytes, i.e., 2.5 billion gigabytes, of data were generated every day\
    \ in 2012. This amount of\ndata will reach 500 zettabytes by the end of 2019 [1].\
    \ Furthermore, some analyses report that, in the last\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    15 of 34\ntwo years, about ninety percent of these data has been generated. In\
    \ most cases, most of the generated\ndata come from the digital world. In 2013,\
    \ IBM reported that about 12 terrabytes of tweets were created\neach day, and\
    \ 5.2 billion daily Google searches in 2017. Table 1 highlights the volume of\
    \ data generated\nby the digital sector. Volume is certainly the main criterion\
    \ that comes to mind when we talk about\nBig Data. However, summarizing Big Data\
    \ volume is too simplistic. There are other criteria, such as\nvelocity and variety,\
    \ to characterize Big Data.\nTable 1. Volume of created data (Sources: bloomberg.com,\

    3.1.2. Velocity\nVelocity refers to the dynamic and/or temporal aspect of the\
    \ data, and their update and analysis\ntime. Data are no longer processed and\
    \ analyzed ofﬂine, but in real time or near-real time. They are\nproduced in continuous\
    \ streams, during which real-time decisions can be made. These are the\ndata especially\
    \ from sensors, requiring fast processing for a real-time reaction. In the case\
    \ of such\nhigh-velocity data generating very large volumes, it is no longer possible\
    \ to store them as they are, but\nonly to analyze them in streaming, or even to\
    \ summarize them; for instance, in time-sensitive processes\nlike detecting frauds,\
    \ Big Data must be used as they stream into industries in order to maximize their\n\
    value. The challenge of Big Data applications is to recover data almost instantly,\
    \ process them in real\ntime, and extract useful information.\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n16 of 34\n3.1.3. Variety\nVariety refers to the heterogeneity of formats,\
    \ types, and quality of information. It is linked to\nthe fact that these structured\
    \ and unstructured data can present complex shapes because they have\ntheir origins\
    \ in various and varied sensors (e.g., temperature, wind speed, hydrometry, humidity,\n\
    and brightness), in exchanged messages (e-mails, social media, and exchange of\
    \ images, videos,\nand music), in texts, online publications (e.g., digital libraries,\
    \ websites, and blogs), recordings of\npurchase transactions, planning of scanned\
    \ books, directories, log ﬁles, click streams, and information\nfrom mobile phones.\
    \ Most of these data consist of public or private data, local or remote, shared\
    \ or\nconﬁdential, and complete or incomplete. When analyzing these data types\
    \ together, new insights\nare found.\nThe three Vs are the major features of Big\
    \ Data. A more relevant deﬁnition ofBbig Data could\nthen be: data that are too\
    \ large, too fast, or too broad in variety to directly store in traditional databases\n\
    or processed by current algorithms [60]. The recent literature adds other complementary\
    \ Vs, turning\nBig Data into Smart Data.\n3.2. Toward Smart Data\nRecently, a\
    \ new term has emerged that tends to replace Big Data. This term is Smart Data.\n\
    Why smart? Because not all data in Big Data are good to recover. Smart Data add\
    \ a V to Big data,\nthe Veracity of the data, which is directly related to value.\
    \ Without Veracity and without quality data,\nValue is illusory.\n3.2.1. Veracity\n\
    Completeness Veracity or Validity refers to the quality of the data and/or the\
    \ ethical issues related\nto their use. Not all data are intended to be analyzed.\
    \ We must unload unusable data, called bad data,\nof poor quality for several\
    \ reasons. This understands the problems of outliers or missing values (these\n\
    problems can be solved by the volume of data), but also to the conﬁdence that\
    \ one can have in the data.\nIf there are criteria for qualifying the quality\
    \ of data, in the case of Big Data this quality check is made\ndifﬁcult or impossible\
    \ because of the volume, variety, and velocity speciﬁc to Big Data [61].\n3.2.2.\
    \ Value\nThe complementary V character that is Value refers to the potentiality\
    \ of the data, especially\nin economic terms. It is thus associated with the use\
    \ that can be made of these Big Data and their\nanalysis, especially from an economic\
    \ point of view. In this light, a recent study by Deloitte [62]\nstates that Viability\
    \ is named as the ﬁfth V, and the sum of the ﬁve Vs is likened to Value. Value\
    \ is\nthe criterion resulting from the exploitation of Big Data; how to validate\
    \ useful, reliable and accurate\ndata from many large online datasets? Once done,\
    \ how to extract value? In addition, Big Data is an\ninterdisciplinary issue requiring\
    \ cooperation from academia, industry, and business [63,64].\n3.3. Big Data Generation\n\
    In this section, we explore the main sources of massive data generation. As highlighted\
    \ in\nFigure 11, we have four main sources of Big Data.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    17 of 34\nFigure 11. Taxonomy of Big Data sources.\n3.3.1. Medical and Biomedical\
    \ Data\nThe medical ﬁeld with related services, such as bioinformatics, computer\
    \ clinics, and other\ncomputer- and health-related activities, generate multidimensional\
    \ data, and are a source of Big\nData generation [65]. Examples are genome-related\
    \ clinical projects and real-time health-monitoring\nsystems using wireless sensors.\
    \ These different techniques generate a lot of data. In addition to this,\nmedical-imaging\
    \ software produce large amounts of data, even with more complex features. In\
    \ the\neffort to modernize medical trays, the Swiss government carried out different\
    \ types of projects going\ntoward this direction, so a project named ProteomicsDB\
    \ was launched to handle genes with a size of\n5.17 terabytes [66].\n3.3.2. Internet\
    \ of Things\nThe IoT covers the connection of objects to the Internet through\
    \ sensors to retrieve and exploit\ndata from the physical world. The constant\
    \ evolution of Internet technologies, coupled with the\ncontinuous decline in\
    \ the cost of electronics, has today made it possible to deploy such systems on\
    \ a\nlarge scale. The best deﬁnition of the IoT would be: an open and comprehensive\
    \ network of smart\nobjects that have the ability to self-organize, share information,\
    \ data, and resources, and react to and\nact on situations and changes in the\
    \ environment [67]. The IoT is therefore seen as the next online\nrevolution [60].\n\
    3.3.3. Social Media\nSocial media are one of the main sources of massive data\
    \ generation. Nowadays, social media\nplatforms, such as Facebook, Youtube, Twitter,\
    \ and Instagram, produce large amounts of data.\nFor instance, SocialBlade.com\
    \ reported that Instagram, with 7.1 million active users, has more than\n34.7\
    \ billion shares of active photos, and more than 3.25 billion hours of videos\
    \ are watched in one\nmonth. In the same light, Twitter has 355 million active\
    \ users every month, averaging 665 million tweets\nper day. More than 5 billion\
    \ people worldwide call, text, tweet, and browse on mobile devices [60].\nThe\
    \ number of email accounts created around the world increased from 3.3 billion\
    \ in 2012 to more\nthan 4.3 billion by the end of 2016 at an average annual rate\
    \ of 6% over the four years. In 2012, a total\nof 89 billion emails were sent\
    \ and received daily, and this value is expected to increase. An average\nannual\
    \ rate of 13% over the next four years will exceed 143 billion by the end of 2019\
    \ [68].\n3.3.4. Scientiﬁc Data\nScientiﬁc data are a particular source of generation\
    \ of Big Data. In most cases, scientiﬁc projects\ncarried out in areas such as\
    \ astronomy, earth sciences, and projects related to the study of the\nocean and\
    \ its reconstruction via imagery, are projects generating large quantities of\
    \ data. As an\nexample of the data generated by different scientiﬁc projects,\
    \ 2MASS (both Micron All-Sky Surveys)\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n18 of 34\ngenerates\
    \ 10 terabytes, DPOSS (Le Palomar Digital Sky Survey) generates 3 terabytes, GBT\
    \ (Green\nBank Telescope) produces 20 petabytes, GALEX (The Galaxy Evolution Explorer)\
    \ has 30 terabytes,\nLSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) has more than 200\
    \ petabytes expected, SDSS (Sloan Digital\nSky Survey) produces 40 terabytes,\
    \ SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey has 500 terabytes, Pan STARRS\n(Panoramic Survey\
    \ Telescope and Rapid Response System) has more then 40 petabytes planned, and\n\
    SKA (Square Kilometer Array) has more than 4.6 exabytes expected [68].\n3.4. Areas\
    \ of Utility of Big Data\nBig Data present application perspectives in all activity\
    \ sectors, scientiﬁc, technical, and\nsocioeconomic, from data recovered from\
    \ the operation of aircraft engines to better maintain or\ndesign them, up to\
    \ data for specifying our relationships on social networks that can be used by\
    \ banks\nto estimate the quality of our credit [69]. Figure 12 presents a taxonomy\
    \ of Big Data utility domains.\nFigure 12. Taxonomy of Big Data utility domains.\n\
    3.4.1. Scientiﬁc Research\nIn the scientiﬁc and technical ﬁelds, scientists and\
    \ engineers particularly face Big Data generated\nautomatically by sensors or\
    \ measuring instruments. In medical research, technologies associated with\nBig\
    \ Data have led to spectacular advances in the analysis of the human genome. This\
    \ knowledge of\nthe genome, coupled with others, makes it possible to better understand\
    \ the evolution of pathologies,\nand to improve preventive measures and even care\
    \ protocols.\n3.4.2. Health\nIn the area of health, McKinsey estimates that Big\
    \ Data could save the U.S. healthcare system\nUSD300–450 billion in the Big Data\
    \ revolution in healthcare reports. These savings include prevention,\nwith a\
    \ follow-up of patients to change their habits, diagnosis, helping doctors to\
    \ choose the most\nappropriate treatment, medical staff, determining if a patient\
    \ needs a nurse, a general practitioner, or\na specialist, cost control both by\
    \ automating the reimbursement procedures and by detecting fraud,\nand ﬁnally\
    \ innovation through multiple contributions of intensive computing to the understanding\
    \ of\nliving and the improvement of treatments. Similarly, thanks to Big Data,\
    \ it is possible to better prevent\ncertain diseases or epidemics, or improve\
    \ the treatment of patients.\n3.4.3. Socioeconomic and Political Domain\nIn the\
    \ socioeconomic ﬁeld, Big Data in general can be used to simplify or adapt offered\
    \ services\nby better listening to users and understanding how they use these\
    \ services [70]. For instance, Google\nAnalytics offers companies, as well as\
    \ public administrations, the opportunity to improve their website\ndesign by\
    \ analyzing Internet user visits. Moreover, in education, with distance education\
    \ such as the\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n19 of 34\nMassive Open Online Course (MOOC),\
    \ the Big Data treatment is used to analyze student activities,\nincluding spent\
    \ time, how to follow the programs, stop and return in pedagogical videos, and\
    \ parallel\nInternet searches, to improve teaching methods.\n3.4.4. Transport\
    \ and Energy Domain\nIn the ﬁeld of transport, population movements can be modeled\
    \ to adapt infrastructure and\nservices such as train schedules. For this purpose,\
    \ data from transit passengers, bicycles, and shared\ncars, as well as from the\
    \ geolocation of people or cars, are used, such as cellular data and satellite\n\
    tracking systems. In the ﬁeld of energy and sustainable development, smart metering\
    \ systems\n(electricity, gas, water) generate Big Data that can rationalize energy\
    \ consumption [71]. In addition\nto offering citizens the opportunity to better\
    \ control their consumption, these meters allow remotely\ncutting, with the agreement\
    \ of customers, the supply of equipment to avoid overloading the network.\nIn\
    \ air transport, by combining sensor data on airplanes with weather data, air\
    \ corridors can be modiﬁed\nto save fuel, improve aircraft design, maintenance,\
    \ or safety [72].\n3.5. Big Data Challenges\nThis section presents the challenges\
    \ to overcome in order to take advantage of the exciting\nopportunities offered\
    \ by the advent of Big Data in various business sectors. The different challenges\n\
    of exploiting Big Data (see Figure 13) are categorized according to the three\
    \ phases of the process of\nextracting knowledge from data: data acquisition,\
    \ processing, and exploitation of results.\nFigure 13. Big Data challenges.\n\
    3.5.1. Data Acquisition and Storage\nData acquisition refers to data acquisition,\
    \ storage, and preprocessing. Big Data are produced\ncontinuously, and volume\
    \ is growing at an exponential rate. At this speed, the acquisition of these data\n\
    is a real challenge for researchers and industrialists. Indeed, the nature of\
    \ Big Data already presents\nseveral challenges [73]:\n•\nHeterogeneity. In general,\
    \ data-mining algorithms and machine learning expect homogeneous\ndata, and cannot\
    \ understand the ﬁne distinction between them. IT systems work the fastest if\
    \ they\ncan store multiple items that are the same size and structure. Thus, Big\
    \ Data must be carefully\nstructured as a ﬁrst step in their acquisition process\
    \ [74].\n•\nScale. The ﬁrst thing everyone thinks about Big Data is size. The\
    \ management of large volumes\nof data and high growth has been a major problem\
    \ for many decades. The volume of data is\nincreasing faster than IT resources.\
    \ Unfortunately, parallel data-processing techniques that were\nuseful in the\
    \ past for processing data between nodes do not apply directly to intranode parallelism,\n\
    since the architecture is very different.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n20 of 34\n\
    •\nDelay. The larger the dataset to be processed is, the longer it takes to analyze\
    \ it. Designing a\nsystem that effectively treats size is also likely to result\
    \ in a system capable to more quickly process\na given dataset size. However,\
    \ it is not only this speed that is generally heard when we talk\nabout Velocity\
    \ in the context of Big Data [75]. There are many situations in which the result\
    \ of the\nanalysis is immediately required. Given a broad dataset, it is often\
    \ essential to ﬁnd elements that\nmeet a speciﬁc criterion. The analysis of all\
    \ the data to ﬁnd the appropriate elements is obviously\nimpracticable [76].\n\
    •\nPrivacy and Security. One of the key value propositions of Big Data is access\
    \ to data from multiple\nand diverse domains. Security and privacy play a very\
    \ important role in Big Data research and\ntechnology. In areas such as social\
    \ media and health information, more data are collected on\nindividuals. It is\
    \ therefore feared that some organizations will know too much about individuals,\n\
    developing algorithms that randomize personal data into a large dataset problem\
    \ [77].\nIn terms of data storage, relational databases remain the reference,\
    \ but these systems ﬁnd their\nlimit against Big Data. These widely used tools\
    \ guarantee the maintenance of ACID (Atomicity,\nCoherence, Isolation, and Durability)\
    \ properties. The management of large volumes of data, especially\nin the context\
    \ of data warehouses, always faithful to the relational model, solutions like\
    \ Teradata rely\non the distribution of data on different disks, allowing a parallelization\
    \ of query execution. However,\nthese solutions do not allow massive data management\
    \ beyond a certain volume. Thus, different\nnew solutions have emerged. All of\
    \ these solutions rely on the distributed (partitioned) storage of\ncluster data.\
    \ Given that Brewer’s theorem is quite easily proven, no distributed system can\
    \ ensure\nconsistency, availability, and the possibility of being partitioned.\
    \ The consequence is that, in these new\nstorage solutions, it is not possible\
    \ to provide the ACID properties, and a loosening of these properties\nis necessary.\n\
    3.5.2. Data Processing\nThis treatment refers to all techniques and methods dedicated\
    \ to the exploitation of Big Data.\nThe data must be presented in a suitable format\
    \ in order to be used as input to generic data-processing\nalgorithms. The challenge\
    \ of Big Data processing is to be able to propose methods and techniques\nto manage\
    \ the complex nature of these data (Velocity, Volume, and Variety) [68], and,\
    \ in most\ncases, the treatment process. Massive data are performed in a distributed\
    \ environment. Traditional\ndata-processing methods are not suited to the context\
    \ of Big Data. The design of new methods or\nthe adaptation of existing methods\
    \ for the processing of these data in the context of a distributed\nenvironment\
    \ remains a topical research issue.\nHowever, the use of distributed data-analysis\
    \ algorithms, including search, learning, decision\nsupport, and visualization,\
    \ requires the rewriting of existing algorithms or the adaptation of Big\nData\
    \ to the data-input format of existing algorithms in a distributed context, but\
    \ also to use speciﬁc\nhardware environments to run them in distributed mode,\
    \ for example, multicore and many-core\nmachines, or computing grids. The current\
    \ limits to the distribution of Big Data analysis algorithms,\nanalysis is taken\
    \ here in a broad sense, including search, learning, decision support, and visualization,\n\
    resides as much in algorithmic difﬁculty as in the hardware architecture of execution.\
    \ Thus, most\nsearch algorithms are not easily distributed, and not necessarily\
    \ with a MapReduce approach, and it is\nsometimes necessary to ﬁnd new techniques\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient parallelization [78].\nAlthough sensors are limited in terms\
    \ of resources due to the fact that they are equipped with an\nintelligence allowing\
    \ them to collaborate to carry out a task, sensor networks can be an interesting\n\
    means for capturing and managing Big Data.\n4. Big Data Collection in LS-WSNs\n\
    The collection of data by a WSN is based on a well-deﬁned architecture. The real\
    \ problem lies\nin choosing an optimal architecture. In this section, we present\
    \ the different architectures proposed\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n21 of 34\nin the\
    \ literature in order to detect those that are compatible with large-scale WSNs.\
    \ The work of\nReferences [25,32,33,41,45,79] proposed several network architectures\
    \ dedicated to data collection.\nThese architectures are built around two main\
    \ approaches: one based on a static network, and the\nother on network mobility.\
    \ Figure 14 presents the different data-collection architectures proposed in\n\
    the literature.\nFigure 14. Different architectures of WSNs.\n4.1. Static Architectures\n\
    This is the classical approach encountered in the literature. It consists of deploying\
    \ a set of sensors\nin an area of interest in order to gather information. In\
    \ this architecture, all network components are\nstatic. On the other hand, the\
    \ deployment of the network can be achieved in two ways: deterministic\nor random.\n\
    4.1.1. Static-Sink and Static-Sensor Architecture\nThis architecture consists\
    \ of a large number of sensors capable of collecting and transmitting\nenvironmental\
    \ data in an autonomous way. The position of these sensor nodes is not necessarily\n\
    predetermined. They can be randomly dispersed across the area of interest. This\
    \ type of architecture\nis characterized by a high density in order to ﬁnd at\
    \ least one path between any two network nodes.\nMoreover, one of the major drawbacks\
    \ of this architecture is that it shortens the lifetime of the\nnetwork. The authors\
    \ in References [25,80–82] reported a problem of rapid depletion of batteries\
    \ from\nneighboring sensor nodes to the sink. The relay of data from the source\
    \ sensor to the sink is the source\nof the network’s nonuniform energy consumption.\
    \ Thus, neighboring sensor nodes at the sink, being\nthe most requested in the\
    \ data transfer to the sink, quickly exhaust their energies, and the sink, in\
    \ turn,\nis out of order. This fact reduces the lifetime of the network. For instance,\
    \ applications that use this\ntype of architecture include the VOLCANO [47], GLACSWEB\
    \ [83], and the Habitat Monitoring on\nGDI (Great Duck Island) projects [84].\n\
    4.1.2. Architecture with Sensor Nodes and Several Static Sinks\nUnlike the previous\
    \ architecture, the architecture with sensor nodes and several static sinks\n\
    (see Figure 15) consists of multiplying the number of sinks in the network in\
    \ order to increase the\nlifetime of the network. However, the problem of battery\
    \ depletion of the sensor nodes lying at a jump\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n22 of\
    \ 34\nfrom the sinks remains. Sensor nodes of this architecture, the choice of\
    \ one sink compared to another,\nremain a challenge in this kind of architecture\
    \ [85].\nFigure 15. Architecture with sensor nodes and several static sinks.\n\
    4.2. Architecture Based on Mobility\nIn order to maximize network lifetime and\
    \ reduce latency in WSNs, several works [48,86–88]\nhave introduced mobility into\
    \ WSNs. Mobility in WSNs is useful since it has a number of advantages\nthat include\
    \ good connectivity, reduced deployment cost, reliability, and energy efﬁciency\
    \ [84,89–91].\nAlthough mobility brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of increased\
    \ network lifetime, it presents\nseveral challenges for sensor networks. These\
    \ challenges (see Figure 16) are, among others, contact\ndetection, mobility-oriented\
    \ power management, reliable data transfer, QoS, location, and energy\nconsumption\
    \ [92–94].\nFigure 16. Challenges of mobility in a WSN.\nDifferent kinds of mobility\
    \ in WSNs have been proposed: static-sink architecture and moving\nsensor nodes,\
    \ architectures with mobile and static-sink sensor nodes, architectures with mobile\
    \ sinks\nand mobile sensor nodes, architectures with sensors, and multiple static-sink\
    \ architectures with sensors\nand multiple mobile sink and hybrid architectures.\n\
    4.2.1. Static Sink Architecture and Moving Sensor Nodes\nThis architecture has\
    \ the particularity that the sensors are mobile. This approach has been the\n\
    subject of much work in recent years [48,86–88]. By the fact that the sensors\
    \ are mobile, this architecture\nconsiderably reduces the number of sensors to\
    \ deploy. Communication in this architecture is direct.\nThis architecture helps\
    \ maintain good network coverage. Moreover, this architecture allows a balanced\n\
    consumption of energy at the sensor level, and the amount of data collected by\
    \ the sink is signiﬁcant.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n23 of 34\nFor instance, these\
    \ projects use this architecture in which sensor nodes move while the sink is\
    \ ﬁxed:\nthe COW project [95] and the CENWITS project [96].\n4.2.2. Architecture\
    \ with a Mobile Sink and Static Sensor Nodes\nUnlike the previous architecture,\
    \ all nodes are static and the sink is mobile here. Data collection\nis done once\
    \ the sink reaches a given sensor node and that sensor detects the presence of\
    \ the sink.\nThis architecture poses the problem of detection of the sink by the\
    \ sensor nodes. However, it represents\nan interesting solution, consisting of\
    \ using mobile agents to collect data gathered by the sensors.\nAkyildiz et al.\
    \ (2002) [33] as well as Jain et al. (2006) [42] reported that mobile agents called\
    \ MULEs\n(Mobile Ubiquitous LAN Extensions), mobile sinks, or mobile data collectors\
    \ move in a random or\ncontrolled way to collect data accumulated at the sensors\
    \ [26,97]. Data collection is done with the\napproach of the mobile agents of\
    \ the ﬁxed sensor nodes. These mobile agents can be humans, robots,\nanimals,\
    \ or vehicles. This architecture has the advantage of relaxing the constraint\
    \ of high densities in\nfavor of better connectivity to the WSN deployed in an\
    \ area of interest. Thus, such a WSN architecture\nhas the advantage of avoiding\
    \ collusion and loss of data induced by networks of wireless sensors with\nhigh\
    \ density of nodes as in References [41,79].\n4.2.3. Architecture with a Mobile\
    \ Sink and Mobile Sensor Nodes\nIn this architecture, mobility is considered at\
    \ the level of the sensor nodes as well as at the level of\nthe sinks. This architecture\
    \ has the same advantages as those of the mobile sink and the static sensor\n\
    node architectures. This architecture has been implemented in several scientiﬁc\
    \ and industrial research\nprojects. For instance, this architecture was implemented\
    \ as part of a zebra tracking project in Kenya;\nthe sensors were deployed on\
    \ zebras from Sweetwaters Reserve to Mpala in central Kenya, and the\nsink was\
    \ positioned on a vehicle. This project was one of the ﬁrst studies carried out\
    \ in the ﬁeld of\nenvironmental monitoring that simultaneously took into account\
    \ the mobility of nodes and sink. As a\ntype of application using this type of\
    \ architecture, we obviously mention this zebra tracking project\n(ZebraNet) [84].\n\
    4.2.4. Architecture with Sensors and Multiple Static Sinks\nThis architecture\
    \ differs from all architectures presented so far. It consists of using several\
    \ sinks\nwith a high density of sensor nodes. The data collected by the sensor\
    \ nodes are transmitted to the\nend users via one of the network sinks. The big\
    \ problem with this architecture lies in the difﬁculty of\nchoosing the sink.\
    \ One can also perceive the complexity of such a solution in Reference [81], which\n\
    proposes a routing optimization solution in a multi-to-many architecture. This\
    \ proposal also suffers\nfrom the clear problem of a lack of evolution. Indeed\
    \ if the sensor network grows, so as not to fall back\ninto the same problems\
    \ as a single-sink architecture, we would have to add sinks, which cannot be\n\
    done automatically. In addition, this solution still does not allow a direct connection\
    \ between the end\nuser and the sensor nodes.\n4.2.5. Architecture with Sensors\
    \ and Multiple Mobile Sinks\nThis strategy is almost identical to the previous\
    \ one, with the difference here being that the\nsinks are mobile. This solution\
    \ consists of placing a plurality of mobile sinks in a single WSN [98,99].\nAn\
    \ important problem with this solution is the difﬁculty of routing the data collected\
    \ by the sensors.\nJuang et al. (2002) [84] tried to solve this by proposing a\
    \ solution to optimize routing.\n4.2.6. Hybrid Architectures\nThere are also solutions\
    \ with a multisink architecture. The lifetime of the WSN could be signiﬁcant\n\
    when using multiple mobile receivers instead of static receivers in data collection.\
    \ Other works, with\nseveral mobile sinks, focused on reducing the energy consumed\
    \ by sensors, or to maximize the lifetime\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n24 of 34\n\
    of the global network. These proposals often come from a lack of scalability.\
    \ Indeed, if the size of the\nsensor network increases, it is to avoid the problems\
    \ of an architecture with a single sink, which can\nnot be done automatically.\
    \ Moreover, this solution does not allow a direct connection between the user\n\
    and the sensor.\n4.3. Comparison of Data-Collection Architectures in the Context\
    \ of LS-WSNs\nThe different architectures analyzed in this section each have advantages\
    \ and disadvantages,\nthe main reason being that the design of these architectures\
    \ is determined by the goals that we set.\nOtherwise, in the context of LS-WSNs,\
    \ the density of sensors deployed in a vast ﬁeld of interest is\nhigh. This makes\
    \ us say that even if mobility brings more advantages than inconveniences to the\n\
    sensor networks, if this mobility is on the side of the sensor nodes, it would\
    \ reduce the number of\nnodes to deploy. We can therefore say that these kinds\
    \ of architecture are not suitable for LS-WSNs.\nRegardless of what the sensor\
    \ and static-sink networks consume in terms of energy, they are adapted\nas the\
    \ network scales up. The real challenge remains the optimization of energy consumption\
    \ in this\nnetwork. For this, the different techniques used in the context of\

    \ by the nodes must be transferred to a collection point in the network called\
    \ a\nsink. Routing is the process of ﬁnding a cost-effective route in terms of\
    \ power consumption in order\nto transfer the data from the sensor nodes to the\
    \ sink. The sink can be connected to a remote user\nvia Wimax, LTE, a satellite,\
    \ or another wide transmission system. The user can address requests to\nother\
    \ nodes in the network, specifying the type of required data and harvesting them\
    \ through the sink\nnode. Routing in LS-WSNs remain a very active area of research,\
    \ and several routing protocols have\nbeen proposed [12,36,100,103,105–108]. Recently,\
    \ routing protocols for WSNs have been the subject of\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    25 of 34\nseveral studies, and various studies have been published. These protocols\
    \ can be classiﬁed according\nto two main axes [45,79]: the structure of the network\
    \ and the type of operation to be performed\n(see Figure 17).\nFigure 17. Taxonomy\
    \ of routing protocols in WSNs.\n5.1. Network Structure-Based Routing Protocols\n\
    Routing protocols are distributed according to network structure, which plays\
    \ a very important\nrole in the data-routing process. There are three main categories\
    \ of protocols based on network\nstructure. These protocols are:\n•\nFlat routing.\
    \ Called ‘data centric’ as well, all sensor nodes here have the same tasks to\
    \ perform.\nThis is the ﬁrst approach used in the routing of data in the WSN.\
    \ It is based on the collaboration\nof all the nodes of the network. Data properties\
    \ are speciﬁed by a naming system by attribute\n(attribute, value) because of\
    \ the difﬁculty of assigning a global identiﬁer to each node given their\nlarge\
    \ number. Among their advantages is their simplicity, hence the possibility of\
    \ establishing\ncommunications at no additional cost where each node would only\
    \ need information from its\ndirect neighbors. The disadvantage is the depletion\
    \ of the energy resources of the nodes close to\nthe base station because all\
    \ trafﬁc toward the latter obligatorily passes by them.\n•\nHierarchical routing.\
    \ This approach is based on the formation of clusters (common areas) [36,85,100].\n\
    The principle is to route the data collected by each node of the cluster to its\
    \ head of area, the Cluster\nHead (CH), which, after processing their common parts,\
    \ forwards them to the next destination\n(If the CH cannot directly reach the\
    \ station, basic information is routed to the next zone leader).\nThe advantage\
    \ is the reduction of communication and energy costs by minimizing the number\n\
    of messages circulating on the network, since CHs apply aggregate functions on\
    \ the data of the\ncluster, which makes it possible to combine them. The disadvantage\
    \ concerns the size of the\nnetwork. In addition, as network size increases, the\
    \ CH election process becomes critical and\ngreedy in resources.\n•\nLocation-Based\
    \ Routing. The identiﬁcation of the geographic locations of the sensor nodes on\n\
    the gathering area is of paramount importance for the data-routing mechanisms\
    \ in the WSN.\nThis location information allows the calculation of sensor positions\
    \ and the distances between\nthem to build the shortest paths between a source\
    \ node and its destination. This routing approach\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n26\
    \ of 34\nis more energy-efﬁcient because it dispenses sensor nodes from using\
    \ random or probabilistic\nmethods to search for routes [109,110]. In addition,\
    \ the location of the nodes (and consequently\nof their regions) makes it possible\
    \ to only broadcast requests to these regions and to avoid their\ndiffusion in\
    \ broadcast mode (global diffusion to all the nodes), thus signiﬁcantly reducing\
    \ the\nnumber of transmissions. The disadvantage is the need to equip sensor nodes\
    \ with a satellite\ntracking system, such as GPS, which consumes a lot of energy.\n\
    5.2. Feature-Based Routing Protocols\nIn this section, routing protocols are categorized\
    \ according to the features they implement.\nThese features are based on data\
    \ routing, route selection, route discovery, and alternating routes.\n•\nRouting\
    \ protocols based on data routing. In this kind of protocol, each sensor node\
    \ must choose a\nnode of its neighborhood to deliver it the task of conveying\
    \ these data. This decision is made\nusing different techniques, including table-based\
    \ routing, broadcasting, and ﬁltering by neighbors,\nor ﬂooding.\n•\nRouting protocols\
    \ based on route selection. Route selection is the process of choosing the best\
    \ route to\na sink from the potential routes depending on the constraints of the\
    \ network and the sensor nodes.\nAlthough most protocols only choose a better\
    \ route (single-path routing), multipath protocols\nselect and save more than\
    \ one path for different purposes, such as energy, trafﬁc balance, reliability,\n\
    and robustness. The entities involved in the selection process may include the\
    \ source sensor node,\nthe intermediate nodes, or the sink node.\n•\nRouting protocols\
    \ based on route discovery. Each sensor node of a WSN acts as a router and\nparticipates\
    \ in the routing of data to the sink. Many debates and works have discussed when\
    \ and\nhow many routes each node must maintain in its routing table. Indeed, a\
    \ node must memorize\nthe roads to reach a sink, or only search and keep track\
    \ of roads when it has an interest in reaching\nthe sink. As a result, three types\
    \ of routing protocols are distinguished depending on how routes\nare maintained\
    \ in the routing tables. Route discovery is categorized into proactive, reactive,\
    \ and\nhybrid routing protocols.\n•\nRouting protocols based on alternating routes.\
    \ In a WSN, from a sensor node, a routing protocol can\nmaintain a single path\
    \ that allows it to reach a sink. It can also maintain multiple paths to reach\
    \ a\nsingle destination. We distinguish two classes of protocols: single path\
    \ and multiple paths.\n5.3. Data-Collection Steps in LS-WSNs\nThe ﬂowchart given\
    \ in Figure 18 summarizes the major steps of data collection in LS-WSNs.\nAccording\
    \ to application areas of sensor networks, the issue of deploying large-scale\
    \ sensor networks\nfor coverage purposes can be categorized into area-based coverage\
    \ deployment that requires sensors\nto be deployed in the whole ﬁeld, and location-based\
    \ coverage deployment that requires sensors to be\ndeployed in speciﬁc locations\
    \ [111]. The diffusion of control messages is commonly done by ﬂooding\n(and controlled-ﬂooding)\
    \ methods and gossiping methods [36]. Finally, the data-transferring step\nrelies\
    \ on knowledge recorded by the control message dissemination step to achieve data\
    \ collection by\nadopting either ﬂat-routing, hierarchical-routing, or location-based-routing\
    \ schemes.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n27 of 34\nFigure 18. Flowchart of data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs.\n6. Challenges of Big Data Collection in LS-WSNs\nWith increasingly\
    \ miniaturized and integrated sensors, a new paradigm of sensor networks is\n\
    emerging in LS-WSNs. These networks are based on the cooperation of a set of nodes\
    \ to perform\nvarious operations, such as monitoring and data collection, on the\
    \ environment in which they are\ndeployed. The term ‘large-scale’ refers to the\
    \ fact that these are networks deployed over a large area\nwith high sensor density.\
    \ Consequently, all techniques and methods that can be used in so-called small\n\
    WSNs cannot be directly used on these networks. They must undergo a modiﬁcation\
    \ to adapt to the\nextension of the network range. In general, a sensor is a resource-limited\
    \ device whose energy resources\nand sensors are deployed in most cases in hard-to-reach\
    \ areas, making it difﬁcult or impossible to\nchange the batteries. The management\
    \ of energy resources is a strategic issue to increase the duration\nof a sensor\
    \ network [24,46,108].\nEven though WSNs have been used in a number of applications,\
    \ data collection is the main\nactivity of WSNs, whether LS-WSNs or not. For researchers,\
    \ this operation consists of ﬁnding solutions\nto maximize data collection, and\
    \ for others to minimize the energy consumption at the level of the\nsensors.\
    \ In the literature [33,45], it appears that of all the basic functions of a sensor,\
    \ communication is\nthe most energy-consuming activity. This energy consumption\
    \ largely depends on communication\ndistance. Indeed, to reduce this consumption\
    \ and extend the life of the sensors, and therefore that\nof the network, several\
    \ techniques and methods have been developed in recent years. In most cases,\n\
    these methods relax several constraints, such as latency, coverage, and QoS, as\
    \ well as the Quality of\nExperience (QoE) of the network in favor of extending\
    \ network lifetime.\nIn addition, the requirements speciﬁed by data-collection\
    \ applications in LS-WSNs also lead to a\nnumber of issues that need to be considered.\
    \ Among them, WSN coverage is an essential issue in sensor\nnetwork deployment,\
    \ which must make sure that sensors deployment in a given area of interest may\n\
    need to allow an acceptable coverage, especially for certain WSNs’ applications.\
    \ Moreover, in certain\ncases, sensors should be located in particular locations\
    \ in order to more accurately gather data. This fact\nis important for industrial\
    \ 3D sensor networks or sensors deployed in aircrafts [112,113]. Furthermore,\n\
    the way and rate of acquiring data cannot be the same for different kinds of data,\
    \ such as vibration,\ntemperature, movement, and humidity [10,114,115]. These\
    \ issues, if not handled well, lead to an\nunbalanced energy consumption resulting\
    \ to power wastage and a short network lifetime. Otherwise,\ndelivering data to\
    \ the base station while minimizing the rate of data loss is also a challenge.\
    \ Some\nworks focus on network structuring and data aggregation [36,80,100,109,116,117],\
    \ while others rely on\nrouting techniques to reduce the energy consumption of\
    \ sensor nodes [12,46,103,118,119]. However,\noperations like data aggregation,\
    \ compression, and fusion remain difﬁcult to apply in the case of large\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n28 of 34\namounts of structured or unstructured data. It is,\
    \ therefore, necessary to develop novel schemes for\ndata collection in LS-WSNs.\n\
    Moreover, in terms of network structuring, hierarchical networks coupled with\
    \ clustering\ntechniques based on multihop communication seem to be the appropriate\
    \ solution for LS-WSNs.\nThese techniques reduce intranode transmission distance\
    \ in the routing of the collected data. This is\neconomical in terms of energy\
    \ consumption compared to direct communication, that is to say, that\neach sensor\
    \ node directly routes these data to the sink without a relay. In contrast, clustering\
    \ results\nin higher latency than in ﬂat structuring [120,121]. In addition, in\
    \ this type of architecture, the most\ncommon problem is called the access point\
    \ problem [122], that is to say, that sensor nodes that are\nin proximity to the\
    \ sink are rapidly depleting their energy compared to other sensor nodes. This\
    \ is\njustiﬁed by the high concentration of data trafﬁc to the sink. Thus, network\
    \ coverage rate is affected,\nwith an increased risk of sink disconnection.\n\
    Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of multihop communication, other works\
    \ propose\nto multiply the number of sinks within a network. Thus, a WSN can have\
    \ several static sinks [120].\nIn this architecture, in general, these sinks have\
    \ more hardware resources compared to other sensor\nnodes [94]. They are used\
    \ to collect data from other sensor nodes, and to reduce the energy consumed\n\
    in transmissions [120]. The data are then sent from the sinks to the end user\
    \ via an Internet or satellite\nconnection [94]. In this approach, the problem\
    \ is the choice of a sink compared to others. Thus, in most\njobs, metrics such\
    \ as distance are used to determine which sink is closest to the sensor node to\
    \ which\nthe data will be sent. However, the issue of the optimal deployment of\
    \ sinks remains a big problem,\nbecause it is difﬁcult to choose the right place\
    \ to deploy the sinks in order to balance the exchanges\nbetween nodes and sinks\
    \ [102,122]. Even though static sinks are deployed in optimal locations, we still\n\
    have the access point problem, which is that the nodes near the sinks consume\
    \ more power. Sinks can\nbe disconnected from the rest of the network if the surrounding\
    \ nodes exhaust their battery. Thus,\nthe optimal position of the sinks ensures\
    \ good coverage of the area of interest, but not permanent\ncoverage [93].\nAnother\
    \ study [81] proposed an approach based on sink mobility.\nIn addition to saving\n\
    energy consumption at the sensor level of sink mobility, it also satisfactorily\
    \ reduces increased data\nlatency [15,24,40]. By choosing to organize the cluster\
    \ network, this reduces the time spent in the\nsensor nodes and therefore increases\
    \ the frequency of its visits to the cluster heads. In addition, using\na method\
    \ called service cycle can further reduce power consumption [102,122].\nFurthermore,\
    \ the problem of storing and computing very large amounts of collected data from\n\
    LS-WSNs needs more attention. In this light, some companies, such as Nokia and\
    \ Apple, integrate\na number of sensors in their mobile phones and other smart\
    \ devices on the Internet. This leads to\nthe collection of petabytes of data\
    \ each year. Certainly, some distributed database solutions, such as\nGoogle’s\
    \ Bigtable, Amazon’s Dynamo, Windows’ Azure Storage, and Apache Hadoop, can achieve\n\
    the storage of such large amounts of data. However, unless these Big Data are\
    \ associated with\nprogramming models, such as Mapreduce, the existing distributed\
    \ database solutions cannot process\nthe large amount of data generated by sensors\
    \ from LS-WSNs. Unfortunately, a number of works are\nfocused on sensors’ interconnection\
    \ and power-efﬁcient WSNs [21,36,121]. In spite of the number of\ninteresting\
    \ challenges that should be addressed in sensor networks, large amounts of data\
    \ collection,\nstorage, and processing schemes in LS-WSNs should be developed.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nThe application prospects of WSNs are rich and varied. The use\
    \ of these networks in the context\nof Big Data shows the ability of these networks\
    \ to overcome inherent constraints to meet certain\nrequirements. In Big Data,\
    \ we expect a heterogeneous dataset that is continuously produced by the\nIoT\
    \ to such an extent that it cannot be captured, managed, and processed by traditional\
    \ systems. Such\ndata, given their characteristics, are an interesting challenge\
    \ for their acquisition and processing by\nLS-WSNs. In this paper, we conducted\
    \ a comprehensive review that proposes a better approach to\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n29 of 34\nthe collection of Big Data. Thus, in this context, to better\
    \ address the issue of collecting Big Data, we\nﬁrst presented horizontal overviews\
    \ of WSNs and Big Data. Then, we reviewed Big Data collection\narchitectures,\
    \ as well as data-transferring schemes. Moreover, the challenges of Big Data collection\n\
    in LS-WSNs have been discussed. From the systematic analysis of standpoints of\
    \ various authors\nregarding Big Data collection in LS-WSNs, we provided a detailed\
    \ review of the open issues with their\nassociated challenges in order to motivate\
    \ and guide future researchers.\nFunding: This research was funded by PHC-Tassili,\

    maturity of wireless technologies and the growing popularity of sensor technology
    in our daily life have created fascinating possibilities in the field of Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN). One of the most critical fields of WSN is how effective
    is the data collection model in such a network. The goal is to ensure data collection
    consistency and reliability while attempting to conserve the power consumption
    within the network. We are proposing a balanced data collection model that can
    be setup on random or controlled WSN deployment that can meet different levels
    of reliability requirements while balancing power consumption across the network.
    The proposed model utilizes an optimization heuristic to achieve a set of system-defined
    goals. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Wireless Sensor

    Abstract

    Kenya is a developing country with a population of 47,213,282 people this

    comprises of 56% low-income earners. Small businesses and crop production

    represent 23% of the income within the country, which is at risk as soils become

    less productive. Various factors have led to this, climate change and land overuse

    being leading causes. Without adaptation, the rural to urban migration will

    continue to increase.

    Through Internet of Things (IoT) and speciﬁcally wireless sensor networks,

    we can change how we obtain and consume information. Small-scale farmers can

    collect data and in exchange receive useful information about their soils, temper-

    ature, humidity, and moisture content hence make better choices during crop

    production. Connected end devices bring in data, which is currently sparse in

    relation to small-scale farming. IoT will enable analysis and informed

    decision-making including crop selection, support equipment, fertilizers, irriga-

    tion, and harvesting. The cloud-based analysis will provide information useful
    for

    policy making and improvement.

    This chapter presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) in mesh topography

    using XBee communication module, communication, and raspberry pi, combined

    with a cloud-based data storage and analysis. We successfully set up a proof of

    concept to test a sensor node that sends information to a RPi and onto an online

    visualization platform.

    Introduction: Background on Kitui County, Kenya

    Kitui County is one of Kenya’s 47 counties located in the lower eastern region
    of the

    country. The county has eight subcounties, namely, Kitui Central, Kitui South,
    Kitui

    East, Kitui Rural, Kitui West, Mwingi North, Mwingi West, and Mwingi Central.

    There are three livelihood zones in the county, marginal mixed farming, mixed

    farming livelihood zone, and formal employment, contributing 44%, 52%, and 4%

    of the population, respectively. The county has a population of 1,136,187 (Kenya

    National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) 2019) people and covers an area of 30,570

    square kilometers, of which 6,370 square kilometers is covered by Tsavo National

    Park (Magee et al. 2017). A large part of this County constitutes arid and semiarid

    land, and therefore over 50% of the population practice mixed farming and hence

    cultivate small pieces of land, and therefore the farming is heavily dependent
    on

    rainfall.

    Climate Change and its Impact in the Region

    Africa is considered to be one continent with the highest growth in population
    at 3%

    annually (IMF 2019). It is projected that by the year 2050, it will constitute
    about

    25% of the world population (World Bank 2019). In addition, the mortality rate
    has

    reduced thereby straining available resources. Sustaining this growth has led
    to

    increase in social problems like rural to urban migration and lower yield in the

    1736

    J. Mbandi and M. Kisangari

    food basket among others. As a result the majority of the active working force
    has

    moved to cities and towns to look for alternative sources of income.

    The smallholder farmers have not been inﬂuenced by the “Green Revolution” as

    they have continued with the practice of nonuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides,

    and genetically modiﬁed organisms. These inherent practices are referred to as

    “traditional farming.” (Onwonga and Freyer 2006). In more recent years, farmers

    have become more reliant on extension ofﬁcers. With the devolution of government

    services, extension ofﬁcers have become few in some areas and highly concentrated

    in others (Franzel et al. 2014). These ofﬁcers are expected to visit farmers to
    provide

    advisory services. It is usually tedious and time-consuming for both the farmer
    and

    the ofﬁcer. There is thus need to investigate and keep record of weather conditions

    for better decision-making for small-scale famers who are the backbone of the

    economy in Kitui County (Magee et al. 2017). In addition assessment of cumulative

    health risk is a challenge in real-world situations because of limited data available
    for

    place and population-related pollution exposure (Solomon et al. 2016). With con-

    tinued primary data collection, it is possible to create models that are more
    accurate

    in relation to this region.

    The current weather stations within the country are a lot more concentrated in
    one

    half of the country and not so much on the other half. See map below (Fig. 1).

    This study proposes to use a raspberry pi (RPi), a microcomputer quite popular

    now with IoT devices; it is of low-cost and easily adaptable to various conditions.

    The XBee is able to transmit information within short-range communication with

    very good accuracy and also low-power utilization and low-costs. The other parts
    of

    the paper will discuss methodology for the data collection, data transmission,

    storage, and visualization.

    Other Studies

    Studies have been done in agriculture and in pollution; however there is dearth
    in a

    studies combining pollution monitoring and agricultural parameters data collection.

    A review of previous studies has shown a gap in combination of these parameters

    which are of use to small-scale farming (Rehman et al. 2011) developed a WSAN

    with sensor and actuator nodes to provide controlled water supply; this is very

    geared toward precision agriculture. In 2016 (Raja et al. 2016) used various types

    of sensors to monitor temperature and moisture values of the soil. The data was

    shared to a central station periodically and concentrated on soil data. A similar
    study

    was undertaken in 2015 by (C and S 2015). This study builds on work done by

    (Rehman et al. 2011) where remote monitoring was done for data collection and

    information shared with research facilities (Vatsal and Bhavin 2017). Worked on
    a

    system showing real-time temperature and relative humidity and once again only

    concentrated in agricultural information for display locally.

    There are several systems designed for precision agriculture. They, however,

    mostly solve the problem of irrigation or temperature control. Those in environment

    solve data collection challenges, while those in agriculture solve a single or
    at most

    two challenges.

    Methodology

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is described as connecting everyday objects via sensors

    and actuators to the Internet where the devices are intelligently linked together

    enabling new forms of communication between things and people and between

    things themselves. This technology has advanced rapidly in the last few years
    and

    has become quite popular in environment monitoring. The basic concept is illus-

    trated in the ﬁgure below (Fig. 2).

    IoT offers new and innovative ways to monitor and manage remote operations. “It

    allows having eyes and ears in remote places, constantly feeding applications
    and

    data stores with information. The low-cost of ‘things’ allows observing and

    managing activities that were previously out of reach. With the Internet of Things,
    it

    is also possible to collect information about events that were once invisible,
    such as

    correlating weather patterns with industrial production” (“IoT in action – Towards

    Data Science” 2020). The advancement in wireless sensor networks is used in

    monitoring and controlling of various aspect in an agricultural ﬁeld. In the same

    light, weather aspects for a station ﬁeld. A wireless sensor network is composed
    of

    hardware and software. These are low-cost and low-power smart sensor nodes which

    monitor physical conditions. In our initial prototype test case, we monitored
    tem-

    perature, moisture, and pollution. These nodes can be spread across a large geo-

    graphic area (Fig. 3).

    A node: The main components of a sensor node are a microcontroller, transceiver,

    external memory, power source, and one or more sensors. The controller performs

    tasks, processes data, and controls the functionality of other components in the

    sensor node. The sensor node or mote can be deployed inﬁeld to form wireless

    sensor network for crop management and environment monitoring system (Fig. 4).

    This study uses ZigBee, an IEEE 802.15.4 for the wireless sensor network of

    nodes. It is common in networking standard for personal area networks. The physical

    layer of ZigBee operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical
    radio

    bands of 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz depending on the region. In this study,

    we adopt 2.4 GHz band because it is unlicensed in Kenya. The ZigBee protocol

    mainly focuses on low-cost and low-power consumption. The low-power consump-

    tion characteristic is necessary since sensors are usually placed at a remote
    location

    where battery power supply is virtually the only option. In order to attain a

    low-power consumption characteristic, the ZigBee protocol operates at low data

    rates (250 kbps at 2.4 GHz); this imposes its limitation where high data transmission

    applications are required. From node to the servers, it is thus more realistic
    to use

    other applications, for instance, Wi-Fi (802.11) which offer high data rates.
    This is

    only done from the coordinator node. Depending on the situation and environment,

    the networks can take three forms of topologies: star, cluster tree, and mesh.
    Our

    study uses the mesh topology. A mesh network is accomplished by allowing devices

    in the cluster tree to topology communicate with each other using multiple routes.

    Consequently, the devices are able to send and receive messages reliably even
    when

    their preferred path is down or congested. This is the major advantage of a mesh

    network over star and cluster-tree networks. However, a mesh network has no

    guarantee of bandwidth since no synchronization is used which requires disabling

    of beacon mode (Fig. 5).

    Mesh topology, also referred to as a peer-to-peer network, consists of one

    coordinator, several routers, and end devices. The following are the characteristics

    of a mesh topology: A mesh topology is a multi-hop network; packets pass through

    multiple hops to reach their destination. The range of a network can be increased
    by

    adding more devices to the network. It can eliminate dead zones. A mesh topology
    is

    self-healing, meaning during transmission, if a path fails, the node will ﬁnd
    an

    alternate path to the destination. Devices can be close to each other so that
    they

    use less power. Adding or removing a device is easy. Any source device can

    communicate with any destination device in the network. Compared with star

    topology, mesh topology requires greater overhead. Mesh routing uses a more

    complex routing protocol than a star topology” (“2.3 ZigBee Topologies | Introduc-

    tion to the ZigBee Wireless Sensor and Control Network | InformIT” n.d.).

    System Design

    This study proposes the combination of solving challenges in environment and in

    agriculture with a single system at the same time contributing to data enhancement

    for policy issues in both precision agriculture and pollution primary data.

    The building of pollution stations within the country present a problem of security

    and management. Having these stations placed at small farms and distributed keeps

    them safe. On the other hand, implementation of monitoring stations for local

    farmers is expensive and the communities lack the knowhow of management of

    the information collected. The cloud-based data management platform will provide

    this, while interested stakeholders (policy makers) will support the management
    of

    data. Kitui County is vast and most small farms lack connectivity to the main
    power

    grid. For the system to be self-sustaining in terms of power, the study uses solar

    photovoltaic and rechargeable batteries to power all electrical devices. The system

    incorporates a remote monitoring mechanism through a General Packet Radio

    Service modem to report soil temperature, soil moisture, WSN link performance,

    and photovoltaic power levels.

    Having a system that encompasses data collection and data dissemination pro-

    vides end to end solution for both small-scale farmers and policy makers.

    The general workﬂow of the monitoring system consists of the following:

    Hardware needed for the end point of the system:

    For the sensor node:

    1. Raspberry pi 3B – this is a low-cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs
    into a

    computer monitor or TVand uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable

    little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing and to learn
    how

    to program in languages like Scratch and Python (Raspberrypi.org n.d.)

    2. Arduino UNO – Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-

    Software used in this project:

    1. XTCU – This was used in this system to setup the XBee radios so that they can

    transmit data between each other.

    2. NOOBS – This is the operating system needed to setup a RPi.

    3. Python.

    System Implementation and Experiments

    To set up and test this system, the XBee devices were ﬁrst activated and set up
    using

    XCTU (a tool available online for free). They were all coded under the same network

    for ease of communication. The RPi was loaded with the necessary operating system

    (NOOBS) which comes with python – a coding language. In the project we also set

    up the Internet access for the raspberry pi as it acts as the gateway in this
    system.

    On a laptop, we installed Arduino IDE (which is a development platform for

    Arduino boards) and also the sketches to run the two sensors for our prototype.

    JSON here is used as the shell to transfer data in a compact mode from the Arduino

    to the RPi.

    On the RPi we run a program to call the data from the Arduino to the RPi and

    tested the same locally. Finally on ThingSpeak, we added the required APIs and
    run

    the visual data from our system.

    The diagrams below further deﬁne our various steps (Figs. 7 and 8):

    Once the codes were tested and found to be producing steady outputs, we put the

    sensors in a monitored environment – domestic fridge with proper calibration to
    test

    the humidity and temperature parameters and the results were displayed on the
    local

    Arduino software as 169% humidity and 12° Celsius continuously and repeatedly

    (Fig. 9).

    1743

    We then transferred the tests to the natural environment and connected the router

    XBee connected to the raspberry pi. We were able to read the results from the

    temperature and humidity sensor as well.

    We also run similar tests on the SDS011 – pollution sensor and obtained a

    consistent ﬂow of results as below.

    Once this was done, we then connected the end nodes to the router node for

    data aggregation. This was done using the python on the raspberry pi and

    wrapping the ﬁle using Json. We could then see our data collected using the

    IDs EN1, EN2, and EN3 from the three Arduino/XBee connected end nodes

    (Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13).

    Conclusion

    The phase of the entire project included:

    1. Coming up with a design to collect data from sensors via a sensor node.

    2. Sending the data to an online visualization platform via a control node and
    this

    step has been successful.

    Continuing work in this project involves adding a local database for localized

    data storage and adding a GSM module that allows ease of access of the online
    data

    remotely. The online platform and visualization will also be improved to be more

    robust with a private platform that can be more scalable in the future.

    Abstract

    Kenya is a developing country with a population of 47,213,282 people this

    comprises of 56% low-income earners. Small businesses and crop production

    represent 23% of the income within the country, which is at risk as soils become

    less productive. Various factors have led to this, climate change and land overuse

    being leading causes. Without adaptation, the rural to urban migration will

    continue to increase.

    Through Internet of Things (IoT) and speciﬁcally wireless sensor networks,

    we can change how we obtain and consume information. Small-scale farmers can

    collect data and in exchange receive useful information about their soils, temper-

    ature, humidity, and moisture content hence make better choices during crop

    production. Connected end devices bring in data, which is currently sparse in

    relation to small-scale farming. IoT will enable analysis and informed

    decision-making including crop selection, support equipment, fertilizers, irriga-

    tion, and harvesting. The cloud-based analysis will provide information useful
    for

    policy making and improvement.

    This paper presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) in mesh topography

    using XBee communication module, communication, and raspberry pi, combined

    with a cloud-based data storage and analysis. We successfully set up a proof of

    concept to test a sensor node that sends information to a RPi and onto an online

    visualization platform.

    Introduction: Background on Kitui County, Kenya

    Kitui County is one of Kenya’s 47 counties located in the lower eastern region
    of the

    country. The county has eight subcounties, namely, Kitui Central, Kitui South,
    Kitui

    East, Kitui Rural, Kitui West, Mwingi North, Mwingi West, and Mwingi Central.

    There are three livelihood zones in the county, marginal mixed farming, mixed

    farming livelihood zone, and formal employment, contributing 44%, 52%, and 4%

    of the population, respectively. The county has a population of 1,136,187 (Kenya

    National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) 2019) people and covers an area of 30,570

    square kilometers, of which 6,370 square kilometers is covered by Tsavo National

    Park (Magee et al. 2017). A large part of this County constitutes arid and semiarid

    land, and therefore over 50% of the population practice mixed farming and hence

    cultivate small pieces of land, and therefore the farming is heavily dependent
    on

    rainfall.

    Climate Change and its Impact in the Region

    Africa is considered to be one continent with the highest growth in population
    at 3%

    annually (IMF 2019). It is projected that by the year 2050, it will constitute
    about

    25% of the world population (World Bank 2019). In addition, the mortality rate
    has

    reduced thereby straining available resources. Sustaining this growth has led
    to

    increase in social problems like rural to urban migration and lower yield in the

    2

    J. Mbandi and M. Kisangari

    food basket among others. As a result the majority of the active working force
    has

    moved to cities and towns to look for alternative sources of income.

    The smallholder farmers have not been inﬂuenced by the “Green Revolution” as

    they have continued with the practice of nonuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides,

    and genetically modiﬁed organisms. These inherent practices are referred to as

    “traditional farming.” (Onwonga and Freyer 2006). In more recent years, farmers

    have become more reliant on extension ofﬁcers. With the devolution of government

    services, extension ofﬁcers have become few in some areas and highly concentrated

    in others (Franzel et al. 2014). These ofﬁcers are expected to visit farmers to
    provide

    advisory services. It is usually tedious and time-consuming for both the farmer
    and

    the ofﬁcer. There is thus need to investigate and keep record of weather conditions

    for better decision-making for small-scale famers who are the backbone of the

    economy in Kitui County (Magee et al. 2017). In addition assessment of cumulative

    health risk is a challenge in real-world situations because of limited data available
    for

    place and population-related pollution exposure (Solomon et al. 2016). With con-

    tinued primary data collection, it is possible to create models that are more
    accurate

    in relation to this region.

    The current weather stations within the country are a lot more concentrated in
    one

    half of the country and not so much on the other half. See map below (Fig. 1).

    This study proposes to use a raspberry pi (RPi), a microcomputer quite popular

    now with IoT devices; it is of low-cost and easily adaptable to various conditions.

    The XBee is able to transmit information within short-range communication with

    very good accuracy and also low-power utilization and low-costs. The other parts
    of

    the paper will discuss methodology for the data collection, data transmission,

    storage, and visualization.

    Other Studies

    Studies have been done in agriculture and in pollution; however there is dearth
    in a

    studies combining pollution monitoring and agricultural parameters data collection.

    A review of previous studies has shown a gap in combination of these parameters

    which are of use to small-scale farming (Rehman et al. 2011) developed a WSAN

    with sensor and actuator nodes to provide controlled water supply; this is very

    geared toward precision agriculture. In 2016 (Raja et al. 2016) used various types

    of sensors to monitor temperature and moisture values of the soil. The data was

    shared to a central station periodically and concentrated on soil data. A similar
    study

    was undertaken in 2015 by (C and S 2015). This study builds on work done by

    (Rehman et al. 2011) where remote monitoring was done for data collection and

    information shared with research facilities (Vatsal and Bhavin 2017). Worked on
    a

    system showing real-time temperature and relative humidity and once again only

    concentrated in agricultural information for display locally.

    There are several systems designed for precision agriculture. They, however,

    mostly solve the problem of irrigation or temperature control. Those in environment

    solve data collection challenges, while those in agriculture solve a single or
    at most

    two challenges.

    Methodology

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is described as connecting everyday objects via sensors

    and actuators to the Internet where the devices are intelligently linked together

    enabling new forms of communication between things and people and between

    things themselves. This technology has advanced rapidly in the last few years
    and

    has become quite popular in environment monitoring. The basic concept is illus-

    trated in the ﬁgure below (Fig. 2).

    IoT offers new and innovative ways to monitor and manage remote operations. “It

    allows having eyes and ears in remote places, constantly feeding applications
    and

    data stores with information. The low-cost of ‘things’ allows observing and

    Fig. 2 Basic parts of an IoT system

    managing activities that were previously out of reach. With the Internet of Things,
    it

    is also possible to collect information about events that were once invisible,
    such as

    correlating weather patterns with industrial production” (“IoT in action – Towards

    Data Science” 2020). The advancement in wireless sensor networks is used in

    monitoring and controlling of various aspect in an agricultural ﬁeld. In the same

    light, weather aspects for a station ﬁeld. A wireless sensor network is composed
    of

    hardware and software. These are low-cost and low-power smart sensor nodes which

    monitor physical conditions. In our initial prototype test case, we monitored
    tem-

    perature, moisture, and pollution. These nodes can be spread across a large geo-

    graphic area (Fig. 3).

    A node: The main components of a sensor node are a microcontroller, transceiver,

    external memory, power source, and one or more sensors. The controller performs

    tasks, processes data, and controls the functionality of other components in the

    sensor node. The sensor node or mote can be deployed inﬁeld to form wireless

    sensor network for crop management and environment monitoring system (Fig. 4).

    This study uses ZigBee, an IEEE 802.15.4 for the wireless sensor network of

    nodes. It is common in networking standard for personal area networks. The physical

    layer of ZigBee operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical
    radio

    bands of 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz depending on the region. In this study,

    we adopt 2.4 GHz band because it is unlicensed in Kenya. The ZigBee protocol

    mainly focuses on low-cost and low-power consumption. The low-power consump-

    tion characteristic is necessary since sensors are usually placed at a remote
    location

    where battery power supply is virtually the only option. In order to attain a

    low-power consumption characteristic, the ZigBee protocol operates at low data

    rates (250 kbps at 2.4 GHz); this imposes its limitation where high data transmission

    applications are required. From node to the servers, it is thus more realistic
    to use

    other applications, for instance, Wi-Fi (802.11) which offer high data rates.
    This is

    only done from the coordinator node. Depending on the situation and environment,

    the networks can take three forms of topologies: star, cluster tree, and mesh.
    Our

    study uses the mesh topology. A mesh network is accomplished by allowing devices

    in the cluster tree to topology communicate with each other using multiple routes.

    Consequently, the devices are able to send and receive messages reliably even
    when

    their preferred path is down or congested. This is the major advantage of a mesh

    network over star and cluster-tree networks. However, a mesh network has no

    guarantee of bandwidth since no synchronization is used which requires disabling

    of beacon mode (Fig. 5).

    Mesh topology, also referred to as a peer-to-peer network, consists of one

    coordinator, several routers, and end devices. The following are the characteristics

    of a mesh topology: A mesh topology is a multi-hop network; packets pass through

    multiple hops to reach their destination. The range of a network can be increased
    by

    adding more devices to the network. It can eliminate dead zones. A mesh topology
    is

    self-healing, meaning during transmission, if a path fails, the node will ﬁnd
    an

    alternate path to the destination. Devices can be close to each other so that
    they

    use less power. Adding or removing a device is easy. Any source device can

    communicate with any destination device in the network. Compared with star

    topology, mesh topology requires greater overhead. Mesh routing uses a more

    complex routing protocol than a star topology” (“2.3 ZigBee Topologies | Introduc-

    tion to the ZigBee Wireless Sensor and Control Network | InformIT” n.d.).

    System Design

    This study proposes the combination of solving challenges in environment and in

    agriculture with a single system at the same time contributing to data enhancement

    for policy issues in both precision agriculture and pollution primary data.

    The building of pollution stations within the country present a problem of security

    and management. Having these stations placed at small farms and distributed keeps

    them safe. On the other hand, implementation of monitoring stations for local

    farmers is expensive and the communities lack the knowhow of management of

    the information collected. The cloud-based data management platform will provide

    this, while interested stakeholders (policy makers) will support the management
    of

    data. Kitui County is vast and most small farms lack connectivity to the main
    power

    grid. For the system to be self-sustaining in terms of power, the study uses solar

    photovoltaic and rechargeable batteries to power all electrical devices. The system

    incorporates a remote monitoring mechanism through a General Packet Radio

    Service modem to report soil temperature, soil moisture, WSN link performance,

    and photovoltaic power levels.

    Having a system that encompasses data collection and data dissemination pro-

    vides end to end solution for both small-scale farmers and policy makers.

    The general workﬂow of the monitoring system consists of the following:

    1. Taking temperature, humidity, and pollution data (PM 2.5 and PM 10) samples
    at

    predeﬁned time intervals (Sensors)

    2. Reading this data at a local level (Arduino Uno)

    3. Sending data via a coordinator node (Raspberry Pi)

    System Implementation and Experiments

    To set up and test this system, the XBee devices were ﬁrst activated and set up
    using

    XCTU (a tool available online for free). They were all coded under the same network

    for ease of communication. The RPi was loaded with the necessary operating system

    (NOOBS) which comes with python – a coding language. In the project we also set

    up the Internet access for the raspberry pi as it acts as the gateway in this
    system.

    On a laptop, we installed Arduino IDE (which is a development platform for

    Arduino boards) and also the sketches to run the two sensors for our prototype.

    JSON here is used as the shell to transfer data in a compact mode from the Arduino

    to the RPi.

    On the RPi we run a program to call the data from the Arduino to the RPi and

    tested the same locally. Finally on ThingSpeak, we added the required APIs and
    run

    the visual data from our system.

    The diagrams below further deﬁne our various steps (Figs. 7 and 8):

    Once the codes were tested and found to be producing steady outputs, we put the

    sensors in a monitored environment – domestic fridge with proper calibration to
    test

    the humidity and temperature parameters and the results were displayed on the
    local

    Arduino software as 169% humidity and 12° Celsius continuously and repeatedly

    (Fig. 9).

    We then transferred the tests to the natural environment and connected the router

    XBee connected to the raspberry pi. We were able to read the results from the

    temperature and humidity sensor as well.

    We also run similar tests on the SDS011 – pollution sensor and obtained a

    consistent ﬂow of results as below.

    Once this was done, we then connected the end nodes to the router node for data

    aggregation. This was done using the python on the raspberry pi and wrapping the

    ﬁle using Json. We could then see our data collected using the IDs EN1, EN2, and

    EN3 from the three Arduino/XBee connected end nodes (Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13).

    Continuing work in this project involves adding a local database for localized

    data storage and adding a GSM module that allows ease of access of the online
    data

    remotely. The online platform and visualization will also be improved to be more

    robust with a private platform that can be more scalable in the future.

    of Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more
    April 03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,

    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges

    research with profound implications for the future of autonomous systems. This
    report delves into the intricacies of designing robotic hands, the hurdles in
    creating robust manipulation actions, and the advancements in the field that poised
    to catalyze a new era of autonomy. Drawing inspiration from science fiction''s
    portrayal of robotics, we bridge the conceptual gap between fiction and ongoing
    real-world technical research, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for
    students interested in robotics. Comprehensive 3GPP-Compatible Channel Model for
    FR2-2 Short-Range Communications for... Yusuke Koda and 3 more April 02, 2024
    This paper proposes a comprehensive 3GPPcnaompatible channel model with statistical
    enhancement tailored for indoor short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications
    operating in the frequency range (FR) of 52.6-71.0 GHz termed FR2-2. Regardless
    of the existence of various channel models at this band for indoor communications,
    there will be a need for developing a channel model compatible with and understandable
    from the current 3GPP stochastic channel model (SCM) to facilitate the discussion
    in the 3GPP for developing such FR2-2 short-range D2D communication framework
    based on the fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR). Indeed, such a futuristic vision
    can be foreseen from the fact that the 3GPP is discussing the evolution of sidelink,
    referred to as a D2D communication framework; however, there are no 3GPP SCM-compatible
    channel models applicable to FR2-2 short-range D2D communications. To fill this
    void, we propose the channel model coined 3GPPCompFR2-InS that allows us to generate
    channel impulse responses (CIR) for computer simulations, which is suitable for
    various indoor short-range D2D communication scenarios while retailing the similarity
    in terms of the implementation policy of the 3GPP SCM. 3GPPCompFR2-InS is verified
    based on the real-world measurements at the 60 GHz band from the viewpoint of
    both the validity of the channel model parameters and that of the statistical
    behavior of the generated CIRs. Effective media models for wave propagation in
    prestressed fractured rocks with nonli... Li-Yun Fu and 3 more April 02, 2024
    Stress-induced progressive deformations in fractured rocks with increasing effective
    pressure generally undergo nonlinear elastic (due to the closure of compliant
    pores), hyperelastic (due to residual stress), and inelastic (due to fracture
    growth) deformations prior to mechanical failure. Wave propagation in such rocks
    involves the complex interaction of fracture-and stress-induced changes in both
    velocity and anisotropy. With attention to nonlinear elastic and hyperelastic
    deformations, we incorporate acoustoelasticity into the traditional Hudson/Cheng
    models to describe the coupling of fracture-induced and stress-induced anisotropies.
    The resulting acoustoelastic Hudson model (AHM) is valid for the crack density
    smaller than 0.1 whereas the Padé AHM could handle higher crack densities. We
    extend the Padé AHM to consider the stress-induced crack closure with nonlinear
    elastic deformations by incorporating the dual-porosity model. These models approach
    the coupled anisotropies with different accuracies and computational complexities.
    The plane-wave analyses and effective-moduli calculations of stressed fractured
    rocks with varying crack densities determine the accuracy of these models under
    the isotropic (confining) and anisotropic (uniaxial and pure shear) prestress
    conditions. The relevant Thomsen parameters are applied to experimental data to
    validate the applicability. Finite-difference simulations are implemented to identify
    the contribution of different anisotropies through the variety of wavefronts,
    depending on fracture orientation, crack density, prestress mode and magnitude,
    and loading direction. Particular attention is paid to the anisotropic prestress,
    where the coupled anisotropies are constructive or destructive interference, strongly
    related to the relativity between fracture strike and loading direction. The stress-induced
    crack closure will reduce the fracture anisotropy so that the stress-induced background
    anisotropy dominates the shape of wavefronts with increasing prestress. Security
    and Reliability Performance of a Cooperative Network with Self-Sustaining No...
    Amit Patel and 1 more April 02, 2024 In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance
    of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting self-sustaining
    nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). Performance of such
    networks is quite different from that with powered nodes. We consider optimal
    combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as
    well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Since availability of channel state information
    at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling.
    To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination.
    Assuming practical nonlinear EH, exact and approximate expressions are derived
    for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and
    the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated
    that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF just as with powered nodes.
    However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function
    of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve
    secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability
    trade-off (SRT) is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy
    performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical
    expressions. Scalable Dynamic Spectrum Access with IEEE 1900.5.2 Spectrum Consumption
    Models Prasad Netalkar and 5 more April 03, 2024 Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)
    is a key mechanism for meeting the ever-increasing demand for emerging wireless
    services. DSA involves managing and assigning available spectrum resources in
    a way that minimizes interference and allows RF coexistence between heterogeneous
    devices and systems. Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs)-defined in the IEEE 1900.5.2
    standard, offer a mechanism for RF devices to: (i) declare the characteristics
    of their intended spectrum use and their interference protection needs; and (ii)
    determine compatibility (non-interference) with existing devices. In this paper,
    we propose a novel SCM-based Spectrum Deconfliction (SD) algorithm that dynamically
    configures RF operational parameters (e.g., center frequency and transmission
    power) of a target transmitter-receiver pair aiming to minimize interference with
    existing devices/systems. We also propose sequential and distributed DSA methods
    that use the SD algorithm for assigning spectrum in large-scale networks. To evaluate
    the performance of our methods in terms of computation time, spectrum assignment
    efficiency, and overhead, we use two custom-made simulation platforms. Finally,
    to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our methods, we build a proof-of-concept
    implementation in the NSF PAWR COSMOS wireless testbed. The results reveal the
    advantages of using SCMs and their capabilities to conduct spectrum assignments
    in dynamic and congested communication environments. Advanced Cardiovascular Health
    in a Quantum AI-driven Healthcare Framework Sarvapriya M Tripathi and 2 more April
    02, 2024 With the advent of Healthcare 4.0, there is increased interest from researchers
    the world over in the application of modern, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) algorithms in solving healthcare
    challenges. The era of Quantum Computing (QC) promises to bring significant advancements
    in several areas of healthcare such that it may be sensible to give this hybrid
    Quantum/Classical paradigm its own name-Healthcare4Q. The potential of QC will
    extend the reach of Healthcare4Q with the help of diverse technologies such as
    quantum-enabled wearables, quantum-secure transfer and storage of data, and quantum
    computing at edge, fog, and cloud. All of these technologies promise to catapult
    Healthcare4Q to become the most capable healthcare framework in the advancement
    of medical innovations and improvement of patient care. An integral part of a
    person''s health lies in cardiovascular health, and thus prioritizing and optimizing
    cardiovascular health remains vital to the broader goals of public health and
    healthcare sustainability. In this study, under the paradigm of Healthcare4Q,
    we propose a framework called the Quantum AIdriven Heart Health Framework (QAIHHF)
    that can provide advanced predictive intelligence to healthcare providers by utilizing
    historical and real-time data and processing capabilities proposed in Healthcare4Q.
    We show that when applied to various diagnostics and health indicators such as
    ECG data, the Quantum AI provides accuracy at a level equal to or higher as compared
    to the classical methods thus proving itself to be the critical component that
    will herald the era of Healthcare4Q. QCDC-DR-GA: Optimizing Container Loading
    and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Docky... Md. Mahfuzur Rahman and 4 more
    April 01, 2024 This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and
    loading operations at ports, integrating quaycrane dual-cycling (QCDC) with dockyard
    rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations:
    ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing
    dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect
    in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically,
    optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase
    dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem,
    we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising 1dimensional
    and 2-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms
    four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard
    rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time
    for large vessels. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing
    QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized
    by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to
    QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads
    to inferior performance than our proposed QCDC-DR-GA. A Two-Stage Passive Matrix
    Addressing Method for Large-Scale Beam-Steering Arrays PengYuan Wang April 01,
    2024 This letter proposes a passive matrix addressing method to dramatically reduce
    the number of controlling (biasing) lines for large-scale beam-steering arrays.
    Phase shifting of each radiation element is accomplished in two stages by the
    row and column biasing lines located at two stacked layers, which offer a pair
    of orthogonal wave vectors. For an antenna array with M rows and N columns, conventional
    direct addressing designs need M * N biasing lines, while the proposed method
    needs only M+N biasing lines to complete the full-space beam-steering. The proposed
    method simplifies the routing of control lines and the design of driving circuits.
    Both theoretical and numerical analyses are provided to validate this method.
    Efficient Twiddle Factor Generation for Post Quantum Cryptography FALCON-based
    Number... Ghada Alsuhli and 4 more April 01, 2024 Area and power-efficient hardware
    implementations are crucial for the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography
    (PQC) algorithms like FALCON. One of the main operations in FALCON is the Number
    Theoretic Transform (NTT), which needs to be performed with many prime numbers.
    Having one set of twiddle factors (TFs) for each prime makes storing all of these
    TFs impractical. In this paper, we propose an architecture for generating TFs
    on the fly for FALCON-oriented NTT, designed for area and power efficiency. Our
    approach dynamically generates TFs during NTT computations, significantly reducing
    on-chip memory requirements. The ASIC implementation results demonstrate significant
    improvements, with the proposed design reducing on-chip memory requirements by
    99%, occupying 95% less area, and consuming 87.4% less power compared to the traditional
    ROM-based implementation. Furthermore, our design achieved a much higher maximum
    clock frequency, indicating superior performance in accessing twiddle factors.
    These findings highlight the potential of our proposed architecture for efficient
    hardware implementations of FALCON-based cryptographic systems. Enhancing Renewable
    Energy-Grid Integration by Optimally Placed FACTS Devices: The Ni... Nnaemeka
    Sunday Ugwuanyi and 5 more April 01, 2024 The global shift towards renewable energy
    (RE) sources, driven by climate change and fossil fuel depletion, encounters challenges
    in integrating intermittent sources like wind and solar power into existing grids.
    Developing countries, such as Nigeria, with weak grids, face significant limitations
    on RE penetration. This study focuses on enhancing RE grid integration in Nigeria
    by strategically deploying Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS)
    devices. Results obtained from the Nigerian grid indicate that FACTS devices,
    particularly STATCOMs, can extend the penetration limit by 40%, enabling an additional
    152 MW of wind energy to be integrated without jeopardizing system stability.
    Improved voltage profiles and enhanced stability highlight the effectiveness of
    FACTS devices in facilitating RE integration into weak grids. Thus, developing
    grids can accommodate more renewable energy without extensive reconfiguration
    of the power system architecture. Doppler Shift Distribution in Satellite Constellations
    Akram Al-Hourani April 01, 2024 Doppler shift has significant implications in
    Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations due to the rapid relative movement of satellites.
    This paper presents a novel approach based on stochastic geometry to capture the
    statistical distribution of Doppler shift in modern mega satellite constellations.
    We derive a simplified expression for both the Doppler shift s-curve and its maximum
    value, highlighting the dependency of Doppler shifts on the zenith angle of the
    closest approach during a satellite pass. Additionally, we present a stochastic
    model for the distribution of these zenith angles within the random constellation
    model. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of the Doppler bound is analytically
    formulated and validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of two major
    satellite constellations currently in orbit. Effect of Presenting Stiffness of
    Robot Hand to Human on Human-Robot Handovers Junya Yamamoto and 2 more April 01,
    2024 In the present study, we focus on the object handover task as a major example
    of collaborative work between a human and a robot. To achieve a smooth handover
    between two different agents, their mutual communication is indispensable for
    understanding the other’s intentions. However, previous research has not dealt
    with a moment during handover in which a robot takes the object from a human grasp
    or in which a robot hands the object to the human. It should be noted that the
    performance during those phases is crucial to the success or failure of the tasks
    because slight changes in the kinematics of the relationship between hands or
    fingers and object result in significant changes in grasping status: the human
    may forcibly pull out the object while the robot is grasping it or drop the object.
    Therefore, this study aims to realize a smooth handover between a human and a
    robot, focusing on the moment of object handover. To this end, this paper proposes
    to present the stiffness of the robot hand to the human. We conducted the subject
    experiments to investigate the effect of this method on humans in the human-robot
    interaction. Experimental results show that this presentation method enables the
    worker to recognize the stiffness of the robot, which is difficult to recognize
    visually, thereby reducing the workload and allowing the worker to respond seamlessly
    to changes in the robot’s stiffness. VABAM: Variational Autoencoder for Amplitude-based
    Biosignal Augmentation within Morp... Junetae Kim and 2 more April 01, 2024 Pulsatile
    physiological signals, characterized by rhythmic fluctuations, are vital for assessing
    health conditions and are widely used in wellness devices and medical equipment.
    Despite their significance, models addressing domain-specific unmet needs and
    considerations have not been developed as much as in other fields. Therefore,
    building on the foundation of variational autoencoders, we introduce VABAM, a
    novel model for the amplitude-based synthesis of pulsatile physiological signals.
    The uniqueness of VABAM lies in its ability to maintain the morphological identity
    of signals throughout the synthesis process, achieved by integrating pass filter
    effects within the variational autoencoder architecture. To assess the effectiveness
    of the model, we developed three novel metrics based on joint mutual information.
    These metrics were aimed at evaluating the disentanglement of latent spaces, influence
    of ancillary information on signal morphologies, and controllability of amplitude-based
    synthesis within morphological identities. Comparative analyses demonstrated that
    VABAM and its variants were notably effective at preserving morphological integrity,
    highlighting their potential to minimize morphological distortions in physiological
    signal processing and their compatibility with artificial intelligence models
    employing frequency and amplitude features. Additionally, the proposed metrics,
    compatible with probabilistic models, were empirically proven to capture the characteristics
    of various models from multiple perspectives. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 508

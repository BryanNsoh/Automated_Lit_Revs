    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\

    \ of products (e.g., farm machinery) re-\nquires (I) geometric (e.g., size, shape)\
    \ and physical properties of an object, (II) in the\ndetailed information of the\
    \ product which can illustrate dynamic processing of the object,\n(III) integration\
    \ of geometric, physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin ap-\nproaches\
    \ make it possible to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery\n\
    that would yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efﬁciencies.\n\
    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) have recently established their capacity to provide cost-effective
    and credible solutions for various real-world scenarios. UAVs provide an immense
    variety of services due to their autonomy, mobility, adaptability, and communications
    interoperability. Despite the expansive use of UAVs to support ground communications,
    data exchanges in those networks are susceptible to security threats because most
    communication is through radio or Wi-Fi signals, which are easy to hack. While
    several techniques exist to protect against cyberattacks. Recently emerging technology
    blockchain could be one of promising ways to enhance data security and user privacy
    in peer-to-peer UAV networks. Borrowing the superiorities of blockchain, multiple
    entities can communicate securely, decentralized, and equitably. This article
    comprehensively overviews privacy and security integration in blockchain-assisted
    UAV communication. For this goal, we present a set of fundamental analyses and
    critical requirements that can help build privacy and security models for blockchain
    and help manage and support decentralized data storage systems. The UAV communication
    system''s security requirements and objectives, including availability, authentication,
    authorization, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and non-repudiation, are thoroughly
    examined to provide a deeper insight. We wrap up with a discussion of open research
    challenges, the constraints of current UAV standards, and potential future research
    directions. Published in: IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology ( Volume:

    With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources
    of data generation have increased exponentially. The use and processing of this
    generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The concept
    of a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making
    in the various aspects of daily life and also improvement in the traditional systems.
    In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include devices
    used for data collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis, and decision
    making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital role in smart city
    applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many challenges when
    dealing with such voluminous and high-speed generated data, such as semi-structured
    or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time responses, and so on.
    Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved as a potential solution for
    many applications in smart cities to complete this tedious task of handling big
    data with real-time response. PDS has been used in many smart city domains, including
    healthcare, transportation, the environment, energy, and industry. The goal of
    this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of PDS and its applications in
    the domains of smart cities. The prominent domain of the smart city has been explored
    in detail; origin, current research status, challenges, and existing application
    of PDS along with research gaps and future directions. The foremost aim of this
    paper is to provide a detailed survey of PDS in smart cities; for readers and
    researchers who want to explore this field; along with the research opportunities
    in the domains. 1.Introduction In the early 1970s, it was a period of acceleration
    in the field of computing and data was the new term. There was an evolution of
    relational databases between the 1980s and 1990s. The internet and IoT are clusters
    of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. In the 1990s, there was
    slow or no internet in most cities. These were ordinary cities. Generally, ordinary
    cities are defined as human settlements without the use of the latest technology
    at all. The need for processing, storage, and analysis is required beyond the
    human and technical infrastructure. This huge volume and variety of unstructured
    data and untapped information is spread across the networks. The core part of
    Apache Hadoop is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), consisting of the
    storage part, and the MapReduce programming model for processing [4]. As the data
    is increasing day by day, to access this data in an efficient and well-structured
    manner, the government and public sector require technologies and expertise to
    convert urban cities to smart cities. The research interest in smart cities has
    continuously increased in the current and coming years and it is economically
    justified by the progress of state-of-the-art technologies [21]. New inventions
    like the internet, the cloud, and IoT have increased data generation speed as
    well as introduced a variation in data. The smart city impacts towns and cities
    around the world with the evolution of the internet and the use of new technologies.
    But in the current context, rapid population growth is creating challenges for
    the government and its services. So, smart cities are the most acceptable solution
    to such situations of better metropolitan living conditions [146]. The emergence
    of a smart city has the potential to manage all these issues (Fig. 1). But, expeditious
    urbanization also quickly presents a major challenge worldwide. Though movement
    from rural to metropolitan areas is unavoidable, that’s why cities persist in
    facing many challenges like transport, healthiness, air quality, agriculture,
    and many more [87]. Smart cities face many issues like pollution, health assistance,
    overburden on both public and private sectors, traffic, etc. due to the rapid
    growth in population in metropolitan cities [126]. In this connection, the problems
    associated with these issues in cities require ingenious solutions. They include
    human strength, ingenuity, and collaboration with different stakeholders [117].
    Fig. 1. Smart city. In a recent survey, the United Nations estimated that the
    world’s population will grow by 32% from 2015 to 2050 and that the population
    will grow by 63% in the metropolitan area. Several researchers also stated that
    by 2030, more than 60% of the population will be living in cities, with the southeast
    United States experiencing the greatest growth [74,275]. The extensive and rapid
    growth of information and Communication Technology (ICT) has provided possible
    solutions and mechanisms to various problems in metropolitan areas [13] this approach
    can be used as a tool [267] to increase the effectiveness of the city system.
    In this regard, the thinking or mentality of humans is required to be changed,
    like a smart mind, to raise the standard of living for sustainability in the smart
    city. Furthermore, remote monitoring and management systems are being used to
    improve energy efficiency in smart cities [316]. Since the advent of the coronavirus
    and its declaration as a worldwide epidemic, all public and private sectors have
    been affected. This virus has affected daily routines and activities like education,
    communication, daily movement, labor, and many more. Some public and private sectors
    have worked with 50% manpower on alternative days. Many sectors, like IT companies,
    schools, etc. have run Work From Home (WFH). Even doctors have their OPD or patients
    diagnosed online. The key solution to this epidemic’s key problems for daily life
    can be solved through the smart city. Jasim et al. [129]made a wise decision to
    help society and expand the resources available to individuals in areas such as
    healthcare, communication, transportation, education, and many others. The Government
    of India (GoI) has a long-term vision for smart cities. GoI defines smart cities
    as a mission to conduct monetary growth and improve the quality of life by allowing
    the development of regional zones and utilizing technology that directs to smart
    results. They also designed a workbook “Making a City Smart: Learnings from the
    Smart Cities Mission” with activities in each section to help cities plan their
    smart city journeys. Creating a smart city incorporates lessons from the smart
    city mission to clarify what, why, and how a smart city works. Consolidated at
    the national level, 100 smart cities have proposed to undertake 5,151 projects
    worth Rs. 2,05,018 crores in 5 years from their selected dates. New financial
    innovations are built on investment plans. The distribution is estimated to be
    from a variety of sources as follows: 6480 projects worth Rs. 185,905 Cr are tendered,
    5845 projects worth Rs. 157,369 are in work order stages and 3145 projects worth
    Rs. 53,256 Cr are completed. The cities like Gwalior, Thiruvananthapuram, Satna,
    Udaipur, New Town Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar, and Ahmedabad are covered under various
    smart city projects [183]. 1.1.Role of big data in smart city Big Data basically
    stands for velocity, volume, and variety of information, which includes complexity
    in terms of speed of data generation, the structure of data (variety), and the
    amount of data to be generated. Big data has a number of definitions and’V’ principles
    to make big data processing clear and accurate [118]. Anything beyond the human
    and traditional infrastructure and techniques required to store, process, and
    analyze big data provides the solutions for it. With the advent of new technologies
    such as IoT, ICT, sensors, and so on, big data systems are becoming more efficient
    in sophisticated data infrastructures [170]. Fig. 2. Influence of big data in
    smart cities. The role of big data in smart cities is heavily influenced, particularly
    in recognizing patterns, analyzing, and processing data collected from various
    IoT devices (Fig. 2). Every city is evolving towards being a smart city. These
    cities combine basic needs with high technology for a carefree and basic lifestyle.
    To extract important information from such huge data sets, big data analysis is
    the key [7]. The data collected from different sensors and devices in a smart
    city’s various gates installed in the city is used for better decisions. This
    growth in data requires efficient storage and handling, which is a big challenge
    for both academia and industry [96]. Big data has different effects in different
    parts of the city. The protection of the general public: The security and privacy
    of citizens is the main concern in smart cities. To protect their citizens from
    anything mishappening within the city, various analyses of geographical data can
    be done. This can all be recorded through Close Circuit Televisions (CCTVs) and
    sensors installed on street lights or traffic lights. An enormous amount of data
    is developed and significant expansion is required when the desired data transforms
    the city into a considerably safer location. Urbanism: Cities are investing heavily
    in transforming to become smart cities. The current needs of the city can be identified
    through the effective use of data, which can aid in identifying areas that require
    development and improvement. As a result, cities can invest by volunteering in
    areas where they are needed. Transportation: After Covid-19 both public and private
    transportation are affected after COVID-19. Most people rely on their own reasoning
    to get to work and so on. The congestion on the roads is increasing, so the risk
    of accidents or anything else going wrong has also increased. To handle or manage
    traffic on roads, the system requires big data and well-structured data. Large
    data sets will also help reduce risks. Sustainable Growth: This is also the main
    part of a smart city. For sustainable growth, a huge amount of past and present
    data is required. Likewise, storing this data is one of the challenges for the
    smart city. This data is updated on a daily basis. Data is a special factor in
    determining the impact of improvement in the city. Infrastructure: To maintain
    sustainability, smart city infrastructure needs to improve consistently. Obviously,
    for this data, a smart city is required and used in a good manner to improve or
    maintain the infrastructure. So, the role of big data in smart cities is significant
    for efficient and quick results. Big data is the brain of the smart city. The
    main challenge is the lack of awareness of using this data to create smart solutions
    to fulfill the requirements of citizens. Citizens are the main stakeholders of
    smart cities. So, to improve the standard of living, the developer needs new data
    processing tools and techniques. There is computational, time, and space complexity
    by using the deterministic data structure. Probabilistic Data Structures are one
    of the key solutions for smart storage and searching of data in real-time scenarios.
    The traditional methods may also produce accurate results in real-time, but there
    is a trade-off in space and time, which is not acceptable due to the massive amount
    of data. Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional data structure
    is shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation solution,
    which may be or may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction.
    Since PDSs have some probabilistic components, they are efficient in reducing
    the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,
    storing nonstructural data, helping with fast retrieval, and making approximate
    predictions. Hash functions are used to represent these data structures [246].
    The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity testing,
    and cardinal counting. Low memory requirements and good processing speed are two
    distinct features of PDS [136]. The extensive review of this paper has found the
    key challenges faced during the handling of big data in smart cities. In this
    regard, the PDS and its variants have provided the key solutions to these challenges
    and also found new possibilities. In this paper, the importance of big data in
    smart cities, generation (Section 2), architecture (Section 4), and the detailed
    application (Section 7) of smart cities, worldwide running smart city projects
    (Section 5) and commonly used PDS (Section 6) have been discussed. During the
    survey, it was found that big data has a high influence on smart cities. PDS has
    evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete
    this tedious task of handling big data with real-time response. PDS has been used
    in many smart city domains, including healthcare, transportation, the environment,
    energy, and industry. This paper has thoroughly investigated the prominent domain
    of smart cities, including the origin, current research status, and existing applications
    of PDS, as well as research gaps and challenges (Section 10). 2.Generations of
    smart cities To improve the standard of living there is a need to change from
    rural to urban. Governments and citizens are increasing their attention in terms
    of technologies and new startups in smart cities. The concept of a smart city
    for urban transformation has radically changed over the years. The generation
    of smart cities has been concise (Table 1). Based on analysis and study, several
    researchers have divided the technical advancement in smart cities into different
    generations (generations 1.0–5.0) (Fig. 3) [140,265]: Fig. 3. Generation of smart
    city [140]. Table 1 Generation of smart city Parameters Generation 1.0 Generation
    2.0 Generation 3.0 Generation 4.0 Generation 5.0 Year 1974–2000 2000–2010 2011–2018

    and Google) AI, Robotics, IoT, 6G Limitations Data Exchange lack of technologies
    usages Privacy and Security Data management New and untested technologies Generations
    1.0: – When the technology vendors started implementing their own solutions in
    cities, it was defined as the first technology-driven smart city. Due to the influential
    role of big corporations like IBM and Cisco, they are criticized for their technology
    concerns. To improve the efficiency of public and private services, the creators
    of technology development are encouraged to use their own solutions in cities.
    Generations 2.0: – Indirectly concerned with citizens, issues like healthcare,
    transport, air quality, and water quality are arising. The technology and tools
    were developed to address such issues in generation 2.0. The participation of
    citizens was negligible in decision-making in cities [276]. The quality of life
    and local administration was measured by modern technology. For this, cities presented
    agendas and schemes that support the execution of trendy technology. Generations
    3.0: – Thus, the modern city represents the whole connected ecosystem that integrates
    ICT into a smart city. The modern city building programs were organized and the
    local public participated. It was the time when the government acted as a facility
    providing services to citizens. Here also, citizens are competent to represent
    their thoughts and innovative ideas [251]. Here also, the urban space is designed
    for users and their engagement. Generations 4.0: – By adopting 4.0 industrial
    transformation, the benefits of smart cities are valued to outweigh city costs
    through city establishment [298]. This generation of smart cities illustrates
    the most useful parts of the past; for example, technology generation 1.0, individual
    performance 2.0, and 3.0 engagement. Smart City Generations 4.0 is inspired by
    Industry Revolution 4.0, and they develop new technologies. In this, control is
    over the use of existing resources and infrastructure. Generations 5.0: – In this
    generation 5.0, the concept of cognitive computing is introduced for developing
    cities. It is purely based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Systems are self-learned
    from past and present knowledge that reflects changes in real-time like interest,
    barriers, etc [228]. Each public and private service can be handled by an independent
    agent, which gives fast and efficient results. Generations 5.0 is the main focus
    on decision-making for urban development by using behavioral analysis and AI [264].
    3.Ranking of smart city Worldwide, there are different ranking systems based on
    distinct parameters. Out of these, the most popular are, “Liveable City Index
    (LCI)” [204],“intelligent cities” [292], “sustainable cities” [28], “global cities”
    and “competitiveness cities” [266]. The center smart city index is used for ranking
    by researchers’ organizations such as Smart City Observatory, in collaboration
    with IMD competitiveness [44]. To manage the infrastructure of smart cities like
    transportation, traffic, street light etc. the technologies like AI and IoT may
    be used. Muhammad A.R. Tariq et al. [266] tries to identify the preferences of
    people living with different city ranking systems, and the top five cities in
    the last three years are given in Table 2. Another ranking criteria is that Juniper
    Research, an analyst firm based in the UK, has ranked the cities as smart cities
    on various factors like transportation, energy, healthcare, connectivity between
    urban areas, etc. Shanghai, Seoul, Barcelona, Beijing, and New York are among
    the top five global cities considered. These cities mainly work on real-time data,
    which helps in managing the assets and future-proofing them. They also cover the
    downtown to provide 5G and 99% of fiber coverage across the city. To fully fill,
    the needs of residents, these smart cities are using the “Citizen Cloud App”,
    which uses ambient technologies like AI, Cloud Computing, and Big Data, which
    come under Smart City Generation 5.0 [20]. Table 2 Top five smart cities in last
    three years Years Smart Cities 2021 Singapore, Zurich, Oslo, Taipei City, Lausanne.
    2020 Singapore, Helsinki, Zurich, Auckland, Oslo. 2019 Singapore, Zurich, Oslo,
    Geneva, Copenhagen. 4.Architecture of smart city Smart city development includes
    the integration and implementation of digital and IoT. IoT provides essential
    elements of smart cities like data production, data management, and application
    management. The number of smart city architectures proposed over time [226]. In
    Fig. 4 the most generic architecture has been represented with four layers. All
    these four layers are integrated with security modules because of sensitive data.
    Sensing layer: – The bottom-most layer of the architecture represents the sensing
    layer or data collection layer. IoT devices are used to build this layer. This
    layer uses various IoT devices like actuator, Zigbee, Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) sensors etc. to sens these various parameters like humidity, temperature,
    pressure, etc. Data collection on mobile devices is a huge burden on the sensor
    layer, which resides under the structure. This layer captures real-time data from
    sensors [26,192]. Transmission layer: – With a variety of communication technologies,
    the transfer layer carries data to higher levels. This layer acts as the spine
    of any smart city architecture. In this layer, the various communication networks
    like 3G, 4G, LTE, the internet, and satellite also help in mobile networks. Fifth-generation
    (5G) telecommunication is embedded in the base station for transferring huge wireless
    traffic [100]. Data management layer: – This layer resides between the transmission
    and application layers and is the brain of a smart city. The functions of this
    layer are deception, editing, analysis, storage, and decision-making [195]. The
    stored information in this layer is used to provide services to various applications
    in the top layer. The primary role of this layer is to preserve data integrity,
    data purification, expansion, and optimization [285]. As the final function of
    the data management layer, the conclusions obtained are transferred to the application
    layer for proper use. Fig. 4. Layered architecture of a generic smart city [243].
    Application layer: – An application layer is required to connect the data management
    layer with urban residents. This is the topmost layer of this architecture. This
    layer provides assistance to the users. It operates applications that use IoT,
    for example, smart homes, grid distribution, smart transport, weather forecasting,
    etc., and intelligent health [317]. As this layer is directly connected to the
    end-users, the satisfaction of users may increase with the improvement of services
    provided. 5.Projects contributions related to smart city The research on smart
    city buildings has been accomplished worldwide. Hence, the concept of smart cities
    was introduced. The research was conducted by various international organizations,
    universities, and businesses. Various countries, like the US and China, have also
    accomplished research in intelligent urban design [156]. The smart city encourages
    the planning of metropolitan, oversight through ICT, IoT, CC etc [157]. The evaluation
    method proposed by IBM is very focused on building standards and relevant standards.

    smart cities are listed in Table 3 [106]. Table 3 Projects contributions related

    in data production services is most evident in the last decade, due to the emergence
    of ICT, IoT, etc. The traditional methods may also produce accurate results in
    real-time, but there is a trade-off in space and time, which is not acceptable
    for a massive amount of data. Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional
    data structure is shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation
    solution, which may be or may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right
    direction. Since PDSs have some probabilistic components, they are efficient in
    reducing the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,
    storing nonstructural data, helping in fast retrieval, and making approximate
    predictions. In general, there are thirteen types of PDS (Fig. 5). But in this
    paper, we are discussing four types, because these are widely used by various
    researchers in their design and development. These are very useful for handling
    and storing large amounts of data in an appropriate and efficient manner. Hash
    functions are used to represent these data structures [246]. The PDS is used for
    membership checking, frequency testing, similarity testing, and cardinal counting.
    Low memory requirements and good processing speed are two distinct features of
    PDS [136]. Fig. 5. Overview of PDS [246]. 6.1.Bloom filter In 1970, the concept
    of Bloom Filter (BF) was introduced by Burton H. Bloom [36]. The BF is a probabilistic
    model, a highly efficient random data structure. It is used to reduce space problems
    and is an effective way to query the membership of any item in an extensive set.
    The BF consists of an array with m-bits which is initialized to 0 and k hash functions.
    The hash function k is used to query an element. To find the position of elements
    in the array, put them into the k hash functions. For insertion into BF, the first
    element has been added using a hash function (Fig. 6). For elements to be inserted,
    hash functions are computed and the corresponding bit is set with that index.
    In the query process, an element is checked to see whether it is a member of the
    set or not. For querying, check all bits correspond to indexes. If all the bits
    are set high, then the answer is “maybe” and if at least 1 bit is not set, then
    the answer is “definitely not”. Properties of BF: – It is impossible to false
    negative, but if the queried locations are set to 1, then a false positive is
    possible (in standard BF). – To process an element, the query time is O (k), where
    k is the hash function. – The size of the union and intersection of BF is the
    same and to implement hash functions, the operations bitwise OR and AND are used.
    Fig. 6. Insertion in bloom filter [246]. 6.2.Count min sketch Count-min sketch
    (CMS) was introduced by G.Cormode and S.Muthukrishna in 2003 [64]. It is a streaming
    algorithm for probabilistic sub-linear space [244]. Its functionality is also
    hashing-dependent like BF. CMS is different from BF in only that it uses a 2-dimensional
    array to handle a given data set, while BF uses a 1-dimensional array for representing
    hashed data. Fig. 7. Count min sketch [246]. The basic data structure of CMS consists
    of a 2-D array (d * w) where w is used for storing the counts and it depends on
    the maximum outputs given by hash functions, and d is the hash function h(1…d)
    and it is pairwise independent. To update the counts, calculate the hash positions
    with the d-hash functions. The values determined by the hash function are used
    to get the actual occurrence of an item in an array. The minimum of the determined
    values by the hash function is the actual occurrence of an item (Fig. 7). The
    space used by CMS is equal to the count of (d * w). With the use of CMS and appropriate
    values of d and w, we get efficient results with very few errors. Use more hash
    functions for more accurate results. Properties of Count-Min sketch: – It supports
    union operations on cells. – The query time to process is O (k), where k is a
    hash function. – The accuracy improves when an item appears multiple times, with
    a higher frequency, or with heavy hitters. – CMS also has various applications
    like compressed sensing, stream processing, frequency tracking, etc. 6.3.Locality
    sensitive hashing In 1998, Indyk and Motwani introduced the Locality Sensitive
    Hashing (LSH) [123]. LSH works on the principle of using low-dimensional space
    for high-dimensional data. The hash functions are selected very carefully, which
    has more chances of collusion in the hash bucket. The LSH has three phases. These
    are: the first phase is the preprocessing phase where different measures are used
    for mapping data, in the second phase, hash tables are created, and in the final
    phase, these hash tables are used for recognizing identical items (Fig. 8). The
    similar items are located in the same bucket, so the whole data is located in
    buckets [104]. Fig. 8. Locality-sensitive hashing framework [246]. A LSH family
    lshF() is defined with probabilities P 1  and  P 2 , an approximation factor c⩾1
    , a threshold R⩾0 , and for a metric space M=(M,d) . This function lshF() maps
    the metric space to buckets sϵS with a set of functions h:M→S [287]. The following
    conditions must be satisfied for p,qϵM and hash function h chosen uniformly at
    random from F: – if d(p,q)⩽R , then h(p)=h(q) (i.e., p and q collide) with probability
    at least P 1 , – if d(p,q)⩾cR , then h(p)=h(q) with probability at most P 2 .
    A family is interesting when P 1 ⩾ P 2 . Such a family lshF() is called (R,cR,
    P 1 , P 2 ) -sensitive. Properties of Locality Sensitive Hashing: – The same items
    are hashed to the same buckets as different items, so LSH hashes the items a number
    of times. – Cosine, similarity, and hammering distances are examples of item LSH
    functions. – The functions of LSH are not limited to the same standard measures
    commonly used for data retrieval, overlap, and dice coefficient [54]. 6.4.Quotient
    filter Michael Bender et al. proposed a quotient filter (QF) in 2011 [30]. It
    uses less memory to sample an element that is a member or not of the set. Basically,
    it has performed four operations add, delete, is a member, is not a member on
    the set. QF uses the single hash function for fingerprint generation with a size
    of p (in bits). For insertion of element in QF, remainder f r ←( f p (x)mod 2
    r ) and quotient f p ←(⌊ f p (x) 2 r ⌋) are calculated, where f p is the index
    of bucket and f r is value inserted in f p bucket. QF gives the specific result
    to the query that is either probably yes or definitely not the element of the
    set. There is some probability after querying that the element is in the set,
    but actually, it is not present (Fig. 9). The storage size is decreased with the
    increase of filter size, so there is a trade-off between storage and false-positive
    [82]. Fig. 9. Quotient filter [89]. Properties of Quotient Filter: – An Approximate
    Member Query (AMQ) filter is used to speed up the answers in the storage system.
    – Insertion, deletion, and updating are allowed in QF, resulting in the large
    usage of proxy databases. – There is no need to re-hash the original key for merging
    and re-sizing of QF. PDSs are used in many real-time applications like preserving
    patient data in healthcare, traffic control, energy-saving, and also for SEM and
    SAM, and many more. In the next section, the PDS and their applications in smart
    cities and big data will be explored in a more detailed manner. 7.Smart city application
    The smart city needs to majorly focus on activities like healthcare, traffic,
    street lights. Intelligent technologies like ICT, IoT, sensors etc. and analysis
    of data are the key requirements to improving the citizen’s standard of life.
    The important application of smart city (Fig. 10) are smart healthcare, smart
    traffic management system, smart emergency system, smart street light, a virtual
    power plant in smart grid etc. Peoples have a number of reasons like job opportunities,
    education, and many more to move from one city to another even in an epidemic
    like Covid-19. In smart cities data is fetched and analyzed through IoT devices
    like sensors, actuators etc. [102]. Further, this data is used to improve social
    services, infrastructure, and decision-making. This information plays an essential
    role in real-time application and services in urban areas [202]. Fig. 10. Applications
    of smart city. 7.1.Smart healthcare Healthcare is an important service to the
    growth and development of any smart city. In recent years, smart healthcare has
    emerged with the growth of ICT. It is a process of managing one’s health by a
    couple of doctors themselves or virtually [112]. The traditional medical system
    needs to be transformed into smart healthcare in order to become more efficient
    and convenient for patients. With the emergence in technologies like ICT, IoT,
    AI etc. the healthcare industry have transformed from old-fashioned like interaction
    between doctor-patient to new i.e. remote health monitoring [113]. IBM (Armonky,
    NY, USA) came up with the idea of smart healthcare in 2009 [269]. There are some
    challenges while transformation into smart healthcare, these are: healthcare systems,
    equipment are under enormous pressure, healthcare data is growing exponentially,
    inform decision-making process with detailed information, additional wisdom for
    nurses, challenges in consolidating and resolving legal issues, making the patients
    run from one department to another for collecting reports, accurate precision
    diagnostics, and right measurements. With the increase of population, these challenges
    are also heightened with demanding health services. The preponderance of industrialized
    nations is facing vital difficulties regarding the quality and cost of numerous
    healthcare and wellbeing services [3]. Due to limited resources, some cities are
    deprived of proper healthcare services. In view of this, there is a need for new
    systems, smart healthcare. In the field of smart healthcare, devices, the internet,
    and IoT can connect people with each other, as well as manage healthcare activities
    and resources. Smart healthcare is one of the highest levels of knowledge building
    in the medical field [108]. To collect information dynamically, liking between
    institutions and healthcare, smart healthcare is used to take advantage of advanced
    technologies, devices like wearable, mobile internet, and the IoT. Smart healthcare
    can reduce workload at the information desk, and also Help patients and their
    wards. 7.1.1.Evolution of healthcare Various authors and researchers in their
    studies are categories the healthcare system in different generations (Fig. 11)
    (Healthcare 1.0–Healthcare 5.0). The different functionality evolution of healthcare
    system are discussed as: Healthcare 1.0: – In the year between 1970–1990 the first
    evolution ‘Healthcare 1.0’ was introduced. Due to limited digital resources, it
    was restricted to paper documentation. It was mainly focused on improving the
    efficiency of health services and a reduction in paperwork. The revolution transformed
    the home remedy system and the untrained physicians who provide paternal care
    into a more sophisticated, intelligent, and data-driven system that can be called
    the “medical complex”. In the 1830s the British government start piping the water
    to homes, when the plague was caused due to drinking of polluted water [114,171].
    Shortly thereafter, the scientific vaccine theory was established [48]. In the
    19th century, a better environment for healthy living integrated measures for
    sanitation, infection control, vaccination, and epidemiology surveys have been
    created. Fig. 11. Health generation. Healthcare 2.0: – The era of Healthcare 2.0
    was between 1991–2005, the main focus was to combine with digital technology.
    Industrial machinery kept working and changing. In the 20th century to increase
    the productivity of cheap products, the automobile industry introduces the concept
    of mass production [120]. The healthcare system also follows the same. At the
    end of the 19th century, few large pharmaceutical companies were formed [214].
    A few years later various antibiotics were introduced, with the advent of mass-industrial
    manufacturing technology [299]. Also at that time in medical education importance
    was given to both clinical training and basic science education [93]. Hospitals
    are expanding, being provided by more specialists, and doctors are being trained
    to deal with more patients with complex conditions. The main focus is on building
    a part of healthcare 2.0 [58]. The second version of healthcare is aimed at improving
    productivity and data sharing. The focus on information sharing is not limited
    to within the organization but among a group of other healthcare providers. The
    new version is entrenched in response to the symptoms, illness, and needs of the
    individual. Information was shared with other organizations with privacy and security.
    It was electrical energy-oriented. Healthcare 3.0: – The era of healthcare 3.0
    was between 2006–2015. In this evolution, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) were
    introduced. It helps the doctors in accessing patient records through cloud gateway.
    It was a step towards creating a value-based model based on Telecommunication
    and information communication technology (TICT), which provides database enhancement
    and additional data efficiency to prevent medical-related problems [1]. The advent
    of microcontrollers in the 1980s allowed for the production of small computers
    and fast-tracking environments, as well as large data storage [127,255]. With
    advanced computer technology, tomography jumped from single images to redesigned
    images, and doctors could diagnose ulcers with more information and diagnose diseases
    earlier. Doctors are provide evidence-based medicine after diagnosis disease [85].
    They have additional information gathered from e-libraries using fast computer
    technologies. Healthcare 3.0 focused on providing emergency care and was able
    to ensure preventive care before the onset of illness or symptoms of the disease.
    Internet changes learning because much medical literature is available at e-libraries.
    In Healthcare 3.0 major concern is to use technologies like BDA and IoT-based
    wearable devices along with advanced E-Medical record databases. Healthcare 4.0:
    – From 2016 to 2020, the era of Healthcare 4.0 was introduced with patient-centric
    healthcare services with the advent of new technologies and IoT devices [261].
    This healthcare evolution is inspired by ‘Industry 4.0’ by establishing personalized
    healthcare platforms and augmented virtualization [271]. It was focused on smart
    devices, involving capabilities of empowering data analytics with ML, DL, AI,
    and IoT for the detection of diseases, [151]. It is the successive approach of
    1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Patients get medicine from suppliers by using their websites
    and also get medical assistance through blogs [240]. In this case, patient records
    are shared with healthcare professionals via an e-Health record over the cloud
    or on the LAN, where many patients and healthcare workers can be connected. It
    helps the physician to access patient records anywhere and also communicate with
    fellow doctors for better treatment. However, data sharing has introduced new
    challenges such as authentication, security, and authority, and so on, [280].
    New hands & a new brain, which includes robots, mini-laboratories, wearable devices,
    and 3D printers. Every device works faster and more efficiently; illnesses can
    be quickly diagnosed using a drop of blood; custom-designed surgery of body joints
    can be performed, and bone framework can be prepared using 3D printing [280].
    Healthcare 4.0 also involves technologies like robotic surgery, CC, CPS, information
    security, and many more. Healthcare 5.0: – The era of healthcare 5.0 began in
    2020 and is going on. This machine includes AI features such as a robot nurse,
    a smart IoT device, and a 6G network speed. [186]. With latency (10–100 ms) and
    reliability (99.9999%) [150], and based on ultra-high accuracy for remote connections
    [314], 6G communication addresses reliability and latency issues in smart cities.
    Why not 5G? According to [141] 5G will fall short of meeting future demands for
    big data connections such as holographic communications (e.g., 3D video conferencing),
    games, and telesurgery. This evolution comes up with device-to-device, machine-to-machine,
    and human-to-machine communication. The human-machine cooperation and participation
    improve the diagnosis system and fast results. This system is more secure than
    its predecessors. A blockchain-based architecture for healthcare applications
    that automatically collects data and removes unreliable systems from external
    companies. The system is not dependent on a single-point failure due to a decentralized
    network [150]. The evolution of the healthcare system has also been succinct in

    New and untested technology Run in only smart city, by integrating modern software
    and technologies decision making is complex process Facilities in Smart Healthcare:
    – The main participants in smart healthcare are research institutes and hospitals,
    patients, and doctors. Smart healthcare has many benefits, like disease prevention
    and monitoring, diagnosis and treatment, hospital management, health decision-making,
    and medical research. ICT, IoT, AI, 5G internet, big data, and modern biotechnology
    are the foundations of the intelligent healthcare room, according to [108]. Doctors
    use Laboratory Information Management system, Electronic medical record etc. for
    managing health data [207]. 7.1.2.Challenges in smart healthcare Trusted Communication:
    – Many medical devices experience network failure, which is unacceptable when
    real-time data access is required. It is challenging to maintain connections on
    mobile devices such as wearable devices while moving anywhere a patient walks,
    crossing boundaries, and covering areas. In mobile devices, switching the network
    to the most powerful available signal also affects data generation. The different
    amounts of data are generated while switching to the network, which is dependent
    on the roaming relationship between the SIM provider and the location of the feed.
    As there are many subcategories for mobile connectivity, we should also adjust
    the network type and location to the value, speed, audio, and video required by
    our device. Cyber security: – Cyber security is one of the challenges when we
    talk about smart healthcare. As it requires internet access and IoT devices, the
    data may be stolen or attackers may attack data or modify the data. So the first
    priority of the healthcare system is to ensure the privacy of patients and their
    data. There are some private IoT-based networks (e.g. APNs, VPNs, and IPsec protocol)
    that are available, which create private areas only accessible by authorized users
    or devices. Scalable Platforms: – The smooth functioning of a smart healthcare
    system, a scalable platform is required. For the effectiveness of a smart healthcare
    system to be enhanced, it must be integrated and supported seamlessly with patients
    and their big data. So, the authorized professionals, physicians, and patients
    use the devices and system easily for monitoring remotely. Cost: – Meet, the requirements
    of the healthcare system are also cost-effective. The healthcare system may take
    less time for decision-making and information gathering. So, it must require new
    tools and techniques for efficient storage and retrieval. Data Availability: –
    The availability of data is facing some issues like resource management and device
    identification. Systems don’t need any redundancy; they only need consistent data.
    So it requires identifying the resources and storage management with new technologies
    in healthcare systems. Data Security: – While accessing the data, it is mandatory
    that only the authorized user can access the concerned data. It still needs to
    be improved. Unique Identification: – In the healthcare system, it is required
    to uniquely identify patients by their doctor and vice versa. This is required
    for providing or getting the best and correct treatment. Privacy Issue: – This
    is one of the major issues while we are talking about big data and IoT devices
    in a smart city. Many kinds of research provide many tools and techniques. But
    still, it needs to be improved. Device Communication: – Machine to machine, a
    device to machine, and human to machine communication is challenging. Patients
    need a quick response to their records, medical tests, and medical reports. A
    5G/6G network is required for the smooth transformation of data communication.
    It is cost-effective, and also required some tools and algorithms for privacy
    and data exchanges. Data Integrity: – Ensuring the integrity of healthcare data
    is also challenging because it is important for providers to use it in making
    decisions about patient care. It is also required for information exchange between
    doctors and patients. 7.1.3.Application of PDS in smart healthcare Due to the
    rapid growth in the population and an epidemic, hospitals are overburdened and
    overcrowded. Patients are struggling to find the doctor’s office and pre-body
    check-up center. Patients and their guardians also face the issue of understanding
    medical terms, and they need someone’s help to get the proper information. For
    that, a proper healthcare system is required with the use of new technologies
    like sensors, IoT, ICT, etc. On one hand, the IoT has benefited patients, physicians,
    hospitals, and health insurance companies. On the other hand, challenges have
    increased. Because sensors and IoT have produced massive amounts of data, To handle
    this data, the following is the application of PDS which may be used in smart
    healthcare systems: Data Processing: – The data generated by devices is homogeneous
    or heterogeneous, semi-structured or unstructured, which will result in the traffic
    load on switches. The storage capacity of switches is limited, so the performance
    of routing may be compromised. A scheme ‘BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom Filter-based
    Secure rule-space management’ is proposed for Software Defined Networking (SDN)
    [245]. The scheme uses two self-dependent hash functions for security checks and
    also manages the network resources to handle the traffic in data. Smart healthcare
    systems provide system-assistance analysis for dedicated medical care to patients.
    The security of this data is in danger. The data security features are improved
    to prevent unauthorized access to information in healthcare systems. BF is also
    useful in data transmission elimination [300]. Data Sharing: – The Garbled Bloom
    filter is used to support authentic search results and secure data sharing for
    multiple users [260] in the Verifiable Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (VMKSE).
    This scheme supports single-keyword search. The author also compares his programme
    with a modern solution to evaluate its effectiveness. This scheme helps in doctor-patient
    data sharing. The multi-keyword search verification mechanism is introduced based
    on pseudo-random and it is IoT-cloud-enabled for healthcare data systems [283].
    The mechanism also takes care of authentication and advanced encryption with advanced
    privacy of data. BF is used in a secure two-dimensional calculation protocol,
    to compare a unit of characters and record [277]. Data Security and Privacy-Preserving
    System: – The use of IoT in smart cities plays a big role in smart healthcare.
    A huge amount of data is exchanged between machines, humans, and devices. This
    big data can be encrypted and then stored on a cloud so that only authenticated
    users can access it. There are also privacy issues. A scheme for efficiently sharing
    data is proposed to address this issue. The author uses attribute-based encryption
    with attribute BF to control access. While transforming data or sharing sensitive
    information, a lot of privacy concerns may arise. Xu et al. propose a scheme using
    BF, which is privacy-preserving for patient health information for sharing information
    [293]. The author uses an encrypted search method that allows numerical search
    for encrypted data. The BF and message verification code are used to filter patient
    data and check the accuracy of search results. Liu et al. design cooperative privacy
    preservation for wearable devices that ensure authenticity and consideration for
    controlling data access in the context of space and time information [162]. In
    space-aware, they use MinHash-based authentication, and in time-aware, attribute-based
    encryption is applied. They adopted BF to determine the existence of sensitive
    data in storage without exposing secret information, and for secure data interaction,
    positive and negative filters are used. Seham A., et al. [11] introduce a system
    for infection control with the use of Blockchain for privacy-preserving. In this
    system, one leader elected by authority updates the two BFs, one for infected
    users and the other for close contact users. Two BF are used for infected and
    suspected users, which reduces the storage space. The block size of the COVID-19
    status ledger with and without using BF is also compared (Fig. 12). Fig. 12. Status
    ledger’s block size with and without using BF. [11]. Fast Response and Congestion
    control: – The number of connected devices in the network (like traffic lights,
    vehicles, laptops, smartphones, etc.) is increasing exponentially. For resource
    sharing and effective communication, all devices with different configurations
    have to be integrated into the same network. Due to the rapid growth of these
    devices, the traffic in the network also increases, causing difficulty in predicting
    traffic patterns. G. S. Aujla et al. propose an approach to handle these issues.
    “Blockchain-as-a-Service for Software Defined Network (SDN) in Smart City Applications”
    is mentioned [23]. Multiple etiquette firmware can be integrated into a single
    network using the SDN controller [22]. In “Software-defined Content Dissemination
    Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-19 like Scenarios”, [111]
    introduces a new way to find the right online distribution channel described in
    the healthcare ecosystem software. Internet of Healthcare Vehicle (IoHV) is an
    emerging concept that depends on smart transport, including ambulances and additional
    healthcare vehicles (testing Covid-19 immediately). To connect to the internet,
    especially when possible, for testing COVID-19 immediately and contact tracing,
    this IoHV is helpful and is deployed across a smart city setup. All healthcare
    vehicles are connected to each other through different types of links: vehicle-to-pedestrian
    (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and cellular links [147]. To overcome congestion and improve response,
    the global information of devices is stored in the deletable BF in the proposed
    framework. While implementing in the real world, there are many ambient intelligence
    challenges. Some of them related to healthcare are listed below: Adopting Advance
    healthcare technology: Almost all medical devices are connected to IoT devices.
    The management systems like appointments, patient administration, laboratory information,
    etc. are now handled by ML and AI. So it is necessary to develop a connected network
    of healthcare leaders, clinics, manufacturers, and software development companies.
    which enhances the new business models and also helps adopt the new technologies.
    Integration between healthcare services: The massive amount of data is generated
    while using medical devices and AI-integrated applications. Many top healthcare
    companies lack data management systems and new architecture. Rising Healthcare
    cost: The rising costs of healthcare are always a serious issue, which includes
    the manufacturing cost of healthcare vehicles and disease detection and testing
    processes. Due to this, many patients skip lab tests and do regular follow-ups.
    Payment Verification: – In this digital world and epidemic, the maximum number
    of transactions is done digitally and payment verification is required. In this
    lieu, Pratim et al. a lightweight payment verification based on the blockchain
    using BF is proposed as IoT-Assisted e-Healthcare [223]. If BLWN simply asks for
    the full location of a small set of blocks/topics, there may be a chance for privacy
    leaks as the full area can peer into BLWNs’ assets. It may allow the full site
    to call for Denial of Services (DoS) and the insignificant liaison service for
    funds available from BLWN. Therefore, it may be completely overwhelmed by the
    great difficulty in its ability to make a computer while crashing its system.
    Real Time Analysis/Support: – Wearable devices are mainly used in real-time Electronic
    Health Records (EHR) collection. Obviously, encryption is required for searching
    targeted EHRs by medical institutions. In this reference, Yuan et al. [259] propose
    a scheme in which medical institutions can search and access EHRs in the cloud.
    They improve the search accuracy and privacy of users in EHRs. To improve search
    efficiency, the Cuckoo filter is used and gives a facility to data owners for
    modification (insert and delete) in their EHRs in the cloud. 7.2.Smart transportation
    For moving from one place to another, horses and camels were used for a long time
    in society. The world has entered the next phase of the movement, namely smart
    transport, with the advent of new technologies and smart transportation systems
    [180]. “Moving smarter is not our future – it is already our present”, says Lisa
    Jerram, senior analyst at Pike Research, simply to make sure the easy journey
    is acceptable as cities become more populous and face potential budget crises
    by building new infrastructure, as is the case in Europe, North America and Japan,
    [38]. According to [274], the population of the world’s urban areas increased
    from 29% to 50% between 1950 and 2008, and it is expected to increase to 70% by
    2050. 7.2.1.Application of smart transportation To meet the increased demand of
    citizens, the easy option is to provide then better transport services. With this
    the growth in supply of automobile is increases, due to that the traffic congestion
    is also increases. The attraction to the development of smart transport system
    took a lot of attention to addressing traffic congestion and rapid urban growth
    [71]. It is identified that the implementation of smart technologies is the key
    factor in gaining intelligence and stability [107,233]. Also several researchers
    shown that how this sustainability achieving the environmental and economic efficiency
    [71,115]. Therefore, sustainable transportation is very important in today’s society.
    There are various application under smart transportation are discussed as follows:
    Smart Street Light: – Smart city should also needs to upgrade Road street light
    to smart street light. It helps in reducing the energy consumption by dimming
    the lights. This saved energy are then used for other services like pollution
    monitoring, update about whether, GPS etc. and also help in signing available
    parking in nearby area. But smart street lights are depending on its feature and
    requirements, and involve a combination of cameras and sensors. Sensors and Cameras
    are collecting the data can either process locally if street light have computing
    device or propagate through network. These devices can detect the movement which
    enable dynamic lighting and dimming [102]. Chen et al. present a system which
    used for controlling the street lights using TX2 device and also help in updating
    the parking status to users (Fig. 13). Fig. 13. Smart street light scenario [59].
    Intelligent Transportation System (ITS): – Today, the state-of-the-art transport
    system is heavily influenced by Machine Learning (ML) and Dynamic Range Learning
    (DRL) based strategies to detect autonomous vehicles, dispatch passengers in a
    safe manner and ensure the safety of vehicles. ITS uses the various advance technologies
    like senros, IoT devices, ICT and many more [302]. The huge amount of data is
    being generated by these IoT devices and sensors which contributes to the concept
    of intelligent cities and the future of ITS [312]. The techniques like AI, ML,
    and especially DRL play an important role as an integral part of sustainable in
    precisely monitoring and measuring real-time data traffic flow in an urban area
    [301,305]. The various applications of ITS are discussed by [302] like: The intelligent
    highway in Britain, which reduces the traffic and accident rate, The CRITER system
    in Lyon, France, offers transportation workers a schematic plan like a map and
    also predicts the bottleneck points. In Japan, electronic toll collections (ETC)
    measure the physical characteristics of vehicles and check and deduct charges
    automatically if they are in ETC. It is useful to avoid illegal entry into the
    city. Include IoT in ITS to build a system where communication between road facilities,
    vehicles, and management equipment is done without barriers. The Global Positioning
    System (GPS) is replaced by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in the IoT to
    become the Smart Transportation System (STS). The author also discusses the services
    for passengers on public transport, like service range, charging, security control,
    and administration. Availability of Parking: – With the rapid growth of vehicles
    in the city, it is a trick for drivers to find available parking. This dilemma
    is seen as an opportunity to increase the efficiency of parking facilities, thereby
    decreasing road accidents and taking less time to find free space in a smart city.
    The troubles related to parking and traffic congestion could be solved if drivers
    were aware in advance of the availability of parking in the area and surrounding
    areas [39]. A smart and automated system that can detect empty parking spaces
    can reduce search time, by finding out where parking is available and bypassing
    lawful information to drivers. Maria et al. proposed an image processing system
    that takes video as input from a drone and feeds it into a frame extraction block
    [176]. These frames are then preprocessed to reduce complexity. These systems
    may be improved if the availability of data and the techniques to manage this
    data were improved or changed with new technologies. Street lights can also play
    an important role in detecting empty parking spaces in open environments. Traditional
    parking (sensor-based) occupancy systems are more expensive, as demonstrated by
    [59]. They use Jetson TX2, an NVIDIA’s Computer Unified Device Architecture embedded
    artificial intelligence supercomputer, which has high power efficiency. This system
    works both day and night with an on-off street parking smart control system. Parking
    space is detected by marker-based image processing using the onboard camera of
    an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [67]. Traffic Control: – The authorities are
    facing chaos trying to manage the traffic with an increase of vehicles on the
    roads. Because of a lack of human resources, authorities are moving toward smart
    traffic control to manage the city’s traffic. To reduce congestion in the context
    of VANETs, robots can play a key role. The aim of smart robots is to give information
    to avoid ideal roads and manage traffic congestion in urban areas. To detect illegal
    traffic behaviour or traffic violations, the system uses street cameras [66].
    But it is not possible to install street cameras everywhere in the city. Modern
    cars with video storage cameras have been introduced to control traffic violations
    in the city. These cars capture the videos in the city and report any violations
    that happen to the authorities. Rathore et al. propose a system to detect the
    front car and road line using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Hough
    transform for self-driving. A violation detection algorithm is designed for the
    fog device smart to identify driving violations, U-turns, and driving central
    dividers [222]. Steve Mazur has also presented a traffic control system (Fig.
    14) in [180]. Fig. 14. Smart traffic control [180]. Automated Toll Collection:
    – To decrease the fuel consumption used in automobiles, the use of the cream road
    is required. The government and road contractors are working on making the new
    highways and flyovers in the cities, and contractors are installing their toll
    on those roads to complete their expenses. Motorists and commuters are spending
    their valuable time at the toll plazas paying the amount of tax. Due to this,
    the parking problem, traffic congestion, and pollution are increasing near the
    toll plaza. Commuters are also facing delays, which increases the travel time
    for their journey [34]. Automatic toll collection is on the rise nowadays, both
    by governments and researchers. The main concern with this automated toll collection
    system, the RIFD tag, is that it is installed on the windshield of vehicles. To
    collect the required amount, the vehicles pass through the sensor system before
    the tollgate [134]. Regular user may also have facility of prepaid smart cards.
    So that the traffic at tollgates can be avoided. M.A. Berlin et al. propose an
    alert message based toll collection system using smart Road Side Unit (RSU) [34].
    This system also helps in stopping the payment violation by send the alert message
    if the any vehicle violate the toll payment. This system is totally man free and
    barricade free, which also help in rush hours to handle the traffic [34]. As the
    use RIFD tags not only the time is saved but also eliminate the corruption in
    toll plazas [8]. Smart Mobility: – Smart mobility is also the main concern in
    smart transportation as it is consistent with the development of a sustainable
    world [101]. In particular, either ICT is the initiative to smart mobility or
    a complete failure [31]. Smart Mobility is providing solutions to users by using
    new technologies like IoT, ICT etc. Some tourists use apps to plan their journey,
    but they get limited information and priorities for travel recommendations [205].
    Smart mobility is also helpful for citizens to roam and move freely in the vicinity
    of a smart city. Smart mobility also helps in improving the traffic control system
    by giving access to other routes in emergencies or traffic jams. Intelligent navigators
    facilitate providing routes and navigating to essential services like ambulances
    and government. can be facilitated by intelligent navigation. In the coming year,
    smart mobility transform into mobility as a service paradigm, like car-sharing
    [205]. 7.2.2.Benefits of smart transportation Figure 15 explores a picture of
    smart transportation in the city. Smart transportation has many benefits, some
    of them are discussed as. Fig. 15. Smart transportation [180]. Smart Transportation
    is safer: – In smart transport the integration of ML with IoT, 5G help in reducing
    traffic and road accidents. In these IoT devices, cameras and other safety devices
    help in monitoring the traffic situation and intimate the same to users for improving
    road safety. Smart Transportation is better managed: – Smart transportation facilitates
    the public administration by allowing to monitor the performance of road safety
    and traffic. It also gives information on critical sources of problems and tracks
    where maintenance is required. Smart Transport is very effective: – With better
    management of resources in smart transport gives more efficient results. If we
    are having quality data, then easily identify the areas where improvement is required.
    It also provides better-quality filling rates. Smart Transportation is more cost-effective:
    – Smart transportation also helps in reducing the cost by providing the best shortest
    routes, giving information regarding facilities available with approx distance
    and price, and many more. Commuters also take benefit if they get affordable public
    transport as compared to hiring a private CAB. Smart Parking Management: – In
    smart parking the driver or car owner can’t face the problem of finding the available
    space for parking. The system provides the information by collecting real-time
    data from connected devices and sensors. Smart Traffic Management: – With the
    smart traffic management system users can get information about congestion on
    road. So that they can plan their journey accordingly. Smart Transportation provides
    instant information: – Smart transport system can also provide information instantly
    regarding the issue in the city, traffic congestion, and problem areas using traffic
    management centers. They also ensure public safety and provide information on
    affordable insurance plans. Integrated Ticket Systems: – It will also provide
    diverse services to citizens by providing the intelligent ticket system in some
    local services. 7.2.3.Challenges in smart transportation A large number of vehicles
    in major cities around the world has posed major transportation and stability
    challenges, like air pollution, traffic congestion and energy problems [284].
    Following are some challenges to smart transportation. Security: – Vulnerable
    to cyberattacks is one of the biggest fears among smart city dwellers. Cyber attacks
    are more common to criminals as the world’s connectivity to the internet increases.
    The data flow during the smart transport management system are may be hacked or
    used to thief the vehicle if there is no secure communication. The security of
    data used in toll collection systems is also in danger. During finding the available
    parking space user share their location, this also may create problems in user
    security. Data Privacy: – User data cannot be retrieved without their knowledge.
    The user’s personal identity must not be identified or traced. Data privacy in
    smart transport is the main concern. Under the new law, data processing must have
    legitimate. Supply Chain: – Due to epidemics like Covid-19 the global supply chain
    is affected. While transportation may face various problems during this epidemic.
    Due to that many businesses are affected. When the drivers may ill and move from
    one region to another it may cause public health. Environmental Problem: – With
    the rapid growth in the automobile industry the traffic on roads also increases.
    This may affect the air quality and water pollution in nearby residential areas.
    The environmental problems caused by the IoT devices are currently serious and
    need to be addressed urgently [180]. Health Concern: – Health concern is also
    one of the challenges to smart transportation. If the transport system is not
    connected to hospitals, then it may cause major problems or may loss their lives
    in road accidents. The system needs to improve its service on road, and proper
    intimation of the concerns (hospitals and police stations). 7.2.4.Applications
    of PDS in smart transport The traffic on roads in both rural and urban areas is
    increasing day by day. It needs to smartly manage the traffic and distribute the
    traffic load by making the transport system to be smart. It includes smart parking,
    smart street lights, violation check on the roads, traffic control system etc.
    Data Dissemination: – It means the statistical data is transmitted or distributed
    to end-users. In Pursuing a Pub/Sub Internet(PURSUIT) project use BF to store
    the path information in source routing. The main scenario of this project is general
    data dissemination [16]. Privacy Preserving: – The IoT devices and sensors are
    used to collect and exchange a huge amount of data, to improve the transport system.
    As Cloud Computing progressed, more sensitive information (like vehicle registration
    number, chassis number, insurance detail,etc.) was released to the cloud. The
    most accurate way to protect data privacy is to encrypt data before extracting
    it [253]. Enabling keyword searches directly over encrypted data is a desirable
    way to make the best use of encrypted data. Wang et al. has proposed a brand new
    idea for acquiring multiple keywords (compound keywords) in random search [282].
    Unlike most existing keyword search programs, the program eliminates the requirement
    of a predefined keyword dictionary. 7.3.Smart environment Many developed cities
    suffer from poor air quality as population and industry growth rapidly. Increasing
    acceptance of smart transport data in smart cities around the world has provided
    unprecedented opportunities to improve air quality management in transportation
    [284]. Government agencies and residents are increasingly concerned with air grade,
    which contributes to a wide range of human environments and human development.
    The most common methods of predicting air pollution especially utilize low-level
    simulations. These standards produce disappointing effects that have led to aspects
    influencing the measurement of air corrosion based on the overall structure of
    the building. Estimating air quality using atmospheric scattering standards is
    time-consuming. Modeling incorporated testing is a new expansion to measure air
    pollution and conservatory gases in an intelligent environment. Normally, maximum
    houses in a smart city are used solar and wind turbines for green energy [140].
    Liu et al. suggested a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in planning smart environment
    in smart cities, which predict air quality that assists Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE)
    [165]. LSTM is used to evaluate air quality forecasts in smart cities. The internal
    components that occur due to air pollution are removed by optimizing SAE. The
    total error rate is 0.46 and the class accuracy of 91.22% is shown by this model,
    it still needs to be improved. Jovanovska et al. proposed and air quality system
    based on IoT and Cloud computing [130]. They visualize and control air pollution
    using mobile applications. Sulfur oxide (SO2), Ozone(O3), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
    and most important PM10 and PM2.5 are common indicators of contamination that
    cause health risks like heart and lung diseases. So, improving the quality of
    air is a good effort by everyone for the weather and health of every citizen.
    7.3.1.Challenges in smart environment The major challenges for the environment
    are water pollution, air quality, and radiation. To achieve sustainable growth
    by maintaining a healthy society proper vigilance is needed in the world. With
    the development of IoT and smart sensors, Smart Environmental Monitoring (SEM)
    is the system for environmental monitoring, in the latest years [273]. Figure
    16 shows various issues of environment like temperature, radiation, dust, humidity,
    ultraviolet signal etc. For establishing the system Silvia et al. used the WSN
    which provides an interface between smart sensors and IoT Devices [273]. Fig.
    16. Challenges in smart environment. Air quality Monitoring: – Due to the rapid
    increase in traffic and industries, air pollution is one of the primary concerns
    of our epoch. The earth is becoming increasingly polluted due to the emissions
    of harmful gases like CO, NO2, SO2, and CO2. These toxic gases can’t be predicted
    because there are dissolve in the air. So, the air quality needs to be checked,
    and for that, an IoT-based tool is required. An IoT device can collect and analyze
    the data to predict the air quality either good or bad. Sensors using Raspberry
    Pi/ Arduino and IoT devices can monitor the local air quality [175]. Dhingra et
    al. develop an application i.e. “IoT-Mobair”, which is mobile-based use to monitor
    and detect the air pollution of the concerned area [76]. This mobile-based application
    has various features like air quality, daily forecasts, health-related tips, and
    risks, air quality map generations etc. But, when dealing with big data generated
    from sensors, then this application has faced some computational complexity problems.
    For that Dhingra et al. have suggested using fog computing instead of cloud computing.
    The IoT is a global system of “smart devices” which can detect and communicate
    with the environment and interact with users and other applications. Qian et al.
    found that due to low sensitivity and low accuracy the exiting monitoring system
    does not work well and it also requires laboratory analysis [218]. The data is
    highly correlated in the case of air pollution monitoring, where these systems
    are leads to a lot of obsolete information. To the data delivery cost and to alleviate
    data neglect Qian et al. the system i.e. ‘Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution
    Monitoring (CIAM)’. In CIAM, the content method is used to compile and integrate
    air pollution data. Water quality Monitoring: – Monitoring of water quality is
    important in determining water safety and related public health [256]. Water quality
    parameters are determined by the same factors as physical, chemical, and biological.
    Bacterial contamination, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, dispersion, free chlorine,
    and pH are the typical parameters of water quality [215,219]. The various research
    papers have been studied in terms of intelligent water pollution control systems
    using ML, IoT, and smart sensors. The pollution of water in the lake can be predicted
    using an ML-based neural network for machine-reading which analyzes the sensed
    image [160]. The water is classified as pure or polluted, and we studied the separation
    of water pollution with the use of ML methods and IoT devices [61]. The prediction
    of water quality parameters using AI and neural networks and the amounts of sulfate
    or chloride present in water were studied [220]. In order to separate the pollutants
    in water using SVM, the analysis of big data and problems faced during the separation
    of water pollution were discussed [46]. AI-SVM is a classification system used
    for real-time monitoring and technology used for testing and its separation from
    non-drinking water [41,128]. Video-based monitoring of water quality and pollution
    was investigated, which used IoT video surveillance and ML tools to separate dirty
    and clean water [208]. To predict the future and quality of water before use,
    another function which is a feature-based model, also helped in analyzing the
    water suggested [311]. Different ML models were used to test the concentration
    of chlorophyll-A in pond water and were also recommended for real-time water management
    system [163]. Agriculture Monitoring System: – The growth of industrial and robust
    agricultural production methods has accelerated to ensure the quality and quantity
    of the growing demand for food [249]. In “smart or green agriculture”, Smart Environment
    Monitoring (SEM) plays an important role as agriculture is the relevant growth
    factor for any nation [210]. It also helps in product development and sustainable
    growth to handle major challenges in the agriculture sector [196,239]. Ullo et
    al. refer to the smart agriculture scenarios (Fig. 17), where the SEM system is
    a smart agricultural monitoring system in real. In the agriculture sector, various
    factors are very important for achieving sustainable production, like water level,
    water pollution level, moisture analysis, soil health etc. These features are
    included in the smart agricultural monitoring system, which is monitored and controlled
    using IoT devices, smart sensors for agriculture data capturing, and WSN to transmit
    data into the cloud [273]. Fig. 17. Smart agriculture monitoring system using
    IoT devices and sensors. In the new agricultural era, there is a growing market
    for IoT that offers a few creative solutions. The various studies and research
    on Smart Agricultural Monitoring systems (SAM) are discussed, which include fertilizer
    control, crop monitoring measures, pest control, etc. Kumar et al. propose a system
    for plant growth monitoring i.e. ‘gCrop’ using IoT, ML and WSN [148]. They use
    a 3rd-degree regression model and provide a prediction with a high computational
    complexity of 98% accuracy. Shinde and Pathak et al. performed a crop quality
    test to monitor the quality of paddy rice using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR)
    data [242]. In the rice quality test, SVMs were used with limited sample size
    and back distribution features. The land and its size play an important role in
    checking the growth level of different crop species that are either satisfactory
    or not. To measure the leaf index Hosseini et al. propose a system with a Gaussian
    process model [91] and using SVM as ML method and reported 89% with a limited
    sample size [119]. To determine the level of fertilizer, pesticides, and water
    quantity used for plant irrigation, an expert system using AI was developed [78]
    using the Naive Bayes [17] method and studying ML using sensory data taken from
    agriculture. UAV is used [77] to investigated the crop quality tests [230] and
    soil health for phenological data of soybean crop [49]. Smart farming [42], pest
    monitoring [164], and crop monitoring [311] are important in the various uses
    of SEM systems. Weather and the environment also affect the health and growth
    of plants. Ullu et al. propose a technique that checks the condition of the soil,
    moisture, air, and water quality, temperature etc. in the context of SEM using
    IoT devices, AI, and smart sensors [273]. The data analysis is performed while
    smart agriculture provides estimation, assisting protection, decision making,
    and storage management [249]. The data is moving while performing the techniques
    to achieve smart agriculture, and various challenges are faced by both farmers
    and researchers. Some of them are addressed below. 7.3.2.Challenges in smart agriculture
    To increase food production, farmers will face many challenges. The production
    will increase 70% by the year 2050 [122]. Various challenges in agriculture have
    been discussed (Fig. 18) as. Fig. 18. Challenges in smart agriculture. Irrigation
    management: – One of the objectives of an irrigation system is to calculate the
    water requirement for crops based on collected data and water flow without interference
    from humans. Irrigation systems use dispersed sensors to monitor the different
    soils, water bodies, vegetation, and microscopic elements. Climate is one of the
    most important variables in estimating agricultural water requirements. A farmer
    can adjust his irrigation system in a variety of ways according to soil and weather
    conditions [216]. The entire farm can track, manage, and forecast weather from
    almost anywhere. IoT will help in developing the new infrastructure for irrigation
    in a very exciting way. Smart IoT-operated irrigation systems use embedded sensors
    in the field to monitor soil structures, climate, and agricultural irrigation
    conditions. Soil management: – Soil monitoring is one of the most challenging
    agricultural activities for both businesses and farmers. Various soil parameters
    like pH, humidity, etc. are involved in soil management and IoT sensors can be
    used to calculate these parameters. Soil management helps in finding the right
    kind of plants and helps to identify fertilizer requirements in the soil. Crop
    production can be affected by soil testing due to a number of environmental concerns.
    The process and patterns of farming can easily be understood, if these types of
    problems are well defined. Crop production may improve and fertilization practices
    can be promoted based on findings of a soil survey study for farmers [37]. The
    moisture and humidity sensors can monitor the moisture in the soil, and IoT technology
    identifies the contaminated soil and shields the field from over-fertilization
    and damage to crops. Agricultural productivity and quality may increase, pollution
    can be avoided, and input costs may be reduced due to soil management. Climate
    management: – Climate has a profound effect on crop production. With the use of
    an IoT-enabled weather forecast system, farmers can determine the best time to
    plant, irrigate, and harvest. With the help of distant sensors attached to the
    field, farmers can learn about natural conditions like humidity, soil moisture,
    and air temperature. On the basis of historical results, to maximize the yield,
    farmers should properly prepare and market the harvest and irrigation season.
    By editing and updating the collected data, farmers should take immediate steps
    to ensure a safe crop yield. Many of the right things are put together to maintain
    and establish a good plant environment while living under stringent limits like
    airflow, temperature, CO2, and O2 levels. With the use of IoT-enabled systems,
    where for advanced decisions data can be exchanged between intelligent sensors
    and devices, this can be achieved [288]. Accurate farming: – The traditional method
    of farming to increase yields and preserve crops was based on physical examination.
    If any issue was found, then it was resolved by trial and error after being involved
    in a serious incident on the farm. Farmers will face various different types of
    challenges while farming, like less water, floods, lack of suitable planting space,
    and cost control. Productivity can be improved with the use of IoT in agriculture.
    With the use of gathered information, farmers can organize their farming activities,
    including what seeds they should sow, what crop yields should be expected, the
    time to harvest, and how much fertilizer to use. Example: The natural soil diversity
    of a field is an accurate agricultural practice. The plants can be planted thicker
    and the irrigation can be used sparingly if the soil in a certain area holds more
    water. Alternatively, if the site is used for grazing, we can take more cattle
    than an equivalent area with a lower level of the soil. Nutritional management:
    – As the human body needs proper nutrition to grow, the same plants may require
    accurate nutrition. Nutrients help to produce the best yield when given at the
    right prices and at the right times. Too much and too limited nutrients for plants
    will affect the environment. For example, too much phosphorus, ammonia, or nitrogen
    may reduce water levels. To grow in one place, the selection of the best crop
    cycle allows for balancing soil fertility. While reducing environmental degradation
    and economic costs, achieving sustainable agriculture, nutrition, and technology
    are essential [6]. Garbage Management: – The wastage of water, soil, and seeds
    is common during farming. This needs to be controlled, but in an intelligent manner.
    For garbage collection, create smart trash cans using IoT sensors, which can smartly
    sense and collect the garbage. The collected data related to network disposal
    is used to read, store and transmit with the help of these smart trash cans. Garbage
    management can be done with the help of some smart and systematic algorithms [10].
    Livestock monitoring: – Livestock plays an important role in agriculture, so they
    need intention, proper care, timely feeding, etc. It is a growing worldwide issue
    to provide enough food to the world’s people with the growing agricultural production.
    As a result, the importance of livestock management on farms is crucial to survival.
    To improve the quality and quantity of agricultural products, new technology like
    IoT advances is important. It also improves the quality of livestock by allowing
    farmers to make decisions based on data-driven. To monitor the livestock’s welfare
    remotely and identify their habitats, cloud-based technologies are used with power
    communication sensors [50]. The health condition of livestock like respiratory
    rate, digestion, blood pressure, heart rate, and other day and night vital signs
    can be checked by farmers using connected sensors. But the data flow between these
    sensors and smart devices is interrupted or tempered, so it needs to be secure
    and well managed to get efficient results. Farm Management System (FMS): – Smart
    farming promotes productivity while minimizing environmental influences, but this
    smart agriculture technique is merely possible with the help of FMS [97]. With
    the help of WSN and GSM in FMS, farmers can track the entire farm and capture
    the data with a small controller [199]. With the use of sensors and smart devices
    in the field, the identifier is used to provide appropriate awareness of soil,
    fertility, and weather, to the farmers. The data collection and storage, monitoring,
    and analysis of the farm operations can be automated using an IoT-based farm management
    system. It can also help in managing agricultural budgets and business operations.
    The irrigation scheme helps in protecting the farms from animals and pests. But
    also automatic irrigation systems can increase the water consumption [105,137].
    Tracing and tracking: – Satyanarayana et al. [236] develop the structures to remotely
    track soil structure and its status in accordance with the needs of plant culture.
    The different agricultural areas and locations are tracked using GPS devices and
    wireless network connections. The real-time data processing is tracked and approved
    by connecting WSN and ZigBee to other devices like the Central Monitoring Station
    (CMoS), GSM, and GPRS. The GPS also enables the farmer to take actions based on
    notifications sent to the farm manager through SMS or MMS. It is often used in
    agriculture to detect precise location and control capacity, despite it having
    high operating and maintenance costs. Plant management: – The growth of a farmer’s
    crop is most important in farming. Farmers use good seeds, organic fertilizers,
    proper watering etc. for best results. For farmers to protect themselves from
    them, they use chemical medicines and fertilizers, which may later affect the
    human body. So, it required an intelligent system that protects the crop from
    insects and does not affect the human body. This can be done by plant management,
    which involves monitoring and recording the welfare of the crop. The plant and
    its diseases can be detected using RFID chips and IoT sensors. The farmers can
    process the data remotely and take necessary steps like keeping the insects from
    plants. The production of rice for a specific country with a Chinese monitoring
    station using SVM [152]. Farmers can also prevent the risk and plan their farming
    practices by demonstrating an effective calculation strategy for coffee fruit
    [68]. Water Management: – The major challenge in greenhouses is to determine how
    much water is required i.e. water management [281]. Intelligent sensors are installed
    to control the waste of water and operate them by using a variety of IoT techniques.
    Automated drip irrigation is used to control the soil moisture in irrigation and
    storage of water in greenhouses. The farmers are checking the water levels in
    a water tank with their Android phones. With the use of IoT devices and sensors,
    the whole water management is done like the motor is automatically started and
    stopped by checking the level water level. Due to over-irrigation in conventional
    irrigation systems, up to 50% of water is lost [241]. A smart Irrigation system(SIS)
    provides a system to overcome this issue. This system helps the farmers to avoid
    water wastage and improve the quality of their crops through timely irrigation.
    SIS also transmits the knowledge of the field to the farmer using temperature
    and soil sensors. Farmers may also plan and modify their irrigation according
    to the local weather information. For Water Distribution System (WDS) an architecture
    WDSchain’, which is blockchain-based in MATLAB, is proposed [172]. For security,
    various consensus mechanisms are used, and results show a trade-off is required
    between data validation and system complexity (Fig. 19). Fig. 19. Water distribution
    systems chain architecture [172]. Blockchain with Agricultural IoT: – To improve
    agricultural intelligence, data-driven technologies can be allowed a secure data
    storage system. The data collection is often very costly where the inventory,
    agricultural contracts, and information about farm conditions from a reliable
    source can be provided. Developing the trust between providers and consumers and
    establishing a reliable food supply chain, the blockchain technology helps in
    tracking the food for timely payments to stakeholders [191]. To monitor the farm
    and collect the data remotely, smart sensors and cameras were used. To adopt the
    current condition of agricultural land, farmers can use IoT devices as they use
    smartphones anywhere in the world. New technologies like IoT have the potential
    to increase global productivity and reduce the cost of crop production. To face
    the challenges on the farm, the agricultural sector can be restructured by providing
    different IoT-based tools and techniques. A massive amount of unstructured data
    has also been generated and the PDS has the potential to solve issues like handling
    big data with real-time response. 7.3.3.Applications of PDS in smart environment
    Energy efficiency and traffic awareness: – To improve energy efficiency and traffic
    awareness. Yousef et al. propose a scheme in underwater WSN for water pollution
    monitoring [297]. BF is used in the preprocessing step to reduce the number of
    transmissions and eliminate redundancy to save precious energy. This type of project
    is mainly used in deep water like the sea and ocean. Mahmoud et al. use BF for
    customer’s identity and privacy-preserving of transferred data in WDS [173]. They
    also suggest the optimal parameters of BF i.e. for 200 customers with 2000 numbers
    of bits and 7 hash functions. In WDSchain, BF is used to match the authentication
    of network nodes in proof-of-authentication(PoAuth). High-performance communication
    networks: – IoT devices contain many sensors, routers, actuators, and base stations
    that need communications between them and send millions of data that need to deliver
    with high-performance communication networks. IoT devices that may have limited
    power resources or limited integration areas have an important research challenge.
    To increase the performance of IoT communication networks alassery et al. propose
    an efficient mechanism based on BF [12]. BF is used to store the routing information
    after aggregating packets to send receiving packets to upstream routers. Query
    Optimization: – Under the big data domain has been developed an air monitoring
    system, which poses major challenges to data analysis. Peng et al. proposed a
    scheme for query optimization of air quality big data using BF index [211]. The
    efficiency of data collected in the air quality monitoring system is improved.
    They create a Hive data repository in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) file format
    and the Row Group Index (RGI). For basic data types 64-bits ThomasWang’s hash
    function is used and Murmur3 64-bit hash algorithm for string and binary type
    by BF in ORC. Privacy-preserving Data Aggregation and Analysis: – A data aggregation
    algorithm is proposed using BF for privacy data analysis in mobile crowdsensing
    system [212]. 7.4.Smart industry In world development, industrial growth plays
    an important role. When the word comes to mind ‘Industry’, then most people probably
    think that it is a noisy and big place. The growth of the industry has increased
    by 18th century. Due to the lack of technologies owned by the industry, it faces
    various challenges like production, distribution, supply chain management etc
    [279]. By the year 2050, technology will have progressed to the level of autonomy
    [80]. The industries are categorized into three economic sectors: primary, secondary,
    and tertiary [24]. Primary industry: – This sector is concerned with the general
    people, means to sell and supply the products. This sector is place dependent
    because the raw material is extracted from the earth. The operation of this sector
    for economic growth revolves around minerals, earth water, vegetation etc. The
    example of these sectors are farming, mining, and fishing and they extract the
    raw material like coal, foods, corn etc. There are two types of industries under
    the primary sector: The genetic industry and the Extractive Industry. Secondary
    industry: – After the collection of raw material by primary industries the secondary
    industries used this material for construction and manufacturing the products.
    These industries are used to make products like steel for automobiles, textiles
    for cloths, wood for furniture, etc. For manufacturing these products heavy machinery
    is used in the production plant and also required manpower for packaging and distribution.
    The example of these sectors are consumer goods, craft & fashion, construction,
    manufacturing etc. There are two types of industries under this sector: Heavy
    industry and Light industry. Tertiary industry: – The product is manufactured
    from raw material in the above sector and is now ready for use by consumers. Tertiary
    industries generally they are not making any products but only provide services
    to consumers and local industries & markets. The main feature of this sector is
    discussion, experiences, access, etc. The financial and education sectors are
    two groups of tertiary sectors one for making money (financial) and the other
    (education) is non-profitable. Examples of these sectors are banking, educators,
    administrative, medical, financial, insurance, transportation retail, wholesale,
    real estate, hotels, police, defense services, media and information technology
    and so on. There are three types of industries under the tertiary sector: Telecommunication,
    Professional, and Franchises. These industries help in growing the Gross Domestic
    Product (GDP) rate of the country. 7.4.1.Industry evolution The farming and handicraft
    economizing processes changed to be monopolized by industry and manufacturing
    machines in the Industry Revolution. These changes transformed society fundamentally
    in terms of living and working styles. In the 18th century Britain began this
    process and spread all over the world. The production of manufactured goods and
    the use of natural resources have increased after these technological changes
    [294]. The industrial evolution has been categorized in Fig. 20 and succinct as
    given in Table 5. Fig. 20. Industry 1.0–5.0. Table 5 Evolution of smart industry

    system would not work in uncertain situations. Data in the cloud need to improve
    security and privacy. Expert systems are not yet developed for industries. New
    and untested technologies Industry 1.0: – In the years 1760–1850, the first revolution
    was introduced with the mechanical theme [225]. It used steam, coal, and water
    mechanization for the manufacturing process. Production through machines had increased,
    so the rate of production had increased by eight times for conventional methods
    [270]. It also increased the standard of life by creating various goods in massive
    amounts. Human productivity was increased by the use of steam power [83]. Machines,
    stream power, and water power played an important role in the first industrial
    revolution’s growth. If we talk about the developing sectors in this revolution,
    textile manufacture, chemicals, paper machines, cement, iron industry, gaslighting,
    transportation, agriculture, railways, and many more are existing there [291].
    Industry 2.0: – In the year 1880–1973 this revolution was introduced with industrialization
    [131]. With the adoption of new technologies like telephone, electric power, sewage,
    internal combustion engine, etc. this revolution manufactured mass production.
    The sectors that are developed in Industry 2.0 through technology are steel, paper
    making, petroleum, automobile, fertilizer, Iron, chemical, rubber, electrification,
    machine tools, telecommunications, and many more. Mainly this revolution occurs
    in America, Britain, and Germany [193]. Industry 3.0: – In the year 1989–2013,
    the industrial revolution ‘Industry 3.0’ was started. In this industry the production
    was automatically done without human interference so, the production sector grew
    in the engineering field. The automation was fully computerized, which increases
    the efficiency and reliability of the industrial system. But automation also affects
    employment. With the growth in technology, many industries start using robots
    and reducing manpower. Industry robots are designed with programmable integrated
    circuits and give accurate and efficient results. Robots can do painting, welding,
    testing, labeling, etc. It is estimated by the International Federation of Robotics
    there are 1.64 million robots used in industry worldwide [51]. Industry 4.0: –
    In 2011 the industrial revolution ‘Industry 4.0’ was first proposed by the German
    government. In this revolutionary trend, computerization is used in manufacturing
    [149]. The cyber-physical system was developed and all systems are communicated
    using IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning [272,278]. These IoT
    devices help ‘Industry 4.0’ for providing services and also in manufacturing.
    This industry transform information through Industrial IoT (IIoT) [190]. The key
    components of this revolution include IoT, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Cyber Security,
    Cognitive computing, etc. [286]. German was initiative the Industry 4.0 as “smart
    manufacturing for the future” [155]. This revolution has emerged with the aim
    of achieving mass production and increasing productivity using innovative technologies
    i.e. similar to previous revolutions [25,213]. Industry 5.0: – This revolution
    in the industry is declared by the European Commission, after discussions with
    various funding agencies, and organizations in Research and Innovation workshops
    in January 2021. To provide services to humanity this industry focuses on and
    highlights innovation and research. It uses the blockchain concept to integrate
    the generated data from different industries. To achieve social goals like employment,
    the standard of living and development this industry plays a key role [43]. Industry
    5.0 is not entirely new it is the upgrade version of industry 4.0. With growing
    technology, artificial intelligence uses in industries also improved. The capability
    of humans, interaction with computers, and robot workers gives efficient and effective
    results [279]. This industry proposed the 3D techniques (like 3D printing or additive
    manufacturing is used for creating 3D objects) with the use of IoT [80]. 7.4.2.Challenges
    in smart industry Data Security: – As the rapid growth of technologies in the
    smart industry a huge amount of data is moving between IoT devices. The security
    of data is also a major challenge in the smart industry. The data protected and
    safe from unauthorized access is also a challenge to the industry. Data Management:
    – This is also the major challenge when a huge amount of data is following over
    the network and between devices. Data need to be well structured and in a good
    manner to access and get efficient results. Storage: – Storage of industrial big
    data is very tough both for users and developers. Data generated from various
    resources IoT devices are scattered and not filtered. The storage of that type
    of data is not easy. 7.4.3.Applications of PDS in smart industry Remove ambiguity:
    – The data generated in the smart industry is ambiguous. Wang et al. proposed
    a technique “Fingerprint Summary” for cluster data de-duplication which is time
    and space-efficient. They use BF in this technique in each node, for reducing
    data duplication. For efficient detect and remove duplicate data [57] proposed
    a new data structure i.e. ‘Improved Streaming Quotient Filter (ISQF)’. Validation:
    – BF is used for data validation. BF is used to reduce memory consumption and
    bypass the unnecessary comparisons in the validation process [109]. This process
    is space-efficient. 7.5.Smart energy Smart energy plays an important role in solving
    the various issues of past, present, and future like healthcare, agriculture,
    the environment, sustainable development, and many more [79]. The energy-saving
    systems have already been developed in various cities and buildings, in the last
    few years. A lot of studies for efficient energy have already been done [142].
    Instead of using the word “smart grid”, a broader approach is to use the terms
    “Smart Energy” or “Smart Energy Systems” (Fig. 21). The energy system is also
    facing various challenges like stability, energy efficiency, cost control, operational
    efficiency, environmental issue, service management etc. [90]. By achieving smart
    energy management big data analytics provide new opportunities to deal with these
    challenges [18]. The innovative storage solution and distributed resources for
    efficient power transmission, clean power generation, dynamic power distribution,
    and rational electricity consumption have been proposed [188]. Smart grid achieves
    the energy transmission and data collection at the same time by integrating energy
    and information flow [187]. The primary focus of smart grids is on electricity
    sectors like cooling, heating, electricity, transportation, industry, building
    etc. It also provides affordable, achievable solutions for sustainable and renewable
    energy [168]. In the last few years, due to the huge growth in industry, energy
    consumption has also increased. It also increases data generation. With the emergence
    of ICT, the energy systems are being digitized [309]. The massive amount of generated
    data from energy-related sources needs to be well structured for efficient and
    fast results [177]. Due to the rapid increase in the population, energy consumption
    has also increased. Renewable energy like wind and solar power is also in its
    developing stage and has brought challenges like energy security and the adoption
    of new technologies [262]. Industries are using more than one-third of the total
    electrical energy used by the country, for production, construction, and mining.
    So in order to gather valuable information, they have collected a big database.
    This data is being used to raise the standard of living [231]. Fig. 21. Smart
    energy. The variety of big data, like the status of the device, consumption of
    electricity, and interaction with the user, is being collected by the smart grid.
    To process this big dataset, various techniques like analysis, optimization [310],
    clustering [232], classification [307] and forecasting [88] have been applied.
    So, the accurate prediction of electricity demand and consumption, the operation
    and generation of power in real-time can be optimized, and also effectively develop
    the pricing mechanism. With the use of big data analytics, the smart grid gives
    more control over the use of energy to the customer, supplies economic and reliable
    energy, responds quickly to the demand for electricity, and also quickly restores
    and detect the failure and many more facilities [124]. This also helps in taking
    decision for customers, producers, operators, and regulators in the smart grid
    [308]. Energy management uses emerging technologies like ICT (Fig. 22). The pattern
    of consumption and production of energy is changed due to involving of big data.
    The energy big data has involved 3Es and 4Vs energy, empathy, exchange, value,
    velocity, volume, and variety [308]. Fig. 22. Energy management (energy cloud)
    [197]. 7.5.1.Challenges in smart energy There are various opportunities and some
    challenges brought by energy big data. Some challenges are listed here: Effectively
    collection of energy big data: It is very difficult to collect data from energy
    resources for giving efficient and effective decision-making and quick responses.
    Management storage of energy big data: This is also one of the major challenges
    for energy big data to provide better services to customers. Mining and analyzing
    of energy big data: The mining of data for cleaning big raw data and analysis
    is a very tough job. Lack of effective and efficient decision making: The decision
    making is one of the impotent key points of a smart energy system, it also needs
    to be improved by joining efficient techniques like PDS. Privacy preserving of
    energy big data: This is one of the major concerns to giving security to energy
    big data. With the use of IoT devices, a huge amount of data is flowing without
    any security measures. To achieve the above-discussed challenges efficient and
    effective tools and techniques like PDS are required. 7.5.2.Applications of PDS
    in smart energy Privacy Preserving: Zhang et al. proposed a mechanism Cuckoo-RPL
    (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) to defend from Advanced metering
    infrastructure (AMI) network from blackhole attack. Cuckoo-RPL is also useful
    to defend from other attacks like version number and gray hole attack [303]. Network
    traffic management: Chaudhary et al. designed a “SDN-enabled multi-attribute-based
    secure communication protocol” in the Smart Grid environment for their entity
    communication. They use a cuckoo filter for fast forwarding of data [56]. Load
    Balancing: Debnath et al. present a scheme i.e. ‘BloomFlash for flash storage
    device. This scheme also achieved the load balancing of elements across the BF
    component. This scheme proves that the BF is useful in load balancing techniques
    [72]. 7.6.Smart governance Smart governance means accessing the government services
    free and in a better manner using various free data projects. With the emergence
    of ICT in smart cities, smart governance can improve the services provided by
    the cities [159]. Developing the businesses of the individual smart economies
    can play an important role in providing a collaborative platform. A smart economy
    also emphasizes economic competitiveness in the development of the city, on the
    competitive edge economic and human activity [143]. Smart Economy: – Smart economy
    that is for success with high social welfare, sustainability, and resource-efficient,
    is based on innovative technologies. It also helps in improving the quality of
    life by adopting new innovative ideas and building new entrepreneurs, and start-ups,
    which increase competitiveness and productivity [263]. This whole system is based
    on technologies and ICT for urban planning and economic advancement. For social
    benefits smart economy is also expected to deliver more products and services
    without compromising energy and pollution [144]. Smart Government: – Smart government
    is the timely demand of the 21st century and smart governance is its key tool.
    The key pillar of smart governance is to use technology. The public administration
    is required to update itself with the emergence of technology. No one can oppose
    adopting smart governance as it is the new face of public administration, governance,
    and political process [237]. The e-government adopts the electronic process in
    the administration system and political system and it is the starting face of
    smart government. There is a trend of using modern technologies in public administration
    for smart governance systems by developed countries and their researchers, academicians,
    politicians, and practitioners [182]. The role of smart government is presented
    in Fig. 23. Fig. 23. Role of smart government. An intelligent network is created
    in the sector of governance and it is directly related to the internet where people
    can connect with each other for communication even in remote areas. Better communication
    with real-time objects in the intelligent network is done through the distributed
    network [234]. As it is not an automated decision-maker so it is not artificial
    intelligence. It only connects to the people for gathering information and making
    the decision and use it in the future. Due to the rapid growth of IoT devices
    and digital applications, a lot of data is produced. The source of big data is
    social networking websites, mobile phones, daily household appliances, various
    private and government websites, and smart devices being used by various researchers.
    Big data plays an important role in transforming traditional governance into smart
    governance. Researchers, academicians, and policymakers argued about the transformation
    of traditional public administration to modern and smart administration in point
    of big data. For developing the public administration and government sector a
    large amount of data is required. It also helps in developing new models [238].
    Big data also help in effective decisions, fast and efficient results, and expert
    users, increasing their accountability and transparency. It also helps in solving
    complex tools for reforming the government but some researchers have doubts about
    future technologies. Many countries have adopted big data for smart governance,
    but some public administrations are still not ready to adopt big data as full
    fledge. It happens because, for implementation of these technologies, data collection,
    production and processing require a big investment. And those public administrations
    who implement impulsive faces threats and challenges like reducing the productivity,
    efficiency, and capacity in governing system [248]. The solutions to these challenges,
    problems, and threats are big data-driven technologies [75] like PDS. The government
    agencies taking future and proper decisions, and identify criminals and corruption,
    with the help of proper use of big data. The government is generating and managing
    the knowledge with their major responsibility [5]. 7.6.1.Challenges in smart governance
    Adopting Big data technologies: Some developing countries are already adopting
    big data technologies in smart governance. But many are facing problems, due to
    their bad handling and management, lack of knowledge, cost-effectiveness, and
    data available being either unstructured or semi-structured. Data Privacy: Much
    confidential data is uploaded by people and used by public administration. So,
    it needs to be protected from malicious users. Applications of PDS in Smart Governance:
    As such, we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart governance. So here
    the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. PDS is an efficient data structure
    for managing data storage and is also compatible with new technologies. PDS also
    helps in protecting data. 7.7.Smart society A smart society means to promote the
    satisfaction of citizens satisfaction and the well-being of metropolitan residents.
    In this reference, a smart society includes a large number of smart: people, infrastructure,
    education, living; water and waste management systems and many more [243]. Society
    4.0 faces the challenge with information sharing and related knowledge, while
    in society 5.0 the increased process complexity and assured sustainability due
    to the massive amount of data combined with environment and human physical investigation.
    The major challenge with big data is to take real-time decisions [94]. 7.7.1.Society
    evolution Society is coexistence with nature, and according to ethnographers,
    society 1.0 had begun with the birth of humans known as the hunting society (Society
    1.0). In 13,000 BC the settlements had been firmly established and irrigation
    techniques had been developed known as an agrarian society (Society 2.0). At the
    end of the 18th century, the steam locomotives were invented and mass production
    had started, it was the industrial society (Society 3.0). In the latter 20th century
    computers were invented and the distribution of information was started, this
    is the information society (Society 4.0). At the beginning of the 21st century,
    “super-smart society” has introduced and known as (Society 5.0). The social evolution
    has categorized and concise as given below (Fig. 24). Fig. 24. Society evolution
    1.0–5.0 [95]. Society 1.0: – This society’s evolution begins with the birth of
    humans. This society is also called a hunting society. People used simple tools
    for full fill their daily needs including food. People have changed their habits
    on the availability of resources [138]. Society 2.0: – In 13000 BC this social
    evolution was introduced with new developing agriculture techniques and it is
    also known as an agrarian society. With the advancement of technology and demographical
    changes, this revolution is transformed from the earlier society revolution [29].
    In Mesopotamia, the hand-made pottery and the cultivation of barley and wheat
    were found at early stages [14]. Society 3.0: – This societal revolution begin
    at the end of the 18th century, when modern physics, gravity law, and the invention
    of the steam engine had discovered and also called Industrial Society. This society
    changes the face of the earth forever. As already discussed industry revolutions
    are one of the growing fields in terms of economy as well as academia [254]. This
    also builds the relationship through transportation, environment, society, and
    many more. Society 4.0: – This is the Information Society, initially planned in
    1972 in Japan. This society aims for a new era after the post-industrial revolution
    in the year 1985 [179]. Here the production of information promotes human creativity,
    and the transition, and development of society. Society 5.0: – At the beginning
    of the 21st century this revolution was introduced with a vision of a “super-smart
    society”. This society provides solutions to many social problems through technologies
    because it is human-centered. This also improves the quality of life, the use
    of robots also increases, and also environment-friendly [14]. 7.7.2.Applications
    of smart society The smart society is directly concerned with citizens and daily
    lives. The main applications are discussed below (Fig. 25). Smart Home/Houses:
    – To increase the quality of life and independence, the homes are equipped with
    technologies called “smart home” [73]. Smart homes include home appliances like
    television, air conditioners, smart fans and lights, etc. are connected with IoT
    devices to effectively deliver the services. To achieve the goals of providing
    the services efficiently, the Smart Home Reasoning System (SHRS) plays an impotent
    role to make decisions [181]. Reducing environmental emissions, energy management,
    and increasing home automation is the primary objective of smart home [229]. Smart
    Living/People: – Smart living gives new opportunities to citizens to increase
    their standard of living. It needs to follow an inclusive strategic approach across
    all age groups and demographics [203]. It provides solutions that are controllable,
    productive, sustainable, economical, and efficient. Smart living is changing people’s
    lives with the emergence of new technologies. Yan et al. propose an architecture
    that controls home lighting using a Bluetooth-based Android smartphone [295].
    Peoples are safer in their homes, if they have to face any problem, they call
    independently also the objective of smart living [153]. Smart Buildings: – Smart
    building is defined as it is efficient energy management, a convenient and comfortable
    environment with reasonable investment, and is designed to provide service and
    management [169]. A smart building also includes automated processes like security,
    heating, lighting, air conditioning, ventilation, and many more [221]. To develop
    the smart building the things required are future-proof devices, IT skilled team,
    and robust wireless infrastructure. The basic components of smart building for
    security includes CCTV system, access control, intrusion system, gate automation
    etc [184]. Fig. 25. Applications of smart society. Smart Education: – With the
    advancement of technologies everything may be interconnected, instrumented with
    AI [313]. Smart education is also an emerging area nowadays and also needs attention
    from both researchers and academics [135]. Various smart education projects [121]
    have already been performed in recent years, in which the first smart education
    project is carried out by Malaysia in 1997 [52]. Smart education [62] faces certain
    issues like accessing student knowledge, comparing behavioral patterns of a student,
    data integration, data mining, detecting effective and emotional state of the
    student, and many more [60]. 7.7.3.Challenges in smart society Efficiency: – All
    resource uses in a smart society have their limits like battery power, memory
    storage, and bandwidth required for communication. They directly affect efficiency,
    which also increases with the rapid growth in data. Heterogeneous data: – The
    data generated in the super-smart city is heterogeneous, which leads to challenges
    in processing, analyzing, and mining data. Getting adequate information from big
    data in heterogeneous information networks is also a big challenge. Privacy preserving:
    – On increasing of smart technologies in a smart society the issue of security,
    and privacy is the main concern. Challenges in all aspects like access control,
    authentication, policy enforcement etc. Applications of PDS in Smart Society:
    As such we have not found any existing use of PDS in the smart society. So here
    the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. In lieu of the above challenges,
    there are many studies and researches available that PDS and its variants give
    an efficient result with memory management, and storage, also to handle heterogeneous
    data. PDSs also provide security to the data. 7.8.Smart sustainability The idea
    of sustainability was introduced in 1987. Sustainability define that the to meet
    today’s needs without sacrificing the future ability to fulfill their requirements
    like social, economic, and environmental [19]. Emerging technologies and digital
    governance are also part of smart sustainability [178]. It also requires a balance
    between the technology, policy, and management by local government [235]. The
    main pillars of sustainability are environmental, economic, and social. Smart
    sustainability has the potential for solving the problems of urban areas [296].
    In sustainable development, governance plays an impotent role [84]. In sustainable
    development’s planning and implementation, the stakeholder and policymakers lack
    practical research knowledge. To achieve this new technologies like ICT, IoT and
    cloud are being used in a smart city. Modern technology and creativity are being
    focused on the framework of smart cities as compared to sustainability cities
    depending on the data-driven identification of the dynamic changes in the broadcast
    relationship [258]. To achieve the required level of sustainability the data came
    from various sources in smart cities are need to be well structured. The IoT technologies
    measures in smart sustainable cities are air and water quality, green urban areas,
    tourism and culture, energy, digital transformation, legality, and security (Fig.
    26). Sustainable economic advancement includes all the factors that are included
    in a smart city. These factors are green building, smart education, social responsibility,
    water management, sustainable energy, smart health, smart governance, natural
    resource management, sustainable transportation, and waste management (Fig. 27).
    Fig. 26. Smart sustainable. Fig. 27. Smart sustainable city. 7.8.1.Challenges
    in smart sustainability Collection of data: – For developing sustainability a
    huge amount of big data is required at a place. Storage management: – The management
    of this data in a proper manner is a big challenge. Privacy and Security: – Security
    and privacy of this data is also the main concern. Applications of PDS in Smart
    Sustainability: As such we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart city
    sustainability. So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. The PDS
    and its variant are very much effective in data collection with less time and
    efficient storage management. It also provides security to the data movement in
    smart sustainability. 8.Comprehensive analysis of PDS in smart city In the smart
    city, the data, and information are the entrance to instantly bounded competitive
    benefits. Today, billions of people are accessing and releasing huge amounts of
    data via the internet, and social networks. This growth in data required efficient
    storage and handling of data is a big challenge for both academia and industry
    [96]. To improve the efficiency of data access and testing, the storage of monthly
    or annual data production from various companies, hospitals, institutions, and
    forests is at data centers [118]. The variants of data structures in PDSs are
    important for big data and live streaming systems. A BF is a probabilistic randomized
    data structure given by Burton Bloom, for efficiently storing information of static
    sets to support membership queries [36]. Presently BF is widely used in many networking
    and security algorithms [201]. After studying the existing uses of PDS in smart
    cities, it is found that many researchers have used BF in healthcare for efficient
    storage of patient data, privacy-preserving etc. in various applications Some
    of the existing applications of PDS in a smart city are recapitulated in below

    A massive amount of data is flowing in a smart city. Obviously, this data needs
    to be managed for their well-being to be used for both personal and civic data
    services. The use of WEB 3.0 for data management is also important. Islam et al.
    proposed a blockchain-based mechanism using bloom filter which provides protection
    from cyber threats in the healthcare system [125]. In this concern, Liu et al.
    proposed a blockchain-based distributed data storage scheme with enabled edge
    computing. The counting bloom filter is used when the storage checking fails to
    locate the error data and to realize data dynamics [161]. Similarly, Nie et al.
    propose a secure and privacy-preserving blockchain-based data-sharing scheme.
    For secure profile matching, the ‘Key-policy attribute-based encryption’ algorithm
    is used, and to verify the authenticity of ciphertext, a bloom filter with hash
    functions is designed [200]. A secure framework in a sustainable city environment
    is proposed by Singh et al. for smart parking that is energy efficient and blockchain-enabled.
    For secure communication of parking zone data, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    (ECC) algorithm is used at the transport layer to encrypt and decrypt the data
    [247]. 10.Research opportunities and challenges in smart city As discussed in
    Section 1.1, big data analysis, retrieval, and processing have very high importance
    from the perspective of smart cities. As storage and retrieval of large volumes
    of unstructured data, especially when responses are required in real-time, remains
    a significant challenge for researchers. From the extensive LR done, some of the
    identified research areas are: Filtering and processing of sensor data: – The
    data generated by various sensors and wearable devices have some limitations like
    security, privacy, ethics, data format, user acceptance, and big data concerns.
    Also, have incompatibility issues between data and information. The information
    collected by these devices may contain some noise. This sensor data may be also
    corrupted by the signals antiques like missing value and noise issues, which significantly
    reduce phase performance. Before using data for any future analysis, this issue
    needs to be addressed. Difficult to monitoring user’s social networking data:
    – It is difficult to monitor users’ data on social networking sites. In smart
    healthcare, doctors can’t rely on data from social media. But still, a system
    for detecting the psychological disturbance in patients is presented named emotional
    healthcare. Some techniques used to detect depressive and stressful content are
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Bi-directional
    Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Also proposed recommendation systems for patients
    to get a text-based on the results while they had been monitored. Lack of efficient
    computational models and data structures: – The expansion of massive data has
    generated large and complicated data sets. Traditional methods used for storage
    and retrieval of data, increase the computation overhead in big processing and
    hence are unable to meet the requirements of the users. For big data handling
    some advanced data, models are required which produce results in minimum time
    with minimum computation overhead. One of the basic problems of massive data is
    to style efficient computational models and data structures for solving these
    problems in big data. The need for energy-efficient data processing: – The rise
    of uses of IoT devices concept paved the way for a smart city. Energy management
    has become a major issue resource as IoT devices are constantly consuming huge
    amounts of energy. These concerns must be considered in order to establish an
    effective mechanism. The efficient use of power aims to promise a sustainable
    city. In addition, IoT devices produce a larger amount of data which is needed
    for optimal processing. Enforcing another challenge in securing smart cities is
    the sharing of data and access control. Data storage and processing: – Smart Cities
    take hold of the relative advantage of being robust for storing data and processing
    it in the information world. The applications of smart cities have generated a
    continuous huge amount of data from different sources. The existing traditional
    methods are insufficient to manage this volume of data and they have restricted
    processing speed and effective storage expansion costs. To overcome this issue,
    efficient computational models and data structures are required. Volume data:
    – Although it is difficult to quantify this challenge because data sets are typically
    very big like hundreds of terabytes or more. The traditional storage system like
    Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and new big data technologies like
    Hadoop are developed to efficiently count the data that must be kept and processed.
    The new data structures are also required to handle and produce results at run
    time. Real time response: – The Response Time (RT) in the smart city is very important
    in term of service, results, data transmission etc. The RT directs to the fact
    that the data transmission and business data infrastructure at elevated cost and
    should be considered with fewer delays. In this case, various techniques have
    been used which are depending on the situation and difficulty of analysis. In
    smart cities where responses need to be given after processing huge data or by
    handling streaming data, then traditional techniques and approaches are not efficient.
    So some new data handling techniques/data structures are required to provide results
    in real-time. Variety of Data: – In the smart city the source of a variety of
    data is also a major issue. The smart city data is available in different data
    sets for different applications of smart city and with different format styles
    like audio, video, images, text etc. The data collected from a variety of sources
    are ambiguous, unstructured, or semi-structured. This data needs to be in a well-structured
    manner for effective and efficient results. The traditional methods are not sufficient
    or even do not provide accurate results in the real-time scenarios. For this data
    management, a new data structure like PDS is required. Searching and Retrieving
    for a data item from the big data: – In huge data, the task of efficiently searching
    and retrieving appropriate data for review in the petabyte and exabyte ranges,
    in a variety of formats, is a major challenge. In some applications when deadlines
    are associated, this challenge becomes more tedious. Stream Processing(Data Collection
    and Distribution Analysis): – The streaming of big data in smart cities is a big
    challenge. There is a huge amount of data is flow in the smart city. The processing
    and analysis of this set of data are required. When raw data is combined like
    vehicle and road, geolocation sensor and social media, weather data, then the
    streaming of data may cause some issues like a too long time in result, access
    problem etc. Also some problems in development like it is still dependent. Various
    decisions and predictions are based on this type of data like traffic, future
    power consumption, etc. Some traditional systems are proposed but with various
    limitations. A new mechanism is required to design for efficient and effective
    results. Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources (Diversity Consolidation):
    – The data coming from different sources is not in proper sequence, maybe in a
    different format, or ambiguous. The operation on these data sets is difficult
    to apply like validation, authentication, updating, alteration etc. This data
    is need to be well structured and organized. Natural Text Analysis and Communication(social
    media analysis): – The analysis of natural text from social networks is available
    through mobile devices like smartphones is also challenging. This data is used
    for monitoring the behavior and emotions of citizens in real life. The information
    on location from various social networking sites is not in a proper format. The
    data include the comments and statements about the user’s feelings, thoughts,
    interests, relations etc. are integrated with sensor data. The reliability of
    this data is also a big challenge. Ambient Intelligence issues/challenges (specific
    to the current generation of smart city domains): – The expeditious growth of
    conversion from rural to urban areas and urban to smart cities is increasing rapidly.
    It also increases the usage and deployment of smart technologies in everything
    and everywhere in the city. So, smart cities may also face some ambient intelligence
    issues. The main concern in smart cities is AI, and privacy when combine with
    automation and autonomous system [257]. This may also create some design trade-offs
    like: Human control vs. automation: Fail to recognize the speed limit sign or
    fooled by scam stickers on road by autonomous driving [86]. Autonomous car driving
    (Uber) had met a deadly accident with a woman walking at night [185]. Hard Behavior
    is also one of the problems in autonomous systems. An example of this is conversations
    of customers with fully automated call centers, and online shopping without the
    involvement of humans. In AI-based behavior, there are missing traceability, transparency,
    and incomprehensible decisions. Privacy vs. smartness: There is also a trade-off
    between privacy and intelligence. To provide smartness, the data should be provided
    to smart services. For this, blockchain is used, which is also cost-effective.
    Infrastructure: To improve the standard of citizens, sensor technology is used
    for analyzing and gathering information. These sensors generally collect the data
    like air quality, crime rates, rush hour stats, etc. To install these types of
    sensors a complicated and costly infrastructure is involved [224]. Hackers vs
    Security: The threat level to security has also increased, as the uses of sensors
    and IoT technology have expanded. Being Socially Inclusive: The programs like
    ‘smart transit’ which is a great idea for the bustling city for real-time updates.
    This may also raise some issues like: some people in smart cities can’t afford
    to take transit, all elderly growing people do use smart mobile devices or apps,
    and how it is possible to use and reach technology to these groups of people?
    11.Discussion and conclusion In this paper, we have discussed the role of big
    data in Section 1.1, where we emphasize the importance of big data in smart cities.
    In Section 2 the generations of smart cities have been discussed. There are various
    architectures that have been discussed by many researchers, but the most appropriate
    architecture for the smart city is elaborated in Section 4. Los Angeles took the
    first action or made the first contribution to smart city projects in 1974. They
    analyze the urban big data. In Section 5 listed various projects to date and also
    future plans regarding smart cities. The role of big data in smart cities is crucial
    in a smart city. Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) have been discussed (Section
    6) as a key solution to many applications of smart cities. This paper also emphasizes
    the various applications of smart cities, such as smart healthcare, smart transportation,
    smart environment, agriculture, smart governance and economy, smart society, people,
    education, and smart sustainability (Section 7). It has been found, after going
    through various proposed techniques in the area of smart cities; that there is
    an influence of big data in a smart city. Generated data is inconsistent, semi-structured,
    or unstructured, lack of efficiency in retrieval and storage management of data,
    privacy, and security has major concerns. In the smart city, the collection of
    data itself is a big challenge. The data collected using IoT devices, records
    (medical history), social media, and web pages are too large. Obviously, this
    data is redundant and unstructured. Various monitoring systems in smart cities
    also have issues in the analysis and representation of this big data with low
    dimensions. Many researchers have put their sincere endeavors into extracting
    information from a huge amount of knowledge databases. The main challenge in this
    effort is that there is no standard approach to efficiently map and keep the big
    data on consistent data structures. The existing tool and techniques cannot work
    efficiently and satisfactorily in data management. To store and processing of
    data for optimal recovery and exploring procedures, data structures like PDS is
    one of the adequate standards to use. In the conclusion of this paper after reviewing
    related work, we have listed the exiting and scope of PDS in various applications
    of smart cities in Table 7. Table 7 Domain specific approaches of PDS in smart

    We will try to address some of these research challenges (Section 10). The goal
    of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of PDS and its applications
    in the domains of smart cities. The foremost aim of this paper is to provide a
    detailed survey of PDS in smart cities for readers and researchers who want to
    explore this field, along with the research opportunities in the domains. Conflict

    Probabilistic data structures in the smart city What is it about? Probabilistic
    Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved as a potential solution for many applications
    in smart cities to complete this tedious task of handling big data with real-time
    response. PDS has been used in many smart city domains, including healthcare,
    transportation, the environment, energy, and industry. The goal of this paper
    is to provide a comprehensive review of PDS and its applications in the domains
    of smart cities. The prominent domain of the smart city has been explored in detail;
    origin, current research status, challenges, and existing application of PDS along
    with research gaps and future directions. The foremost aim of this paper is to
    provide a detailed survey of PDS in smart cities; for readers and researchers
    who want to explore this field; along with the research opportunities in the domains.
    Why is it important? Big data analysis, retrieval, and processing are very important
    from the perspective of smart cities. Storage and retrieval of large volumes of
    unstructured data, especially when responses are required in real-time, remains
    a significant challenge for researchers. Identify the research areas, challenges,
    and application of PDS in smart cities. Read more on Kudos… The following have

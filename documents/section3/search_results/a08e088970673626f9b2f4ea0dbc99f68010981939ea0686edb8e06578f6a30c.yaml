    Views   Citations Abstract Even though annual rainfall is high in the Delta region
    of Mississippi, only 30% occurs during the months in which the major crops are
    produced, making irrigation often necessary to meet crop water needs and to avoid
    risk of yield and profitability loss. Approximately, 65% of the farmland in this
    region is irrigated. The shallow Mississippi River Valley Alluvial Aquifer is
    the major source of water for irrigation and for aquaculture in the predominant
    catfish industry. This groundwater is being heavily used as row-crop irrigation
    has increased tremendously. Water level in this aquifer has declined significantly
    over the past twenty five years, with overdraft of approximately 370 million cubic
    meters of water per year. Moreover, the common irrigation practices in the Delta
    re-gion of Mississippi do not use water efficiently, further depleting the ground
    water and making ir-rigation more expensive to producers due to increasing energy
    prices. Irrigation experts in the re-gion have tested and verified various methods
    and tools that increase irrigation efficiency. This article presents a review
    of the current status of the irrigation practices in the Delta region of Mis-sissippi,
    and the improved methods and tools that are available to increase irrigation efficiency
    and to reduce energy costs for producers in the region as well as to stop the
    overdraft of the declining aquifer, ensuring its sustainable use. Keywords The

    (Figure 1) is agronomically very productive under proper management, having deep
    alluvial soils with a relatively high annual precipitation (1100 - 1500 mm) and
    220 to 260 frost-free days per year [1] . The soils have developed over many years
    of deposition from seasonal flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
    Delta soils are nutrient rich, but they vary widely in texture, structure and
    depth [1] [2] . Approximately 70% of the yearly rainfall occurs during the months
    from September to April and this is the main source of water to replenish moisture
    to the root zone for the beginning of the growing season. Nonetheless, the rest
    30% of the annual rainfall occurs in the months of May, June, July, and August
    during which the major crops are produced. Figure 2 shows the monthly average
    rainfall for the years 1960-2013 for Stoneville, MS, which is one of the major
    weather stations in the Delta region of Mississippi. Due to this variability in
    rainfall distribution, irrigation is often necessary to meet crop water needs
    and avoid loss in yield and profitability. Over 80% of the crops produced in Mississippi
    are grown in the Delta [1] . The major crops grown in the Delta region of Mississippi
    are cotton, soybeans, corn and rice. Nearly 65% of the Delta farmland is irrigated
    (Table 1). The shallow Mississippi River Valley Alluvial Aquifer is the main source
    of groundwater in the Delta for irrigation of crops as well as for filling and
    maintaining water levels in aquaculture ponds for the catfish industry [1] [3]
    . The Yazoo Mississippi Delta Joint Water Management District (YMD) annually estimates
    the total groundwater pumped from the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial Aquifer
    for various crops grown in the Delta region of Mississippi. According to the YMD
    report of 2010 (Table 1), approximately 60% of the cotton, corn and soybean acres,
    and 100% of the rice and aquaculture acreage in the Delta were irrigated. Soybeans
    covered the largest irrigated acreage (53%) followed by rice (17.5%), corn (17.2%),
    cotton (9.9%) and aquacul- Figure 1. Map of the state of Mississippi showing the

    for each crop out of the total. ture (2.2%). Rice, however, with only 17.5% of
    the total irrigated acreage, used more water than any other crop. Soybeans and
    rice used about 80% of the estimated water usage (Table 1). According to YMD (Figure
    3), on average, rice uses about 9.1 Megaliters/hectare (ML/ha) of groundwater,
    which is about three times that used by corn or soybeans and about six times used
    by cotton with averages of 2.7, 2.3 and 1.7 ML/ha for corn, soybeans, and cotton,
    respectively. As shown in Table 1, these crops and the aquaculture used up about
    3.2 billion cubic meters of water from the aquifer in 2010. Water level in this
    aquifer has declined significantly over the past twenty five years [3] . The overdraft
    of the aquifer in Mississippi is estimated to be approximately 370 million cubic
    meters per year and is attributed to the irrigation of over 700,000 hectares of
    row crops located in the Delta region of Mississippi [3] [4] . The decline is
    the most prominent from April to October each year when normal crop water demands
    are intensified by simultaneous dry climatic conditions and the recharge of the
    aquifer during the remainder of the year has been insufficient to restore water
    levels [3] . The groundwater is being heavily used for irrigation as the demand
    continues to grow due to a tremendous increase in the production of row crops
    [3] . Moreover, the common irrigation practices in the Delta region of Mississippi
    are inefficient, further depleting the ground water and making irrigation expensive
    to producers due to increasing energy prices. To reduce water use and stop the
    decline of the aquifer, various tools and methods that increase irrigation efficiency
    have been tested and verified by the irrigation experts in the region. This review
    briefly summarizes the current status of the irrigation practices in the Delta
    region of Mississippi, and the methods and tools that improve irrigation efficiency
    in order to reduce energy costs and the overdraft of the aquifer. In this review
    we have used valuable information obtained from various web sites in addition
    to the available literature to describe strategies to improve irrigation efficiency.
    2. Irrigation Methods and Improvements in the Delta Region of Mississippi 2.1.
    Current Irrigation Methods About 60% of the cropland in Mississippi is irrigated
    with furrow and center pivot being the two predominant irrigation systems (Table
    2). Furrow irrigation accounts for about 75% of the irrigated area and the remaining
    area is irrigated with center pivot (Table 2). In two neighboring states, Arkansas
    and Louisiana, furrow irrigation accounts for over 80% with center pivot/sprinkler
    accounting less than 20% of the irrigated land. Table 3(a) shows a summary of
    the annual survey report from YMD on irrigation methods used for the major crops
    grown in the Delta region of Mississippi for five consecutive growing seasons
    (2005-2009). The total number of survey sites reported by YMD under each irrigation
    method was listed for each crop for the five cropping seasons and the average
    percentages for each method were calculated. Based on these data, over 85% of
    the corn and cotton and about 50% of the soybean sites, with an average of 75%,
    were furrow irrigated. The sites under center pivot were only about 10%. The common
    furrow irrigation practice in the Delta is to pump water using poly-ethylene tubing
    until water gets to the end of the furrows, but all furrows do not reach the tail-ditch
    at the same time. This may causes deep percolation losses (over-saturation of
    the soil profile) and also results in tail-water runoff, wasting water. The rice
    flooding methods in Mississippi include the straight levee, contour, straight
    levee with multiple inlets, and zero grade with 45%, 30%, 20% and 5% in coverage,
    respectively [4] . In the Delta region of Mississippi, about 55% of the YMD survey
    sites were irrigated with straight levee, 20% contour, 12% straight levee with
    multiple inlets, and 12% zero grade methods (Table 3(a)). The straight levee and
    contour irrigation Figure 3. Yearly average water use estimates for rice, corn,
    soybeans and cotton (Megaliters per hectare) in the Delta region of Mississippi

    is shown in parenthesis). or flooding methods utilize a well or riser in the highest-elevation
    portion of the field and water spills into lower paddies as the upper paddies
    are filled [5] [6] . During the time of flooding, an increasingly larger area
    is covered with water until the entire area within the levees is flooded [5] [6]
    . When the floodwaters naturally subside and when saturated mud is exposed in
    the upper half of the paddy, water is pumped back to a full-flood depth of about
    four inches [7] . These conventional furrow and rice flooding practices do not
    use water efficiently. 2.2. Improvements in Irrigation Methods The YMD reports
    yearly comparison of water use by different irrigation methods in the Delta region
    of Mississippi (http://www.ymd.org/publications.htm). Table 3(b) shows water use
    by the different irrigation methods for the same crops and survey sites shown
    in Table 3(a) (averaged over five years, 2005-2009). In the survey sites, an average
    of 3.4 ML/ha was used in corn with the furrow irrigation method, whereas only
    1.5 ML/ha was used by center pivot, a savings of more than 50% of irrigation water
    compared with furrow irrigation. Cotton used 1.8 and 1.5 ML/ha of water on the
    average under furrow and center pivot, respectively, which is a savings of about
    15% water. In soybean, the center pivot reduced water use from 2.4 to 1.8 ML/ha,
    saving about 25% water. Nonetheless, center pivots were used in only 10% of the
    sites for these three crops (Table 3(a)). In soybean, in addition to the furrow
    and center pivot methods, contour and straight levee methods are also used. Furthermore,
    the contour method used the highest irrigation water out of all the methods for
    soybean as well as for rice. The zero-grade method saved about 50% water in rice
    (5.8 ML/ha) followed by the multiple inlet method with a savings of about 20%
    (8.5 ML/ha) as compared to the contour method (11 ML/ha) (Table 3(b)). However,
    only about 12% of the sites used these two water use efficient methods (Table
    3(a)). Studies on energy saving by irrigation experts at Mississippi State University
    showed that the zero-grade irrigation method, with nearly 50% water reduction,
    was estimated to save producers up to 160 liters of diesel per hectare, which
    in terms of money could be a saving of about $136 US dollars per hectare at a
    price of $0.85/liter compared with the contour method [7] . The estimated energy
    savings for the straight levee with multiple inlets was about 85 liters/ha which
    would be about $72/ha compared with the contour method [7] . A recent investigation
    by Mississippi State University researchers and rice growers in Mississippi showed
    that intermittent flooding, which maintains a less- than-full flood, maximizes
    rainfall capture and avoids run off from completely filled paddies, thus, reducing
    water and energy use [4] [7] . They also showed that combining intermittent flooding
    with multiple-inlet irrigation can improve efficiency of the multiple-inlet method
    by about 30%, which makes the average water use close to that of zero-grade rice
    fields [4] [7] . In this improved method, instead of pumping water to maintain
    full paddies, a pumping cycle can be established by turning the well on every
    five to seven days, thus saving water and energy. Implementation of the water
    efficient irrigation practices in rice production represent a promising opportunity
    to generate groundwater savings where savings of only 3000 cubic meters per hectare
    could save the aquifer nearly 310 million cubic meters of water per year [4] [7]
    [8] . This savings would approach the average overdraft and help to bring groundwater
    withdrawals closer to the recharge rate of the aquifer [8] . The furrow irrigation
    method is the most dominant in row crop production in the Delta region of Mississippi
    and Mississippi as a whole (Table 2 and Table 3(a)). Various tools and methods
    employed in other regions have been tested in the Delta to increase the efficiency
    of the furrow irrigation as well as other surface irrigation methods. Efficiency
    of furrow irrigation can be improved using computerized hole-selection softwares
    such as the Pipe Hole and Universal Crown Evaluation Tool (PHAUCET) or the Delta
    Plastic Pipe Planner (http://www.pipeplanner.com/) [4] [9] . The PHAUCET is a
    free software program developed by engineers with the US Department of Agriculture’s
    National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Missouri [9] [10] . It uses
    engineering equations to calculate pipe pressure and flow rates for each watered
    furrow, and can compute proper hole-size designs for fields that vary in layout.
    Researchers in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana have shown that PHAUCET reduces
    water, fuel and irrigation usage by 20 percent versus conventional irrigation
    sets in regular-shaped fields, and in irregular-shaped fields, could reduce water
    use as much as 50% [7] [9] [11] . Furrow irrigation efficiency is further improved
    when the computerized hole-selection programs are used in conjunction with surge
    valves [11] . Conventional furrow irrigation sets apply water continuously while
    surge flow intermittently applies water to the irrigated furrows and increases
    efficiency by distributing water more evenly across a field and reducing both
    water loss to deep percolation and runoff [9] [11] . With furrow irrigation accounting
    for 85% of the corn and cotton and 50% of the soybean farms, increase in efficiency
    of furrow irrigation through use of these tools could bring huge savings in water
    and energy usage in the Mississippi Delta. Other measures can also be employed
    to save water in the different irrigation methods. Tailwater recovery, which involves
    collecting water that runs off from surface-irrigated fields and reusing it for
    irrigation, improves overall irrigation efficiency [12] . Installation of a timer
    helps to automatically or remotely turn the pumps off, which might otherwise be
    pumping more water than is needed by the plant, particularly at night. Flow meters
    could also help save water by allowing producers to keep track of water applied
    in each field. The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All

    Scheduling Methods The purpose of irrigation scheduling is to determine the timing
    and the amount of water to be applied based upon the crop’s water needs, soil
    water storage capacity and climatic conditions. Irrigation scheduling methods,
    in general, can be classified as plant-, soil-, or climate-based, or combinations
    [13] . The most common methods use either daily crop evapotranspiration (ET) estimates
    as crop water use, or measurements of soil moisture status, or a combination of
    these two methods, to determine when and how much irrigation water needs to be
    applied [14] [15] . The different tools available for irrigation scheduling include
    soil moisture sensors, in-field weather stations, crop water use estimators, daily
    soil water balance checkbook worksheets and computerized daily soil water balance
    programs [15] . Crop water use is the amount of water given up to the atmosphere
    by transpiration through plant leaves and evaporation from the soil and plant
    surfaces, referred as evapotranspiration or ET [16] . Daily crop water use changes
    throughout the growing season depending on the stage of crop development and weather
    conditions. Climatic parameters having a major effect on a crop’s daily water
    use include maximum and minimum temperatures, solar radiation, humidity, and wind.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration for specific crops (ETc) is important for irrigation
    scheduling and agricultural water management. Irrigation is required when ETc
    (crop water demand) exceeds the supply of water from soil water and precipitation.
    Crop evapotranspiration for a specific crop can be estimated by multiplying the
    reference evapotranspiration (ETO) by a crop specific crop coefficient (Kc) [17]
    . Reference evapotranspiration is an estimate of the amount of water lost from
    a theoretical reference surface, usually a well-watered field of grass, and is
    a measure of the evaporative power of the environment. Crop coefficient is an
    adjustment factor that mainly depends mainly on crop type and its growth stage.
    Using several years of weather data and crop water use data, Kc can be estimated
    and a specific Kc curve can be developed that shows the water requirement of the
    specific crop. However, developing Kc for a specific crop in the Mississippi Delta
    and the humid mid-south as a whole has been difficult due to highly variable daily
    evaporative demand [18] . In a four-year study (2003-2006) of cotton in Stoneville,
    MS, seasonal water-use patterns varied among growing seasons due to highly variable
    environmental and crop-growth conditions, making it difficult to develop a crop-coefficient
    for the Mississippi Delta growing conditions [18] . Irrigation scheduling is complex
    in the humid mid-southern US than in the drier environments of the US due to highly
    variable climatological conditions such as fluctuating temperature and rainfall
    caused by the movement of weather fronts which make the daily evaporative demand
    highly variable, and these weather conditions vary from year to year and even
    within a year affecting crop-growth and crop-water use [18] - [20] . Additionally,
    the soils in this region are highly variable, and sometimes exhibiting restrictive
    layers at shallow depths which can reduce the water storage capacity of the soil
    [1] [19] [20] . Thus, this variability must be accounted for in irrigation scheduling.
    While many irrigation scheduling methods have been developed for dry climates,
    few tools are available for humid, high rainfall areas [20] . The most common
    irrigation scheduling method is the water balance, or checkbook, method which
    can range from a simple spreadsheet record keeping to sophisticated web-based
    computer models that require weather and other information [14] [15] . In the
    water balance method, soil water is balanced by taking account of the amount of
    water that leaves as crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and water that enters the soil
    reservoir as rain or irrigation. By keeping records of these transactions, it
    is possible to estimate how much water is in the soil reservoir at any time. Daily
    ET estimates are needed for the water balance method to update the soil water
    deficit balance. There are a variety of equations that are used to calculate reference
    ET, ranging from simple empirical models to sophisticated physically based energy-
    and mass-transfer models. While the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method is the de facto
    standard, other methods, such as the Modified-Penman, Jensen-Haise, Hargreaves,
    Turc, and ASCE Standardized Reference equation are also in use [13] [21] - [23]
    , with various versions of the Penman-Monteith method being the most widely used
    [13] [24] [25] . Daily crop water use or ETc can also be estimated using tools
    such as evaporation pans, atmometers (atmosphere meters), or crop water use (ET)
    tables which are usually provided by county or state extension programs. These
    simpler tools are used to estimate reference ET, which is then adjusted to provide
    estimates of ETc using device-specific crop coefficient functions [13] [26] .
    Soil-based methods of irrigation scheduling includes monitoring soil moisture
    using sensors and the “feel method”, which involves an estimate of soil moisture
    by feeling the soil [27] - [29] . There are two groups of soil moisture sensors,
    soil water tension-based sensors (tensiometers and granular matrix sensors), and
    soil water content-based sensors (capacitance, neutron probe and gravimetric)
    [27] . Soil moisture sensor readings can be used to determine how much water is
    available for the crop, when to start irrigating, and how much water to apply
    [27] [29] . The sensors also show depth of wetting, depth of extraction by roots
    and adequacy of wetting [29] . When sensors indicate that remaining soil moisture
    level reaches a critically low value, irrigation is applied. Monitoring sensor
    measurements can be used as a stand-alone method or in combination with the ET
    method for irrigation scheduling [30] . The soil feel method, which is a low cost
    method, has been used for many years by researchers and growers [28] [31] . By
    squeezing the soil between the thumb and forefinger or by squeezing the soil in
    the palm of a hand, a fairly accurate estimate of soil moisture can be determined
    by someone with experience. This method is still being recommended by extension
    specialists to growers in different parts of the country [28] [31] [32] . 3.2.
    Irrigation Scheduling in the Delta Region of Mississippi Crop producers in the
    Mississippi Delta and in Mississippi as a whole primarily determine to irrigate
    their fields using a subjective plant-based method, which is visually observing
    the condition of the crop (USDA-NASS, 2008, Table 4). Their second choice of irrigation
    scheduling method was the soil feel method (Table 4). On average, about 8% of
    producers used a personal calendar schedule, approximately 10%, based their irrigation
    decisions on daily crop evapotranspiration (ET). These methods are very similar
    to those used by producers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee except that in
    Mississippi, ET based scheduling was slightly higher and the personal calendar
    scheduling was slightly lower than in the other states (Table 4). The soil moisture
    sensor based irrigation scheduling accounted for less than 5% of the farms in
    Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee, on the average. The percentages
    for the irrigation scheduling methods in these four states was not very different
    from the national average as shown in Table 4. The national average for the method
    using visual observation of crop condition is about 44% (ranging 32% - 57%) and
    the soil feel method is about 25% (ranging 13% - 42%). Even though many computer
    based and web-based irrigation scheduling tools are available these data show
    that a very small percentage of the farms use these scientific irrigation scheduling
    methods. The scientific irrigation scheduling method available to the Mississippi
    Delta producers has been the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler, developed by the University
    of Arkansas for the humid Mid-South [19] . This Scheduler has been used by producers
    in Arkansas and the surrounding states for over twenty years [6] . However, based
    on Table 4. Irrigation scheduling methods used on farms in Mississippi, Arkansas
    and Louisiana (data from USDA-NASS, 2008). the data from USDA-NASS (Table 4),
    this scheduler may have been used only by a very small number of producers in
    Mississippi and the surrounding states. A computer based irrigation scheduling
    tool, the Mississippi Irrigation Scheduling Tool (MIST), is being developed by
    the USDA-ARS and Mississippi State University researchers [33] [34] . An estimate
    of crop water use is made using a modified Penman Monteith method [20] to calculate
    daily evapotranspiration. This checkbook method maintains the water balance of
    the soil, adding water from rainfall or irrigation, and subtracting water used
    by the crop or evaporated from the soil. The need for irrigation is indicated
    when the soil water available to the plant falls below that which is required
    for the crop growth [34] . The MIST has been implemented in a web interface, allowing
    producers to access the information from anywhere via computers, tablets or smart
    phones [33] . The system relies on national databases for automated integration
    with a water balance model. However, due to the high degree of spatial variability
    in precipitation in Mississippi, information extracted from the nearest publicly
    available weather station may not represent the actual precipitation on a particular
    field which can affect the water balance calculations. Incorporating automated
    data from the National Weather Service (NWS) spatially gridded radar-estimated
    precipitation was tested to determine if it could improve the issue with spatial
    rainfall variability [35] . Comparison between rainfall from publicly available
    stations and spatially gridded radar precipitation estimates showed some discrepancies
    [36] . According to Sassenrath et al. [34] , given the Delta’s local practice
    of irrigating to replace full evapotranspiration, use of the NWS daily precipitation
    analysis data as input for a daily irrigation scheduler was judged not only acceptable,
    but also preferable to other sources of daily precipitation data. However, data
    from an on-site rain gauge would be the most reliable measurement of daily precipitation.
    While the MIST and the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler both use a water balance
    scheduling method the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler requires daily values of air
    temperature and effective precipitation as input by the producer [37] . The MIST,
    on the other hand, automatically extracts weather data from online weather data
    sources [31] [33] . Entering daily precipitation values has the advantage of solving
    the issue of spatial variability in precipitation as encountered in the MIST.
    Crop evapotranspiration in these systems is calculated using different equations
    and built-in crop-coefficient functions, then the soil-water deficit is updated,
    and the current soil-water deficit and a projection of the deficit for the next
    few days are output. The user then decides whether to irrigate based on an allowable
    deficit level chosen by the user, with guidance from the program based on soil
    type, crop, and irrigation system [18] . Currently, soil moisture sensors are
    being promoted as a valuable irrigation scheduling tool to producers in the Delta
    region of Mississippi by the Mississippi State University irrigation extension
    specialists [38] . Soil moisture sensors placed at different soil depths allow
    the producer to determine how much moisture the soil has available to plants and
    to schedule irrigation in advance. Use of soil moisture sensors in combination
    with computerized hole-selection programs and surge valves is recommended by the
    experts to be the most water use efficient surface irrigation practice at present
    for producers in the Mississippi Delta [8] [10] [38] . 4. Other Considerations
    in Increasing Irrigation Efficiency in the Delta Region of Mississippi Many irrigation
    scheduling tools in the other parts of the US use different forms of the water
    balance method in which crop specific ET values are estimated from the daily air
    temperatures provided by the producer or online based on nearby weather station
    data [15] [39] [40] . Precipitation from a rain gauge or a local weather station,
    and in some cases soil moisture sensor data, is required to be entered by the
    producer. An alternative for ET estimates is an atmometer. An atmometer is designed
    to simulate ET from a plant canopy in a way that agrees closely with a plant’s
    resistance to ET and it closely matches the values calculated from weather station
    data [26] . It can be located in a grower’s field, making it especially useful
    for areas without nearby weather stations or for people who do not have ready
    access to this information and can help to schedule irrigations for any field
    within several miles [26] . Atmometers have shown close agreement to the modified
    Penman method ET (similar to method used in MIST) in some studies [41] - [43]
    . An atmometer or ET Gauge is being evaluated by University of Arkansas extension
    specialists and county agents for irrigation scheduling. ET Gauge sheets have
    been developed for Arkansas based on crop growth stage for corn and soybean grown
    to help Arkansas producers set their atmometers [44] . In Nebraska, modified atmometers
    (ETgage) together with watermark soil moisture sensors are recommended to producers
    as cost-effective tools for irrigation scheduling [45] . Since the Mississippi
    Delta has not only humid and highly variable weather, but also highly variable
    soils, irrigation scheduling with a com- bination of an atmometer and soil moisture
    sensors might be an alternative if tested and proven to work in this environment.
    An investigation was conducted to find alternative methods of estimating ET in
    humid environments with limited weather data [46] . Three ET estimation methods,
    which are recommended for use when weather data are limited, the FAO-56 reduced
    set, the Turc and the Hargreaves methods, were compared with the standard FAO-
    56 method under the Delta weather conditions. When the weather data were limited
    only to air temperature and solar radiation, the Turc method, originally developed
    with air temperature and solar radiation as inputs, was found to provide better
    estimates of the FAO-56 method compared with the FAO-56 reduced and the Hargreaves
    methods [46] . The Turc method has consistently performed well when tested under
    other humid environments [47] [48] . This method would be of use in the Delta
    region of Mississippi if the complete set of weather data for the FAO-56 method
    was unavailable, or if a computationally simpler method was desired [46] . Deficit
    irrigation (DI) is a strategy used in water-limited environments to reduce agricultural
    water use. The classic DI strategy implies that water is supplied at levels below
    full crop evapotranspiration throughout the season [49] [50] . Deficit irrigation
    deliberately allows crops to sustain some degree of water deficit with some yield
    reduction and a significant reduction of irrigation water applied [49] - [51]
    . Regulated Deficit Irrigation (RDI) is a modified DI in which water deficit is
    applied at certain periods of the growth stages of a crop to save water but still
    maintain yield [49] - [52] . To address the issue of increasing production costs
    and restricted water use by producers arising from decline in groundwater levels,
    experts at Mississippi State University have been conducting some RDI studies
    in soybeans [53] . They tried to determine if, relative to the common soybean
    practices of the Mississippi Delta, an irrigation event can be omitted while maintaining
    yield and profitability. The study indicated that there is potential to eliminate
    at least one irrigation event without adversely affecting yield or profitability
    [53] . Similar studies for the major crops in the Delta of Mississippi could also
    help producers in cutting energy costs and saving groundwater. The DI strategy,
    in which irrigation is reduced below the evapotranspiration demand of the crop
    throughout the growing season, may not be acceptable in the Delta now with other
    options still available to cut down water use and energy costs. However, it may
    be worthwhile to start thinking about it now to lay a strategy for the long term
    considering the rapidly growing demand for the ground- water due to the tremendous
    increase in water use for row crops in the Delta. Moreover, weather changes and
    the increases in demand for supplemental irrigation may still require a more restricted
    groundwater use, making DI an option. 5. Summary In this review, the current status
    of the irrigation practices used by producers in the Delta region of Mississippi,
    and the improved methods and tools that can efficiently utilize the groundwater
    have been discussed. The strategies that are currently recommended by irrigation
    experts in the region to improve irrigation efficiency in the Delta region of
    Mississippi are summarized below. · Furrow irrigation using computerized hole-selection
    programs in conjunction with surge valves; · Multiple inlet irrigation with intermittent
    flooding for rice; · Zero-grade irrigation for flood-irrigated rice and soybeans;
    · Soil moisture sensors recommended as the primary tools for irrigation scheduling
    while a web-based irrigation management tool, the MIST, is being developed; ·
    Tailwater recovery from surface-irrigated fields and reuse for irrigation; · Center
    pivots—water savings of about 50% in corn, and 15% - 25% in cotton and soybeans
    as compared to furrow irrigation. Widespread adoption of these efficient irrigation
    methods and tools together with irrigation scheduling using soil moisture sensors
    can tremendously reduce water use and fuel energy expenses for producers in the
    Delta while reducing the current overdraft of the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial
    Aquifer and ensuring its sustainable use. Disclaimer Mention of a trade name or

    \ justiﬁes the incorporation and\nadaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays,\
    \ managing crops is possible through Internet-based\ntechnologies. Their application\
    \ allows for the exploitation of information and the development of\nisolated\
    \ applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable\
    \ predictions\nthroughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a\
    \ data model was deﬁned to improve\nthe management of crop plots in irrigation\
    \ communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.\nConsequently, the objective\
    \ of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on\nstandard\
    \ interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources\
    \ of information,\nwhile ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions\
    \ for exchanging and exploiting such\ninformation. Standard and open interfaces\
    \ and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby\nunifying all information\
    \ in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of\n\
    information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation\
    \ community; the\nsoftware improved water irrigation management for the farmers\
    \ connected to the platform.\nKeywords: IoT platform; data model; smart agriculture;\

    1. Introduction\nSociety is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological\
    \ changes. The productive sectors\nthat are more digitized tend to improve their\
    \ productivity faster than those that are less digitized.\nIrrigation farming\
    \ communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and\ncommunications\
    \ technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,\n\
    facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and\
    \ sustainable production\nsystems. The use of these new technologies not only\
    \ enables the digital transformation process\ndemanded by the sector, but also\
    \ supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools\nfor analysis\
    \ and prediction, improving optimization.\nThe digital transformation and continuous\
    \ technological advances that are currently occurring,\ne.g., the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and\
    \ aerial\nimages [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with\
    \ new tools that help determine\nthe real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153; doi:10.3390/s20041153\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n2 of 20\ntraditional paradigm\
    \ regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making\nall\
    \ objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and\
    \ integration of\ninformation and real knowledge into the digital world [4].\n\
    This transformation has produced\nimprovements compared to the techniques traditionally\
    \ used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in\nthe management of farms. These\
    \ advantages are mainly focused on the following:\n•\nProblem detection: The implementation\
    \ of new technologies such as satellite images, variable\napplication algorithms,\
    \ drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing\nfor\
    \ the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer\
    \ use, water\nstress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before\
    \ they start to interfere with\ncrop performance;\n•\nProductivity improvement:\
    \ The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of\nplanting\
    \ and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions,\
    \ to\nimprove crop production levels;\n•\nImprovement in decision making: By analyzing\
    \ and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water\nneeds, and precipitation forecasts,\
    \ it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water\nand schedule\
    \ irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress\
    \ on\nthe crop;\n•\nBehaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring\
    \ and the analysis of the relationships\namong different elements, such as yield,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the\nmost beneﬁcial actions\
    \ and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.\nMotivated by\
    \ the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with\
    \ new\ndevices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones,\
    \ and satellite images) that allow\nfor the optimization of the resources, to\
    \ improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact\non the environment.\
    \ For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration\n\
    framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated\
    \ according to\nthe needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial\
    \ and have to be part of a unique\nsemantic model that organizes and evaluates\
    \ all the data collected.\nAt the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6],\
    \ offers a framework using a set of standard\nand open Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface\n(NGSI), promoted\
    \ by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces\nwith\
    \ Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for\
    \ Context\nInformation Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of\
    \ standards based on the contextual\nmanagement of the data. Therefore, adhering\
    \ the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary\ntechnologies can contribute\
    \ to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world\nwhere\
    \ everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability\
    \ must be\nthe cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing\
    \ to a more productive environment\nwhere information is exchanged for a greater\
    \ good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows\nfor the integration of\
    \ different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and\n\
    data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information\
    \ to analyze,\nin real time, the factors associated with the production process,\
    \ the evolution of the crops, and the\noptimal use of water for irrigation. The\
    \ core features the platform are as follows:\n1.\nScalability and ﬂexibility:The\
    \ platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date\nwith\
    \ protocols, technologies, and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent\
    \ and can be\nintegrated to work with all vital technological systems;\n2.\nInteroperable:\
    \ The platform offers a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection\
    \ with\ndevices that use standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine\
    \ to Machine (LWM2M)\nover Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight\n(UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility\
    \ of using parameterizing agents to integrate any\nother type of future protocols.\
    \ At the application level, the platform is open to integration with\nother third-party\
    \ platforms using both API and data model based on NGSI-LD.\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ the management of the different\nelements that are part of a farm;\n4.\nEfﬁciency\
    \ and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions to be made\
    \ in terms\nof management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically\
    \ document the health\nstatus of the crop or natural resources provides an efﬁcient\
    \ and effective diagnosis technique\nfor managers.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is\nintroduced,\
    \ detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community\n\
    of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels\
    \ of implementation and\nthe results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion\
    \ and new proposals based in these results\nare described.\n1.1. Information Models\
    \ Applied to Agriculture\nThe data collected by all connected devices are characterized\
    \ by scalability, heterogeneity,\nand dynamism:\n•\nScalability: Millions of sensors\
    \ continuously generating large amounts of information;\n•\nHeterogeneity: There\
    \ is a wide variety of sensors;\n•\nDynamism: The high speed of generation produced\
    \ the need to generate data models that allow\nfor better use and dissemination\
    \ of the information from these devices.\nGiven the above factors, interoperability\
    \ mechanisms must be generated that allow for the\nintegration of different devices,\
    \ applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information\nthat many\
    \ systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential\
    \ resources\nthat improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability\
    \ of information systems to\ndevelop better applications for the agri-food sector\
    \ [9].\nToday, different data models are available; many of them were developed\
    \ by the organizations\nin charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) data models are\nused primarily in geosciences and environmental\
    \ domains, including the SensorThings API, based on\nthe Observations and Measurements\
    \ (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms\nthe numerous unconnected\
    \ IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can\nbe performed\
    \ and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based\n\
    on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart\
    \ home sectors. The\nWorld Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some\
    \ vocabularies to describe real things\nbut does not focus much on the data. Other\
    \ vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE\ndirective [10], deﬁne the\
    \ rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;\n\
    these are mandatory.\nCurrently, some resources speed up the data modeling of\
    \ a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld\nof agriculture, Drury et al. [11]\
    \ presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:\n•\nControlled\
    \ vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example\n\
    is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\
    \ United\nNations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.\n•\nMiscellaneous\
    \ ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,\n\
    CIARD Ring, and Vest.\n•\nData exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and\
    \ AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for\nsensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology\
    \ (diseases and pests that affect cotton).\nThe basis of many decisions is the\
    \ uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the\ncorrect interfaces\
    \ (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for\
    \ the\nuniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service\
    \ interfaces with linked data\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n4 of 20\n(NGSI-LD) [12].\
    \ This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks\
    \ and\nfor the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.\nA diverse range of\
    \ ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different\nobjectives\
    \ [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses\
    \ the results\nof projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies,\
    \ such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,\nSpitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One\
    \ recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI\nSmartM2M Technical Committee,\
    \ is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared\nmodel of consensus\
    \ that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain\
    \ and\nallows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology\
    \ according to speciﬁc\nneeds. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version\
    \ [15] was created to provide services for\nanimal husbandry, intelligent irrigation,\
    \ and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support\nservices for\
    \ decision making.\nSome models are promoted by public administrations, such as\
    \ the standardized water\nmanagement model applied to irrigation model (MEGA)\
    \ [16], an initiative of the Ministry of\nAgriculture of Spain, included in the\
    \ ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The\npurpose of MEGA is to establish\
    \ a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for\ninteroperability\
    \ between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently\n\
    manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves\
    \ how the irrigation\nschedules and the requirements of the control systems are\
    \ speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation\nbetween decision making and execution.\n\
    1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector\nMultiple problems exist in the\
    \ domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of\npesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers\
    \ are\nworking to provide the best possible solutions:\n•\nImprovements in productivity:Through\
    \ the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,\nthe farmer can apply\
    \ irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,\n\
    Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to\
    \ predict diseases\nin horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer\
    \ to apply the necessary defense\nmechanisms, thus improving productivity and\
    \ reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]\npresented a low-cost sensor-equipped\
    \ platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert\nmanagement in vineyards;\n\
    •\nDetection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful\
    \ agronomic factors,\npreviously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops\
    \ using remote-sensing techniques. For\nexample, De Rango et al. [19] monitored\
    \ crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they\nhad parasites and\
    \ to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique\n\
    for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);\n\
    •\nMonitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to analyze the\nentire dataset obtained from crops to make future predictions,\
    \ the PLANTAE platform [20] is a\nsystem capable of managing the agricultural\
    \ process and simultaneously using machine-learning\ntechniques to detect possible\
    \ diseases in plants. Other works, such as that of Choudhury et al. [21],\nmonitored\
    \ the behavior of plants to avoid pests and diseases. Through the use of a mobile\n\
    applications, farmers report events that improve the models of diseases used;\n\
    •\nEfﬁcient water management: Crop water adjustments should avoid water stress.\
    \ Riquelme\net al. [22] showed how the use of cloud services involving the FIWARE\
    \ platform allows for the\nimprovement of the management of water used for irrigation\
    \ in areas with water deﬁcits. Another\nproject to be considered, also based on\
    \ FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective\nis to develop innovative\
    \ methods based on the IoT for the intelligent management of irrigation\nwater,\
    \ using the semantic characteristics provided by a context engine based on the\
    \ SPARQL\nProtocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) Event Processing Architecture;\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n5 of 20\n•\nImprovement in greenhouse management: By monitoring\
    \ its different components, Zamora-\nIzquierdo et al. [24] proposed a ﬂexible\
    \ platform capable of meeting the needs of hydroponic\ncrops in a greenhouse with\
    \ complete recirculation. For this FIWARE-based deployment, Message\nQueuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a\nmeans\
    \ to represent the information. Somov et al. [25] constructed a system to monitor\
    \ both the\nconditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants\
    \ for the prediction of the growth\nrate of tomatoes in different environments.\n\
    IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants\
    \ to provide its\nactivity with a smart component. These platforms collect and\
    \ store data in a distributed database for\nthe ﬁltering, analysis, calculation,\
    \ decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data\nin new\
    \ services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration\
    \ of IoT services\nand their characteristics can be found, such as that provided\
    \ by Silva et al. [26], although a results\ncomparison is difﬁcult because of\
    \ the lack of standardization.\n2. Proposed System\nThis article proposes an open\
    \ and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.\nThe platform,\
    \ based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration\
    \ of\nheterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other\
    \ third-party solutions for\nexchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally,\
    \ this platform exploits the stored information\nto analyze, in real time, the\
    \ factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and\n\
    the optimal use of water for irrigation.\n2.1. Proposed Data Model\nAs a result\
    \ of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data\
    \ generated\nby the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided\
    \ with standardized information\nmodels that permit farmers to make the best possible\
    \ decisions, allowing them to take advantage of\nthe available data and knowledge.\
    \ Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional\nrequirements\
    \ of the users.\nThe proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers,\
    \ responsible technicians, and farm\nmanagers about the useful and necessary information\
    \ that should be managed on a farm. The existing\nmodels are too specialized;\
    \ although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their\nimplementation\
    \ is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet\n\
    the needs of our users.\nConceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed\
    \ by FIWARE harmonized data\nmodels [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that\
    \ includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them\nto characterize\
    \ the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water\
    \ quality\nand the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the\
    \ model focuses on the efﬁcient\nmanagement of the crop plots and all the included\
    \ elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed data\
    \ model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot\n\
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation\
    \ entity. The plot is\ncharacterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely\
    \ deﬁned:\n•\nDevices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide\
    \ information to the plot and are\nclassiﬁed based on the parameters studied:\
    \ AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture\nprobes, temperature\
    \ and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop\n\
    (leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere,\
    \ which are\nthe devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature,\
    \ humidity, radiation, and wind\nspeed). These data are used to optimize agricultural\
    \ decisions;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n6 of 20\n•\nWater, represented by AgriWater,\
    \ indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect\nirrigation.\
    \ AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the\
    \ water\ndistribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary\
    \ for fertilization and\nirrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity\
    \ of nutrients carried by the water;\n•\nSoil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates\
    \ the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more\ndetailed by indicating\
    \ the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers\n\
    (horizons) that deﬁne the ground;\n•\nCultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes\
    \ the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the\nplot is associated. The\
    \ crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its\n\
    growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time.\
    \ The phenology\nis determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone,\
    \ AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences\nthe optimal climatic conditions for the development\
    \ of the crops.\nAnother feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management,\
    \ represented by the AgriScene\nentity, including images or scenes from any satellite\
    \ or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,\nAgriBand, of different wavelengths.\
    \ In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,\nafter processing,\
    \ such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation\
    \ or\nwater, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.\nFigure 1. Speciﬁc data\
    \ model for agricultural plot management.\nThe main feature of the IoT-based interoperability\
    \ mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging\ninformation homogeneously in different\
    \ systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this\ncontinuous exchange\
    \ of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value,\
    \ the\nspeciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the\
    \ set of attributes that compose\nthe entities and their relationships [28]. As\
    \ NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or\nontologies, we added\
    \ a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information\n\
    models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic\
    \ element of\nthe study sector.\nIn Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model\
    \ is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the\nuse of NGSI-LD concerning\
    \ NGSI are as follows:\n•\nThe information model is based on graphs and focuses\
    \ on information. The concept of Relation\nappears. Entities can have properties\
    \ and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the\nobject of the properties\
    \ or relationships;\n•\nAll data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique\
    \ Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)\ncorresponding to well-established semantic\
    \ identiﬁers;\n•\nIt allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms\
    \ are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows\nusers to refer to their information deﬁnitions;\n\
    •\nThe model and query language is more constrained;\n•\nThe use of JSON-LD allows\
    \ us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n\
    7 of 20\n•\nThere were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer\
    \ needed, GeoProperty is\nused instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included,\
    \ TemporalProperty is used instead of\nDateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used\
    \ to encode the relation target.\n2.2. System Architecture\nSince the new IoT\
    \ devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with\nfaster\
    \ and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent\
    \ of the\nprovider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between\
    \ applications/services\nand the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a\
    \ common framework so that applications can\ninteract with any aspect that is\
    \ part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device\nor controller\
    \ using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturers or services.\nThe architecture of the platform\
    \ proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered\nmodular form\
    \ ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for\
    \ data\nextraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers\
    \ is based on open and standard\ninitiatives, such as the one provided by the\
    \ FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.\nFigure 2. General vision of\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nThe ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents\
    \ the different sources of information that form\nthe system; these include sensors,\
    \ actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases\nwith updated\
    \ information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies\n\
    to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module\
    \ acts as an\nintermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally\
    \ or bidirectionally\n(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to\
    \ interact with the platform.\nA speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions\
    \ imposed by the modules on the processing\ncapacity, memory, and even the available\
    \ power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent\nthem from using\
    \ heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols\
    \ such as\nCoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to\
    \ perform communications\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n8 of 20\nwith the different\
    \ devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).\n\
    As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating\
    \ the information\nsent through these protocols to the interface made available\
    \ by the broker through NGSI-LD.\nThe second layer, Information Management, contains\
    \ software components in charge of data storage,\nprocessing, and distribution.\
    \ The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that\nwork\
    \ together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper\
    \ layer. The\nNGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations\
    \ about data changes. Figure 3\npresents an example of how the information provided\
    \ by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON\nover MQTT, is integrated into the\
    \ platform.\nFigure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.\n\
    The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater\
    \ treatment\nplant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water.\
    \ Once the entity is created in the\nbroker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers\
    \ can retrieve this information following two different\napproaches: query or\
    \ subscription.\nThe core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information\
    \ broker that exposes an\nHTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration\
    \ and consultation, as well as a subscription/\nnotiﬁcation approach. This is\
    \ the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of\n\
    NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both\
    \ directions. One\nof these solutions that has been integrated into the platform\
    \ through the development of a connector\nis MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO\
    \ 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a\nstandardized model applied\
    \ to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and\nthe\
    \ control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored\
    \ information of each\nentity is overwritten, with only the current state being\
    \ kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational\ndatabase, MongoDB. This\
    \ database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,\nas\
    \ well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled\
    \ using data\nmodels that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards\
    \ and also ensure the generality\nnecessary for the subsequent extensibility.\n\
    The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central\
    \ layer to offer different\nsolutions to the problems that are generated in an\
    \ agricultural operation, such as water management,\nirrigation planning, data\
    \ analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n9 of 20\nof other modules allows us to provide our solution\
    \ with more capabilities due to the possibility of\nintegrating new components\
    \ through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send\ndata\
    \ updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration\
    \ parameters\ntriggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user\
    \ level. As a result of the use of\nspeciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted\
    \ or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of\npropagating it for other\
    \ interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or\n\
    integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational\
    \ state\ntransfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication\
    \ between the ﬁnal\napplications and the analysis modules.\n3. Case Study in an\
    \ Irrigation Community\nThis section validates our data model and the architecture\
    \ of the platform. It was implemented in\nan irrigation community where different\
    \ systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA), GIS systems,\
    \ and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.\n\
    3.1. Scenario\nIrrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations,\
    \ which are responsible\nfor the management of the shared use of public common\
    \ water. To this end, they relied on automatons\nand speciﬁc irrigation systems\
    \ for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction\nbetween\
    \ the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting\
    \ with third-party\ndevices and software applications.\nThe Miraﬂores irrigation\
    \ community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in\nthe Segura\
    \ river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about\
    \ 1330 ha\nof agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by\
    \ localized irrigation. The main\ncrops produced are fruit trees, especially pear,\
    \ peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,\n3.8 hm3 annually, and\
    \ water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant\n\
    delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the\
    \ available ﬂows to six\ninterconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity\
    \ of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts\nwater from the rafts to the various\
    \ irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and\nsetpoints,\
    \ ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.\nOne of the main problems\
    \ to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements\n(SCADA,\
    \ drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide\
    \ information\nto the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA\
    \ that are integrated into the platform\nare shown in Table 1. The results derived\
    \ from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month\nwere also integrated\
    \ into the platform.\nTable 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and\
    \ data acquisition (SCADA) that are integrated\ninto the platform and the associated\

    \ Equipment and Implementation\nFigure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed\
    \ to address the deployment of the platform.\nThe ﬁrst step was to channel water\
    \ from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n10 of 20\nto the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the\
    \ key elements of the system. All the devices needed for\nits deﬁnition are integrated\
    \ using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data\nand\
    \ the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural\
    \ weather station, and\nhydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information\
    \ is transferred to the data model for later\nvisualization (using mobile or web\
    \ applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.\nFigure\
    \ 4. Layout of the case study.\nThe deployment involved the installation of controllers\
    \ for monitoring, and remote control in\noutdoor environments were provided by\
    \ Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform\nwas reduced due\
    \ to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget\
    \ needed\nfor dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.\
    \ In this instance, the cost of\nthe chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average\
    \ price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration\nand installation) and varies\
    \ according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,\n\
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software\
    \ as digital or\nanalogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks\
    \ (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox,\
    \ Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12\nis able to manage eight additional\
    \ slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured\neffortlessly through\
    \ their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the\n\
    MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed\
    \ for outdoor\nsettings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided\
    \ with water- and dust-proof enclosure.\nIt is provided with a battery and a solar\
    \ panel.\nThe dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil\
    \ conductivity, soil moisture,\nsoil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological\
    \ parameters, among others, and to operate\nthe solenoid valves to control the\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD\
    \ EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of\nRAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB\
    \ each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and\nLibVirt/KVM. A single virtual\
    \ machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n11 of 20\nprocesses, and to host management with web services.\
    \ The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and\n400 GB of hard disk capacity.\
    \ A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility\nof our\
    \ architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.\n\
    Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities\
    \ were deﬁned\nin the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later.\
    \ The broker manages subscriptions\nto the creation or changes of entities. All\
    \ these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational\nJSON-LD object-based database,\
    \ to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of\nprocessing\
    \ is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down\
    \ the rest of\nthe implementations.\nTo improve the data of the irrigation plots,\
    \ the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used\naccording to the needs proposed\
    \ by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was\nconstructed\
    \ through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing\
    \ 2.\nListing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD)\

    \ and Validation\nThis section describes the validation of the platform in a community\
    \ of irrigators from three\ndifferent perspectives. The tests were conducted under\
    \ a controlled environment with the equipment\ndescribed in Section 3.2.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n14 of 20\n4.1. Information Broker Evaluation\nThe main element\
    \ of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the\n\
    information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions,\
    \ and the management\nof the information providers. For this reason, an analysis\
    \ was performed by selecting the following\nmetrics: CPU usage, memory consumed,\
    \ and response times, according to the operations performed.\nFirstly, different\
    \ execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the\n\
    changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the\
    \ same type of requests,\nchecking their response time in terms of both CPU and\
    \ RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute\nexecution varying the number of simultaneous\
    \ communications or connections with which it was\nperformed. Figure 5 shows the\
    \ results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.\n(a) CPU\
    \ usage\n(b) RAM usage\nFigure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.\nFigure\
    \ 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals\
    \ (2, 4,\nand 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU\
    \ remained stable with average\nvalues close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the\
    \ behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable\nfrom the beginning\
    \ to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use\
    \ of the\nRAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that\
    \ are considered optimal.\nThe behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on\
    \ the information distribution characteristic\nthat the broker had acquired. To\
    \ this end, the response time obtained after performing various\noperations on\
    \ the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant\n\
    values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for\
    \ the different modes:\nentity management, subscription management, and context\
    \ provider control.\n•\nThe publication/subscription model enables the reduction\
    \ of the number of queries because it is\nnot necessary to make periodic queries\
    \ to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The\ncreation time is\
    \ longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;\n•\nThe management\
    \ of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,\n\
    making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission\
    \ is to act as a proxy\nbetween the client and the context provider. For this\
    \ reason, search and consultation times are\nshorter compared with the rest of\
    \ the operations.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n15 of 20\n(a) Entities\n(b) Subscriptions\n\

    This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based\
    \ on the three layers\nthat form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained\
    \ for the system after the execution of\n100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation\
    \ times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker\nnotiﬁes the IoT Agent)\
    \ and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are\n\
    longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided\
    \ by the use of the data\nmodel is performed in the database (MongoDB). However,\
    \ in exchange for this increase in time, it is\npossible to have all the relevant\
    \ information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated\ninto a single\
    \ point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance management.\n\
    The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time is less than\
    \ if it is not; the average\nresponse time of 31.18 ms is considered low.\nSensors\

    \ Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level\nData interoperability is of critical\
    \ importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and\nplatform) provides\
    \ the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model\n\
    together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD.\
    \ This proposal enables\nthe integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources,\
    \ resulting in an open and interoperable data\nintegration model according to\
    \ the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes\nto obtaining\
    \ performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.\n\
    Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed.\
    \ The analysis of\nthe data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system.\
    \ To have a continuous and homogeneous\nirrigation system, we deemed it necessary\
    \ to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural\ntechnicians. As\
    \ the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits\
    \ of the\nsoil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount\
    \ of water between these\ntwo values is the functional water or humidity available\
    \ to the plant. Once the community technicians\ndeﬁned the limits for the crops,\
    \ tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation\nefﬁciency:\
    \ the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and\
    \ another after\nimproving the irrigation programming based on the results of\
    \ the ﬁrst test (between June and July).\nFigure 8. Evolution of the humidity\
    \ of an apricot crop based on set water levels.\nOnce the ﬁrst test was analyzed,\
    \ Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones\nwere generated,\
    \ A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n17 of 20\nthat water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce\
    \ resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root\nasphyxiation was produced\
    \ (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)\n\
    in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability\
    \ to supply itself\nwith water, consequently reducing the quality of the production\
    \ of the crop. Once the maximum and\nminimum thresholds are set, rules can be\
    \ deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are\nexceeded or not reached,\
    \ the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.\n\
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the\
    \ start-up of any device\nthat improves irrigation efﬁciency.\nAs a result of\
    \ the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the\
    \ help of\nan agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established\
    \ or adjusted. In addition, other\nuseful parameters can be established, such\
    \ as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of\nthe probes. Once\
    \ the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was\n\
    efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with\
    \ the humidity curves,\nshowing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the\
    \ hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the\nlimits set, irrigation was controlled\
    \ to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to\ninform of possible\
    \ alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.\n\
    Figure 9.\nEvolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water\
    \ contribution by\nthe hydrant.\nThe versatility of the platform is stressed by\
    \ the ability to export selected data for further\nprocessing or study, as shown\
    \ in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work\
    \ demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ water\nmanagement, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open\
    \ platform is presented which\nis capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources\
    \ at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision\nmaking in a community of irrigators.\
    \ The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors\nfrom different\
    \ manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.\n\
    As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible,\
    \ thereby sustainably\nobtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields.\
    \ As a result of its interoperable nature,\nthe platform can be combined with\
    \ other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n18 of 20\naspect was tested in a real-world context where successful\
    \ integration with other systems already\ndeployed in the facilities of the irrigation\
    \ community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The\nplatform integrates\
    \ different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and\
    \ HTTP.\nThey transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless,\
    \ a set of them promote\ninteroperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine\
    \ (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These\nrepresentation formats were adopted by\
    \ the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT\ndevices, making\
    \ use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform\
    \ the\nadaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model.\
    \ After analyzing the obtained\nresults in the community of irrigators, the following\
    \ conclusions were obtained:\n1.\nA homogeneous data model was proposed that meets\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such\nas efﬁcient water management. This model\
    \ was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD\nbroker. The application of this\
    \ model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the\ncapacity to\
    \ manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that\
    \ provide\ninformation to improve irrigation water;\n2.\nThe platform was validated\
    \ using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main\n\
    component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU\
    \ (83.21%) and\nmemory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded\
    \ on the most relevant operations\nof the broker, highlighting among them the\
    \ average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context\nprovider. The platform\
    \ was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the\ndevice\
    \ receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and\
    \ from the\nmoment the action is performed (31.17 ms);\n3.\nAt the user level,\
    \ the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the\nmanagement\
    \ of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition\n\
    of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations\
    \ that, under\ncertain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling\
    \ efﬁcient water use.\nIn the future, the speed of computing and latency should\
    \ be compared by replicating the platform\nin edge computing with current cloud\
    \ computing to detect which one provides better performance and\nresponse times.\
    \ One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level,\
    \ this feature\nwill monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications\
    \ based on remote sensors. This new\nattribute will focus on the diagnosis, management,\
    \ and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature\nuses images of the Sentinel\
    \ 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ\n\
    satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included\
    \ within the National Earth\nObservation Programme) will be used. Another future\
    \ line of research is the development of a data\nanalysis module that will allow\
    \ us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This\nwill generate\
    \ better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce\
    \ expenses,\nsuch as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary\
    \ products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M., J.A.M. and A.F.S.;\

    Abstract: California has unsustainable use of agricultural water and energy, as\
    \ well as problems\nof severe drought, nitrate pollution and groundwater salinity.\
    \ As the leading producer and ex-\nporter of agricultural produce in the United\
    \ States, 5.6 percent of California’s energy is currently\nused for pumping groundwater.\
    \ These problems and new regulatory policies (e.g., Sustainable\nGroundwater Management\
    \ Act, Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program) pressure growers to schedule,\naccount\
    \ and maintain records of water, energy and nutrients needed for crop and soil\
    \ management.\nGrowers require varying levels of decision support to integrate\
    \ different irrigation strategies into\nfarm operations. Decision support can\
    \ come from the public or private sector, where there are\nmany tradeoffs between\
    \ cost, underlying science, user friendliness and overall challenges in farm\n\
    integration. Thus, effective irrigation management requires clear deﬁnitions,\
    \ decision support and\nguidelines for how to incorporate and evaluate the water–nutrient–energy\
    \ nexus beneﬁts of different\npractices and combinations of practices under shifting\
    \ water governance. The California Energy\nCommission-sponsored Energy Product\
    \ Evaluation Hub (Cal-EPE Hub) project has a mission of\nproviding science-based\
    \ evaluation of energy-saving technologies as a direct result of improved water\n\
    management for irrigation in agriculture, including current and future irrigation\
    \ decision support\nsystems in California. This project incorporates end-user\
    \ perceptions into evaluations of existing\ndecision support tools in partnership\
    \ with government, agricultural and private stakeholders. In this\narticle, we\
    \ review the policy context and science underlying the available irrigation decision\
    \ support\nsystems (IDSS), discuss the beneﬁts/tradeoffs and report on their efﬁcacy\
    \ and ease of use for the\nmost prevalent cropping systems in California. Finally,\
    \ we identify research and knowledge-to-action\ngaps for incorporating irrigation\
    \ decision support systems into new incentives and requirements for\nreporting\
    \ water and energy consumption as well as salinity and nitrogen management in\
    \ the state\nof California.\nKeywords: food–water–energy nexus; nitrate leaching;\
    \ precision agriculture; water productivity;\nirrigation management; soil moisture\n\
    1. Introduction\nAgricultural production in California includes the cultivation\
    \ of approximately 400 crops\naccounting for one-third of vegetable and two-thirds\
    \ of fruit and nut production in the\nUnited States [1]. According to California\
    \ Agricultural Production Statistics (2019), this\nagricultural abundance makes\
    \ California a leading US state accounting for over 13% of the\ncountry’s total\
    \ value in agricultural production. Some of California’s leading crops include\n\
    almonds, grapes, strawberries, pistachios, lettuce, walnuts and processing tomatoes\
    \ [1]. In\norder to produce these crops for export across the country and other\
    \ parts of the world,\ngreat amounts of water, fertilizer and energy are used.\
    \ In California, agricultural water\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12081962\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n2 of 31\nuse represents\
    \ one-ﬁfth of the electricity consumed for water use and four percent of total\n\
    electricity consumption annually [2]. Approximately 75–80% of the total water\
    \ pumped is\nused to irrigate three million hectares throughout the state [3,4].\
    \ The majority of the water\nand energy consumption is during the summer growing\
    \ season (June to August), relying on\ngroundwater that uses between 496 to 1750\
    \ Megajoules per Megaliter of water [5]. Declines\nin aquifer levels, increased\
    \ land subsidence and loss of storage strain growers for energy\nefﬁciency improvements\
    \ in drought years. The ampliﬁed demand for water and energy\nduring drought also\
    \ lowers stream ﬂows and lake levels, which impact the production\nof hydroelectric\
    \ power. In addition, the water table is lowered continually during these\nperiods,\
    \ as growers pump groundwater from deeper wells demanding more power. The\nCalifornia\
    \ drought assessment of 2014 reported a loss of 8.1 million ML of surface water\n\
    with a simultaneous increase of 6.3 million ML in groundwater pumped for an additional\n\
    cost of USD 454 million [6]. Flood and furrow irrigation still account for approximately\n\
    40 percent of the total irrigated area in California, despite the advances and\
    \ investments in\nirrigation systems. The adoption of the drip and micro-sprinkler\
    \ irrigation signiﬁcantly\nincreased in acreage between 1991 (0.52 million hectares)\
    \ and 2010 (16 million hectares) [7].\nFigure 1 identiﬁes the hydrologic regions\
    \ across the state of California and the distribution\nof major crops, irrigation\
    \ methods and levels of salinity in irrigation water.\nCalifornia’s increasing\
    \ severity of droughts not only depletes groundwater but also\nincreases the carbon\
    \ footprint and greenhouse gas emissions from increased burning of\nfossil fuels\
    \ to generate the power for pumping groundwater. After facing several severe\n\
    drought years, state leaders implemented incentives, regulations and policies\
    \ to manage\ngroundwater that require record keeping and reporting of water use,\
    \ nitrogen (N) leaching\nand energy consumption. Simple and scalable irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are\nneeded to facilitate base information for growers\
    \ to manage and maximize irrigation\nwater, energy and N use efﬁciency. On-farm\
    \ water management using irrigation decision\nsupport systems coordinates the\
    \ development and management of water, land and related\nresources aimed toward\
    \ equitable economic welfare and sustainable water use for future\ngenerations\
    \ [8,9]. Irrigation decision support systems (IDSS) are integrated solutions\n\
    combining and interpreting real-time meteorological, soil moisture and/or crop\
    \ water\nstress data using telemetric services to help growers make irrigation\
    \ decisions. Most of\nthe ﬁrst IDSS developed in California ranged from spreadsheets\
    \ to stand-alone software.\nWith recent improvements in public weather-station\
    \ networks, sensor technology, satellite\nand aerial imaging, wireless communications\
    \ and cloud computing, web and smartphone\napplications automating a range of\
    \ complex calculations involved in evapotranspiration-\nbased irrigation scheduling,\
    \ crop and soil nitrogen status IDDS have been developed.\nThe California Energy\
    \ Product Evaluation Hub (or Hub) was proposed by the Califor-\nnia Energy Commission\
    \ to ﬁll an information gap between energy sector manufacturers\nand large commercial\
    \ and institutional customers. The purpose of the Hub is to accelerate\nthe adoption\
    \ of beneﬁcial technologies by informing customers purchasing distributed\nenergy\
    \ resource products through procurement processes. The objectives of the Hub are\
    \ to\nevaluate the selected distributed energy resource products (e.g., IDSS)\
    \ in a rigorous and\ntransparent manner and widely disseminate the evaluation\
    \ results to large commercial and\ninstitutional customers. The evaluations will\
    \ allow comparisons of similar technologies,\nas well as comparisons to existing\
    \ government and industry standards. The evaluations,\nand the data behind them,\
    \ will be distributed through the Hub’s public web platform. The\nHub is a cooperative\

    The overall goal of this narrative review is to identify, compile and assess the\
    \ available\nIDSS in California and how they may serve multiple water, energy\
    \ and nutrient manage-\nment goals. Here, we discuss the different water budget\
    \ components and measurements\nused in crop canopy, soil moisture, aerial reﬂectance\
    \ and satellite-based IDSS. We also\nconsider diverse California cropping and\
    \ irrigation systems and how different IDSS are\nintegrated into existing crop\
    \ irrigation management as part of the ongoing research of\nthe California Energy\
    \ Product Evaluation Hub. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps in\nIDSS research\
    \ and current available tools for integrating energy, nitrogen leaching and soil\n\
    salinity management.\n2. Objective and Review Methodology\nWe identiﬁed all active\
    \ IDSS in California through a comprehensive search of all IDSS\non the search\
    \ engines and in consultation with a California IDSS product advisory group.\n\
    The IDSS product advisory group consisted of growers, certiﬁed crop advisors,\
    \ cooperative\nextension advisors, the California Department of Agriculture, California\
    \ Agricultural\nIrrigation Association and additional government, industry and\
    \ trade organizations. The\nadvisory group helped deﬁne the IDSS needs for the\
    \ California cropping system. This\ninformation was used to identify the commercially\
    \ or freely available technologies and\nexclude the IDSS that have not yet been\
    \ made available for widespread use.\nSection 3 deﬁnes California’s water management\
    \ context and the need for IDSS un-\nder increasing drought, regulation and risk\
    \ management. Section 4 provides a broad\noverview of soil–plant–atmosphere approaches\
    \ for IDSS. Section 5 describes the commer-\ncially available IDSS based on soil\
    \ tension, canopy temperature, stem water potential and\nremote-sensing techniques.\
    \ Section 6 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\nintegrated irrigation\
    \ and energy management in agricultural systems. Section 7 describes\nthe science,\
    \ policy and role of IDSS for integrated irrigation and nitrogen (N) management\n\
    to control the environmental problems or groundwater contamination due to excessive\n\
    N fertilizer uses. Section 8 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\
    \ integrated\nirrigation and salinity management. Sections 9 and 10 focus on IDSS\
    \ as a holistic effort\nfor water, nutrient and salinity management and consider\
    \ the innovation, validation and\nadoption strategies.\n3. Context for IDSS in\
    \ California Agriculture\n3.1. Water Scarcity\nOverdrawn aquifers, decline in\
    \ snowpack, frequent droughts and rising evaporative\ndemand are increasing water\
    \ scarcity in California. These water resource concerns have\nled to decreasing\
    \ water availability for irrigation, increasing regulation (e.g., reduced allo-\n\
    cations), increasing energy consumption, difﬁculty in water/fertilization co-management\n\
    and increasing water and energy prices. Because the annual evaporative demand\
    \ exceeds\nprecipitation in the majority of California, irrigation is generally\
    \ considered compulsory.\nWhile most of the precipitation falls in the winter,\
    \ key economic crops have high water\ndemands during the spring–summer–fall season.\
    \ Additionally, there is a spatial disconnect\nbetween precipitation and agricultural\
    \ water demand in California. Most of the surface\nwater used for agriculture\
    \ comes from precipitation in the northern part of the state, while\nthe Central\
    \ Valley and southern parts of the state have the greatest demand for agricultural\n\
    water. These discrepancies in space and time have led to complex water conveyance,\n\
    storage and transfer systems that are important for understanding the potential\
    \ beneﬁts of\nIDSS for California growers [10].\nAlthough California spans a wide\
    \ range of climates, much of the state, including\nsome of the most productive\
    \ farmland, occupies semi-arid regions of the Central and Impe-\nrial Valleys,\
    \ which are characterized by a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers\nand\
    \ mild, wet winters. Statewide, the average water use is roughly 50% environmental,\n\
    40% agricultural and 10% urban [11]. By necessity, California has adopted management\n\
    strategies to deal with water shortages, such as reusing water, long-distance\
    \ water con-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n5 of 31\nveyance and desalination technologies\
    \ to complement local ground and surface water [12].\nUnfortunately, water supply\
    \ diversiﬁcation strategies can also lead to increased energy use\nand, consequently,\
    \ to increased greenhouse gas emissions [13]. California’s water system is\nestimated\
    \ to emit 10% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions [14]. Water–energy nexus\n\
    approaches recognize the close connection between water and energy and the importance\n\
    of considering all aspects of these complex systems [15,16]. As irrigation makes\
    \ up a large\nportion of the water supply system in the state, it is under critical\
    \ consideration by both\ngovernment agencies and agricultural end users. Policy\
    \ makers face the difﬁcult task of\nbalancing the needs of diverse stakeholders,\
    \ protecting the environment and providing\nreliable, sustainable water supplies\
    \ to agricultural, industrial and residential customers [16].\nAt the same time,\
    \ California growers face more frequent and severe drought events, warmer\ntemperatures\
    \ and variable rainfall associated with climate change [17], leading to increasing\n\
    dependence on irrigation [18].\nGrowers also face increasing competition for irrigation\
    \ water and growing concerns\nabout the environmental impacts of irrigation. Growers\
    \ pay for water, energy and infras-\ntructure to irrigate crops. California growers\
    \ pay between USD 12/106 ML−1 water in\ndirect costs and USD 17/151 ML−1 water\
    \ in energy costs [19–21]. While growers are willing\nto adopt new technologies\
    \ to reduce risks during periods of water shortage, the information\nprovided\
    \ by extension services and other educational sources plays an important role\
    \ in\nnew irrigation technology adoption [22].\n3.2. Regulations\nCalifornia growers\
    \ identify the key barriers to water and energy conservation efforts as\n(1) cost,\
    \ (2) a lack of return on investment (3) and uncertainty about the future of available\n\
    water. Cost alone is not enough to increase IDSS adoption or agricultural water\
    \ conserva-\ntion [23]. In semi-arid regions, regulating surface water without\
    \ regulating groundwater (or\nvice versa) increases pressure on the unregulated\
    \ water source instead of increasing the use\nof IDSS [24]. However, approaches\
    \ that involve cooperation across institutional ecosystems\nas well as multi-actor\
    \ governance and participation to jointly regulate groundwater and\nsurface water\
    \ quantity, nutrient/pollutant transport and energy usage may increase IDSS\n\
    adoption [23,25].\nFor the past century, California has been a demonstrative example\
    \ where the reg-\nulation and governance of surface water quantity and quality\
    \ have placed tremendous\nstress on groundwater supply and energy required to\
    \ pump groundwater in years with\nlimited surface water allocation. However, the\
    \ legislation and policies adapted in 2014–2016\nare attempting to jointly regulate\
    \ groundwater and surface water quantity, quality and\ncooperation across institutions.\
    \ In 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater\nManagement Act (SGMA),\
    \ in which two state agencies (Department of Water Resources and\nState Water\
    \ Resources Control Board) mandate and oversee communities self-organizing\ninto\
    \ groundwater sustainability agencies [26]. Each agency created groundwater sustain-\n\
    ability plans to achieve sustainability goals by 2040–2042. Similarly, in 2014,\
    \ the California\nIrrigated Lands Regulatory Program was expanded to regulate\
    \ nitrates in discharge to\nboth surface and groundwater from irrigated agricultural\
    \ lands [27]. California’s 2020\nheat wave and widespread agricultural power outages\
    \ have spurred agricultural trade\norganizations to consider the need for IDSS\
    \ to accommodate off-peak energy usage and\nregulations imposed by utility companies\
    \ [28]. However, there are not yet any direct\nstatewide regulations on the energy\
    \ used for groundwater pumping in California.\n3.3. Loss and Risk Management\n\
    3.3.1. Infrastructure Failures\nIDSS could help growers plan for water usage throughout\
    \ the growing season when\nadjustments may be required to accommodate irrigation\
    \ interruptions to avoid yield losses\nat critical moments. For example, in the\
    \ 2018 Census on Irrigation and Water Management,\n1792 CA growers (29,538 ha)\
    \ reported yield losses because of irrigation interruptions related\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n6 of 31\nto groundwater/surface water shortages, equipment failure,\
    \ energy shortages, high salinity,\nloss of water rights or increase in water\
    \ costs [29]. Having a formal IDSS in place does not\nprevent water, energy or\
    \ infrastructure disruptions but instead could assist in identifying\nequipment\
    \ failures and providing the projected data and calculations needed for difﬁcult\n\
    decisions—how best to prioritize the available water across the farm to the crops\
    \ that will\nhave the highest potential for short- and long-term revenue.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Disease-Based Losses and Water\nGrowers using intuitive, informal irrigation\
    \ practices may err on the side of applying\n‘extra’ water to ensure that crop\
    \ water requirements are met. Additionally, some IDSS may\nalso err on the side\
    \ of overprediction of evapotranspiration and crop water requirements\nto match\
    \ grower management practices. Although this logic may decrease the risk of\n\
    underwatering or water stress, it can increase water logging, nitrate leaching,\
    \ anoxia,\ndenitriﬁcation, salinity, soil erosion and runoff, in addition to the\
    \ wasted energy and water\ncosts [30]. In California perennial crops, overirrigation\
    \ or irrigating too soon can impact\nroot development—especially of shallow, ﬁne\
    \ roots—which can lead to long-term yield\nlosses, especially if the root zone\
    \ oxygen concentration drops below 10% [31]. In both\nannual and perennial crops,\
    \ overirrigation that increases soil and/or canopy moisture can\noften increase\
    \ the survival, growth, infection and dispersal of pathogens, which ultimately\n\
    leads to disease-based yield losses [32]. However, it is important to note that\
    \ not supplying\nenough water to meet crop needs can also trigger many belowground\
    \ diseases [32]. For\na comprehensive review of irrigation–disease interactions,\
    \ please see Swett (2020) [32].\nAlthough IDSS could integrate crop-speciﬁc co-management\
    \ of water and diseases in the\nfuture, to the best of our knowledge, no IDSS\
    \ currently have this function for California\ncropping systems.\n4. Soil–Plant–Atmosphere\
    \ Approaches and Data for IDSS in California\n4.1. Precipitation\nPrecipitation\
    \ is an important component of the hydrologic cycle considered for all\nwater\
    \ budgets. In California, real-time rainfall data can be acquired from different\
    \ sources,\nsuch as the Department of Water Resources California Irrigation Management\
    \ Information\nSystem (CIMIS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s\
    \ California Nevada\nRiver Forecast Center (CNRFC) and United States Climate Data.\
    \ For annual water budget-\ning, monthly precipitation data are often used. Several\
    \ researchers have observed decreases\nin precipitation and increases in autumn\
    \ temperatures since the 1980s [33,34]. In 2018, the\ndelayed start of precipitation\
    \ months resulted in the most destructive wildﬁres of California,\nburning about\
    \ 766,439 hectares of land area [34,35]. This has not only disturbed water\nbudget\
    \ planning and estimation, but it has also impacted the contamination of groundwater\n\
    and other available sources of irrigation by changing the pH due to debris and\
    \ ash [36].\n4.2. Evapotranspiration\nEvapotranspiration depends on weather conditions,\
    \ crop type, canopy density/\ndevelopment, stomatal conductance and regulation,\
    \ irrigation system and management,\nsoil management and soil type. In California,\
    \ the estimates of reference evapotranspiration\n(ETo) come from the 153 active\
    \ CIMIS stations that are sited, maintained and equipped\nby the California Department\
    \ of Water Resources to measure shortwave solar radiation\n(pyranometer), soil\
    \ temperature (thermistor), air temperature (HMP35), relative humidity\n(HMP35),\
    \ wind direction (wind vane), wind speed (anemometer) and precipitation (tipping\n\
    bucket rain gauge). The state is divided into 18 ETo climatic zones based on long-term\n\
    monthly CIMIS averages. Additionally, a spatial CIMIS data product combines the\
    \ network\nof available stations for ground measurement and satellite data in\
    \ order to simulate the\nETo of the whole state. CIMIS estimates hourly ETo for\
    \ cool-season grass with a height\nof 0.10–0.15 m using the CIMIS Penman equation,\
    \ which is modiﬁed from the Penman\nequation [37], with an approach for estimating\
    \ net radiation from shortwave solar radiation,\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n7 of\
    \ 31\ntemperature and relative humidity measurements developed and validated using\
    \ 71 net\nradiometers across California [38]. The CIMIS Penman equation also uses\
    \ different weights\nfor wind speed in the hourly estimation of ETo depending\
    \ on whether it is day or night\ntime and a unique cloud factor obtained from\
    \ each CIMIS station [39].\nIn addition to the CIMIS network, the National Oceanic\
    \ and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental\
    \ Satellite (GOES) satellites have\nbeen used to predict incoming solar radiation\
    \ as the main source energy for evapotran-\nspiration. Satellite-based ETo maps\
    \ are calculated on a two-kilometer grid, which is an\nimportant contribution\
    \ of data for decision making, given that the distance between the\nCIMIS stations\
    \ can be tens of kilometers. These freely available estimates of ETo can be\n\
    paired with crop-speciﬁc coefﬁcients (Kc) to estimate crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) during\nthe growing season. It is important to note that evapotranspiration\
    \ offers decision support\nas to how much water has been used by the crop based\
    \ on meteorological data or will be\nused by the crop based on meteorological\
    \ forecasting [40,41].\n4.3. Irrigation Scheduling Resources\nThe quantity and\
    \ timing of water application to irrigate a crop is a critical part of\nplanning\
    \ a growing season. Crop management activities are mainly dependent on the\nmoisture\
    \ present in the soil and root matrix. Scheduling depends on the combination\n\
    of evaporative demand from the atmosphere, spatial and temporal heterogeneity\
    \ in soil\nproperties and changes in crop canopy during a growing season. California\
    \ IDSS currently\nschedule irrigation by measuring, remotely sensing and/or modeling\
    \ some combination of\nthree different categories: (1) evapotranspiration, (2)\
    \ allowable depletion of soil moisture\nand (3) canopy characteristics [42]. In\
    \ this work, we discuss California IDSS and state\nspeciﬁc data sources that can\
    \ be used to ascertain data from these categories and represent\nthese tools and\
    \ sensors in Figure 2. These categories are used in IDSS throughout the world,\n\
    and we recommend Gu et al. (2020) for an in-depth general review [43].\n4.3.1.\
    \ In Situ Calculation of Crop Coefﬁcient Values\nCrop coefﬁcient (Kc) values can\
    \ be obtained for the entire growing season from his-\ntorical evapotranspiration\
    \ databases for specialty crops (almonds, walnuts, pistachios,\nprocessing tomatoes,\

    \ program. There are available databases maintained by the University of Califor-\n\

    management/irrigation-guide/ (accessed on 20 August 2021)) that provide regional\
    \ esti-\nmates of ETo and ETc for growers. Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to\
    \ measure actual\nevapotranspiration to derive the Kc values speciﬁc to California\
    \ crops and management.\nDirect measurements using lysimetry, eddy covariance\
    \ and surface renewal have estimated\nKc values for almond, pistachio, walnut,\
    \ processing tomato, wine grapes, lettuce, rice,\ncorn, wheat, and alfalfa (Table\
    \ 1) [44–68]. It is important to note that the Kc values derived\nfrom actual\
    \ evapotranspiration studies have several assumptions and site-speciﬁc limita-\n\
    tions for widespread adoption and water use projections. Attention should be given\
    \ as\nto whether water stress had occurred during the actual evapotranspiration\
    \ measurement\nperiods as well as the uncertainty of actual evapotranspiration\
    \ estimates by a method-\nological approach. The use of crop coefﬁcients for irrigation\
    \ of perennial crops is often\nmore challenging than for annual crops. This is\
    \ because there can be signiﬁcant variability\nas a consequence of the crop density,\
    \ crop load, row orientation, variety, irrigation sys-\ntem, pruning, ﬂoor management,\

    \ depletion of soil moisture approach requires some knowledge or a priori\nassumption\
    \ of the effective crop rooting depth, soil textural and hydrological properties\
    \ and\nestimates of either soil volumetric water content or soil water potential.\
    \ These parameters\nare used to estimate the plant available water content (AWC)\
    \ as the difference between ﬁeld\ncapacity and permanent wilting point. The allowable\
    \ depletion is established as a threshold\nbased on a fraction of AWC or speciﬁc\
    \ soil water potential at which water stress will occur\nwithout irrigation. The\
    \ allowable depletion can differ by soil texture, crop type, as well\nas phenological\
    \ stage. In California, the allowable depletion can range from 25% AWC in\nonions\
    \ to 90% AWC in ripening wheat but generally runs in the 45–50% AWC range [69–71].\n\
    Allowable depletion, whether measured or modeled, offers decision support regarding\n\
    how much to irrigate (e.g., reﬁll the soil proﬁle), as well as when to initiate\
    \ irrigation. It\nis important to note that allowable depletion is not a direct\
    \ assessment of plant water\nstress but rather assumes plant water stress based\
    \ on empirical relationships between plant\nphysiological stress (e.g., stem water\
    \ potential, canopy temperature, reduced transpiration)\nand soil volumetric water\
    \ content or soil water potential.\nSoil cohesion and adhesion to water molecules\
    \ determines the soil water potential\n(suction or negative pressure). Plants\
    \ take up water when water potential is between\nthe ﬁeld capacity (−0.33 bar)\
    \ and permanent wilting point (−15 bar). Therefore, irriga-\ntion scheduling is\
    \ performed by maintaining the soil moisture within this range of soil\nwater\
    \ potential. The most commonly used methods for soil moisture or water potential\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n10 of 31\nmonitoring in California are tensiometers,\
    \ electrical resistance block (watermark sensors)\nor capacitance-based sensors\
    \ [72]. Recent developments in telemetric operations allow\nmanufacturers to combine\
    \ the soil moisture sensors with web or mobile applications as\nremote systems.\
    \ Additionally, the user friendliness of remote telemetry and real-time\nmoisture\
    \ data in the ﬁeld are now integrated with automated irrigation systems. Some\n\
    of the common telemetric operators for soil moisture sensors in California are\
    \ Wildeye,\nFarm(X), Hortau, Irriwatch and AquaSpy.\n4.3.3. Scheduling with Crop\
    \ Canopy Characteristics\nRecent advancements in the capture and interpretation\
    \ of remotely sensed vegetative\nindices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index or NDVI) allow growers to empirically\nderive real-time values of crop\
    \ coefﬁcients throughout the growing season [73–75]. Remote\nsensing tools, such\
    \ as directly or remotely piloted aerial vehicles or satellite imagery, aid in\n\
    the use of algorithms to combine remotely sensed vegetative indices and soil reﬂectance\n\
    maps [76–79]. This combination helps growers manage irrigation in orchard cropping\n\
    systems where NDVI and other index values for individual trees can be calculated.\
    \ In\nCalifornia, these services are widely provided by Ceres Imaging Inc. to\
    \ specialty crop grow-\ners. Additionally, CropManage uses satellite-based estimates\
    \ of phenology for irrigation\nscheduling [80–82].\n5. IDSS for Crop Water Management\
    \ in California\nThe use of IDSS has increased in California in the last decade,\
    \ especially for efﬁcient\nwater application preparation for the SGMA regulatory\
    \ standards. The most common\nIDSS in California integrate two major components:\
    \ (1) data input/analysis and (2) user\ninterface. The data input/analytical techniques\
    \ acquire data based on soil, crop and/or\nweather parameters, and the user interface\
    \ is based on telemetry that simpliﬁes the acquired\ndata using statistical interpretation,\
    \ photogrammetry and/or simulation modeling. The\nease of understanding or user\
    \ friendliness of the acquired information depends on the\nuse of graphics, color\
    \ notations and approach to simplify the complex data [83]. The\nIDSS commonly\
    \ used in cultivating specialty crops in California can be classiﬁed into\nthree\
    \ types (Table 2): (1) soil-based IDSS, (2) canopy-based IDSS and (3) remote-sensing\n\
    IDSS. Irrigation strategies, such as deﬁcit irrigation, subsurface drip irrigation,\
    \ overhead\nlinear move sprinkler irrigation, deep root irrigation, pressure-compensated\
    \ drip irrigation,\nautomated surface irrigation, and tail recovery systems may\
    \ enhance water use efﬁciency\nfor high-value crops in California [84].\n5.1.\
    \ Soil-Based IDSS\nIn IDSS, soil moisture is generally reported in inches of water\
    \ per foot of soil or as\na percentage of weight or volume [2,85], while soil\
    \ water potential is usually reported in\nbars or kPa. The California IDSS based\
    \ on soil moisture usually also estimate or infer soil\nhydrologic properties\
    \ (e.g., texture, AWC) to contextualize the recommendations. Therefore,\nthe soil\
    \ sensors used as IDSS can be divided into two types.\nType 1—IDSS based on volumetric\
    \ moisture content. These soil moisture sensors include\ntime domain reﬂectometry,\
    \ capacitance and frequency domain reﬂectometry sensors [80,86].\nType 2—IDSS\
    \ based on soil water potential. These sensors include tensiometers and\ngranular\
    \ matrix sensors [87,88].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n11 of 31\nTable 2. List of\

    \ 12, 1962\n12 of 31\nSoil sensors are generally provided by IDSS vendors in combination\
    \ with their telemet-\nric services to access the data through cloud-based data\
    \ storage applications. The selection\nof these sensors is based on evaluating\
    \ water and energy savings, installation and mainte-\nnance, ease of use and suitability\
    \ for specialty crops and soil type, data interpretation and\nadditional services.\
    \ Vendors have the capability of making recommendations to growers\nby integrating\
    \ and installing in situ weather stations. However, the CIMIS weather stations\n\
    are widely spread throughout the state and provide reliable and validated information\
    \ on\nthe required weather parameters for water budgeting. Some commonly used\
    \ soil moisture\nsensors can be combined with telemetric services provided either\
    \ by the sensor company\nor by a separate IDSS vendor.\nSoil moisture probes are\
    \ widely used to determine the real-time volumetric moisture\ncontent allowing\
    \ user-friendly or site-speciﬁc calibrations. Measurements can be taken\nat the\
    \ desirable depths throughout the soil proﬁle. These sensors also provide additional\n\
    information on soil temperature and salinity. These sensors, based on design,\
    \ can also\nmeasure soil water potential up to −10 bars. The sensors are provided\
    \ to growers as leased\nassets, and real-time irrigation recommendations are made\
    \ through telemetry services.\nExamples include tensiometers that are designed\
    \ to measure soil water potential in heavy\n(0–1 bar) and light soils (0–0.3 bar).\
    \ Watermark sensors are based on electrical resistance in\nsoils and are widely\
    \ useful for measuring soil matric potential up to 2 bars.\n5.2. Canopy-Based\
    \ IDSS\nThe metabolic processes in a plant system are driven by its water content.\
    \ Plant water\nstatus can be estimated by monitoring physiological and metabolic\
    \ processes, such as stem\nor leaf water potential, relative moisture content,\
    \ stomatal conductance, canopy temperature\nand xylem cavitation [2,73,89–92].\
    \ The most commonly measured water stress parameters in\nCalifornia are canopy\
    \ temperature, canopy cover and stem water potential [2]. These plant\nwater status\
    \ indicators are most useful for irrigation timing and can be used to inform when\n\
    irrigation is required, when crops are not receiving enough irrigation, when there\
    \ are problems\nwith irrigation systems (e.g., distribution uniformity), as a\
    \ proxy for soil salinity stress and\nfor applying controlled stress to improve\
    \ crop quality or health. Plant water status indicators\nare less useful for understanding\
    \ how much irrigation is needed, as they do not provide\ninformation about soil\
    \ moisture or evaporative demand. Plant-based IDSS are generally\ncombined with\
    \ meteorological parameters and/or evapotranspiration data.\n5.2.1. Canopy Cover\n\
    Radiation interception and evapotranspiration depend on the canopy cover and sur-\n\
    face area of a crop. Canopy cover serves as an important parameter for several\
    \ remote-\nsensing techniques used as IDSS. As crop canopies change throughout\
    \ the growing season\nin terms of their size, area and reﬂectance properties,\
    \ so do the values of the crop coefﬁcient\n(Kc). The spectral reﬂectance of vegetation\
    \ or crop canopy can help growers understand\nthe variability in the ﬁeld by assessing\
    \ the plant vigor and chlorophyll content [93,94].\nA key component of canopy-based\
    \ IDSS is the crop and growth stage-speciﬁc Kc value.\nThe Kc values are usually\
    \ determined from ﬁeld studies measuring actual evapotranspi-\nration and ETo\
    \ [95,96] but can also be assessed using measurements of leaf area index,\nlight\
    \ interception and percent canopy cover. Some of the commonly used IDSS based\n\
    on evapotranspiration and canopy parameters include Arable Mark 2 sensors and\
    \ Tule\nsensors. These sensors are leased by the respective vendors, and the irrigation\
    \ recom-\nmendations based on canopy parameters are informed through web/mobile\
    \ applications.\nArable Mark 2 sensors are often combined with the soil moisture\
    \ probes to apply the soil\nand canopy parameters to complete the water budget\
    \ equation for irrigation decisions.\n5.2.2. Canopy Temperature\nCanopy temperature\
    \ indirectly measures water deﬁcit when it increases above the\nsurrounding ambient\
    \ temperature [97]. In general, the variability in canopy temperature\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n13 of 31\nis also a result of solar radiation and air temperature.\
    \ Different indices are used for\nirrigation scheduling using canopy temperatures.\
    \ Some examples include the Crop Water\nStress Index, Stress Degree Days, Stomatal\
    \ Conductance Index, Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold and Time Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT) [98–101]. In California, the Crop Water\nStress Index and Degrees Above\
    \ Canopy Threshold have been evaluated for wine grapes,\ncorn, pistachios and\
    \ wheat growers using infrared thermal radiometry [102,103]. The\nCrop Water Stress\
    \ Index is calculated by determining the canopy temperature minus\nthe air temperature\
    \ relative to a well-watered and non-transpiring reference crop [103].\nContrary\
    \ to the Crop Water Stress Index, the Degrees Above Canopy Threshold only\nrequires\
    \ a single canopy temperature measurement for quantifying water stress [103,104].\n\
    For point-based measurements, canopy temperature can be acquired using an infrared\n\
    thermal radiometer [103]. At larger spatial scales, thermal and spectral imagery\
    \ IDSS\n(e.g., Ceres Imaging) using remote-sensing tools can be used for determining\
    \ indices based\non canopy temperature.\n5.2.3. Stem Water Potential\nStem water\
    \ potential is an indicator of how hard a plant is pumping to move water\nfrom\
    \ the soil (−15 to 0 bars) through the xylem (−2 to −60 bars) to the atmosphere\n\
    (−200 to −800 bars) [105]. In California, stem water potential is most commonly\
    \ used\nand recommended for high-value perennial crops, such as grapes, almonds,\
    \ walnuts and\nprunes [106,107]. Stem water potential is most often measured by\
    \ a pressure chamber, which\napplies pressure to a sample leaf until the water\
    \ is pushed out of the stem [90,106,108].\nThere are growing numbers of sensors\
    \ available for measuring the stem water potential.\nThese sensors can function\
    \ as micro-chips or micro-tensiometers or dendrometers for\ninstallation in woody\
    \ vines or trunks [108]. In order to be useful, stem water potential\nmeasurements\
    \ need to be contextualized in relation to the environmental demand, as they\n\
    are sensitive to temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit [105]. Local tools are\
    \ available for\ngrowers to correct stem water potential readings in reference\
    \ to the evaporative demand and\ncompare the readings to baseline values when\
    \ water is not limited. The use of stem water\npotential measurements is high\
    \ in wine grapes, as growers are interested in maintaining\nspeciﬁc levels of\
    \ stress after veraison in order to maintain the quality (M. Cooper, personal\n\
    communication). Larger California vineyards have ‘pressure bomb teams’ to constantly\
    \ test\nstem water potential throughout the vineyards during the key time periods.\
    \ Although there\nare disease management beneﬁts to maintaining stress at hull\
    \ split, nut growers have still\nbeen slow to adopt the pressure chambers to measure\
    \ stem water potential, with adoption\nrates of under 20% among almond growers\
    \ [109].\n5.3. Remote-Sensing IDSS\nRemote and proximal sensing tools can be used\
    \ either independently or in conjunction\nwith ground measurements to estimate\
    \ actual evapotranspiration, ETc, allowable depletion\nand plant water status.\
    \ Remote sensing can use several modes of data collection, including\nsatellite,\
    \ aerial imaging and scanning towers. Remotely sensed measurements of evapotran-\n\
    spiration typically use thermal imaging as an indicator of canopy radiometric\
    \ temperature,\nwhere higher temperatures indicate relatively lower rates of evapotranspiration\
    \ (relatively\nhigher partitioning to sensible heat ﬂux), and relatively lower\
    \ temperatures indicate higher\nrates of evapotranspiration (relatively higher\
    \ partitioning to latent heat ﬂux). Remotely\nsensed vegetation indices from multispectral\
    \ data, such as NDVI, can be used as analogs for\nthe leaf area index, canopy\
    \ cover and height, which are also required for evapotranspiration\nmapping algorithms.\
    \ All remotely sensed evapotranspiration models solve for sensible\nheat ﬂux,\
    \ soil heat ﬂux and net radiation, which leaves the latent heat ﬂux or the energy\n\
    equivalent of evapotranspiration as the remainder of the energy budget. Some of\
    \ the en-\nergy balance models commonly used in evapotranspiration estimation\
    \ include Two-Source\nEnergy Balance (TSEB), Surface Energy Balance Algorithm\
    \ for Land (SEBAL), Surface En-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n14 of 31\nergy Balance\
    \ System (SEBS), Mapping EvapoTRanspiration using Internalized Calibration\n(METRIC)\
    \ and High-Resolution Mapping of EvapoTranspiration (HRMET) [77,110–115].\nThese\
    \ types of evapotranspiration maps and crop stress indices have been integrated\n\
    into several IDSS that serve California, such as Ceres Imaging (Oakland, CA, USA),\
    \ Ir-\nriwatch (Maurik, The Netherlands) and Open ET (a satellite-based water\
    \ data resource\nlaunched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\
    \ and United States\nGeological Services (USGS)). However, one potential concern\
    \ or drawback is that detectable\ndifferences in evapotranspiration based on canopy\
    \ radiometric temperature may be re-\nvealed too late for irrigation intervention,\
    \ in that crops exhibiting this level of water stress\nhave already suffered some\
    \ yield loss from decreased photosynthesis [116]. This limitation\nof thermal\
    \ imaging has led to new areas of development for IDSS that may involve combin-\n\
    ing a variety of spectral bands, solar-induced ﬂuorescence and thermal imagery\
    \ to provide\nadditional information relating water status to yields [117,118].\n\
    Proximal sensing of soil apparent electrical conductivity can be a useful tool\
    \ to de-\nvelop high-resolution maps of AWC and other important soil physical\
    \ and hydrological\nproperties [119]. These soil maps can be used in conjunction\
    \ with maps of evapotranspira-\ntion or stem water potential measurements to assess\
    \ plant water status [77,78]. In many\nareas outside of California, commercial\
    \ IDSS have been developed to assign management\nzones based on soil properties,\
    \ especially in regions where center pivot irrigation systems\ndominate and can\
    \ be retroﬁtted or designed with variable rate application technology. New\nopportunities\
    \ for precision irrigation exist in California micro-irrigation systems using\n\
    variable frequency drives to irrigate based on the management zones. However,\
    \ there\nare not yet commercially available IDSS in California that rely primarily\
    \ on soil apparent\nelectrical conductivity mapping to delineate zone-based irrigation\
    \ management.\n6. IDSS for Energy Management in California\n6.1. General Considerations\n\
    The California agricultural sector consumes 75% of total water use in California\n\
    compared to 24% and 1% for municipal and industrial sectors, respectively [4].\
    \ During\nthe most recent megadrought between 2012 and 2016, the groundwater contribution\
    \ to\ntotal water use nearly doubled from 30–40% to 60%, with most of this being\
    \ used for\nagricultural irrigation [120,121]. Agricultural groundwater consumption\
    \ is directly linked\nwith the energy required to pump groundwater from the aquifers.\
    \ In California, 8% of total\nenergy use is for agriculture, and 70% of the agricultural\
    \ energy used is for groundwater\npumping [122]. Agricultural water and energy\
    \ demand surge in dry years and the summer\nmonths—especially in the afternoons\
    \ during peak daily energy demand for water to cool\nboth crops and humans [123].\
    \ Additionally, 60% of daily water-related energy demand is\ndue to pumping irrigation\
    \ water in California from surface and groundwater sources [124].\nMost surface\
    \ irrigation systems have an irrigation efﬁciency of 67.5–70%, while the\ntraditional\
    \ sprinkler system ranges between 70 and 82.5%. Drip and micro-sprinkler\nsystems\
    \ have the highest irrigation efﬁciency compared to sprinkler or surface systems,\n\
    ranging between 87.5 and 90% [125]. Pressurized surface and subsurface drip or\
    \ micro-\nsprinkler irrigation systems improve irrigation efﬁciency but require\
    \ more energy than\nsurface ﬂood or gravity irrigation [121,126]. Because there\
    \ has been a nearly commensurate\nconversion in half of California’s irrigated\
    \ lands from surface ﬂood or gravity systems to\npressurized systems since 1972\
    \ [127], California’s irrigation infrastructure has unfortunately\nincreased its\
    \ overall energy consumption while increasing its overall water use efﬁciency.\n\
    6.2. Science\nThere are opportunities for coupled energy and water conservation\
    \ in agriculture\nthrough improving irrigation system efﬁciency, application efﬁciency,\
    \ as well as crop water\nuse efﬁciency. Agricultural pumping of irrigation water\
    \ uses approximately 10 TWh of\nelectricity per year [128], and at least 1 TWh\
    \ or 10% of this usage could be conserved\nthrough improved control of water with\
    \ better water metering and improved distribution\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n15\
    \ of 31\nuniformity [4]. Additionally, pumping reductions through science-based\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning efforts on farm- or district-wide scales may also reduce\
    \ energy consumption [123].\nAdditional energy savings may be available through\
    \ increasing the pump efﬁciency to\n55–65% and using variable frequency drives\
    \ to facilitate changes in pump speeds when\nsystem pressure demands are not peaking\
    \ [129]. Moreover, on-farm solar generation and\nsolar or hybrid solar pumps can\
    \ also curb peak energy demands that coincide with peak\nwater demands [123].\n\
    Finally, either front loading pumping to on-farm water storage structures in advance\n\
    of peak energy demand [123,130] or applying a larger magnitude of irrigation a\
    \ week in\nadvance of a predicted heat wave could mitigate peak energy usage during\
    \ heat waves [126].\nHowever, scheduling larger irrigation events in advance of\
    \ a heat wave would have to\nensure that soil properties facilitated storage rather\
    \ than drainage of excess water. Similarly,\ndeﬁcit irrigation has been suggested\
    \ for energy conservation; however, this would need to\nensure that there either\
    \ would not be a signiﬁcant yield loss or that the yield losses would be\nlow\
    \ enough to justify an overall proﬁt based on reduced energy and irrigation costs.\
    \ Finally,\nthere is an opportunity for collective and community-based action\
    \ from irrigation districts\nand newly formed groundwater sustainability agencies\
    \ to use and develop district-wide\ntools for common pool energy users to pump\
    \ and store water in advance of peak times, as\nwell as prioritize and optimize\
    \ groundwater pumping based on the crop stage and need\nduring droughts and heat\
    \ waves [131].\n6.3. Policy\nThe above coupled energy and water management measures\
    \ require supportive poli-\ncies and governance for success, in which California\
    \ has made some promising progress. In\nresponse to the groundwater-pumping-related\
    \ energy use and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions during the megadrought of 2012–2016,\
    \ California enacted the State Water Efﬁciency\nand Enhancement Program (SWEEP)\
    \ in 2014, which is the ﬁrst and largest program of its\nkind in the United States\
    \ to date. The SWEEP program involves a competitive application\nprocess for growers\
    \ to receive grants to make improvements that will reduce water and\nenergy consumption,\
    \ greenhouse gases, as well as improve drought resilience and air\nquality. Agricultural\
    \ operations can receive grants for three project categories: (1) pump\nand motor\
    \ enhancements, which include installing variable frequency drives and replacing\n\
    or improving the efﬁciency of motors or pumps; (2) irrigation system enhancements\
    \ for\nsystems with pumps, which include system pressure reduction measures, soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors, automating irrigation systems and IDSS; (3) fuel conversion\
    \ and renewable energy,\nwhich include changing fuel types to low-carbon fuel,\
    \ as well as the installation of on-site\nrenewable energy sources to offset fuel\
    \ use [132].\nApplicants must quantify the baseline information about current\
    \ energy, infrastruc-\nture efﬁciency and water use. Approximately one-third of\
    \ applicants have been awarded\nSWEEP at a maximum of USD 100,000 for 18 months\
    \ [133]. The awardees must use base-\nline water and energy data, as well as the\
    \ SWEEP Irrigation Water Savings Assessment\nTool and California Air Resources\
    \ Board Greenhouse Gas Calculator tool, to quantify the\nprojected water and energy\
    \ savings. The SWEEP program has invested USD 80 million in\nover 800 projects\
    \ for an annual water saving of 88,496 Megaliters and GHG reduction of\n80,077\
    \ MTCO2e [134]. The program’s challenges include the need for a stable, continuous\n\
    funding source and increased accessibility for small and socially disadvantaged\
    \ grow-\ners [133]. Speciﬁcally, although a third of projects have been located\
    \ in disadvantaged\ncommunities, only 10% of the funds have gone to socially disadvantaged\
    \ growers and\nranchers [133,134]. Although the SWEEP program has incentivized\
    \ and improved the\nirrigation system infrastructure and design for energy optimization,\
    \ there is still a need and\nlarge opportunity for IDSS and training related to\
    \ coupled water and energy management\nin California [133].\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\
    \ 1962\n16 of 31\n6.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Energy Management\n\
    Although there has been an identiﬁable need for co-management of irrigation and\n\
    energy, there is currently only one decision support tool deployed for this purpose\
    \ in\nCalifornia. The California Energy Commission funded the research and development\
    \ of\nAgMonitor [135]. AgMonitor integrates irrigation schedules based on the\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\napproach and monthly aerial imagery with ﬂow metering and all\
    \ on-farm energy sources\nand sinks. This IDSS provides information on irrigation\
    \ magnitude and timing events\nthat will also optimize energy conservation across\
    \ a farm and has been validated in key\nCalifornian crops, such as processing\
    \ tomato, almond, pistachio and alfalfa. Although\ncommercially available IDSS\
    \ are limited in this area, there are currently research-level\nIDSS in development\
    \ to optimize irrigation applications with photovoltaic power produc-\ntion [136,137].\n\
    7. IDSS for Nitrogen (N) Management in California\n7.1. General Considerations\n\
    California’s intensive irrigated agricultural production has led to the use of\
    \ large\namounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In contrast, N over-application\
    \ has been associated with\nwater pollution and various human health concerns\
    \ [138]. More than 50 years of tradeoffs\nbetween the use of N fertilizer and\
    \ the health of the environment have been documented in\nCalifornia [139,140].\
    \ Over the past years, the volume of inorganic N fertilizer used in the\nstate\
    \ has expanded dramatically. The annual sales between 1980 and 2001 have exceeded\n\
    600,000 tons of N [141].\nA signiﬁcant increase in the N fertilizer application\
    \ rate was observed in the Sacra-\nmento Valley, San Joaquin Basin and Tulare\
    \ Basin of the Central Valley for the period\n2002–2012 compared to 1991–2001\
    \ [142,143]. Nitrogen loading in the Sacramento Valley,\nSan Joaquin Basin and\
    \ Tulare Basin saw a signiﬁcant increase in 2002–2012 compared to\n1991–2001 [138].\
    \ More than 740,000 tons of N fertilizer was loaded on roughly 2.7 million\nhectares\
    \ of irrigated farmland in California. The excess N fertilizer leaches to groundwater\n\
    and affects the quality of drinking water [144]. Improper management of N fertiliza-\n\
    tion in California has contributed to the unsustainability of agricultural production\
    \ and\nhas threatened the health of Central Valley communities whose drinking\
    \ water relies on\ngroundwater resources.\n7.2. Science\nCrop N needs have been\
    \ investigated to provide growers with tools to determine\nproper fertilizer applications.\
    \ Numerous quantitative and complex decision-making tools\nhave been consistently\
    \ used to achieve improved nutrient management and irrigation.\nOnline spreadsheet\
    \ models and IDSS that process large amounts of information have been\nimplemented\
    \ by the University of California to help growers determine the appropriate\n\
    amounts of N fertilizers to apply (Table 3) [82]. Early season leaf sampling in\
    \ tree crops was\ndeveloped to estimate N status in tree tissues and make adjustments\
    \ in fertilizer timing\nand amount. Brown et al. [145] developed online spreadsheet\
    \ models for managing N\nin almonds and developed the four Rs of N management\
    \ (right rate, right time, right\nplace, right source). The right rate consists\
    \ of applying N in appropriate proportion to tree\ndemand. The right time is the\
    \ N application with the accurate timing with tree uptake,\nwhich starts at 70%\
    \ leaf out and stops soon after harvest. The right place encompasses\nvariable\
    \ rate irrigation and N application to address in-orchard soil and yield variability\n\
    as well as N application to the tree’s active root zone or foliage. The right\
    \ source refers\nto using the type of fertilizer that optimizes other nutrients\
    \ and suits the crop and the\nenvironment [146]. The Soil Nitrate Quick Test (SNQT),\
    \ developed for vegetables, provides\nan estimate of the soil mineral N status\
    \ capable of offsetting a fraction of the total N\nrequired by a crop. Hartz et\
    \ al. [147] developed N requirements for processing tomatoes in\nthe Central Valley.\
    \ Nitrogen application guidelines were later modelized to help growers\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n17 of 31\noptimize N application in processing tomato production\
    \ [148] and across several key\nCalifornia crops [149].\nTable 3. Principal decision\

    \ issues, the State Water Board has evaluated the\nexisting policies to determine\
    \ if existing water regulations are sufﬁcient and have improved\nthe wastewater\
    \ regulations to protect groundwater quality (www.cvsalinity.org (accessed\non\
    \ 20 August 2021)). The dischargers, such as growers, food processors, municipalities\n\
    and ranchers, have to comply with new regulations (e.g., Salt and Nitrate Management\n\
    Plan). Californian growers are under rising regulatory pressure to improve N use\
    \ efﬁciency\nin agricultural production to decrease nitrate leaching. Therefore,\
    \ they need the tools to\naccurately estimate crop N needs and availability to\
    \ conﬁdently adjust the N application\nrates. The federal and state agencies responsible\
    \ for protecting air and water quality have\nbeen assessing the causes, consequences\
    \ and costs of California’s agriculture-wide N use.\nThis concern explains the\
    \ various regulatory initiatives, such as the Central Valley Regional\nWater Quality\
    \ Control Board’s Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program, the Central Coast\nRegional\
    \ Water Quality Control Board’s renewal process for the Irrigated Agricultural\n\
    Lands Waiver, the Climate Action Reserve’s N Fertilizer Reduction Protocol and\
    \ the Central\nValley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s General Order for\
    \ Dairy Waste Dischargers\nand the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-term\
    \ Sustainability (CV-SALTS)\nprogram [150].\nCV-SALTS is a collaborative program\
    \ tasked to develop environmentally and eco-\nnomically sustainable management\
    \ plans for nitrates and salts in the Central Valley. The\nExecutive Committee\
    \ encompasses diverse stakeholder groups, such as agricultural groups,\ncities,\
    \ industry, regulatory agencies and community and environmental justice representa-\n\
    tives. The Salt and Nitrate Management Plan (SNMP) developed by CV-SALTS is built\
    \ on a\nrange of existing water quality management policies. It proposes additional\
    \ policies, mech-\nanisms and tools to provide the Central Valley Water Board\
    \ with the appropriate means for\naddressing the long-term loading of salt and\
    \ nitrates in the different regions of the Central\nValley. CV-SALTS is also tasked\
    \ with developing an all-inclusive regulatory program with\nadequate strategies\
    \ to address the management of salts and nitrates sustainably [151].\n7.4. Decision\
    \ Support for Irrigation and N Management\nNumerous IDSS for irrigation + N have\
    \ been developed by extension services, uni-\nversities and other institutions\
    \ involved in water management for states or regions [152].\nSome IDDS that help\
    \ manage N in CA include CropManage, Food, Agriculture, Resource\nManagement System\
    \ (FARMs) and the N Budget Calculator.\nCropManage can help growers and farm managers\
    \ determine watering and fertilizer\nN schedules on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis. All\
    \ the required components to determine crop water\nneeds, such as ETo and weather\
    \ data (from CIMIS), estimated Kc, as well as adequate\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on soil properties, are available without the need for in-ﬁeld\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n18 of 31\nsensors. CropManage is publicly available at: https://cropmanage.ucanr.edu/\
    \ (accessed\non 21 August 2021). The software automates all steps required to\
    \ calculate crop water\nrequirements, including N recommendations, based on soil\
    \ crop N uptake models, nitrate\nquick test values and credits for nitrate in\
    \ irrigation water and preceding crop residues.\nCropManage also helps growers\
    \ track irrigation and fertilizer schedules on multiple ﬁelds\nand allows data\
    \ sharing among users from the same farming operations. The web-based\napplication\
    \ record-keeping capability allows growers to review water and N applications\n\
    on each ﬁeld and maintain data required to comply with water quality regulations.\
    \ Crop-\nManage can be integrated with other web applications and data sources\
    \ to improve the\naccuracy of irrigation and fertilizer models [82].\nFARMs is\
    \ a user-friendly geospatial web-based application that simpliﬁes the use of\n\
    the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) model by automating\
    \ pro-\ncesses such as weather, climate and soil input. FARMs was developed using\
    \ DSSAT-CSM\nand open-source GIS software. FARMs allows adaptive management to\
    \ perform in-season\nyield predictions using both weather and climatic data to\
    \ evaluate the potential impacts of\nmanagement decisions on end-of-season yield.\
    \ FARMs uses NASA POWER weather data\nintegrated through an API [153]. FARMs simulates\
    \ nitrogen cycling of the cropping systems\nand quantiﬁes crop N stress based\
    \ on nitrogen uptake versus available nitrogen and is\nexpressed as a range between\
    \ 0 (no stress) to 1 (maximum stress). FARMs also simulates\nthe probability of\
    \ nitrate leaching from a given irrigation and N management strategy.\nThe N Calculator\
    \ is a predictive model that helps growers by advising on the timing\nand the\
    \ appropriate amount of N fertilizer to meet yield-based demand [145]. The N\n\
    Calculator has many functions, including calculating fertilization rates based\
    \ on the newest\nUC N management research, applying the four Rs of nutrient management\
    \ (right source,\nright rate, right timing and right location), enabling efﬁcient\
    \ fertilizer use, calculating N\nsupplies from non-fertilizer sources, such as\
    \ cover crops groundwater and compost, and\ncloning the N budget from one orchard\
    \ to another within and between years.\nFor example, using this tool for almonds\
    \ requires entering a yield estimate for pre-\nand post-bloom and adding early\
    \ season tissue-sampling results. The N Calculator helps\nto meet much of the\
    \ nutrients management required from the Irrigated Lands Regulatory\nProgram.\
    \ The Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program requires keeping an Irrigation and N\n\
    Management Plan (INMP) worksheet onsite and submitting a summary report to one’s\n\
    coalition in post-harvest time.\n8. IDSS for Salinity Management in California\n\
    8.1. General Considerations\nAbout 40% of global irrigated land is located in\
    \ arid/semi-arid zones, and this irriga-\ntion is often associated with salinization\
    \ [154]. With the development of intensive irrigation\npractices, the Central\
    \ Valley of California has become one of the world’s most productive\nfarming\
    \ regions. The continuously increasing levels of crop production are threatened\
    \ due\nto the deteriorating irrigation water quality. Clay layers impeding percolation\
    \ to deeper\ngroundwater regions have led to salt accumulation in drainage water\
    \ in many Central\nValley regions. One of the primary sources of salts is the\
    \ water supply imported from the\nSacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. About 250\
    \ tons of salt a day are imported into the\nSan Joaquin Valley through the state\
    \ and federal water project canals [155]. The soils of the\nCentral Valley’s western\
    \ regions are sedimentary and alluvial from the origin and formed\nin an uplifted\
    \ seabed. The native salts have mineralized and leached to the shallow water\n\
    tables over time due to irrigation and ﬂooding [156]. In the predominantly clay\
    \ and silty\nclay soil textures, as plants extract water from the soil and transpire,\
    \ the salt concentration\nlevel of the drainage water is likely to increase. As\
    \ a result, salts are likely to concentrate in\nthe root zone and accumulate in\
    \ shallow water tables through leaching [157]. Excessive salt\nconcentrations\
    \ affect a plant’s osmotic balance and trigger a reduction in plant water uptake\n\
    and stomata closing, which causes transpiration inhibition to occur [158]. The\
    \ increasing\nsoil salinity slowly and steadily contaminates water supplies and\
    \ reduces crop production.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n19 of 31\nVarious factors,\
    \ such as drought, climate change, water shortages and land-use changes,\ncould\
    \ exacerbate the salinity conditions.\nMore than 1.8 million hectares of irrigated\
    \ cropland in Central Valley (primarily in\nthe San Joaquin Valley) are affected\
    \ either through saline irrigation water or saline soils,\nand tens of thousands\
    \ of hectares of productive agricultural land are at risk (Figure 1) [159].\n\
    Salt accumulation has triggered more than 99957 hectares to be taken out of agricultural\n\
    production, and another 0.6 million hectares are considered damaged by salinity\
    \ [155].\nCurrent management activities address only 15% of the annual salt load\
    \ [150]. The direct\nannual costs from increasing salinity will range from USD\
    \ 1 billion to USD 1.5 billion, and\ntotal annual income impacts to the State\
    \ of California are predicted to range between USD\n1.7 billion and USD 3 billion\
    \ by 2030 [160]. The income reduction in the Central Valley\nwill range between\
    \ USD 1.2 billion and USD 2.2 billion [160]. In 2014, salinity reduced\nCalifornia’s\
    \ agricultural revenues by USD 3.7 billion, amounting to 8.0 million tons of crop\n\
    production lost [161].\n8.2. Science\nThe U.S. Salinity Laboratory (1954) classiﬁed\
    \ ﬁve cases of agricultural soil salinity: non-\nsaline (0–2 dS m−1), slightly\
    \ saline (2–4 dS m−1), moderately saline (4–8 dS m−1), strongly\nsaline (8–16\
    \ dS m−1) and extremely saline (>16 dS m−1) [162]. Although this salinity system\n\
    is the most commonly used, many other classiﬁcation systems of salt-affected soils\
    \ exist\nand are available in the literature [163]. The presence of salt in soil\
    \ water may affect plant\ngrowth either through salt-speciﬁc or osmotic effects.\
    \ The salt-speciﬁc or ion-excess effect\nof salinity occurs when excessive salt\
    \ amounts enter the crop, accumulate and damage the\ntranspiring leaves’ cells\
    \ and trigger plant growth reductions. The osmotic or water deﬁcit\neffect of\
    \ salinity occurs when salt in the soil solution decreases the plant’s water uptake\n\
    ability and leads to a decrease in the crop growth rate [164]. Salinity stress\
    \ affects all the\nmajor plant processes, such as germination, growth, water uptake\
    \ and yield [165].\nSalinity can be classiﬁed as natural or primary salinity and\
    \ second-hand salinity or\nhuman-induced salinity. Primary salinity comes from\
    \ salts accumulation over long periods\nof time via natural soil or groundwater\
    \ processes. Two natural processes contribute to\nprimary salinity. The ﬁrst is\
    \ the weathering process that breaks down rocks and releases\nvarious types of\
    \ soluble salts, including chlorides (of sodium, calcium and magnesium),\nsulfates\
    \ and carbonates. The passive results from oceanic salt that the wind carries\
    \ inland\nare deposited in the soil by rainfall. Passive salinity occurs due to\
    \ human activities, leading\nto the modiﬁcation of the soil’s hydrologic balance\
    \ [165].\n8.3. Policy\nThe increase in salts concentration in the California Central\
    \ Valley due to many factors,\nincluding intensive irrigation, has led to crises\
    \ and political decisions toward remediation.\nHigh concentrations of selenium\
    \ were found in ﬁsh in Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge,\nand vast numbers of\
    \ deformed and dead waterfowl were discovered at the refuge [166].\nIn 2006, the\
    \ Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s Salt and Boron Total\n\
    Maximum Daily Load for the San Joaquin River was approved, and a salinity control\
    \ plan\nentitled ‘Actions to Address the Salinity and Boron Total Maximum Daily\
    \ Load Issues\nfor the Lower San Joaquin River’ was adopted in response to the\
    \ Salinity and Boron\nTotal Maximum Daily Loads [156]. Solutions for addressing\
    \ salinity in the Central Valley\nwater require considering innovative salt management\
    \ strategies for both the short term\nand the long term to reach salt balance\
    \ and restoration of the impacted areas. In 2015,\nthe State Water Resources Control\
    \ Board adopted Resolution No. 2015–0010 to approve\nBasin Plan amendments and\
    \ to include the Salinity Variance Program, which applies to\nsurface water under\
    \ the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Salinity Variance Program follows\nwater quality\
    \ standards that include the following constituents: electrical conductivity,\n\
    total dissolved solids, chloride, sulfate and sodium [155]. Recognizing the challenges\
    \ of\nmanaging salinity in surface and ground waters, the Salt and Nitrate Management\
    \ Plan\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n20 of 31\n(SNMP) was implemented as part of the\
    \ Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term\nSustainability (CV-SALTS).\n\
    The long-term salinity management strategies recommended by the SNMP are divided\n\
    into three different phases, as described below.\n(i)\nPhase I focuses on developing\
    \ a prioritization and optimization study for salinity\nmanagement by using an\
    \ interim salinity approach.\n(ii)\nPhase II is related to environmental permits,\
    \ obtaining funding, engineering\nand design.\n(iii)\nPhase III consists of the\
    \ implementation of physical projects to manage salt in the\nlong term.\nThe interim\
    \ salinity permitting approach is recommended by the SNMP to be set\nin place\
    \ for 15 years. The interim salinity approach requires dischargers to participate\n\
    in the prioritization and optimization study. However, the dischargers opting\
    \ out of\nparticipating in the prioritization and optimization study would not\
    \ be eligible for obtaining\na variance under the Salinity Variance Program (https://www.cvsalinity.org\
    \ (accessed on\n29 August 2021)).\n8.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Salinity\n\
    Although there are not currently any California IDSS that also factor salinity\
    \ manage-\nment, there are several decision tools available to manage salinity\
    \ in California. One of\nthe water quality regulation tools used throughout the\
    \ U.S. is the EPA-supported Total\nMaximum Daily Load (TMDL). The TMDL is a controlling\
    \ tool for allocating responsibility\nfor contamination in impaired waterbodies\
    \ by assessing the assimilative capacity of the\nwaterbody for the contaminant,\
    \ determining the mass loading from non-point and point\nsources, which contribute\
    \ to the pollution, and developing downstream water quality\nstrategies reducing\
    \ the excess of the pollutants in the waterbody. The implementation of\nthe TMDL\
    \ tool in the Central Valley of California has led to the development of decision\n\
    support system tools, such as the Watershed Management Risk Management Framework\n\
    (WARMF) and the San Joaquin River Real-Time Management (SJRRTM).\nThe Watershed\
    \ Management Risk Management Framework (WARMF) model is a de-\ncision support\
    \ system designed to guide stakeholders towards a comprehensive watershed\nmanagement\
    \ plan. The tool helps speciﬁcally to facilitate TMDL implementation at the\n\
    watershed level. The embedded model uses a mass balance approach for an extensive\
    \ suite\nof potential San Joaquin River pollutants, such as total dissolved solids\
    \ (measured as EC),\nsuspended solids, phosphates and nitrates. Models are also\
    \ used to simulate agricultural\nand wetland drainage return ﬂows and estimate\
    \ the salts buildups from shallow ground-\nwater. Components such as simulation\
    \ models, graphical software and GIS software are\nincorporated into a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) to easily visualize the model ﬂow and\nsalinity information.\
    \ The WARMF model contains hydrologic routing that is capable of\ncalculating\
    \ ﬂow and water quality at roughly one-mile intervals [156,167].\nThe SJRRTM is\
    \ a web-based salinity DSS that combines WARMF and assimilative salt\ncapacity\
    \ forecasts information to increase stakeholder awareness of the unique opportuni-\n\
    ties and measures to improve water quality resource management in the San Joaquin\
    \ River\nBasin. The decision support system was implemented using OpenNRM, an\
    \ open-source\nsoftware that systematically allows users to perform tasks such\
    \ as creating, modifying and\nmanaging data and web content. One of the speciﬁc\
    \ features of the SJRTM web portal has\nbeen the integration of WARMF model-generated\
    \ ﬂow with real-time SJR tributary ﬂow\nand EC data with salt load assimilative\
    \ capacity predictions [156].\nIn addition to decision support systems, various\
    \ models are widely used for salinity\nmanagement studies in the Central Valley.\
    \ Models such as Westside Agricultural Drainage\nEconomics (WADE) [168] and the\
    \ Agricultural Production Salinity Irrigation Drainage\nEconomics (APSIDE) [169]\
    \ are examples of policy models used in the Central Valley. The\nAPSIDE model\
    \ has the speciﬁcity of simulating the agricultural production and projected\n\
    income in response to irrigation water quality and drainage policy constraints\
    \ [169].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n21 of 31\n9. IDSS for Irrigation System Management\n\
    Under increasing water deﬁcit or drought conditions, distribution uniformity plays\
    \ a\ncritical factor in managing the available water efﬁciently while simultaneously\
    \ improving\nand maintaining the yield and quality of specialty crops [170,171].\
    \ Distribution uniformity\ncan be deﬁned as the even distribution or spread of\
    \ applied irrigation to avoid over- or\nunder-watering at speciﬁc locations across\
    \ the ﬁeld. Non-uniform distribution can not only\nreduce the yield, but it affects\
    \ the drainage, increases soil erosion risk through runoff, in-\ncreases nitrate\
    \ leaching and reduces the available nitrate content in the soil [172,173]. Under\n\
    California’s arid conditions, a reduced use of water and energy in the agricultural\
    \ sector is\nlargely dependent on efﬁcient DU. Although it is impossible to attain\
    \ 100% distribution\nuniformity, the goal is to maximize the uniform and efﬁcient\
    \ distribution of the applied\nirrigation water.\nApplication use efﬁciency is\
    \ the ratio of the amount of water lost through evapotran-\nspiration to the amount\
    \ of water applied for crop production [174]. The joint initiative of\nthe California\
    \ Department of Food and Agriculture and Department of Water Resources\nhas a\
    \ goal of decreasing 1200–1220 ML of agricultural water use per year through on-farm\n\
    efﬁciency improvements. The majority of California’s crops are now cultivated\
    \ using micro-\nirrigation systems, such as sprinkler, drip and subsurface drip\
    \ irrigation. The distribution\nuniformity for drip and subsurface drip irrigation\
    \ systems is determined by taking the\nratio of average ﬂow of the lowest quarter\
    \ of emitters to all emitters sampled [130,175].\nDecision support tools offer\
    \ the potential for site-speciﬁc irrigation management,\nwhich optimizes distribution\
    \ uniformity by delineating the ﬁelds into management\nzones [176,177]. The UCANR’s\
    \ Bilingual Emission Uniformity Calculator uses a bilin-\ngual (English and Spanish)\
    \ interface with an Excel spreadsheet model to help growers\ncalculate distribution\
    \ uniformity based on emitter discharge measurements [178]. Using\nwireless sensor\
    \ networks (soil and crop canopy-based), irrigation automation and telemet-\n\
    ric control through mobile or cloud-based applications allows the growers to efﬁciently\n\
    increase the distribution uniformity based on real-time data. Growers can use\
    \ automation\nequipment to avoid over- or under-watering with remote access [179,180].\
    \ In California,\nmany nut growers in the state are using an alternative method\
    \ of determining transpira-\ntion uniformity rather than using distribution uniformity\
    \ [181]. Transpiration uniformity\ndescribes the uniform loss of water from the\
    \ ﬁeld, in contrast to DU, which deﬁnes the\nspread across the ﬁeld. Because transpiration\
    \ is an indicator of plant metabolism, it can\nalso be affected by nutrients,\
    \ pests or soil heterogeneity, which would not be related to the\nuniformity of\
    \ an application. Remote-sensing IDSS are useful in evaluating the distribution\n\
    uniformity based on thermal and NDVI maps generated using multispectral imagery.\

    \ IDSS Evaluation and Ongoing Work in California\nIn this rapidly growing ﬁeld\
    \ of products and services, detailed information on the\nutility, user friendliness,\
    \ reliability, accuracy and precision of IDSS is of primary importance\nto the\
    \ end user. The purpose of the Hub project is to evaluate the irrigation decision\

    \ user friendliness and inputs from advisory groups.\nUser-friendly decision support\
    \ tools are important for maximizing beneﬁts by enhanc-\ning productivity and\
    \ simplifying the spatiotemporal environmental parameters [182,183].\nFor IDSS,\
    \ innovation, validation and adoption are cyclical, iterative processes engaged\n\
    in by the agricultural technology industry, applied or Cooperative Extension researchers\n\
    and growers (Figure 4). In the cyclical process of innovation–validation–adoption,\
    \ it is\nhelpful to form a project advisory group to achieve a more practical,\
    \ secure and cohesive\napproach [179]. This user feedback is pivotal for implementing\
    \ and improving new IDSS\ntechnologies [184]. The primary focus of the advisory\
    \ group members is to assist in shaping\nthe process of research that can simplify\
    \ the later steps for adoption [185,186].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n23 of 31\n\

    Ideally, IDSS should be assessed for data accuracy, linearity, precision, response\
    \ time\nand reliability [187,188]. This can be carried out using research-grade\
    \ equipment with eddy\ncovariance and neutron probe measurements of key water\
    \ budget components, as well\nas estimates of leaf area index, to better understand\
    \ and predict the Kc values. Different\ncomplexity may be required for different\
    \ end users (i.e., farm manager versus irrigators).\nThe system’s user friendliness\
    \ can be assessed by user interview or survey that generally\nfocuses on: (a)\
    \ graphic interface features, (b) graphic interface ease of use, (c) ﬁeld placement\n\
    decision support, (d) comprehensiveness, (e) update frequency, (f) reliability,\
    \ (g) system\nvalue and (h) unanticipated costs [189,190]. In addition, the performance\
    \ evaluation\nof IDSS is important based on soil and crop type. Performance evaluation\
    \ should be\nbased on statistical analysis and comparison based on root mean square\

    \ systems (IDSS) may greatly beneﬁt the >400 crops grown\nthroughout the State\
    \ of California to support diverse challenges, including drought, en-\nergy, nitrogen\
    \ and salinity management. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of\nexisting\
    \ IDSS available to California growers, their underlying science, incentive policies\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n24 of 31\nand anticipated outcomes. Effective energy,\
    \ water, nitrogen and salinity management in\nCalifornia under regulatory policies,\
    \ such as the Sustainable Groundwater Management\nAct, require the integration\
    \ of different strategies to improve precision irrigation schedul-\ning, uniform\
    \ water and nutrient application, and the soil–plant–water monitoring. In\naddition\
    \ to water management, these policies also aim to manage groundwater and require\n\
    the record keeping of water use, nitrogen (N) leaching, salinity management and\
    \ energy\nconsumption. Most of the irrigation decision support tools used in California\
    \ are based on\nfewer components of the water budget, and none of the available\
    \ IDSS provide estimation\nof all parameters together. For example, soil-based\
    \ IDSS consider soil water potential or\nvolumetric water content, while crop\
    \ canopy IDSS are based on crop evapotranspiration.\nThese IDSS can potentially\
    \ be used in combination to obtain the overall inﬂow and outﬂow\nof water to and\
    \ from the soil–plant–atmospheric continuum of the crops. However, het-\nerogeneity\
    \ in agronomic and ﬁeld soils can lead to poor management practices at certain\n\
    locations in agricultural ﬁelds. Remote sensing IDSS are useful in determining\
    \ the spatial\nscale information based on spectral data, but the interpretation\
    \ of multispectral/thermal\nimagery is complicated and difﬁcult for growers to\
    \ base decisions for water, nutrient and\nsalinity hotspots. In a nutshell, there\
    \ has been an identiﬁable need for the co-management\nof irrigation decision support,\
    \ nitrogen and salinity management and energy efﬁciency.\nThe integration of IDSS\
    \ for nexus beneﬁts is a cyclical process of innovation by service\nproviders/researchers,\
    \ validation by extension research professionals and adoption by\ngrowers. Therefore,\
    \ for a widescale adoption of these tools, the synergetic evaluation of\npoint-based\
    \ and spatial IDSS needs to be studied and validated on different scales (farm\n\
    to county). Not only is the information presentation and availability important;\
    \ the inte-\ngration within the farm management hierarchy is equally signiﬁcant.\
    \ The recommended\ninformation on water, nitrogen, salts and energy management\
    \ must be clearly and simply\ntransmitted to and from farm managers to individual\
    \ irrigators.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.J., R.S. and M.A.N.;\

    \ 2023 \n© The Author(s) 2023\nAbstract\nProper and reasonable estimation of actual\
    \ evapotranspiration is critical for the design, operation, and management of\
    \ irri-\ngation systems. However, the density of climatic stations is low in many\
    \ parts of Ethiopia to estimate spatially reasonable \nreference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo), and the lack of spatial variability of crop coefficient (Kc) is clear\
    \ barrier to the proper \nmanagement of irrigation water. Therefore, the main\
    \ objective of this study was to estimate reasonable crop evapotranspira-\ntion\
    \ (ETc) by deriving spatially and temporally varying crop coefficients using remote\
    \ sensing products in 10 wheat plots \nat the Koga irrigation scheme. The moderate-resolution\
    \ imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) potential evapotranspiration \nwas calibrated\
    \ at two class-I climate stations (Bahir Dar and Dangila) based on Penman–Monteith\
    \ estimates and Normal-\nized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was derived from\
    \ Sentinel 2B, which was later used to derive Kc. The correlation \nbetween reference\
    \ evapotranspiration from MODIS Penman Monteith was acceptable for both Dangila\
    \ (R2 = 0.64) and \nBahir Dar (R2 = 0.74) stations. The MODIS calibration constant\
    \ for Koga irrigation schemes was 0.27 and 1.99 (regression \nslope and constant)\
    \ on an 8-day basis. Similarly, a strong correlation (R2 = 0.95) was found between\
    \ Sentinel-based NDVI \nand FAO crop coefficient, which indicated an alternative\
    \ pathway for estimating crop coefficient. The value of Kc varies in \nspace (across\
    \ the 10 plots) from 0.16 to 0.42 at the initial stage and from 1.20 to 1.32 at\
    \ the mid-stage. Similarly, the mean \nvalue of Kc varies in time from 0.29 at\
    \ the initial stage to 1.26 at the mid-stage. On the other hand, evaluation of\
    \ MODIS and \nWaPOR ETc found a significant difference (p < 0.05) with the calibrated\
    \ MODIS-Sentinel 2B derived ETc. This indicated \nthe need to calibrate both MODIS\
    \ and WaPOR for the proper estimation of crop water needs. Underestimation of\
    \ ET was \nobserved from MODIS, and the reverse is true for WaPOR. Our findings\
    \ showed that calibrating and integrating MODIS \nwith Sentinel 2B would be a\
    \ feasible approach to estimate Kc and hence ETc that varies in time and space.\
    \ This would assist \nwater managers in estimating crop water needs for better\
    \ productivity in the region.\nKeywords MODIS · WaPOR · Sentinel · NDVI · Crop\

    \ resources is increasing \nnowadays, especially in the agricultural sector (Leguen\
    \ \n2019). The increasing population in the world leads to the \nintensification\
    \ of irrigation for increased food production \nresulting in additional pressure\
    \ on freshwater resources \n(Kumar et al. 2017). The current trend in irrigation\
    \ intensi-\nfication is unsustainable (Sappington and Rifai 2018). Sus-\ntainable\
    \ intensification of irrigated agriculture and proper \nestimation of crop water\
    \ need is essential to efficiently utilize \nwater resources (Ewaid et al. 2019).\

    et al. 2014). Evapotranspiration estimation is essential for \nvarious applications\
    \ including the assessment of irrigation \nfeasibility in arid and semi-arid regions\
    \ (Allen et al. 2007), \ndrought monitoring (Djaman et al. 2018), and conservation\
    \ \nof irrigation water through proper irrigation scheduling \n(Subedi and Chávez\
    \ 2015; Koech and Langat 2018). The \nspatial and temporal values of evapotranspiration\
    \ estimates \nwould help to determine crop water use which is vital for \nimproving\
    \ the performance of irrigation schemes (Kharrou \net al. 2021).\nSeveral studies\
    \ were conducted on the performance of \nirrigation schemes in Ethiopian highlands\
    \ and found insuf-\nficient to address the designed command area (Asres 2016;\
    \ \nAbera et al. 2019; Haile et al. 2020; Tesfaye 2020). Koga, \nthe major irrigation\
    \ scheme in the Ethiopian highlands, was \ndesigned to irrigate a maximum command\
    \ area of 7000 ha \n(MacDonald 2004). However, the scheme was so far able to \n\
    irrigate a maximum size of about 5000 ha in 2014 (Abiyu \nand Alamirew 2015).\
    \ Tewabe and Dessie (2020) reported \nthat the irrigation ratio of the scheme\
    \ was around 76.6% \nin the 2016 and 2017 irrigation seasons. The main reasons\
    \ \nwere poor irrigation water management at the field level, \ninsufficient reservoir\
    \ release to the command area, and tra-\nditional water application techniques\
    \ resulting in high water \nloss throughout the scheme. This demands a proper\
    \ estima-\ntion of crop evapotranspiration in the scheme and hence irri-\ngation\
    \ scheduling (Kassie and Alemu 2021), which would \nhelp to improve the performance\
    \ of the Koga irrigation \nscheme and productivity in general.\nSeveral approaches\
    \ can be used to measure and/or \nestimate actual evapotranspiration (ETc) including\
    \ eddy \ncovariance, soil water balance approach, Bowen Ration \nEnergy Balance\
    \ System, pan evaporation, and weighting \nlysimeters. However, these methods\
    \ are expensive, time-\nconsuming, cannot be easily automated, and provides \n\
    point-based measurements (Genanu 2017; Bastiaanssen \net al. 1998; Zhao et al.\
    \ 2013, 2006; Enku et al. 2011). \nTo overcome such challenges, remote sensing\
    \ approaches \nare practiced worldwide as efficient alternatives (Reyes-\nGonzalez\
    \ et al. 2015). This includes Surface Energy Bal-\nance Algorithm for Land, SEBAL,\
    \ (Bastiaanssen et al. \n1998), Two Source Energy Balance, TSEB, (Norman et al.\
    \ \n1995), Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index, S-SEBI, \n(Roerink et al.\

    \ Internalized Calibration, METRIC, \n(Allen et al. 2007), and the Simplified\
    \ Surface Energy \nBalance, SSEB, (Chen et al. 2016). These models require \n\
    detailed standard metrological data (Kitsara et al. 2013; \nNajmaddin et al. 2017;\
    \ Allam et al. 2021), which can be \ntricky in region where climate stations are\
    \ scarce (Najmad-\ndin et al. 2017). One of the most commonly used methods \n\
    for ETc estimation is the crop coefficient approach which \nis the product of\
    \ reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and \ncrop coefficient (Kc) (Yimam et al.\
    \ 2020, 2021, 2021).\nSeveral have developed equations to quantify reference \n\
    evapotranspiration from the basic fundamental physical \nprinciples of energy\
    \ balance and mass transfer (Maeda \net al. 2011). The Penman–Monteith method\
    \ is among the \nstandard approach for determining ETo, though it requires \n\
    detailed meteorological data inputs (Zhang et al. 2018). \nRemote sensing approaches\
    \ are nowadays becoming popu-\nlar in estimating evapotranspiration (ET) at various\
    \ temporal \nand spatial scales (Kharrou et al. 2021; Maeda et al. 2011) \nwhich\
    \ is a feasible solution from various perspectives for \nin-situ estimation (Wanniarachchi\
    \ and Sarukkalige 2022). \nRemote sensing-based estimation of ET helps water manag-\n\
    ers in the irrigation sector to manage both water and crop \nstress conditions\
    \ (Genanu et al. 2017). Of the various remote \nsensing indices used to estimate\
    \ ETc, The Normalized Dif-\nference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly\
    \ \nused indices used to estimate ETc (Carpintero et al. 2020; \nPôças et al.\
    \ 2020). In the crop coefficient approach, Kc is \ntypically taken from the Food\
    \ and Agricultural Organiza-\ntion, FAO (Singh and Irmak 2009), which does not\
    \ capture \nthe spatial and temporal variability in estimating the crop \nevapotranspiration.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of \nKc can be easily derived from NDVI\
    \ considering actual crop \ngrowth conditions and stages (Reyes-González et al.\
    \ 2018). \nSimilarly, open-access remote sensing datasets would help \nin accessing\
    \ reference evapotranspiration products at vary-\ning spatial and temporal resolutions\
    \ during the estimation \nof crop evapotranspiration. The moderate-resolution\
    \ imag-\ning spectroradiometer (MODIS) evapotranspiration product \n(Mu et al.\
    \ 2011) and the FAO portal product to monitor \nwater productivity through open-access\
    \ portal (WaPOR) \ndeveloped for Africa and the Near East (Blatchford et al. \n\
    2020) are among the open sources to estimate ET. How-\never, the applications\
    \ of those open-source remote-sensing \nproducts to estimate ET and help in irrigation\
    \ scheduling \nare an unexploited approach in the region that needs refined \n\
    studies.\nRecently, Sentinel and Landsat satellites are among the \nopen-source\
    \ remote sensing products used for site-specific \nmanagement of irrigation. Even\
    \ though the sentinel -2 sat-\nellite was launched recently 7 years ago, it has\
    \ an advan-\ntage over the Landsat satellite in terms of better spatial and \n\
    temporal resolution. According to Morave et al., (2021), \natmospheric correction\
    \ is essential to increase the NDVI \nvalues.\nTherefore, the main objective of\
    \ this research was to esti-\nmate crop evapotranspiration using the combined\
    \ applica-\ntion of open-access remote sensing ETo and NDVI-derived \nKc which\
    \ was generated from atmospherically calibrated \nSentinel-2 images for the major\
    \ irrigated crop in the Koga \nirrigation scheme (wheat).\nWe also did a comparison\
    \ of remote sensing-based ET for \ntheir applications in irrigated water management\
    \ in the same \nirrigation scheme. In Ethiopia, wheat grain is the flour for \n\
    the preparation of traditional as well as modern processed \nfood products and\
    \ industrially processed products (Aklilu \net al. 2015). Wheat in Ethiopia is\
    \ a significant stable and \ncash crop in increasing the income of the households,\
    \ food \nsecurity, and national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) incre-\nment (Anteneh\
    \ and Asrat 2020). At present, the Ethiopian \ngovernment has started planning\

    \ in Koga's large-scale irriga-\ntion scheme located in the west Gojam Zone of\
    \ Amhara \nRegional State in the Ethiopian highland (11.35 °N latitude \nand 37.14 °E\
    \ longitude, at an altitude of 1900 m above sea \nlevel) (Fig. 1). Its catchment\
    \ area is about 220  km2 including \na reservoir area of 17  km2 with an impounding\
    \ capacity of \n83.1 million cubic meters (MCM). The scheme is planned to \nirrigate\
    \ a maximum area of 7000 ha for 10,000 smallholder \nhouseholds (Asres 2016).\
    \ The irrigation scheme networks \ninclude 19.7 km of primary canals, 42.3 km\
    \ of secondary \ncanals, 117 km of tertiary canals, 783 km of quaternary \ncanals,\
    \ and a 12-night storage structure. Agriculture in \nKoga includes rain-fed in\
    \ rainy periods and irrigation in dry \nmonsoon phases where maize and wheat are,\
    \ respectively, \nthe most common cereal crops. Irrigated wheat covers about \n\
    70% of irrigated command area annually while potato and \nonion are the second\
    \ and third major irrigated crops in the \nKoga irrigation scheme.\nData sources\
    \ and description\nThis research was conducted using open-source remote \nsensing\
    \ products and meteorological data (Table 1). Sen-\ntinel images with 10 m spatial\
    \ resolution were obtained \nevery 10 days to develop the NDVI map. Similarly,\
    \ MODIS \npotential evapotranspiration (PET) products were obtained \nto estimate\
    \ reference evapotranspiration. Also, actual \nevapotranspiration was taken from\
    \ the MODIS sensor and \nWaPOR database to extract wheat crop evapotranspiration.\
    \ \nThe MODIS and WaPOR actual evapotranspiration (ETa) \nwas obtained from late\
    \ December 2020 to mid of April \n2021. A total of 12 ETa image products were\
    \ downloaded \nfrom each website considering the same temporal resolu-\ntion as\
    \ Sentinel-2B images. The level-3 dataset of WaPOR \nactual evapotranspiration\
    \ for the Koga irrigation scheme \nwas obtained at 30 m spatial resolution every\
    \ 10 days. In \nWaPOR, the pixel value represents the average daily ETa \nin a\
    \ given 10 days (FAO 2019). Meteorological data (pre-\ncipitation, mm; relative\
    \ humidity, %; sunshine hour, hr; and \nwind speed, m/sec) were collected from\
    \ two meteorological \nFig. 2  An overall framework of this study\nApplied Water\

    \ crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was estimated for the \nKoga irrigation scheme\
    \ by combining open-source remote \nsensing products and meteorological data (Fig. 2).\
    \ The daily \nmeteorological data were collected from nearby stations of \nDangila\
    \ and Bahir Dar from the year 2016 to 2021. The Pen-\nman–Monteith method (Eq. 1)\
    \ was used to estimate ETo at \nthe stations and the result was compared with\
    \ the MODIS \nPET product. Then, crop evapotranspiration for the Koga \nirrigation\
    \ scheme was computed by multiplying the refer-\nence evapotranspiration from\
    \ MODIS with the crop coef-\nficient in the Geographic Information System, GIS,\
    \ and spa-\ntial analysis. The crop coefficient was derived by developing \na\
    \ regression equation between the NDVI-derived Kc from \nsentinel 2B and FAO Kc\
    \ for the wheat crop. Reconnaissance \nsurveys were conducted to identify wheat\
    \ field plots along \nthe command area during the first stage of sawing. A total\
    \ \nof ten wheat field plots were selected from the entire Koga \nirrigation scheme.\
    \ Depending on the size and shape of each \nfield, point coordinates were taken\
    \ at representative points \nper plot. Atmospherically corrected sentinel-2B Level-1C\
    \ \nimages were used to generate the NDVI value over the Koga \nirrigation scheme.\
    \ In addition, a correlation analysis was \nperformed between MODIS-based crop\
    \ evapotranspiration \nwith WaPOR and MODIS crop evapotranspiration products \n\
    to validate uses for the metrological data-scarce region.\nwhere ETo is reference\

    1 3\n168 \nPage 6 of 15\nThe remote sensing potential evapotranspiration product\
    \ was \ncalibrated using the Penman–Monteith reference evapotran-\nspiration estimates.\
    \ The MODIS potential evapotranspiration \nimage products were extracted by points\
    \ to the exact mete-\norological stations (i.e., Dangila and Bair Dar). A regression\
    \ \nequation was developed between the Penman–Monteith evapo-\ntranspiration and\
    \ MODIS potential evapotranspiration for each \nmeteorological station. Based\
    \ on the goodness of fit, a recom-\nmendation was made to use a remote sensing\
    \ tool for evapo-\ntranspiration estimation, particularly in data-scarce regions.\
    \ \nFinally, MODIS PET products were calibrated according \nto Maeda et al. (Maeda\
    \ et al. 2011) using Eq. (3) and then \nused reference evapotranspiration for\
    \ the estimation of crop \nevapotranspiration.\nwhere  EToc and  ETm are calibrated\
    \ reference evapotran-\nspiration and 8-day MODIS potential evapotranspiration,\

    \ evapotranspiration and \nevapotranspiration from the meteorological station\

    undergo various corrections (i.e., atmospheric, geometric, \nand radiometric)\
    \ to minimize distortion and enhance quality \ndata (Young et al. 2017). The Sentinel-2\
    \ Level-1C products \nhad geometrically registered and radio-metrically calibrated\
    \ \n(Phiri et al. 2020), and thus only atmospheric correction was \ndone. The\
    \ atmospheric correction for the bottom of atmos-\nphere reflectance for Sentinel-2\
    \ images was obtained from \nthe European space agency (ESA) Sentinel Application\
    \ Plat-\nform (SNAP). The surface reflectance values were obtained \nfor red and\

    \ map was computed using Eq. (2). Then, \nthe NDVI map was extracted by polygon\
    \ for sampled wheat \nfield plots at each growth stage to identify the wheat crop.\
    \ \nThe relationship between derived NDVI values and Kc val-\nues gained from\
    \ the FAO was created. Then linear regression \nequation was developed between\
    \ the FAO crop coefficient \nand NDVI values of the wheat crop at the field obtained\
    \ \nfor each growing stage. Using that linear regression model \nNDVI-based Kc\
    \ was estimated and compared with FAO Kc. \nThe performance of the linear regression\
    \ model developed \nbetween FAO Kc and NDVI was checked by statistical index \n\
    using correlation coefficient, R2 (Campos et al. 2010; Gontia \nand Tiwari 2010),\
    \ Mean Square Error, MSE (El-Shirbeny \nand Ali 2014); Root Mean Square Error,\
    \ RMSE (Er-Raki \net al. 2013); and Mean Absolute Error, MAE (Adamala et al. \n\
    2013). The crop coefficient map was prepared by converting \nthe NDVI map using\
    \ the developed regression equation in \nmap algebra. The length of the four growth\
    \ stages of wheat \nadopted were 15, 25, 50, and 30 days for initial, develop-\n\
    mental, mid, and late-stage, respectively. The corresponding \ncrop coefficient\
    \ values taken were 0.3, 1.15, and 0.325 for \nthe initial, mid, and late-stage,\
    \ respectively (1998).\nwhere NIR and RED are near-infrared (Band 8) and red band\
    \ \n(Band 4) of the sentinel image, respectively.\nComputation of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ \nand comparisons with remotely sensed ETc\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) was\
    \ computed and mapped \nas a product of the NDVI-derived crop coefficient and\
    \ cali-\nbrated ETo from 8-day MODIS PET. The 8-day calibrated \nMODIS reference\
    \ evapotranspiration map was resampled to \n10 by 10 spatial resolution to fit\
    \ with the Kc map. The crop \nevapotranspiration map was extracted by field plot\
    \ polygon \nto determine wheat water requirement for each growing sea-\nson. A\
    \ correlation analysis was done between crop evapo-\ntranspiration obtained from\
    \ the Penman–Monteith method \nand MODIS for validation. Similarly, the WaPOR\
    \ crop \nevapotranspiration and MODIS ETc product were obtained \nat 30 m and\
    \ 500 m resolution, respectively, and resampled \nto 10 m spatial resolution.\
    \ The MODIS and WaPOR crop \nevapotranspiration product was compared with the\

    The reflectivity difference (Fig. 3) between the true color of \nthe top of the\
    \ atmosphere and the bottom of the atmosphere \nradiance presents the big difference\
    \ between atmospheri-\ncally calibrated and uncorrected images. To determine the\
    \ \neffects of atmospheric correction on the raw data, changes in \nSentinel 2B\
    \ red and NIR bands for NDVI calculation were \nexamined. The visual comparison\
    \ of Fig. 1A and B showed \nthat atmospheric correction is essential for Sentinel-2B\
    \ \nimage quality enhancement. David Morave et al., (Moravec \net al. 2021) revealed\
    \ that atmospheric correction is used to \nincrease the NDVI values and reported\
    \ an increased NDVI \nvalue of 0.497 from an atmospherically corrected image than\
    \ \nan uncorrected image (0.421).\nEvaluation of MODIS reference evapotranspiration\n\
    The MODIS potential evapotranspiration values were \nevaluated with the Penman–Monteith\
    \ reference evapotran-\nspiration estimated for Bahir Dar and Dangila climatic\
    \ \nstations. The root means square error and means absolute \nerror between remote\
    \ sensing evapotranspiration prod-\nuct and the Penman–Monteith method for both\
    \ climatic \nstations were within the acceptable limit, 0.2 to 0.5, based \non\
    \ Yu et al., (2016) data on an 8-day basis (Table 2 and \nFig. 4). Similarly,\
    \ the coefficient of determination (R2) \nshowed a good correlation, more than\
    \ 50%, based on Tay-\nlor (1990) for both stations. The result would help to esti-\n\
    mate the temporal and spatial variation of evapotranspira-\ntion at a regional\
    \ and local scale in areas where climate \nstations are scarce or unavailable.\n\
    The calibration parameters in Table 2 were obtained \nfrom the regression equations\
    \ of each of the trend lines in \nFig. 4. The average of the 8-day regression\
    \ constants (i.e., \n0.27 for a and 1.99 for b) was taken to map the calibrated\
    \ \nMODIS reference evapotranspiration for further estimation \nof crop evapotranspiration\
    \ in the Koga irrigation scheme. \nThe monthly time series of the calibrated reference\
    \ evapo-\ntranspiration (Fig. 5) showed an increasing trend in the dry \nperiod\
    \ and reached a maximum in April for both stations \nwith 4.7 mm and 4.5 mm for\
    \ Bahir Dar and Dangila, respec-\ntively. Whereas, the minimum value was around\
    \ 2.6 mm for \nboth stations and occurs in July. This is because the region \n\
    experiences an annual maximum temperature in April result-\ning in the high value\
    \ of ET. The reverse is true in July, the \nair temperature is low resulting in\
    \ a reduced ET rate. The \nranges of evapotranspiration for Bahir Dar and Dangila\
    \ were \n2.6 mm to 4.7 mm, and 2.6 mm to 4.5 mm, respectively. The \nmean daily\
    \ reference evapotranspiration for Bahir Dar and \nDangila, respectively, were\
    \ found 3.9 and 3.6 mm. Mengistu \nand Amente (2020) found 3.67 mm and 3.59 mm\
    \ of mean \ndaily reference evapotranspiration for Bahir Dar and Dangila \nstations,\
    \ respectively, which supports our findings.\nDeriving NDVI for the various growth\
    \ stages \nof wheat\nThe NDVI values for ten wheat field plots along the crop\
    \ growth \nstage are presented in Fig. 6. At the initial stage, the value of \n\
    NDVI is low because the ground cover is small at this stage. \nMore precisely,\
    \ at the initial stage, the reflectance values of the \nnear-infrared (NIR) wave\
    \ band are low, whereas the red wave \nband has high reflectance at the initial\
    \ stage (Panda et al. 2010). \nIn addition, the red wave band is strongly absorbed\
    \ by chlorophyll \nwhereas the NIR wave band is highly reflected from the meso-\n\
    phyll structure of the crop leaves. According to Yin et al. (2012) \nthe high\
    \ values of NDVI are related to dense vegetation with high \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n\

    \ Yang 2014; El-shirbeny et al. 2014). The \nspatial and temporal variability\
    \ of the NDVI in the study area is \npresented in Fig. 10.\nDeriving crop coefficient\
    \ for the various growth \nstages of wheat\nThe correlation between the average\
    \ NDVI and FAO crop \ncoefficient of wheat along the crop growth stage was found\
    \ \nstrong, R2 = 0.95, (Fig. 7). This depicted crop coefficient \ncould be determined\
    \ from remote sensing indices (NDVI). \nThe regression equation was used to develop\
    \ a crop coef-\nficient, and the resulting crop coefficient for the wheat crop\
    \ \nis presented in Table 4. The average crop coefficient was \nfound about 0.83\
    \ for the crop base period. The minimum \ncrop coefficient was found 0.16 during\
    \ the initial period (on \nthe 8th day after plantation) and the maximum value\
    \ was \n1.32 at mid-stage (on the 78th day after plantation). In the \nearly stage,\
    \ the plant height and surface area of crop leaves \nare small resulting in a\
    \ lower Kc value and the reverse is \ntrue as the cop grows. As the crop maturity\
    \ increases, the \ngreenness of the crop reduced which resulted in a reduc-\n\
    tion in crop coefficient. Several research findings reported \na closer estimate\
    \ of the crop coefficient for the wheat crop \nfrom NDVI (Gontia and Tiwari 2010;\
    \ Er-Raki et al. 2013; \nAdamala et al. 2013; El-shirbeny et al. 2014). The spatial\

    \ and Drainage Paper-56 for the wheat \ncrop, while calibrated Kc values were\

    \ at the end of the grow-\ning season (DAP 88–118) the calibrated Kc values were\
    \ \nlower than FAO-Kc values. The crop coefficient values esti-\nmated from NDVI\
    \ have high temporal variation reflecting \nthe reality as compared to the FAO-Kc\
    \ values which are \nconstructed from points and lead to constant irrigation appli-\n\
    cation, particularly at the mid-stage. The crop coefficient \ncannot be constant\
    \ throughout the mid-stage (DAP 88–118). \nIn fact, the cop coefficient varies\
    \ continuously throughout \nthe growing period (Reyes-González et al. 2018). Compar-\n\
    ing the overall average Kc based on DAP in Table 5, the \nFAO Kc was 0.86 whereas\
    \ the NDVI-derived Kc was 0.83. \nThe NDVI-based Kc could be used by water managers\
    \ in the \nKoga irrigation scheme for proper water release considering \nthe various\
    \ wheat growth stages and, hence, improve water \nand crop productivity.\nCrop\
    \ evapotranspiration\nThe 8-day MODIS PET and derived Kc values from Sen-\ntinel\
    \ 2B were used to generate the crop evapotranspira-\ntion (ETc) in the study area\
    \ with 10 m spatial resolution \n(Fig.  12). The minimum crop evapotranspiration\
    \ was \n0.59 mm/day during the initial period, while the maximum \ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ was 5.66 mm/day during the mid-\nstage (Table 5). The average crop evapotranspiration\
    \ of \nwheat for the crop base period was found to be 3.2 mm/\nday. This indicated\
    \ that a small amount of irrigation water \nwas needed at the initial and late\
    \ stages, whereas, the high-\nest crop water need was observed at the mid-stage.\
    \ Crop \nevapotranspiration at middle stage of the crop was larger \nthan other\
    \ growing stages, which agreed with (Reyes-Gon-\nzalez et al. 2015; Gontia and\
    \ Tiwari 2010; Er-Raki et al. \n2013; Farg et al. 2012; Adamala et al. 2016).\
    \ This study \nargued that the estimation of crop evapotranspiration using \n\
    remotely sensed data is very important for designers to better \nunderstand the\
    \ amount of irrigation for various crop growth \nstages and for better irrigation\
    \ scheduling. In Fig. 12, the \nyellow color represents lower ETc values, whereas\
    \ the dark \nblue color presents high crop evapotranspiration values of \nthe\
    \ wheat crop. Similarly, Vegetation index-based ETc at \nfield scale for the wheat\
    \ crop was reported by El-shirbeny \net al., (2014); Farg et al., (2012); Hunsaker\
    \ et al., (2005); \nLei and Yang (2014), and reported that the ETc values at \n\
    different crop growth stages are different, where the higher \nET rate was found\
    \ at mid-stage and lowest ET rates at an \nearly stage. In general, vegetation\
    \ index-based estimation \nof ETc, produced satisfactory results in comparison\
    \ with \nFig. 10  Spatial and temporal NDVI map of Koga irrigation scheme from\
    \ December to April 2021\nApplied Water Science (2023) 13:168 \n1 3\nPage 11 of\
    \ 15 \n168\nthe Penman–Monteith approach. The findings would help \nto improve\
    \ water use efficiency through the use of proper \nirrigation scheduling. In addition,\
    \ the study would help to \nsupport policy decisions for land use allocation based\
    \ on \nagro-climatic conditions.\nComparison between MODIS‑sentinel 2B derived\
    \ ETc, \nWaPOR ETc, and MODIS ETc\nThe comparison between the MODIS-Sentinel 2B\
    \ derived \nwheat crop evapotranspiration, direct MODIS ETc observa-\ntion, and\
    \ WaPOR is presented in Table 7 and Fig. 9. The \ndisparity in variance between\
    \ data sets was checked and the \nresult showed equal variance. A two-tailed,\
    \ t-test assum-\ning equal variances with a 5% significance level was used \n\
    to examine the significant difference between the MODIS-\nbased calibrated crop\
    \ evapotranspiration and the direct \nremotely sensed crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (WaPOR ETc and \nMODIS ETc) of the wheat crop (Table 6). The result showed \n\
    that there is a significant difference (p = 0.0006) between the \ncalibrated MODIS-Sentinel\
    \ 2B ETc and the direct MODIS \nETc observation. Similarly, we found a significant\
    \ differ-\nence (p = 0.013) between the calibrated MODIS-Sentinel \n2B ETc and\
    \ the WaPOR ETc observation. Thus, our find-\ning indicated that it is required\
    \ to calibrate both MODIS \nETc and WaPOR ETc in using the values to estimate\
    \ crop \nwater need and to decide crop water stress conditions. The \nWaPOR ETc\
    \ value exaggerates ET, whereas, the MODIS \nETc value underestimates ET value\
    \ (Fig. 9). On the other \nhand, the advantage of combing MODIS and Sentinel 2B\
    \ \nis its higher spatial resolution (10 m) capable of capturing \neven small\
    \ plots of fields. The point scale daily reference \nevapotranspiration estimates\
    \ of the remote sensing products \nare presented in Table 7.\nThe mean daily point\
    \ reference evapotranspiration for \nBahir Dar and Dangila, respectively, was\
    \ 3.9 and 3.6 mm \n(Table 7). The range of evapotranspiration for Bahir Dar \n\
    and Dangila was from 2.6 to 4.7 mm, and 2.6 to 4.5 mm, \nrespectively. The result\
    \ showed a closer estimate of reference \nevapotranspiration for both stations\
    \ with a slight increment \nin Bahir Dar station. The table caption presented\

    and examine crop evapotranspiration of wheat that varies \nin time and space using\
    \ MODIS and Sentinel 2B products \nfor the Koga irrigation scheme. We found a\
    \ good correla-\ntion (R2 > 0.6) between MODIS potential evapotranspiration \n\
    and Penman Monteith's estimate of reference evapotranspi-\nration and developed\
    \ a regression coefficient that serves \nfor the calibration of MODIS. Similarly,\
    \ a strong correla-\ntion (R2 = 0.95) between NDVI derived from Sentinel 2B \n\
    and FAO Kc values, and regression coefficients were used \nto generate time and\
    \ space variable Kc from NDVI. The \nmean value of Kc from the 10 plots significantly\
    \ varied in \ntime; from 0.29 at the initial stage to 1.26 at the mid-stage. \n\
    Similarly, a significant Kc variation was found across the 10 \nplots; 0.16 to\
    \ 0.42 at the initial stage and 1.20 to 1.32 at the \nmid-stage. On the other\
    \ hand, the evaluation of MODIS and \nWaPOR ETc indicated that both need to be\
    \ calibrated before \nbeing directly used for the estimation of crop water needs.\
    \ \nThe combination of MODIS and Sentinel 2B to derive time \nand space variable\
    \ Kc and hence ETc was found a feasible \nalternative for proper water management\
    \ and improvement \nof crop productivity.\nAppendix\nSee Figs. 10, 11, and 12.\n\

    Compiled by Michael W. Bradley\nAbstract\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has\
    \ estimated the use of water in the United States at 5-year intervals since 1950.\
    \ This \nreport describes the water-use categories and data elements used for\
    \ the national water-use compilation conducted as part of the \nUSGS National\
    \ Water-Use Science Project. The report identifies sources of water-use information,\
    \ provides standard methods \nand techniques for estimating water use at the county\
    \ level, and outlines steps for preparing documentation for the United States,\
    \ \nthe District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nAs part\
    \ of this USGS program to document water use on a national scale, estimates of\
    \ water withdrawals for the catego-\nries of public supply, self-supplied domestic,\
    \ industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric power are prepared for each county\
    \ in \neach State, District, or territory by using the guidelines in this report.\
    \ County estimates of water withdrawals for aquaculture, \nlivestock, and mining\
    \ are prepared for each State by using a county-based national model, although\
    \ water-use programs in \neach State or Water Science Center have the option of\
    \ producing independent county estimates of water withdrawals for these \ncategories.\
    \ Estimates of water withdrawals and consumptive use for thermoelectric power\
    \ will be aggregated to the county level \nfor each State by the national project;\
    \ additionally, irrigation consumptive use at the county level will also be provided,\
    \ although \nstudy chiefs in each State have the option of producing independent\
    \ county estimates of water withdrawals and consumptive use \nfor these categories.\n\
    Estimates of deliveries of water from public supplies for domestic use by county\
    \ also will be prepared for each State. \nAs a result, total domestic water use\
    \ can be determined for each State by combining self-supplied domestic withdrawals\
    \ and \npublic-supplied domestic deliveries. Fresh groundwater and surface-water\
    \ estimates will be prepared for all categories of use, \nand saline groundwater\
    \ and surface-water estimates by county will be prepared for the categories of\
    \ public supply, industrial, \nmining, and thermoelectric power. Power production\
    \ for thermoelectric power and irrigated acres by irrigation system type will\
    \ \nbe compiled. If data are available, reclaimed-wastewater use will be compiled\
    \ for the public-supply, industrial, mining, thermo-\nelectric-power, and irrigation\
    \ categories. \nOptional water-use categories are commercial, hydroelectric power,\
    \ and wastewater treatment. Optional data elements are \npublic-supply deliveries\
    \ to commercial, industrial, and thermoelectric-power users; consumptive use (for\
    \ categories other than \nthermoelectric power and irrigation); irrigation conveyance\
    \ loss; and number of facilities. Aggregation of water-use data by \nstream basin\
    \ (eight-digit hydrologic unit code) and principal aquifers also is optional.\n\
    Water-use data compiled by the States will be stored in the USGS Aggregate Water-Use\
    \ Data System (AWUDS). This data-\nbase is a comprehensive aggregated database\
    \ designed to store mandatory and optional data elements. AWUDS contains several\
    \ \nroutines that can be used for quality assurance and quality control of the\
    \ data, and AWUDS produces tables of water-use data \nfrom the previous compilations.\n\
    Introduction\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has compiled and published estimates\
    \ of water use for the Nation at 5-year inter-\nvals since 1950. During 1977,\
    \ Congress provided funding for the USGS to establish the National Water-Use Science\
    \ Project \n(NWUSP), which is a cooperative effort with States to collect reliable\
    \ and uniform water-use information. Most water-use \ninformation is collected\
    \ by State or other Federal agencies with whom the USGS has close working relationships.\
    \ The national \nwater-use compilations are stored electronically, and the data\
    \ and reports are available to all researchers through the NWUSP \nwebsite Water\
    \ Use in the United States (http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/). The published USGS\
    \ circulars entitled Estimated Use of \nWater in the United States present data\
    \ collected for each State in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto\
    \ Rico, and \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands (MacKichan, 1951, 1957; MacKichan and Kammerer,\
    \ 1961; Murray, 1968; Murray and Reeves, 1972, \n1977; Solley and others, 1983,\
    \ 1988, 1993, 1998; Hutson and others, 2004; Kenny and others, 2009; Maupin and\
    \ others, 2014).\n2  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for\
    \ 2015\nCurrently, estimates of water withdrawals are mandatory for the categories\
    \ of public-supply, self-supplied domestic, indus-\ntrial, irrigation, livestock,\
    \ aquaculture, mining, and thermoelectric power, and optional for commercial,\
    \ hydroelectric power, \nwastewater treatment, and reservoir evaporation. The\
    \ NWUSP has developed nationally consistent methods to estimate water \nwithdrawals\
    \ for livestock, mining, aquaculture, and thermoelectric power. Methods have also\
    \ been developed to estimate water \nconsumption for irrigation and thermoelectric\
    \ power. Estimates of saline groundwater and surface-water withdrawals by county\
    \ \nare mandatory for the categories of public supply, industrial, mining, and\
    \ thermoelectric power. Estimates of reclaimed-wastewater \nuse by county are\
    \ mandatory for the irrigation and industrial categories, but null values are\
    \ allowed if there is an uncertainty \nabout the use of reclaimed wastewater in\
    \ the county. Estimates for the optional categories were last compiled nationally\
    \ in 1995.\nThe Aggregate Water-Use Data System (AWUDS) is a USGS database that\
    \ is specifically designed to store and analyze \nannual water-use data aggregated\
    \ by county, aquifer, or hydrologic unit code (HUC) compiled for any year after\
    \ 1985. Water-use \ndata for years ending in ‘0’ and ‘5’ are used for the 5-year\
    \ reports. AWUDS is capable of storing only annual aggregate State-\nlevel water-use\
    \ data for the years prior to 1985. \nEstimates of water withdrawals compiled\
    \ by the USGS enable the depiction of trends in total water use for the Nation\
    \ \namong different geographic areas, categories of use, and sources over time.\
    \ The USGS is dedicated to providing reliable scien-\ntific information that accurately\
    \ describes current and historical conditions and enables a better understanding\
    \ of the Earth’s pre-\ncious water resources. Water-use information complements\
    \ and supports surface-water and groundwater availability studies and \nthe water\
    \ budgets that are critical to these studies. This information is also essential\
    \ to accurately understand how future water \ndemands will be met while maintaining\
    \ adequate water quality and quantities for human and ecosystem needs.\nPurpose\
    \ and Scope\nThe purpose of these guidelines is to present a nationally consistent\
    \ set of methods for the collection and estimation of \nwater-use data and for\
    \ the compilation of these values for use in the 5-year publications entitled\
    \ “Estimated Use of Water in the \nUnited States.” Each chapter in this publication\
    \ describes a single water-use category, the relevant data elements, sources of\
    \ \ndata, and estimation methods. The guidelines are intended to aid personnel\
    \ in producing more useful, consistent, and reliable \nwater-use estimates. The\
    \ guidelines included in this report have been updated and compiled from Kenny\
    \ (2004) and Hutson \n(2007) and from changes in the guidelines for the 2010 water-use\
    \ compilation (USGS internal-only site https://water.usgs.gov/\nusgs/watuse/2010compilation/guidelines2010update.html).\
    \ \nThe chapters in these guidelines can be updated as methods are improved or\
    \ become more detailed. The date listed with the \nchapter title in the on-line\
    \ version of this document reflects the current version of the guidelines for\
    \ that water-use category. \nThe scope of this report includes methods for the\
    \ following mandatory water-use categories: public supply, self-supply \ndomestic,\
    \ industrial, irrigation, thermoelectric power, livestock, aquaculture, and mining.\
    \ Methods are also included for esti-\nmates of water withdrawals for (optional)\
    \ categories of commercial, hydroelectric power, wastewater-treatment and reservoir\
    \ \nevaporation. Optional data elements described herein include reclaimed-wastewater\
    \ use for commercial, thermoelectric power \nand wastewater-treatment purposes;\
    \ public-supply population served by source of supply; consumptive use for categories\
    \ other \nthan irrigation and thermoelectric power; irrigation conveyance loss;\
    \ deliveries from public-water suppliers to commercial, \nindustrial, and thermoelectric\
    \ power users; and number of facilities. Estimates for all categories may be compiled\
    \ and stored in \nthe AWUDS database to meet State or USGS Water Science Center\
    \ (WSC) needs. Over the history of the water-use program, the \ncategories and\
    \ terminology have changed. The changes in the water-use categories by 5-year\
    \ compilation are described at http://\nwater.usgs.gov/watuse/WU-Category-Changes.html\
    \ (U.S. Geological Survey, 2016a).\nBecause of the variability in available data\
    \ by State, the methods presented are general in nature and are not intended to\
    \ \nreplace more specific methodologies that may be used in some States, but do\
    \ provide guidance as to the acceptable procedures \nrequired to complete the\
    \ national compilation, and are designed to be used in conjunction with the 2015\
    \ water-use coding forms \n(Appendix A). Required documentation of the methodology\
    \ used in the compilation of water-use data for each State is part of \nscientific\
    \ protocol and is especially important for this study because data availability\
    \ and reliability vary from State to State. \nEach USGS WSC maintains documentation\
    \ as a reference for current data and as a starting point for continued data collection.\n\
    Water-Use Compilation Requirements\nMinimum requirements for the national compilation\
    \ are designed to produce a more cost-effective product that meets \nthe scientific\
    \ priorities of the USGS and NWUSP. The national data compilation currently (2015)\
    \ focuses on the aggregation \nof water-use data to the county level. The data\
    \ can, depending on local and regional needs, be aggregated based on the hydro-\n\
    logic unit code or by national aquifer code. The national aquifer codes are defined\
    \ for the principal aquifer of the United States \n(https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/NatlAqCode-reflist.html).\
    \ The national data model is not intended to limit any efforts to meet the \n\
    needs of local programs and cooperators. Mandatory and optional water-use categories,\
    \ and their associated data elements, are \nsummarized on the coding forms in\
    \ Appendix A. \nWater-Use Compilation Requirements  3\nWater-Use Categories and\
    \ Data Elements\nFor the compilation, water-use data are mandatory by county and\
    \ are optional for eight-digit HUCs, and principal aqui-\nfers. Fresh groundwater\
    \ and surface-water estimates will be prepared for the mandatory categories of\
    \ public supply (including \ndomestic deliveries), self-supplied domestic, industrial,\
    \ irrigation, livestock, mining, aquaculture, and thermoelectric power. \nEstimates\
    \ may be prepared for the optional categories of commercial, hydroelectric power,\
    \ reservoir evaporation, and wastewa-\nter treatment. Saline groundwater and surface-water\
    \ estimates are mandatory for only the categories of public supply, industrial,\
    \ \nmining, and thermoelectric power (for once-through and closed-loop cooling\
    \ systems). \nIrrigation withdrawals may be reported either as a total amount\
    \ or as subcategories of crop and golf-course irrigation; \nacres irrigated are\
    \ mandatory and will be reported either way. The choice of reporting irrigation\
    \ as a total for the category or \nby subcategory must be consistent for all counties\
    \ in the State. Consumptive use by irrigation and thermoelectric power will be\
    \ \nreported by county. Reclaimed-wastewater use is a mandatory data element for\
    \ the industrial and irrigation categories, and zeros \nshould be reported for\
    \ counties where the delivery of reclaimed wastewater does not occur; null values\
    \ can be stored in AWUDS \nfor counties where there is an uncertainty about the\
    \ use of reclaimed wastewater. Compiling domestic deliveries from public \nsupply\
    \ and power generated by thermoelectric power plants by cooling type are mandatory.\
    \ \nEstimates of county water withdrawals and consumptive use for thermoelectric\
    \ power and irrigation consumptive use will \nbe provided to the study chiefs\
    \ by NWUSP. However, a study chief may decide not to use the nationally generated\
    \ numbers but, \ninstead, use independently estimated values for water withdrawals\
    \ for the three categories. Compiling total population served \nby public-water\
    \ suppliers is mandatory for each county. Once county population estimates are\
    \ available from the U.S. Census \nBureau, NWUSP will provide the dataset to the\
    \ study chief in a format that can be readily input into AWUDS. County self-supplied\
    \ \ndomestic population in AWUDS is calculated automatically as the county population\
    \ minus the county population served by \npublic supply.\nOptional categories\
    \ and data elements also are described in this report and summarized in the coding\
    \ forms in Appendix A \nor are available at http://water.usgs.gov/usgs/watuse/2015compilation/coding-forms/forms2015.html.\
    \ Data for the optional cat-\negories may be compiled and stored in the AWUDS\
    \ database. Guidance for compiling data for the optional categories and data \n\
    elements are based largely on guidelines for 1995 (E. James Crompton and Wayne\
    \ B. Solley, U.S. Geological Survey, written \ncommun., March 27, 1995) and 2000\
    \ (Kenny, 2004). Optional categories include self-supplied commercial, hydroelectric\
    \ power \n(instream and offstream and associated power generations), and wastewater-treatment,\
    \ and reservoir evaporation. Optional \ndata elements in the public-supply category\
    \ include deliveries to commercial and industrial users and for thermoelectric-power\
    \ \npurposes. Consumptive use for all categories except thermoelectric and irrigation\
    \ (such as commercial, self-supplied domestic, \nindustrial, mining, livestock,\
    \ and aquaculture) are optional data elements. Irrigation conveyance loss is an\
    \ optional data element \nof the irrigation category. The following are optional\
    \ data elements: power production data for hydroelectric power; the number \n\
    of facilities for public-supply, industrial, thermoelectric power, hydroelectric\
    \ power, and wastewater-treatment categories; and \nreclaimed-wastewater use for\
    \ the commercial, public-supply, mining, thermoelectric power (once-through and\
    \ closed-loop cool-\ning systems), and wastewater-treatment categories.\nUnits\
    \ of Measurement\nAnnual average daily water withdrawals are stored in AWUDS in\
    \ units of million gallons per day (Mgal/d). Population is \nstored in units of\
    \ thousands of persons. Acres irrigated are stored in units of thousand acres.\
    \ Power production is stored in units \nof gigawatthours; a gigawatthour is equivalent\
    \ to 1,000 megawatthours or 1 billion watthours. All values, except population,\
    \ \nare stored with two places after the decimal point; population is stored with\
    \ three places after the decimal point. A value of zero \nusage for a data element\
    \ indicates either no usage or usage of less than 0.01 Mgal/d. A null value for\
    \ reclaimed-wastewater use \nindicates uncertainty as to the presence of the water-use\
    \ activity in the county. Care must be taken to ensure that zeros are not \ncoded\
    \ when the field is intended to be left blank.\nAggregation Levels\nWater withdrawals\
    \ for the public-supply (including domestic deliveries), irrigation, self-supplied\
    \ domestic, industrial, \nthermoelectric power, mining, livestock, and aquaculture\
    \ categories will be compiled by county for each State. Total population \nand\
    \ population served from public supply are also reported by county for each State.\
    \ For the national compilation, the District of \nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and the\
    \ U.S. Virgin Islands are treated as States, and Alaska boroughs, Louisiana parishes,\
    \ and Virginia \nindependent cities are treated as counties. Water withdrawals\
    \ aggregated by principal aquifer (U.S. Geological Survey, 2003) \nfor each State\
    \ and also for aquifer by county are optional and may be entered into AWUDS, but\
    \ will not be part of the national \nwater-use compilation as published in the\
    \ water-use circular series. Entry of the withdrawals by aquifer of any scale\
    \ (statewide \n4  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for\
    \ 2015\nor by county-aquifer subsets) is encouraged, and the data will be available\
    \ for other studies. Information on the principal aqui-\nfers of the United States\
    \ and geographic information system (GIS) files are available at http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/aquifer/map.html\
    \ \n(U.S. Geological Survey, 2015).\nAggregate Water-Use Data System Database\n\
    The AWUDS is the official USGS database to store areal water-use data, and must\
    \ be used for the 5-year compilations as \nwell as to store water-use data for\
    \ local, regional, watershed, or aquifer studies. Water-use data compilers are\
    \ required to enter \naggregate data by county for mandatory water-use categories\
    \ except for self-supplied domestic population, which is calculated \ninternally.\
    \ Data from AWUDS are available by State and county through the USGS Water Use\
    \ Data for the Nation website at \nhttp://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/wu (U.S. Geological\
    \ Survey, 2016b).\nThe AWUDS database was created to store data aggregated by\
    \ county, HUC, or principal aquifer and is released as a \npersonal computer-based\
    \ system available to each USGS WSC. AWUDS data for each State are reviewed and\
    \ revised for each \ncompilation in order to accommodate updated compilation requirements.\
    \ AWUDS also is able to store the optional data elements \nby county and eight-digit\
    \ HUC, as well as selected groundwater categories by principal aquifer. \nIn addition\
    \ to meeting the storage requirements for the 5-year compilation, AWUDS also can\
    \ store water-use data for any \nother year after 1985; data for years prior to\
    \ 1985 may be stored as State-level totals. Within AWUDS, data are entered and\
    \ \nedited interactively or imported from machine-readable files. AWUDS can generate\
    \ tables by category of use or by county, \neight-digit HUC, or principal aquifer.\
    \ Summary tables output from AWUDS show entered data elements or provide calculated\
    \ \nvalues for categories. Quality-assurance and quality-control (QA/QC) programs\
    \ within AWUDS include checks for erroneous \nvalues, comparison of totals by\
    \ area, and comparison of data between years.\nDocumentation\nDocumentation of\
    \ data sources and methodology is required as part of the 5-year compilation.\
    \ Documentation corrobo-\nrates the data that will be published in the USGS water-use\
    \ circular and provides a guideline for subsequent compilations. The \nNWUSP documentation\
    \ template provides a nationally consistent format for each water-use study chief\
    \ to document the sources, \nmethods, and quality assurance of the data. All documentation\
    \ must include the following elements.\n• Sources of data and sources of coefficients\
    \ used.\n• Source agency and contact information.\n• Methods, techniques, and\
    \ coefficients used to collect or estimate data.\n• Location and types of data\
    \ files.\n• Explanation of substantial changes from previous water-use data compilations.\n\
    • Results of QA/QC review on acquired or estimated data—If the current water-use\
    \ estimates of values for the data ele-\nments differ substantially from those\
    \ reported for the previous compilation, possible explanations for these differences\
    \ \nshould be included in the documentation. For example, a major nuclear-fueled\
    \ power plant may have started operation, \nseveral pulp and paper industries\
    \ may have closed, or irrigation may have been encouraged or limited in an area\
    \ of the \nState. Any information that can add to the understanding of water use\
    \ in the State should be included in the documenta-\ntion.\nWater-use study chiefs\
    \ will transmit completed documentation in electronic form to the respective USGS\
    \ regional water-\nuse specialist. A standardized naming convention for the documentation\
    \ file includes the State postal code and the date. For \nexample, for Alabama,\
    \ the name of the documentation file will be “ALdocyymmdd.”\nCompilation Methods\n\
    The compilation of water-use data for the current (2015) compilation should begin\
    \ with the review of previous compila-\ntion documentation. Although the format\
    \ of the documentation has changed with time, the documentation should provide\
    \ the \nwater-use study chief with a starting point for developing an approach\
    \ and a time-task plan. The previous documentation should \nCompilation Methods\
    \  5\ncontain the location and types of electronic and paper water-use files;\
    \ agency and contact information; sources of data; and \nmethods, techniques,\
    \ and coefficients used to collect or estimate data. Several methods are described\
    \ in each section of these \nguidelines. If needed, study chiefs are encouraged\
    \ to investigate other methods outside of those suggested.\nGeneral Methodologies\
    \ and Techniques\nThe availability of data, the year of the most recent data,\
    \ and the completeness of the data can vary among States and \namong the counties\
    \ within a State. Accessing the data for estimating water use can be as uncomplicated\
    \ as asking agencies or \norganizations for the data reported to them or as involved\
    \ as designing a survey to collect the data. When data are not readily \navailable,\
    \ for some categories, water-use data can be collected either by an inventory\
    \ of all sites or a partial inventory of the \nwater-use sites using several sampling\
    \ techniques. Site-specific water-use data more commonly are available for public-supply,\
    \ \nindustrial, and thermoelectric-power facilities and less commonly available\
    \ for self-supplied domestic, irrigation, aquaculture, \nlivestock, and mining\
    \ water-use sites. When site-specific data are not available, water-use estimates\
    \ may be determined by using \nancillary data and a water-use coefficient.\nAn\
    \ inventory accounts for all of the individual sites and ancillary data in contrast\
    \ to a partial inventory that queries selected \nwater-use sites using several\
    \ sampling criteria. Once an inventory has been developed, some or all of the\
    \ users can be surveyed \nto determine water usage. Federal agencies cannot distribute\
    \ surveys without meeting the requirements of the Paper Reduction \nAct of 1995\
    \ (U.S. Congress, 1995). Generally, the guidelines for developing a survey are\
    \ as listed.\n• Identify agencies with the authority or legal mandate to collect\
    \ the data.\n• Identify the type of facilities information needed.\n• Identify\
    \ the agency and organization sources of facility information for the category\
    \ of use.\n• Construct a master list of facilities.\n• Decide on a sampling approach\
    \ if not all users are to be surveyed.\n• Create a survey form that is short and\
    \ easy for the user to complete.\n• Write a concise description of the requested\
    \ data.\n• Provide a contact name and phone number. \n• Provide a desired completion\
    \ date.\n• Include a statement of confidentiality.\n• Identify an agency or organization\
    \ to cooperate in distributing the surveys; the entity may be different from the\
    \ agency \nwith the authority and legal mandate to collect the data.\n• Send survey\
    \ forms by mail, fax, or e-mail or conduct the survey by phone.\n• Develop a tracking\
    \ process for receiving and managing the returned survey forms.\n• Implement a\
    \ follow-up procedure for contacting facilities that do not respond by the requested\
    \ time.\nTo produce the most complete and defensible data for each State, the\
    \ greatest effort and time are spent collecting informa-\ntion about the largest\
    \ users and the largest categories of use in individual States. Compilation of\
    \ accurate data for the largest \npublic suppliers, industries, agricultural regions,\
    \ and power plants produces State totals that are fairly reliable. As time and\
    \ \nresources permit, data on smaller-volume water users also should be collected\
    \ within each category.\nWithout site-specific data, water use often is estimated\
    \ by using a coefficient that represents a unit-use water requirement \nand number\
    \ of units such as population served, number of employees, acres of cropland,\
    \ or number of golf courses or golf holes. \nSome water-use coefficients already\
    \ have been developed and are part of the technical literature or administrative\
    \ and legislative \ndocuments for a State. If water-use coefficients are not available\
    \ or perhaps no longer suitable, coefficients can be developed \nfrom a representative\
    \ sample of typical users that are more pertinent to a specific facility, county,\
    \ or State. The source of the \ncoefficients, the source of the ancillary data,\
    \ and the date they were accessed should be documented.\n6  Guidelines for Preparation\
    \ of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\nQuality Assurance and Quality Control\n\
    Errors can occur in both the compiled and entered data. QA/QC procedures are scientific\
    \ protocols implemented to ensure \nthe quality of the water-use estimate. By\
    \ definition, quality assurance is the program for the systematic monitoring and\
    \ evalua-\ntion of several aspects of a project to ensure that standards of quality\
    \ are being met. Quality control is an aggregate of activities \ndesigned to ensure\
    \ adequate data quality. AWUDS provides a system of QA/QC procedures to check\
    \ for errors.\n The following basic checks can be made during data compilation\
    \ and after AWUDS data entry.\n• Use AWUDS quality-assurance programs to check\
    \ for erroneous data and to compare State totals with principal aquifer \nor hydrologic\
    \ unit totals by category.\n• Review spatial distribution of data using choropleth\
    \ or other types of maps or GIS analysis.\n• Compare data with those from the\
    \ previous compilations. Examine changes based on percentage change, statistical\
    \ \nanalysis, or general geographic patterns of use within a State.\n• Use sorting\
    \ routines to check for possible errors in largest and smallest water withdrawals\
    \ by ranking values for data ele-\nments by county, HUC, or aquifer. \n• Examine\
    \ calculated values such as per capita use and irrigation application rates.\n\
    • Check county and State data for population served to ensure that they do not\
    \ exceed total census populations.\nMuch of the data that will be used in the\
    \ compilation will be received from other entities. A preliminary QA/QC check\
    \ \nshould be performed, if possible, before the data are integrated into the\
    \ USGS analysis and database. The QA/QC check should \ninclude an evaluation of\
    \ the documentation of the level of completeness, degree of accuracy, and amount\
    \ of review given to the \ndata by the entities from whom the data were received.\
    \ AWUDS can also be used to generate a QA/QC check for the entered \ndata that\
    \ includes many of the required QA/QC checks. \n The QA/QC check should determine\
    \ whether the data are based on a census enumeration or are statistically derived\
    \ data, \nlike the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) data. Completeness\
    \ of the data can be examined by determining, for \nexample, if reported crop\
    \ acreages include total acreages or just irrigated acreages; if irrigated acreages\
    \ and water deliveries are \nreported for a management area of a particular agency,\
    \ or for an entire county; or if some data are censored for privacy reasons. \n\
    Additionally, any data obtained from surveys, questionnaires, or cooperator reports\
    \ should be checked against former data to \nensure reporting consistency and\
    \ consistency in location over time. Site visits to select or problem sites should\
    \ be conducted, \nif possible. Outliers in the data should be identified, evaluated,\
    \ and confirmed or corrected, and units of measurement should \nbe verified.\n\
    Standard Industrial Classification Coding System\nThe Standard Industrial Classification\
    \ (SIC) coding system was developed to promote the comparability of establishment\
    \ \ndata describing several facets of the U.S. economy (Office of Management and\
    \ Budget, 1987). The SIC coding system was \nintended to cover the entire field\
    \ of economic activities—agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and trapping;\
    \ mining; construc-\ntion; manufacturing; transportation, communications, electric,\
    \ gas, and sanitary services; wholesale trade; retail trade; finance, \ninsurance,\
    \ and real estate; personal, business, professional, repair, recreation, and other\
    \ services; and public administration. The \nSIC coding system is based on the\
    \ primary activity in which the industry is engaged. The structure of the classification\
    \ makes \nit possible to tabulate, analyze, and publish industry data based on\
    \ a two-digit major group, a three-digit industry group, or a \nfour-digit industry\
    \ code. A newer system of classification, the North American Industry Classification\
    \ System (NAICS), went \ninto effect in 1997. The U.S. Census Bureau (U.S. Department\
    \ of Commerce, 2000, 2002) published descriptions of the NAICS \ncodes and the\
    \ correlation with SIC codes.\nThe USGS has assigned each four-digit industry\
    \ code in the 1987 SIC manual (Office of Management and Budget, 1987) to \na water-use\
    \ category. In some cases, a code may be listed under more than one water-use\
    \ category. Each of these SIC codes was \nthen correlated to one or more NAICS\
    \ codes. The SIC and NAICS codes can be useful for assigning withdrawals to the\
    \ public-\nsupply, industrial, mining, thermoelectric-power, and commercial categories.\
    \ A list of SIC codes by water-use category can be \nfound in table 3 of Guidelines\
    \ for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for 2000 (Kenny, 2004, accessed\
    \ at http://pubs.usgs.\ngov/tm/2005/tm4A4/). Reference lists of the SIC and NAICS\
    \ codes for each category can be generated by the template builder \nin the Site-Specific\
    \ Water-Use Data System (SWUDS).\nPublic Supply  7\nPublic Supply\nPublic supply\
    \ refers to water withdrawn from ground and surface sources by public and private\
    \ water systems for use by \ncities, towns, rural water districts, mobile-home\
    \ parks, Native American Indian reservations, and military bases. Public-supply\
    \ \nfacilities provide water to at least 25 persons or have a minimum of 15 service\
    \ connections and are classified as SIC 4941. \nWater withdrawn by public suppliers\
    \ may be delivered to users for domestic, commercial, industrial, and thermoelectric-power\
    \ \npurposes, as well as to other public-water suppliers. Public-supply water\
    \ is also used for public services (public uses)—such \nas pools, parks, and public\
    \ buildings—and may have unaccounted uses (losses) because of system leaks or\
    \ such non-metered \nservices as firefighting, flushing of water lines, or backwashing\
    \ at treatment plants. Some public-supply water may be used in the \nprocesses\
    \ of water and wastewater treatment. \nSome public suppliers treat saline water\
    \ before distributing the water. Estimates of saline groundwater and surface-water\
    \ \nwithdrawals for public supply are mandatory for the national compilation.\
    \ The definition of saline water for public supply refers \nto water that requires\
    \ treatment to reduce the concentration of dissolved solids through the process\
    \ of desalination or dilution. \nData Elements\nThe public-supply category includes\
    \ not only the water withdrawals, but also includes delivery of water to various\
    \ users. \nDeliveries for domestic use are reported and are mandatory data elements.\
    \ Deliveries to commercial, industrial, or thermo-\nelectric users are optional\
    \ data elements. The mandatory and optional data elements are described below.\
    \ Data for the optional \nelements may be compiled and entered into AWUDS, but\
    \ will not be part of the national water-use analysis as published in the \nwater-use\
    \ circular series. The optional data, however, will be available for other types\
    \ of water studies.\nMandatory\n• Groundwater withdrawals, freshwater, by county.\n\

    Sources of Information\nFor each USGS WSC, the documentation for the previous\

    \ agency and contact information; agency and internet resources; and methods,\
    \ techniques, \nand coefficients used to collect or estimate data. With this information,\
    \ the compiler should know where to begin to create or \nupdate a master list\

    \ \n(AWRA), accessed at http://www.awra.org/.\nCompilation Techniques\nConstructing\
    \ a master list of public-supply systems is fundamental to all of the compilation\
    \ techniques. A master list, at a \nminimum, consists of the names and locations\
    \ of public-water suppliers, populations served, and sources of water. The informa-\n\
    tion to build or update this list may be available from previous documentation,\
    \ one or more State agencies, or USGS water-use \ndatabases. The EPA SDWIS database\
    \ is a secondary source containing information on public supplies obtained from\
    \ the State \nagencies that administer water-quality regulations for drinking\
    \ water. \nThe SDWIS database includes information on the names and locations\
    \ of systems, source of supply, location of water \nintakes, and population served\
    \ for all community water systems (CWS), which are those serving at least 25 persons\
    \ or 15 or \nmore service connections on a year-round basis. SDWIS does not include\
    \ any information on quantity of water withdrawn. In \nsome cases, the State agencies\
    \ providing the data to SDWIS may have more up-to-date and complete information\
    \ than SDWIS.\nWater Withdrawals\nPublic-supply information may be obtained from\
    \ water suppliers by cooperator surveys and permit information. If water \nsuppliers\
    \ cannot be contacted by cooperator surveys, then information may be obtained\
    \ from a State agency that administers \nwater-withdrawal permits. Public-supply\
    \ withdrawals are reported in the compilation for the county in which the withdrawals\
    \ \noccur, although the water subsequently may be distributed and used elsewhere.\
    \ State reporting programs and individual public-\nwater suppliers are good sources\
    \ of data. Individual State reporting agencies have varying criteria for obtaining\
    \ public-supply \nwater-use data; these criteria may be based on such permit requirements\
    \ as size of system or magnitude of withdrawals. Return \nrates of the required\
    \ surveys to the State reporting agency, as well as the amount of QA/QC review,\
    \ also may vary from State to \nState. For these reasons, some needed public-supply\
    \ system information may not have been collected by the State agency and \nmust\
    \ be obtained directly from the public-supply system or be determined from other\
    \ ancillary information.\nStudy chiefs may survey public-water suppliers by telephone\
    \ calls or visits to the systems. However, surveys mailed from \nthe USGS offices\
    \ must meet all requirements of the 1995 Paper Reduction Act (U.S. Congress, 1995).\
    \ Usually, information \ncan be obtained from a director of public works, city\
    \ engineer, city clerk, bookkeeper, manager, or operator. The level of detail\
    \ \nobtained depends on the availability of the information and the necessary\
    \ resources available to collect the data. Useful informa-\ntion to request from\
    \ these contacts includes the following list of items.\n• Source(s) of water.\
    \ Well information (local name or number, depth, location) and names of aquifers\
    \ used for ground-\nwater sources; names and locations of surface-water sources\
    \ (streams, lakes, reservoirs); and sources of any purchased \nwater. Some water\
    \ suppliers use combinations of groundwater, surface water, or purchased water.\n\
    • Total withdrawals. Amounts of water pumped may have been measured by flowmeters\
    \ or calculated using pump rates \nand number of hours pumped. The rate of withdrawal\
    \ may be by day, month, or year and should be converted to million \ngallons per\
    \ day.\n• Metering points. Water may be metered before treatment, during transport\
    \ to another location, or as it is delivered to \nusers. Knowing the metering\
    \ point allows for the accounting of treatment or transit losses and helps avoid\
    \ double count-\ning of water.\n• Type of treatment plant. Surface water usually\
    \ requires more water for treatment processes, such as backwashing filters, \n\
    than groundwater does. If total reported water is finished water rather than raw\
    \ water, an amount or percentage of water \nfor treatment should be added for\
    \ systems to account for water-treatment usage.\n10  Guidelines for Preparation\
    \ of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\n• Names of other connected water suppliers\
    \ and amounts of water purchased or sold. Many water suppliers purchase \nand\
    \ sell water to other systems, and the amount of water transferred in both directions\
    \ is needed to accurately determine \nwater use and subsequent water-use coefficients.\
    \ \n• Number of service connections by type. Numbers of active residential, commercial,\
    \ industrial, or other meters may \nbe used with a coefficient to estimate delivery\
    \ amounts by customer types. Coefficients also may be derived from the \nnumber\
    \ of meters, the amount of water delivered, and population or employment counts.\
    \ Numbers of active residential \nmeters, including single-family and multifamily\
    \ housing, are useful for determining population served.\n• Amounts of water delivered\
    \ for several purposes. Total water use for a public supply is accounted for through\
    \ deliv-\neries to other public supplies, to local domestic, commercial, industrial,\
    \ and thermoelectric-power customers, and in \npublic use and losses. Delivery\
    \ data can be used to develop water-use coefficients for estimating withdrawals\
    \ for similar \npublic suppliers. Total metered uses also can be subtracted from\
    \ total withdrawals to determine amounts of public use \nand losses.\n• Location\
    \ of retail service areas. Many public-water suppliers serve customers outside\
    \ city limits or in multiple counties \nor States. Water sold or distributed to\
    \ other counties will affect county totals and should be defined.\nEstimating\
    \ public-water losses and transfer water amounts for public supply is not mandatory;\
    \ however, the data are \nlikely to be collected as part of the survey. In Solley\
    \ and others (1998), the difference between total raw water withdrawals and \n\
    metered water use is equivalent to public use and losses, and that difference\
    \ averaged about 15 percent of public-supply with-\ndrawals in the United States\
    \ during 1995. Public use and losses vary substantially among water suppliers,\
    \ depending on treat-\nment needs, system efficiency, condition and age of the\
    \ infrastructure, and the amount of public-supply water use. For example, \nolder\
    \ systems and those that are undergoing repairs to lines or towers have greater\
    \ losses because of leaks, flushing, and tower \ndraining than systems with few\
    \ problems. Often public use and system losses cannot be separated.\nInformation\
    \ on water transfers is necessary for estimating public-supply withdrawals. Estimates\
    \ of total water use for \nsuppliers using a combination of their own withdrawals\
    \ and purchased water, or for those selling water wholesale, should be \nadjusted\
    \ to identify withdrawals by the county in which they occur.\nAn effort should\
    \ be made to estimate water withdrawals for each public-supply system in the county.\
    \ At a minimum, water-\nwithdrawal data should be obtained for the largest public\
    \ suppliers in each county. For public suppliers of smaller amounts of \nwater,\
    \ water use may be estimated based on water-right allocations, average water production,\
    \ previously reported usage, or \nchanges in population or population served.\
    \ Sometimes estimates of total withdrawal for a public-supply system are based\
    \ on \nestimates of water delivered to residential, commercial, or industrial\
    \ customers or perhaps only on estimates of public-supply \ndeliveries to residential\
    \ customers. Depending on the size of the public-supply system and on the available\
    \ time and resources, \nestimates of commercial and industrial deliveries and\
    \ public use and losses should be added to domestic-delivery estimates \nto approximate\
    \ total public-supply water use. References that can be used to aid in estimating\
    \ commercial deliveries included \nMcCuen and others (1975), Wolff and others\
    \ (1975), Kim and McCuen (1979), Kammerer (1982), Jones and others (1984), and\
    \ \nBucca and Marella (1992). Information and data on residential water use, indoor\
    \ and outdoor use, are available from a detailed \nstudy for California (Gleick\
    \ and others, 2003).\nPublic-supply water withdrawals for the smaller systems\
    \ also may be estimated using population served and a total \npublic-supply per\
    \ capita use coefficient. Preferably, the coefficient is derived from public-supply\
    \ systems of similar size, \nsimilar customer base, similar rate structures, similar\
    \ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, or similar climatic and \ngeographic\
    \ settings.\nPer Capita Use Coefficients\nA per capita use coefficient may be\
    \ used to estimate total public-supply water use or domestic deliveries from public\
    \ \nsupply. In each case, the per capita use coefficient usually has a different\
    \ value. Per capita coefficients for total public-supply \nwithdrawals and domestic\
    \ deliveries are commonly expressed in terms of gallons per person per day and\
    \ require an estimate of \npopulation served. For the compilation, the different\
    \ per capita use terms are defined, for clarity and convenience of discussion,\
    \ \nas total public-supply per capita use coefficient and public-supply domestic\
    \ per capita use coefficient. Total public-supply per \ncapita use is derived\
    \ by dividing average daily total public-supply water use by the population served\
    \ only by the system. Total \nwater use accounts for the water withdrawn and purchased\
    \ by a system and subtracts from that amount the water sold to other \nsystems.\
    \ Total public-supply per capita use coefficients are generally larger for systems\
    \ that serve industrial and commercial \nusers or have large losses. Public-supply\
    \ domestic per capita use is derived by dividing average daily domestic deliveries\
    \ by the \nPublic Supply  11\npopulation served only by the system. The coefficients\
    \ can be compared to other sources of total public-supply per capita use, \nand\
    \ public-supply domestic per capita use coefficients include the documentation\
    \ from previous compilations, technical litera-\nture, or State administrative\
    \ or legislative documents.\nPopulation Served\nPopulation served refers to the\
    \ population within a county receiving water from a public-supply system on a\
    \ year-round \nbasis and excludes vacationers and second-home owners. Persons\
    \ living on military bases, on Native American Indian reserva-\ntions, and in\
    \ prisons constitute a population served by the public-water system serving those\
    \ communities. Population served \nby public-water suppliers is estimated for\
    \ all public-water suppliers regardless of the source of the water (groundwater,\
    \ sur-\nface water, purchased water, or a combination of sources of water). Population\
    \ served is compiled in the county of residence, \nwhich is not necessarily the\
    \ county where the withdrawals occur. Population served within a county cannot\
    \ exceed the total \ncounty population. \nIndividual public-water systems, State\
    \ agencies, and SDWIS are sources of population-served data. Additionally, county\
    \ \nestimates of the source of water (public or private water system, individual\
    \ drilled well, individual dug well, or other) to housing \nunits were published\
    \ in the 1990 Census of Housing: Detailed Housing Characteristics (U.S. Department\
    \ of Commerce, U.S. \nCensus Bureau, 1993). Although the data are dated and apply\
    \ to the number of housing units rather than the number of occu-\npied housing\
    \ units, the data can aid in the overall analysis of population served in a county\
    \ and perhaps serve as a baseline from \nwhich to compare the population-served\
    \ data received from the other sources.\nPopulation-served numbers may be unreliable\
    \ for several reasons and should be checked. Some potential problems include \n\
    service-area boundaries, which for many public suppliers do not correspond to\
    \ political boundaries such as city limits or county \nlines; therefore, census\
    \ population is adjusted to accommodate customers living outside city limits or\
    \ county lines to account \nfor total population served. For water suppliers with\
    \ service areas that span more than one county, an estimate is made of the \n\
    population residing in each county.\nIn estimating population served, other errors\
    \ may be caused by counting the population served more than once, especially if\
    \ \na supplier providing wholesale water supplies to other systems reports a population-served\
    \ number that may erroneously include \nboth retail and wholesale population-served\
    \ numbers. Errors in a reported population served sometimes can be detected when\
    \ \ncomparing aggregated county population served to total county census populations.\n\
    If population-served numbers are not available, population served can be estimated\
    \ based on the number of residential \nconnections and the number of persons per\
    \ household. Individual water suppliers can provide the number of residential\
    \ connec-\ntions, which may include multifamily dwellings. Because the number\
    \ of billed residential connections often approximates the \nnumber of households\
    \ that are occupied in the service area, this statistic, although not always available,\
    \ is preferred to the more \ngeneral statistic, total number of residential connections.\
    \ The use of total residential connections would likely overestimate the \npopulation\
    \ served.\nCensus data on housing characteristics for counties and the incorporated\
    \ places within the counties include ratios of average \npersons per household.\
    \ As with the population served numbers from different sources, the reliability\
    \ of the number of persons \nper household also should be checked. The population\
    \ served that is reported by public-water suppliers may be over-reported, if \n\
    it is estimated by using a ratio of persons per household that is too large.\n\
    Domestic Deliveries\nPublic-supply deliveries for domestic purposes will be estimated\
    \ for the compilation. Domestic-delivery data may be col-\nlected from the appropriate\
    \ State agency or from the public-supply system, estimated using population served\
    \ and a public-supply \ndomestic per capita use coefficient, or estimated from\
    \ a sampling of the public-supply systems. Two additional sets of data may \n\
    be available from the public-water systems and are helpful: \n• The number of\
    \ billed residential customers or the number of residential service connections.\n\
    • Amount of water delivered for domestic purposes during the compilation year.\n\
    Domestic deliveries from public supply can be estimated, if needed, by using a\
    \ per capita water use coefficient, or esti-\nmated as a percentage of the total\
    \ withdrawal for public supply, based on data from other public-water systems\
    \ of similar size \nand in the same general region of a State. The method used\
    \ to determine domestic deliveries must be fully described in the \ndocumentation\
    \ for the compilation. \n12  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates\
    \ for 2015\nEstimating Domestic Deliveries Using Population Served and a Coefficient\n\
    Domestic deliveries from public supply can be estimated by using population served\
    \ and a public-supply domestic per \ncapita use coefficient. Residential use varies\
    \ from household to household; however, households served by the same public-supply\
    \ \nsystem often have a common pattern of use influenced by factors such as water\
    \ rates, water-conservation programs, lot size, \ncustomer affluence, climate,\
    \ and topography. Although public-supply systems with similar water-use characteristics\
    \ are likely \nto have similar per capita use coefficients among systems, a common\
    \ pattern of residential use, especially outdoor use, may not \nexist because\
    \ of variation in this set of factors. Therefore, the coefficient for one system\
    \ may or may not be valid for all systems \nwithin the State, and more than one\
    \ public-supply domestic per capita use coefficient may have to be determined\
    \ for a State.\nOutdoor water use can be a major component of domestic deliveries,\
    \ especially in arid climates; this outdoor usage is \nreflected in the per capita\
    \ use coefficient. In some areas, residential communities may receive potable\
    \ water from a public-water \nsupplier for indoor use and nonpotable water through\
    \ a separate distribution system for outdoor irrigation of lawns and gardens.\
    \ \nAn example of a “dual-use” area is where developers provide the nonpotable\
    \ water to houses in urban areas built on former \nfarmland, using water previously\
    \ allocated for agricultural irrigation use. Homeowners may also use wells to\
    \ supply nonpotable \nwater for landscape and yard irrigations. Public-supply\
    \ domestic per capita use coefficients in these dual-use areas generally \nare\
    \ lower than in areas where customers use publicly supplied water for indoor and\
    \ outdoor uses. The nonpotable water in the \nexamples previously described would\
    \ be counted as self-supplied domestic rather than as a delivery from public-supply\
    \ to \ndomestic use.\nEstimating Domestic Deliveries as a Percentage of Total\
    \ Public-Supply Water Use\nIf data are not available for other methods, domestic\
    \ deliveries may be estimated as a percentage of the total water use for a \n\
    system, a county, or a State. However, because the customer base of public suppliers\
    \ and use patterns may vary a great deal, cau-\ntion should be used in applying\
    \ county- or State-wide percentages. The percentage of total water withdrawals\
    \ used for domestic \ndelivery should be based on percentages calculated for systems\
    \ with reported domestic deliveries and applied to systems of simi-\nlar size\
    \ and similar geographic area. Care should also be taken when applying percentages\
    \ from previous compilations because \nthe water-use demographics and domestic,\
    \ commercial, and industrial deliveries likely change through time. In determining\
    \ \nthe percentage of domestic deliveries compared to total deliveries, an exploratory\
    \ sampling of a selected set of public-supply \ndelivery data should be taken\
    \ to determine a representative percentage and tested to see if applying a percentage\
    \ to total deliver-\nies would be a valid approach.\nSelf-Supplied Domestic\n\
    Domestic water use is water used for indoor and outdoor household purposes. Common\
    \ indoor uses include water for \ndrinking, food preparation, bathing, washing\
    \ clothes and dishes, and flushing toilets. Major outdoor uses include watering\
    \ lawns \nand gardens and washing cars. Water for domestic use may be delivered\
    \ from a public supplier or may be self-supplied. Self-\nsupplied users may withdraw\
    \ water from a private source, such as a well or spring, or capture rainwater\
    \ in a cistern.\nData Elements\nThe category of self-supplied domestic consists\
    \ of the following mandatory and optional data elements. Data for the \noptional\
    \ elements may be compiled and entered into AWUDS, but will not be part of the\
    \ national water-use compilation as pub-\nlished in the water-use circular series.\
    \ The optional data, however, will be available for other types of water studies.\n\

    \ and housing characteristics by county and down to the block/ census tract level—the\

    \ and reports on domestic water use are available through the AWRA, accessed at\
    \ http://www.awra.org/.\nCompilation Techniques\nSelf-supplied domestic water\
    \ withdrawals typically are estimated by multiplying the self-supplied population\
    \ by a self-\nsupplied domestic per capita use coefficient. However, the approach\
    \ to estimating self-supplied domestic water withdrawals may \nvary depending\
    \ on the type of data available to the study chief. Self-supplied population is\
    \ automatically calculated in AWUDS \nby subtracting total population served by\
    \ a public supply in a county from the total census population in the county.\
    \ \n14  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\nThe\
    \ reliability of the estimate of self-supplied population depends on the reliability\
    \ of the population-served data reported \nfor the public-water systems. The reliability\
    \ and accuracy of the self-supplied domestic water-withdrawal estimates are also\
    \ \ndependent on the domestic per capita use coefficient. The coefficient may\
    \ be more accurate if it is determined for separate \ngeographic areas of the\
    \ State that have distinctive climatic or water-use characteristics. A public-supply\
    \ domestic per capita use \ncoefficient may be substituted for a self-supplied\
    \ domestic per capita use coefficient if the publicly supplied and self-supplied\
    \ \npopulations are believed to be similar in terms of water use, especially if\
    \ the public-water supply system is relatively small with \nminimal commercial\
    \ deliveries and zero industrial deliveries. If the public-supply domestic per\
    \ capita use rates developed from \nthe sampling indicate regional differences\
    \ within the State, an average public-supply domestic per capita use should be\
    \ esti-\nmated for each county or region.\nSelf-supplied or publicly supplied\
    \ domestic per capita use coefficients also may be obtained from estimates provided\
    \ by \nother agencies or from technical, administrative, or legislative literature.\
    \ Some States have published projections of future water \ndemands and may have\
    \ calculated per capita use rates. Regional and State planning agencies, State\
    \ natural-resource agencies, or \nthe State’s public health agency are possible\
    \ sources for this information. Per capita use coefficients also have been determined\
    \ \nas part of research conducted by professional organizations, such as the AWWA,\
    \ and by consulting firms.\nIn areas where sewer districts serve houses that are\
    \ not on public-water supplies, wastewater-treatment facilities often \nmaintain\
    \ information about self-supplied residences for billing purposes. This information\
    \ can be used to estimate withdraw-\nals for areas and to develop per capita use\
    \ coefficients along with population and housing data. State pollution-control\
    \ agencies \nalso estimate per capita uses when designing wastewater lagoons.\
    \ These design values, usually from about 80 to 100 gallons per \ncapita per day\
    \ (gpcd), may provide a good estimate of domestic per capita use. Other coefficients,\
    \ such as gallons per day per \nhousehold or gallons per day per household market\
    \ value can be used to determine domestic self-supplied withdrawals in areas \n\
    for which ancillary data on housing are available.\nDomestic self-supplied withdrawals\
    \ typically are from wells. The source for about 98 percent of self-supplied domestic\
    \ \nwithdrawals during 2000 was groundwater (Hutson and others, 2004). Information\
    \ on the use of surface water for domestic \nsupply may be obtained from the State\
    \ public health agency, the State agency responsible for permitting or water-use\
    \ data col-\nlection, census housing data, or local knowledge of areas where surface\
    \ water is used. Cisterns used to collect rainwater for \ndomestic use generally\
    \ are considered to be surface-water sources. Springs are considered surface water\
    \ in some States and \ngroundwater in others. \nConsumptive Use\nConsumptive use\
    \ can be estimated for the total of self-supplied and publicly supplied domestic\
    \ water uses. Domestic con-\nsumptive use is typically estimated as a percentage\
    \ of the water that is withdrawn and delivered for domestic purposes. Percent\
    \ \nconsumptive use should be based on information obtained from water suppliers\
    \ or from references for your State. \nCommercial\nThe commercial water-use category\
    \ was a mandatory category through 1995 and became an optional category starting\
    \ with \nthe 2000 national compilation (Kenny, 2004). The commercial water-use\
    \ category includes water used by commercial facilities \nsuch as hotels, restaurants,\
    \ office buildings, educational institutions, prisons, government and military\
    \ facilities, and retail sales \nstores. The water used by commercial facilities\
    \ can be self-supplied or delivered by public-water suppliers. For military bases\
    \ \nand prisons, if domestic use cannot be determined, all withdrawals should\
    \ go in the commercial category. \nThe irrigation water provided by public suppliers\
    \ to golf courses, parks, and other landscaped areas can be reported as \na delivery\
    \ to commercial use. Public-supplied deliveries for clubhouses and other non-irrigation\
    \ uses at golf courses can be \nreported as a commercial use. Also for the 1995\
    \ compilation, offstream fish hatchery withdrawals were reported in the commer-\n\
    cial water-use category. For the current compilation, offstream fish hatchery\
    \ withdrawals will be reported as aquaculture. A list \nof commercial facility\
    \ types by SIC and NAICS codes can be generated with the SWUDS template builder.\n\
    Data Elements\nCurrently (2015), all commercial data elements are optional. \n\
    • Self-supplied groundwater withdrawals (fresh).\n• Self-supplied surface-water\
    \ withdrawals (fresh).\nCommercial  15\n• Deliveries from public suppliers.\n\
    • Consumptive use (fresh).\n• Reclaimed wastewater.\nSources of Information\n\
    Information concerning commercial water use may be obtained from the following\
    \ sources. These sources are not all \nencompassing. They are examples only. \n\
    • Individual facilities (by personal visits and [or] cooperator surveys).\n• Water\
    \ suppliers (for deliveries).\n• State agency that permits the use of water.\n\
    • State or local department of economic development.\n• Local chamber of commerce.\n\
    • Sewage-treatment facilities.\n• Tax appraiser and county assessors.\n• State\
    \ board of education (student enrollments).\nCompilation Techniques\nThe compilation\
    \ methods described in this section are not intended to be all encompassing. These\
    \ techniques can be used if \nbetter methods are not available. \nWater Withdrawals\n\
    The water withdrawals by self-supplied commercial facilities vary with the size\
    \ and type of the commercial facility. The \nwater withdrawn by commercial facilities\
    \ may be available at the facility or reported to State or local agencies. If\
    \ the informa-\ntion is not available, commercial water-use coefficients (gallons\
    \ per day per person, thousand gallons per day per building, \ngallons per day\
    \ per square foot, gallons per night per hotel room) may be used. Estimates of\
    \ withdrawals by self-supplied com-\nmercial facilities may be determined from\
    \ information available by similar SIC code commercial facilities in the State\
    \ or in an \nadjacent State. Sewage-treatment plants may maintain some information,\
    \ such as billing records, about self-supplied facilities \nthat release wastewater\
    \ to the plants. Withdrawals may be estimated by using this source if better information\
    \ is not available. \nThe larger commercial water-using facilities are institutions,\
    \ water parks, resorts, and military installations. If the domestic \npopulation\
    \ can be determined for military installations and institutions, then the withdrawals\
    \ should be categorized as public \nsupply with deliveries to domestic and commercial\
    \ users. \nSelected references that contain some commercial water-use coefficients\
    \ include Wolff and others (1975), Baumann and \nothers (1981), van der Leeden\
    \ and others (1990), LaTour (1991), Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. (1991), Bucca and Marella\
    \ (1992), and \nAdams (1993). Literature coefficients may be applied in areas\
    \ that have similar climate and socioeconomic factors to the area in \nwhich data\
    \ were collected in order to estimate water withdrawals. Information and data\
    \ on commercial water use are also avail-\nable from a study for California (Gleick\
    \ and others, 2003).\nDeliveries from Public Suppliers\nThe volume of water delivered\
    \ to commercial facilities is an optional data element, and may be obtained from\
    \ the public \nsupplier when compiling information about public-supply withdrawals.\
    \ Public suppliers may have in their billing systems the \nnumber of connections\
    \ and volume of water delivered to commercial users. If delivery data are available\
    \ by meter size rather \nthan by connection or use type, water suppliers may be\
    \ able to indicate the size of meters installed in commercial establishments \n\
    for their water system. In this case, the information may be used to separate\
    \ commercial deliveries from the public supply. If \n16  Guidelines for Preparation\
    \ of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\nspecific information is not available\
    \ for deliveries to commercial users, then an estimate of the percentage of total\
    \ water deliv-\nered to the commercial users can be used based on previous information\
    \ or requested from the public-water system. \nIf commercial-delivery data or\
    \ estimates are not available from the water supplier, then the delivery data\
    \ must be estimated \nby other methods. One estimation method is to apply a coefficient\
    \ based on data obtained from the commercial facility or the \npublic-water supplier.\
    \ Another method is to subtract the distribution loss and domestic use (possibly\
    \ calculated from population \nmultiplied by per capita use) and other uses (industrial,\
    \ power, public use) from the public-supply withdrawal. \nConsumptive Use\nConsumptive\
    \ use by commercial uses is an optional data element, and may be estimated for\
    \ all commercial users as a \npercentage of the combined self-supplied withdrawals\
    \ and public-supply deliveries of water. The best consumptive-use estimates \n\
    are usually obtained through contacts with commercial establishments that withdraw\
    \ the largest volume of water and have the \nlargest consumptive use. \nThe most\
    \ common method to estimate consumptive use is using coefficients. In 1990, State\
    \ estimates of coefficients of \ncommercial consumptive use ranged from 5 to 30\
    \ percent of withdrawals and deliveries (Solley and others, 1993). Coefficients\
    \ \nof consumptive use may be derived by subtracting releases from withdrawals\
    \ using data from commercial facilities that main-\ntain withdrawal and release\
    \ records. Consumptive-use coefficients determined for a commercial facility can\
    \ then be applied to \nsimilar facilities in the same area. \nReclaimed Wastewater\
    \ \nThe total use of reclaimed wastewater by commercial facilities is an optional\
    \ data element. The wastewater-treatment facil-\nity or the utility department\
    \ may be able to provide information about the use of reclaimed wastewater by\
    \ commercial facilities. \nIn many States, separate records are maintained on\
    \ further use of treated wastewater. \nIndustrial\nIndustrial water use includes\
    \ water used for such purposes as fabricating, processing, washing, diluting,\
    \ cooling, or trans-\nporting a product; incorporating water into a product; or\
    \ for sanitation, maintenance, or landscaping needs of a facility. Industrial\
    \ \nwater users are businesses classified in the SIC codes under construction\
    \ and manufacturing. Water supplies may be self-\nsupplied industrial withdrawals\
    \ derived from groundwater and (or) surface water, may be provided by a public-water\
    \ supplier \n(public-supply industrial deliveries), or may include water from\
    \ reclaimed wastewater. \nData Elements\nThe industrial water-use category consists\
    \ of mandatory, mandatory with null values allowed, and optional data elements.\
    \ \nData for the optional elements may be compiled and entered into AWUDS, but\
    \ will not be part of the national water-use analy-\nsis as published in the water-use\
    \ circular series. The optional data, however, will be available for other types\
    \ of water studies. \nReclaimed-wastewater use is a mandatory data element for\
    \ the industrial category. Zeros should be reported for counties where \nthe delivery\
    \ of reclaimed wastewater does not occur, but null values can be stored in AWUDS\
    \ for counties where the use of \nreclaimed wastewater is uncertain or unknown.\n\

    Compilation Techniques\nSelf-supplied industrial withdrawals tend to occur within\
    \ particular industry groups that require large amounts of water for \nfabricating,\
    \ processing, washing, diluting, cooling, or transporting a product or incorporating\
    \ water into a product. However, \nthere are exceptions in which the more water-use-intensive\
    \ industries are publicly supplied and the less water-use-intensive \nindustries\
    \ are self-supplied. Major industrial groups that historically have been self-supplied\
    \ include food and kindred products \n(SIC 2011–2099), paper and allied products\
    \ (SIC 2611–2679), chemicals and allied products (SIC 2812–2899), petroleum-refining\
    \ \nand petroleum-related industries (SIC 2911–2999), and primary metals industries\
    \ (SIC 3312–3399). Although these types of \nindustries historically have used\
    \ the most water per facility, the most important industry in any given county\
    \ may not fall into \none of these five groups. Therefore, it is important to\
    \ consider any industries outside these groups.\nConstructing a master list of\
    \ industrial facilities is fundamental to all of the compilation techniques. A\
    \ master list, at a \nminimum, consists of the names and locations of industries,\
    \ and sources of water. The information to build or update this list \nmay be\
    \ available from previous documentation, one or more State agencies, or from USGS\
    \ water-use databases. State reporting \nprograms and individual industries are\
    \ good sources of data. Reporting agencies have varying criteria for obtaining\
    \ industrial \nwater-use data. These criteria determine if withdrawals are permitted,\
    \ registered, or monitored; the trigger levels for reporting \nand the application\
    \ of the trigger level to groundwater or surface-water sources; and whether the\
    \ reporting is statewide or applies \nto selected counties or watersheds. If the\
    \ State agencies use a relatively large minimum water withdrawal rate as a reporting\
    \ \ncriterion, data for a substantial number of small industries may not be collected\
    \ or reported. Therefore, some needed facility \ninformation must be obtained\
    \ directly from the industry or be determined from other ancillary information.\n\
    Water Withdrawals\nThe self-supplied withdrawals at industrial facilities vary\
    \ depending on the size and type of industry. Water-withdrawal data \nmay be available\
    \ from the facility or from State or local agencies. Three general approaches\
    \ can be used to compile industrial \nwater-withdrawal data:\n1. \nAcquire site\
    \ information and withdrawal data for individual industries. If needed, focus\
    \ on industries with larger withdraw-\nals while striving for an adequate representation\
    \ of the withdrawals in each county.\n2. \nAcquire site information with ancillary\
    \ data on employment or production, and estimate water withdrawals by using water-\n\
    use coefficients. The coefficients are usually in the form of usage in gallons\
    \ per day per employee or per unit of product.\nIndustrial  19\n3. \nCombine the\
    \ two approaches by acquiring industrial facility information and water withdrawals\
    \ for the larger industries \nand using these data to develop water-use coefficients\
    \ to estimate withdrawals for smaller industries.\nIndustrial water information\
    \ may be acquired through telephone contacts, site visits, or surveys sent out\
    \ by cooperating \nagencies. The level of detail obtained depends on the availability\
    \ of the information and the necessary resources available to col-\nlect the data.\
    \ Confidentiality should be considered. Useful data to acquire include the following:\n\
    • Facility name, mailing address, physical plant facility address.\n• County.\n\
    • Contact name, title, telephone and fax number, and e-mail.\n• Industry description\
    \ or principal products.\n• SIC codes—primary and secondary.\n• Estimated annual\
    \ quantity of product produced.\n• Total number of employees.\n• Number of groundwater\
    \ sources, aquifer names, and number and depth of well(s).\n• Number of surface-water\
    \ sources and names of streams or water bodies.\n• Latitude and longitude of wells\
    \ or intakes.\n• Maps of facility and water intakes.\n• Name of public water-supply\
    \ sources.\n• Amounts of water withdrawn and time period of withdrawal for each\
    \ source.\n• Amount or percentage of total withdrawal that is freshwater or saline\
    \ water, groundwater or surface water.\n• Method of determining or estimating\
    \ water withdrawals.\n• Percentage of total or amount of water used for cooling,\
    \ processing, sanitary use, boiler feed, power generation, or other \namount of\
    \ water recycled or reused.\n• Wastewater discharge—average amount of discharge\
    \ or percentage relative to withdrawals.\n• Number of days operating each year.\n\
    • Average number of hours of operation each day.\n• Approximate age of the facility.\n\
    • Confidentiality statement, if needed.\nWater-Use Coefficients\nIndustrial water\
    \ withdrawals can be estimated by using water-use coefficients and ancillary data\
    \ such as numbers of \nemployees, units of production, or annual sales if reported\
    \ data are not available. Reported water-use data from the largest indus-\ntries\
    \ can be used to develop locally adjusted water-use coefficients to estimate withdrawals\
    \ for smaller industries of the same \ntype.\nThe use of coefficients to estimate\
    \ industrial water use is imprecise because of the variability in factors affecting\
    \ water use \nby industries. The specific processes, age of the facility, cost\
    \ of the water and wastewater treatment, and amount of recycling all \ncontribute\
    \ to the amounts of water needed by an industry. These factors should be considered\
    \ when using national coefficients \nor when developing and adjusting local coefficients\
    \ for industries not surveyed. The coefficients and the source of coefficients\
    \ to \nestimate industrial water use should always be well documented.\n20  Guidelines\
    \ for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\nDeliveries from Public\
    \ Suppliers\nWater deliveries to industrial facilities is an optional data element\
    \ and may be obtained from public suppliers when compil-\ning information about\
    \ public-supply withdrawals. Public suppliers may have water sales information\
    \ concerning the number of \nconnections, use, and volume of water delivered to\
    \ industrial users. If metered delivery data are available by meter size, public\
    \ \nsuppliers should be able to indicate, for their system, the size of meters\
    \ installed in industrial establishments. If the information \nis not available,\
    \ the water-utility operator may be able to provide some estimate of the percentage\
    \ of total water delivered to \nindustrial users. \nIf data or estimates on deliveries\
    \ for industrial purposes are not available from water suppliers, the data must\
    \ be estimated \nby other methods. One method is to subtract the estimated distribution\
    \ loss and domestic use (possibly calculated from popula-\ntion multiplied by\
    \ per capita use) and other uses (commercial, power, public use) from total deliveries.\
    \ Please refer to other \nsections in these guidelines for more detailed information\
    \ on individual category calculation techniques. \nConsumptive Use\nConsumptive\
    \ use by industrial uses is an optional data element, and if computed must be\
    \ estimated for the total of self-\nsupplied and public-supply industrial water.\
    \ Consumptive-use estimates could be determined from information obtained through\
    \ \ncontacts with industrial establishments that withdraw or consume the largest\
    \ volumes of water. If no other data are available, \nestimates of consumptive\
    \ use by SIC can be inferred from information available in the literature.\nIf\
    \ delivery and release information are available for industrial facilities, then\
    \ consumptive-use information could be esti-\nmated by the difference between\
    \ the deliveries and releases. The consumptive-use coefficients determined may\
    \ be applied to \nsimilar facilities (same SIC) in the same geographic area. \n\
    Allocation of Water Withdrawals by Source\nThe industrial water-use withdrawals\
    \ by source are mandatory data elements, and should be allocated to the county\
    \ in \nwhich the withdrawal occurs. If the source, location, or quality of the\
    \ water are not known, the allocation of the industrial water \nwithdrawals by\
    \ source and quality can be estimated by discussion with local or State agencies\
    \ or by combining local knowledge \nof water sources and applying spatial analysis.\
    \ Determining whether water is freshwater or saline water also may require some\
    \ \nknowledge of the type of industrial activity. Spatial analysis may indicate\
    \ the possibility of tapping into a saline water source; \nhowever, the industrial\
    \ process for which the water is needed may require freshwater. Seawater and estuary-bay\
    \ water are the \nprimary sources of saline surface water in the United States.\
    \ Generally, because the use of saline groundwater for industrial use \nis both\
    \ specific and unique, the use of saline groundwater is generally known within\
    \ the State. Saline water is water that contains \n1,000 milligrams per liter\
    \ or more of dissolved solids.\nThermoelectric Power \nThermoelectric-power water\
    \ use is the amount of water used in the process of generating electricity from\
    \ heat by steam-\ndriven turbines. Thermoelectric power plants use fossil fuels,\
    \ nuclear fission, solar energy, and geothermal energy to heat water \ninto steam\
    \ which then turns turbines to generate electricity. After powering the turbines,\
    \ the steam is then cooled and condensed \nback to water through the transfer\
    \ of heat to cooling water flowing through a condenser (heat exchanger). The condensed\
    \ water \nis then routed back to the heat source where the cycle begins again.\
    \ Although some water, in the form of steam, is used to turn \nthe turbines and\
    \ generate electricity, the predominant use of thermoelectric-power water is in\
    \ the cooling process. Most water for \nthermoelectric use is self-supplied from\
    \ freshwater or saline surface-water sources. Smaller quantities are derived from\
    \ ground-\nwater sources or provided by public suppliers. The water used to create\
    \ steam to drive the turbines must be freshwater; however, \ncooling water may\
    \ be fresh or saline. All thermoelectric power plants are classified as SIC 4911\
    \ and as NAICS codes 221112 \nthrough 221118, excluding 221115 which is wind electric\
    \ power generation.\nThe amount of water withdrawn and consumed at thermoelectric\
    \ power plants primarily depends on the type of cooling \nsystem at the plant.\
    \ The two general types of cooling are once-through (open-loop) cooling and recirculating\
    \ (closed-loop) cool-\ning. For the compilation, water withdrawal and consumptive\
    \ use will be compiled for each type of cooling system and will be \nstored in\
    \ AWUDS in units of million gallons per day. \nOnce-through cooling systems withdraw\
    \ large amounts of water because the water is not recirculated within the facility.\
    \ \nThe water is withdrawn from a surface-water source, circulated through the\
    \ condenser, and then returned to a surface-water body \nat a higher temperature.\
    \ Withdrawal for a once-through cooling system is the amount of water that flows\
    \ through the condenser, \nThermoelectric Power   21\nand consumptive use is the\
    \ amount of water lost through evaporation from the surface-water body due to\
    \ the heated return flow. \nThis technology is common in older facilities but\
    \ generally is not used for new facilities because of increasingly restrictive\
    \ ther-\nmal and other water-quality requirements for return water.\nRecirculating\
    \ cooling systems include cooling ponds and wet cooling towers. They recirculate\
    \ water within the facility, \nthus reducing the overall water withdrawal requirement.\
    \ Withdrawals for recirculating systems (also known as “makeup” water) \nreplace\
    \ cooling water lost to evaporation, blowdown, drift, and leakage, and are much\
    \ less than the water flowing through the \ncondenser. Cooling ponds are typically\
    \ shallow reservoirs with large surface areas that receive heated water from the\
    \ condenser. \nThe water is cooled by evaporation, which is consumptive use, and\
    \ reused in the cooling process. In cooling towers, heated \nwater from the condenser\
    \ flows through a volume of fill within a tower while air flows through the same\
    \ volume. Water is cooled \nby evaporation, which is consumptive use, and is collected\
    \ in basins beneath the fill where it is piped back to the condenser for \nreuse.\
    \ Cooling towers are the most common cooling-system type of newer power plants,\
    \ especially where water resources are \nlimited, or where local regulations prohibit\
    \ the release of heated return flow water.\nNet electrical generation, the amount\
    \ of electricity that is generated, transmitted, and distributed for consumer\
    \ use, will also \nbe compiled for each type of cooling system. The value will\
    \ be stored in AWUDS in units of gigawatthours. A gigawatthour is \nequivalent\
    \ to 1,000 megawatthours or 1 billion watthours.\nAnother type of thermoelectric\
    \ plant is the combined heat and power (CHP or cogeneration) plant. A cogeneration\
    \ plant \nproduces electricity and heat simultaneously, and uses the heat for\
    \ industrial or commercial purposes. Many, but not all, cogen-\neration plants\
    \ are industrial or commercial facilities. An example is a university with a power\
    \ plant on campus that generates \nelectricity and heats the campus buildings.\
    \ On the other hand, some are independent power producers that identify as utilities\
    \ \nand sell power to the electrical grid. If the data from a cogeneration facility\
    \ are sufficient to identify water used in power gen-\neration separately from\
    \ the water used for industrial or commercial purposes, then the water used in\
    \ power generation and the \npower generated are compiled with other county thermoelectric-power\
    \ water-use data.\nWater-use data for geothermal power plants are reported in\
    \ much the same way as recirculating cooling systems at ther-\nmoelectric plants.\
    \ The make-up water withdrawn from a geothermal source is reported but the recirculating\
    \ water in the plant is \nnot reported. The two primary types of geothermal power\
    \ plants are the dual-flash plant and the binary plant. In the dual-flash \nsystem,\
    \ superheated water (above 212 degrees Fahrenheit) is released from pressure near\
    \ the surface, where it “flashes” into \nsteam in a separator. The water that\
    \ does not turn to steam is sent to a second separator where the pressure is further\
    \ reduced \nand another portion of it flashes to steam. The steam from the separators\
    \ is directed to the turbines. The steam turns the turbines, \nthen is cooled\
    \ and condensed into water and injected back into the geothermal reservoir. Water\
    \ use is reported for uses such as \nmaintenance of the geothermal systems (makeup\
    \ or maintenance water).\nIn the binary system, or heat exchange system, the geothermal\
    \ water is pumped through a heat exchanger and injected back \ninto the geothermal\
    \ reservoir. The heat exchanger contains a second fluid that has a low boiling\
    \ point. The heat from the geother-\nmal water is transferred to this second fluid\
    \ making it boil and vaporize. The vapor that pushes against the turbine blades\
    \ is con-\ndensed back to a fluid and recycled through the heat exchanger. The\
    \ binary system method enables the use of lower temperature \ngeothermal water\
    \ to produce electric power. The water pumped from and reinjected into the geothermal\
    \ reservoir is not reported \nas use. Water use at this type of system is reported\
    \ for any maintenance water.\nData Elements\nThe category of thermoelectric power\
    \ consists of the following mandatory and optional data elements. Data for the\
    \ optional \nelements may be compiled and entered into AWUDS, but will not be\
    \ part of the national water-use analysis as published in the \nwater-use circular\
    \ series. The optional data, however, will be available for other types of water\
    \ studies.\nMandatory\n• Groundwater withdrawals, once-through cooling, freshwater,\

    \ withdrawals and consumption should be the starting point for planning the data\
    \ collection for the current compilation. The \nprevious documentation for the\
    \ thermoelectric-power category may contain the location and types of electronic\
    \ and paper files; \nagency and contact information; agency and internet resources;\
    \ and methods, techniques, and coefficients used to collect or \nestimate data.\
    \ \nUSGS National Water-Use Science Project (NWUSP)\nThe USGS NWUSP will provide\
    \ a data file of model-estimated average daily water withdrawal and consumptive\
    \ use, along \nwith verified cooling-system types, for every thermoelectric plant\
    \ in the United States, including cogeneration (or CHP) plants \nthat are identified\
    \ as utilities according to SIC/NAICS codes. The USGS method for estimating water\
    \ use at thermoelectric \npower plants is based on linked heat and water budgets\
    \ constrained by plant generation technologies, cooling system technolo-\ngies,\
    \ and environmental variables such as air temperature, water temperature, and\
    \ wind speed. In addition to the “best” model-\nestimated average daily water\
    \ withdrawals and consumptive use, plant-specific plausible ranges of withdrawals\
    \ and consumptive \nuse will also be provided. These ranges provide a QA/QC tool\

    www3.epa.gov/enviro/facts/pcs-icis/search.html.\nCompilation Techniques\nThe recommended\
    \ approach for compiling data for thermoelectric power is to use site-specific\
    \ water withdrawal, consump-\ntive use, and power-generation data. Site-specific\
    \ data can come from the NWUSP-provided USGS model-estimated data, or \nthe federally\
    \ reported EIA data. Data could also be collected from other sources such as State\
    \ agencies, or obtained directly \nfrom plant operators. Water withdrawal and\
    \ consumptive-use data can be obtained from the USGS model-estimated data, the\
    \ \nEIA-reported data, State agencies, or plant operators. However, net electrical\
    \ generation data will come from EIA and will be \nprovided, but could also possibly\
    \ be obtained through State agencies and plant operators. State agencies that\
    \ administer water \nrights or monitor water use may have water withdrawal and\
    \ consumptive-use information. The State agency that is responsible \nfor compliance\
    \ with EPA’s Clean Water Act is an important source for this information.\nEPA\
    \ administers the PCS-ICIS database, which was designed to track permit, compliance,\
    \ and enforcement status data for \nthe NPDES program under the Clean Water Act.\
    \ An NPDES permit is required for all point discharges into U.S. waterways. The\
    \ \nPCS-ICIS database contains descriptive information on major power-generating\
    \ facilities, their location, and monthly return \nflows. The NPDES permit application\
    \ and the permit itself usually include detailed descriptions of the plant that\
    \ provide basic \ninformation on all the sources of supply for the plant, the\
    \ different ways in which water is used in the plant, and water included \nin\
    \ the reported discharge values.\nWater-use and power-generation data may also\
    \ be collected by contacting the individual power plant facility. If the con-\n\
    tact person for a power plant facility is not known, a good place to start is\
    \ the person at the plant who prepares the Discharge \nMonitoring Reports (DMRs)\
    \ for EPA. DMRs contain information on volume discharged from all pipes in the\
    \ facility and can be \ncompared to the permit or permit application as to the\
    \ source of the water and how it was used. The following selected terminol-\n\
    ogy may help in conversations with plant personnel—blowdown, capacity, drift,\
    \ and makeup water. These terms are defined in \nthe Glossary.\nPower-generation\
    \ data can be used to estimate thermoelectric-power water withdrawals. A coefficient\
    \ to estimate the gal-\nlons of water used per unit-hour of electricity generated\
    \ is calculated by using information on water withdrawals and power \ngeneration\
    \ from plants of similar age, design, and cooling methods. This coefficient then\
    \ can be multiplied by the amount of \nelectricity generated during a specified\
    \ time period by the plant for which withdrawals are being estimated. Coefficients\
    \ ideally \nare derived by using the gross power produced, which is the net electrical\
    \ generation plus the amount of electricity used within \nthe power plant itself.\
    \ Monthly gross and net power generation, in megawatthours, is available in the\
    \ EIA-923 database. The in-\nplant electricity use will not be part of the NWUSP\
    \ derivative data file provided to the study chiefs.\nQuality Assurance/Quality\
    \ Control\nOne of the most important aspects of compiling thermoelectric water-use\
    \ data is thorough QA/QC review of the data. The \nNWUSP-provided USGS model-estimated\
    \ data, with plant-specific plausible ranges of withdrawals and consumptive use,\
    \ pro-\nvide a QA/QC tool with which to compare reported and other estimated thermoelectric\
    \ water-use data. If reported or estimated \ndata for a plant are outside the\
    \ plausible range of withdrawal or consumptive use, further investigation is needed.\
    \ Similarly, if \ndata are outliers in comparison to data from previous years,\
    \ further investigation is needed. Contact the source of the data for \npossible\
    \ explanations for data variability. Also, keep USGS definitions of thermoelectric\
    \ withdrawal and consumptive use in \nmind. Other sources may define these terms\
    \ differently; the compilation requires USGS definitions to be followed. Data\
    \ from \nmultiple sources may be used to achieve the most accurate estimates of\
    \ thermoelectric water use. Document QA/QC methods as \nwell as compilation methods\
    \ and data sources. \nMining\nPrior to 1985, mining withdrawals were categorized\
    \ as an industrial use. In 1985, mining became a separate water-use \ncategory.\
    \ Beginning in 2005 and continuing through the current compilation (2015), estimates\
    \ for mining withdrawals will be \nprovided by the NWUSP for all States. USGS\
    \ WSCs still have the option of reporting their own estimates for mining water\
    \ use.\nThe mining water-use category is water used for the extraction of minerals:\
    \ solids, such as coal and ores; liquids, such as \ncrude petroleum; and gases,\
    \ such as natural gas. The category includes quarrying, milling (crushing, screening,\
    \ washing, and \nMining  25\nflotation), and other operations as part of a mining\
    \ activity. It does not include the processing of raw materials, such as smelting\
    \ \nores, refining petroleum, and slurry pipeline operations; these are considered\
    \ industrial uses of water. Water that is pumped and \nthen reinjected for secondary-oil\
    \ recovery is considered a water use and should be included in the mining category.\
    \ \nWater pumped from mines (dewatering) or produced as a byproduct of primary\
    \ oil production is not included if the water \nis drained and discharged, i.e.,\
    \ transferred from one place to another (usually groundwater to surface water)\
    \ without being put to \nuse. If water is put to some beneficial use such as washing\
    \ or dampening roads for dust control, then the water is categorized as a \nmining\
    \ use. \nFour major SIC groups account for most of the water used in this category:\
    \ \n• SIC 10, Metal mining.\n• SIC 12, Coal mining.\n• SIC 13, Oil and gas extraction.\n\
    • SIC 14, Mining and quarrying of nonmetallic minerals, except fuels.\nData Elements\n\
    The category of mining consists of the following mandatory and optional data elements.\
    \ Data for the optional elements \nmay be compiled and entered into AWUDS, but\
    \ will not be part of the national water-use analysis as published in the water-use\
    \ \ncircular series. The optional data, however, will be available for other types\
    \ of water studies.\nMandatory\n• Self-supplied groundwater withdrawals (fresh),\

    \ following sources. Other sources may be \navailable within each State. \n• Individual\
    \ facilities (by personal visits and [or] cooperator surveys).\n• State agency\

    \ activities.\n• State agency that permits mining activities.\n• State agency\
    \ for economic development.\n• State geological survey.\n• U.S. Bureau of Mines.\n\
    • Universities, departments of geology and mines.\n26  Guidelines for Preparation\
    \ of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\nCompilation Techniques\nThe estimation\
    \ methods described in this section are not all encompassing. The methods described\
    \ offer consistent tech-\nniques to estimate mining water use if better methods\
    \ are not available. Other methods used to estimate water use for this sector\
    \ \nshould be fully documented for the compilation.\nThe NWUSP estimates are based\
    \ on production amounts and water-use coefficients. The classification of sources\
    \ as surface \nwater or groundwater will be estimated based on the percentages\
    \ reported in previous compilations unless better information is \navailable.\
    \ Methods used in the national estimates for mining water use are described in\
    \ Lovelace (2009c).\nWithdrawals\nThe withdrawals by mining facilities will vary\
    \ depending on the size and type of mining operation. The amount of water \nwithdrawn\
    \ may be available from the facility or from State or local agencies. It may be\
    \ possible to develop coefficients such as \nwater used per ton produced or volume\
    \ of sales from facilities with the same SIC code that have water-use information\
    \ avail-\nable. Major mines should be contacted to determine water withdrawals,\
    \ water use at the plant, and the current source of water. \nConsumptive Use\n\
    Consumptive-use estimates are optional but they should be based on information\
    \ obtained through contacts with those min-\ning establishments that withdraw\
    \ or consume the largest volumes of water. In 1990, State estimates of mining\
    \ consumptive use \nranged from 10 to 100 percent of the withdrawals, depending\
    \ on the type of mining activity (Solley and others, 1993). Con-\nsumptive-use\
    \ coefficients may be estimated by calculating the difference between water intake\
    \ and water discharges listed by \nSIC and region. The 1982 Census of Mineral\
    \ Industries publication series provides dated information that may guide consump-\n\
    tive-use if more recent data are not available (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1985).\
    \ Quan (1988) used sales and volume production \nto calculate coefficients for\
    \ water consumption in the domestic non-fuel minerals industry. Consumptive-use\
    \ rates determined at \na mining facility may be applied to similar facilities\
    \ in a geographic area. \nReclaimed Wastewater\nIf information is available, the\
    \ total use (fresh and saline) of reclaimed wastewater by mining facilities should\
    \ be reported. \nIf the wastewater-treatment facility or the utility department\
    \ cannot provide information about the use of reclaimed wastewater \nby mining\
    \ facilities, then the larger individual mines should be contacted.\nLivestock\n\
    Prior to 1985, livestock and rural domestic withdrawals were combined under Rural\
    \ Uses. Beginning in 2005, withdrawals \nfor livestock and aquaculture were estimated\
    \ by the NWUSP for all States. The estimates for livestock water withdrawals will\
    \ \ncontinue to be provided by the NWUSP, though WSCs still have the option of\
    \ reporting their own withdrawal estimates.\nNational estimates will be made based\
    \ on animal populations or some other measure of production and coefficients.\
    \ The \nclassification of sources as surface water or groundwater and as saline\
    \ water or freshwater will be made based on previous com-\npilations unless better\
    \ information is available.\nLivestock water use is water associated with livestock\
    \ watering, feedlots, dairy operations, and other on-farm needs. Live-\nstock\
    \ includes dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep and lambs, goats, hogs and pigs, horses,\
    \ and poultry. Other livestock water uses \ninclude cooling of facilities for\
    \ the animals and products, dairy sanitation and wash down of facilities, animal\
    \ waste-disposal \nsystems, and incidental water losses. All withdrawals are considered\
    \ self-supplied. The livestock category excludes on-farm \ndomestic use, lawn\
    \ and garden watering, and irrigation water use. \nEstimates of livestock withdrawals\
    \ are primarily derived by using animal population data and water-use coefficients,\
    \ in gal-\nlons per head per day for each animal type, because few State agencies\
    \ require livestock operations to report water withdrawals. \nAnimal population\
    \ data generally are available from State agricultural agencies and the U.S. Department\
    \ of Agriculture (USDA) \nNASS (available at http://www.nass.usda.gov/). Coefficients\
    \ vary by State and, for many States, are provided by agricultural \nextension\
    \ agents or water-permitting agencies. Coefficients may reflect facility maintenance\
    \ needs and effects of climate on ani-\nmal watering. Many of the 2010 withdrawals\
    \ for livestock were estimated according to methods described by Lovelace (2009a),\
    \ \nusing livestock population data compiled for the NASS Census of Agriculture\
    \ and water-use coefficients.\nAquaculture  27\nData Elements\nMandatory\n• Groundwater\
    \ withdrawals (freshwater), by county.\n• Surface-water withdrawals (freshwater),\
    \ by county.\nOptional\n• Consumptive use (fresh).\nCompilation Techniques\nLivestock\
    \ water use is determined by stock numbers and production practices. To estimate\
    \ withdrawals, it is first necessary \nto determine the number of animals in a\
    \ county or hydrologic unit by animal class. Livestock water use is calculated\
    \ by multi-\nplying the number of animals per geographic area by a coefficient\
    \ in gallons per day per head for each different animal class. \nCoefficient values\
    \ for different animal classes can be obtained at State agricultural colleges\
    \ and from many county extension \nservice offices. The distribution of State\
    \ totals of the number and class of animals and farms may be modified based on\
    \ local \nknowledge. If coefficient values are used to estimate water use for\
    \ livestock or poultry operations that raise more than one crop \nduring the reporting\
    \ period, care must be taken to ensure that the coefficient is applied to the\
    \ correct head count for the full \noperation. The time-span of a livestock feeding\
    \ operation or poultry operations for meat or egg production and the average head\
    \ \ncount can be used to estimate total populations to estimate water use.\nThe\
    \ distribution of the estimated livestock withdrawals between groundwater and\
    \ surface-water sources may be more dif-\nficult to estimate. The distribution\
    \ of withdrawals by source can be especially difficult in States where surface-water\
    \ sources are \nused during late spring, summer, and fall, and groundwater sources\
    \ are used throughout the year. The distribution by source can \nbe made in direct\
    \ proportion to the amount of time each source is used if seasonal consumption\
    \ data are not available. County \nextension agents and personnel at an agricultural\
    \ college, experiment station, or research center may be able to provide informa-\n\
    tion about seasonal water sources used by animals.\nAquaculture\nAquaculture water\
    \ use is associated with raising organisms that live in water—such as finfish\
    \ and shellfish—for food, res-\ntoration, conservation, or sport. Major aquaculture\
    \ operations in the United States include alligator, crawfish, catfish, and trout\
    \ \nfarms. Aquaculture production occurs under controlled feeding, sanitation,\
    \ and harvesting procedures primarily in ponds, flow-\nthrough raceways, and,\
    \ to a lesser extent, cages, net pens, and tanks. Aquaculture ponds, raceways,\
    \ and tanks usually require the \nwithdrawal or diversion of water from a ground\
    \ or surface source. Most water withdrawn or diverted for aquaculture production\
    \ \nis used to maintain pond levels and (or) water quality. Water typically is\
    \ added for maintenance of levels, oxygenation, tempera-\nture control, and flushing\
    \ of wastes. Instream use of water for aquaculture generally is not considered\
    \ a withdrawal unless water \nis being diverted or used for a confined instream\
    \ operation, such as flow-through fish raceways.\nPrior to 1985, aquaculture withdrawals\
    \ were part of the self-supplied industrial use category. In 1985, total livestock\
    \ use \nwas made up of withdrawals for livestock and withdrawals for “animal specialties,”\
    \ which, among other things, included aqua-\nculture. Beginning in 2005 and continuing\
    \ with the current compilation (2015), withdrawals for aquaculture will be estimated\
    \ by \nthe NWUSP for all States. Details on the methods used in estimating aquaculture\
    \ water use are described in Lovelace (2009b). \nUSGS WSCs will have the option\
    \ of reporting their own withdrawal estimates. The percentages of surface water\
    \ and ground-\nwater and of saline water and freshwater will be calculated based\
    \ on percentages reported for the previous compilations unless \nbetter information\
    \ is available.\n28  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for\
    \ 2015\nData Elements\nThe aquaculture category consists of the following mandatory\
    \ and optional data elements. Data for the optional elements \nmay be compiled\
    \ and entered into AWUDS, but will not be part of the national water-use analysis\
    \ as published in the water-use \ncircular series. The optional data, however,\
    \ will be available for other types of water studies.\nMandatory\n• Groundwater\
    \ withdrawals, freshwater, by county.\n• Surface-water withdrawals, freshwater,\
    \ by county.\nOptional\n• Groundwater withdrawals, saline water, by county.\n\
    • Surface-water withdrawals, saline water, by county.\n• Consumptive use, freshwater,\
    \ by county.\n• Consumptive use, saline water, by county.\nSources of Information\n\
    If the aquaculture estimates will be determined by the USGS WSC, the documentation\
    \ for the previous compilations should \nbe the starting point for planning the\
    \ data collection and compilation. The documentation for the previous compilation\
    \ may \ncontain the location and types of electronic and paper files; agency and\
    \ contact information; agency and internet resources; and \nmethods, techniques,\
    \ and coefficients used to collect or estimate data. Additional information concerning\
    \ aquaculture water use \nmay be obtained from the following sources. Other sources\
    \ of information may be available in each State. \nPossible contacts for aquaculture\
    \ are listed as follows. Data from these sources can range from reported water\
    \ withdrawals \nto coefficients and ancillary data that can be used to estimate\
    \ water withdrawals. Multiple datasets can be used to determine the \nbest estimates\
    \ and can be used during the QA/QC review.\n• State agencies that administer water\
    \ rights, allocate water to users, or collect water-use data.\n• State agencies\
    \ that issue permits for the discharge of water.\n• State agencies that regulate\
    \ or license aquaculture.\n• State department of agriculture.\n• State and county\
    \ planning departments.\n• Local or county agriculture extension offices.\nCompilation\
    \ Techniques\nLittle information is available on total water use by fish farms,\
    \ probably because the water is used only as a vehicle to raise \nor hold the\
    \ fish and a large portion is still available for other uses. It is best to obtain\
    \ local information from fish farm operations \nin each State. Coefficients to\
    \ estimate water use by fish may be expressed in terms of water volume per facility,\
    \ water volume \nper pond surface area, or water volume or pond surface area per\
    \ pound of fish produced (Trotta, 1988). Water use by fish farms \nis generally\
    \ equated to amount of “make-up” water necessary to maintain pond water levels.\
    \ Loss of water is due to leakage and \nevaporation.\nEvaporation and leakage\
    \ from ponds and raceways are major consumptive uses of water by aquaculture.\
    \ In these cases, any \nreplacement withdrawals are considered makeup water, and\
    \ would equal consumptive use.\nIrrigation  29\nIrrigation\nWater for irrigation\
    \ is applied by an irrigation system to sustain growth in agricultural and horticultural\
    \ vegetation and \nalso is applied for the purposes of pre-irrigation, frost protection,\
    \ weed control, field preparation, crop cooling, harvesting, dust \nsuppression,\
    \ leaching of salts from the root zone, and the application of chemicals (SIC\
    \ 0111–0191 and 4971). Irrigation with-\ndrawals include conveyance losses. Irrigation\
    \ of golf courses (SIC 7992 and 7997), parks, nurseries, turf farms, and cemeteries\
    \ \nand other self-supplied landscape-watering uses also are included in the irrigation\
    \ category. Water use in this category may be \nwithdrawn by the irrigator or\
    \ delivered from irrigation companies, irrigation districts, irrigation cooperatives,\
    \ or governmental \nentities. The irrigation category does not include potable\
    \ water purchased from a public supply for use by golf courses. Instead, \npublic-supply\
    \ deliveries of potable water for golf courses, parks, cemeteries, and others\
    \ are either commercial deliveries or pub-\nlic-use water. Non-potable water provided\
    \ for outdoor irrigation at publicly owned golf courses may be reported as golf\
    \ course \nirrigation, but if so, should not be included in public-supply withdrawals\
    \ to avoid double-counting the water as public supply.\nThe number of irrigated\
    \ acres by type of irrigation system—sprinkler, surface (flood), and microirrigation\
    \ are manda-\ntory data elements in the irrigation category. Reclaimed-wastewater\
    \ use is also a mandatory data element, however, zeros are \nreported for counties\
    \ where the delivery of reclaimed wastewater does not occur, and null values can\
    \ be stored for counties \nwhere the use of reclaimed wastewater is uncertain\
    \ or unknown. Consumptive use of water by irrigation is a mandatory data ele-\n\
    ment and includes the water incorporated into the crops or turf, evaporated from\
    \ soils or transpired from plants, or otherwise not \navailable for immediate\
    \ use, but does not include conveyance loss. \nFor the compilation, States may\
    \ divide total irrigation water use into crop irrigation and golf course irrigation.\
    \ If the irriga-\ntion is divided, all other landscape irrigation is included\
    \ with crop irrigation. If irrigation is divided in this manner, county-level\
    \ \ntotals for crop and golf course irrigation are mandatory where applicable,\
    \ and total irrigation water withdrawals are automati-\ncally calculated as the\
    \ sum of the two subcategories by AWUDS for report tables. If irrigation withdrawals\
    \ are not divided into \ncrop and golf course withdrawals, then all irrigation\
    \ is reported as total withdrawals and may include both crop irrigation and \n\
    irrigation for golf courses.\nData Elements\nThe category of irrigation consists\
    \ of the following mandatory, mandatory but null values allowed, and optional\
    \ data ele-\nments. Data for the optional elements may be compiled and entered\
    \ into AWUDS, but will not be part of the national water-use \nanalysis. The optional\
    \ data, however, will be available for other types of water studies.\nMandatory\n\

    \ withdrawals and reclaimed-wastewater use are compiled according to the county\
    \ in which the withdrawals \nor diversions occur. The number of acres irrigated\
    \ is counted where the irrigation water is applied. In most cases, irrigation\
    \ water \nis applied close to where it is withdrawn or diverted; in some cases,\
    \ the irrigation water is transported long distances through \ncanals. Problems\
    \ in estimating irrigation water use include\n• Unknown number of irrigated acres.\n\
    • Possibility of single or multiple cropping patterns.\n• Possibility of multiple\
    \ sources of water: surface water, groundwater, or reclaimed wastewater.\n• The\
    \ effect of age and design on application rates for irrigation systems.\n• Unexpected\
    \ seasonal irrigation needs such as frost protection or harvesting.\n• Gap in\
    \ permitted amounts compared to used amounts.\n• Censoring of data for privacy\
    \ reasons.\n• Spatial scale (watershed, irrigation district, etc.) of primary-source\
    \ data compared to the needed county-scale data for the \ncompilation.\nDirect\
    \ methods for compiling information on irrigation withdrawals and irrigated acres\
    \ include use of reported data, sur-\nveys, and personal contact. Indirect approaches\
    \ for estimating withdrawals include calculation of crop water needs and statistical\
    \ \nsampling. Data on irrigated acres by crop type and golf course, coupled with\
    \ irrigation system type, are used in most estimation \nmethods for determining\
    \ withdrawals.\n32  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for\
    \ 2015\nReported Data\nSome States require individual water users or water-right\
    \ holders to measure and report their withdrawals and irrigated \nacreages for\
    \ each well or surface-water diversion. Reported withdrawal data that can be assigned\
    \ an accurate location can be \naggregated to a county, aquifer, or HUC and are\
    \ considered to be good quality. Other sources of reported data may yield partial\
    \ \ncoverage of irrigation use. USGS cooperative studies may include measurement\
    \ of site-specific data in local areas within a State. \nIrrigation districts\
    \ or other agencies may own water rights and distribute water to users; these\
    \ entities usually measure withdraw-\nals and deliveries. Watermasters may have\
    \ been assigned to measure or compile measured withdrawals and deliveries in some\
    \ \nareas, in which case they are excellent sources of data.\nReported measurements\
    \ are the most defensible data; however, the completeness of reported data varies\
    \ among States. \nBefore using data that are reported to or by other Federal,\
    \ State, and local agencies, it is important to understand the level of \ncompleteness,\
    \ the degree of accuracy, and the amount of QA/QC review given to data. USGS water-use\
    \ study chiefs need to \nverify whether the data are based on full and complete\
    \ enumerations, like a census, or are statistically based, like the NASS data.\
    \ \nReported crop acreages may include all crop acreages or just irrigated acreages.\
    \ Irrigated acreages and water deliveries may be \nreported for an area managed\
    \ by a particular agency, or for an entire county. Some data may be censored for\
    \ privacy reasons in \nareas with few irrigators. Reported withdrawals and acreage\
    \ data need to be reviewed for errors, either by the reporting agency \nor by\
    \ the USGS water-use study chief. Knowing the level of QA/QC review for data that\
    \ are reported by other agencies may \nprevent calculations that are based on\
    \ incorrect assumptions.\nSurveys and Personal Contact\nAnother method of estimating\
    \ irrigation water use is by a local survey conducted by a cooperating agency.\
    \ Surveys that are \nconducted by the USGS are discouraged, but where used, must\
    \ comply with the requirements of the 1995 Paper Reduction Act. \nIdeally, survey\
    \ forms include a complete background about why the information is being requested,\
    \ how it will be used, and by \nwhom. Other important components of the survey\
    \ are (1) a concise description of the requested data, (2) a contact name and\
    \ \nphone number to direct questions to, and (3) a desired completion date. In\
    \ any case, efficient collection and processing of survey \ndata can be best achieved\
    \ if the survey forms are short and easy for the user to complete. Typically,\
    \ other State and local agen-\ncies distribute surveys, and the data are shared\
    \ with the USGS.\nIt is important to obtain accurate data on water users who use\
    \ great amounts of water; these users typically have more data \navailable than\
    \ water users who use lesser amounts of water. When developing survey lists, data\
    \ sources such as the USDA’s \nCensus of Agriculture can be used to target counties\
    \ with the water users who use great amount of water. Some of the most ben-\n\
    eficial survey information includes the following:\n• Total irrigated acreage.\n\
    • Crop and pasture acreage.\n• Type and efficiency of irrigation system(s).\n\
    • Quantity or flow rate of water by source.\n• Irrigation scheduling and frequency.\n\
    • Number of irrigation wells.\n• Total depth of well(s).\n• Capacity of well(s).\n\
    • Identification of the aquifer or aquifer system.\n• Total annual energy usage.\n\
    • Power consumption coefficient(s), if known.\nOther useful data include information\
    \ on crop water shortages, acres harvested and yields by crop, energy sources,\
    \ water \nand agricultural management practices, and any agricultural resources\
    \ that generally are contacted when the irrigator needs \nadditional guidance.\n\
    Irrigation  33\nEstimates of Crop Water Needs\nA commonly used method to estimate\
    \ irrigation withdrawals involves calculating consumptive use for irrigated crops\
    \ by \nusing crop water-consumption coefficients for several crops and system\
    \ types (see U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1970, 1976, \n1997, 2002; Allen and\
    \ others, 1998). The amount of water consumed by crops, plus additional water\
    \ used in conveyance or \nneeded for other irrigation uses, is the total withdrawal.\
    \ The consumptive-use method requires that ancillary data exist for total \nirrigated\
    \ acres for each type of crop, irrigation system efficiencies, conveyance losses,\
    \ climatic variables, and other irrigation \nmanagement practices, such as pre-irrigation,\
    \ frost protection, weed control, and leaching salts from soils. The consumptive-\n\
    use technique assumes that the irrigation water applied is adequate for optimal\
    \ plant growth and that the plants are not being \nirrigated with more or less\
    \ water than needed.\nApplication efficiency is a measure of the effectiveness\
    \ of the irrigation system in applying the right amount of water to \nthe soil\
    \ and root zones over time. Application efficiency must be taken into account\
    \ if irrigation withdrawals are estimated from \ncrop water-consumption coefficients.\
    \ Application efficiencies vary with the type of irrigation system and soil, crop,\
    \ topographic, \nand climatic conditions. Pertinent climatic conditions that have\
    \ large effects on irrigation efficiencies include wind speed, rela-\ntive humidity,\
    \ and air temperature.\nIn many cases, compilation of State withdrawals based\
    \ on crop consumptive use, plus additional climatic and soil factors, is \nnot\
    \ feasible because of the amount of work and level of detailed data necessary.\
    \ Use of previously determined crop consumption \nvalues may be the most cost-effective\
    \ method of estimating irrigation withdrawals. These values may be obtained from\
    \ sources \nsuch as the USDA irrigation guide (U.S. Department of Agriculture,\
    \ 1970).\nStatistical Sampling\nFor large irrigated areas where few measurements\
    \ exist, statistical sampling represents a cost-effective way to estimate \nirrigation\
    \ withdrawals. For this method, withdrawals are measured at sampling sites where\
    \ data also are available for such vari-\nables as power consumption, lift, or\
    \ crop type. Water-use coefficients are developed from these sample data and then\
    \ are used to \nestimate withdrawals at unsampled sites where the predictor variable(s)\
    \ is known.\nStatistical approaches may have transfer value to other areas if\
    \ there is good understanding of the predictor variables, the \nstatistical significance\
    \ of the predictor variables, and the level of expected accuracy. For example,\
    \ by understanding the variabil-\nity of the predictor variable, a specific number\
    \ of sampling sites may be determined that will enable calculations of withdraw-\n\
    als for all sites with a probability that the calculated values are within a specific\
    \ margin of error. Luckey (1972) and Helsel and \nHirsch (1995) provide a complete\
    \ description of how to determine a sufficient sample size. \nAllocation of Withdrawals\
    \ by Source\nIf site-specific measurements of withdrawals are unavailable, then\
    \ the estimates of total withdrawals need to be allocated \nbetween groundwater\
    \ and surface-water sources. Geographic location can be a major determinant of\
    \ water availability from \neach source. Often, a given State or geographic area\
    \ will have a predominant source of water supply for irrigation. For example,\
    \ \nin the Mississippi River alluvial plain in southeastern Missouri, western\
    \ Kentucky and Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and \nLouisiana groundwater from\
    \ the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer is the predominant source of water\
    \ for irrigation (Maupin \nand Barber, 2005). Personnel with State agricultural\
    \ agencies, county extension agents, and staff with irrigation districts and \n\
    equipment dealers can be good sources of local information on irrigation rates,\
    \ methods, and sources of water. \nConsumptive Use by Irrigation\nEstimates of\
    \ water consumption by irrigation will be reported at the county level. The NWUSP\
    \ will provide estimates \nof consumption that can be used in the national compilation.\
    \ The estimates from NWUSP do not preclude the USGS WSC \nfrom developing other\
    \ estimates. If the local compiler for the WSC uses a different method to estimate\
    \ water consumption, the \nmethod, assumptions, sources of data, and results must\
    \ be included in the documentation.\nAcres Irrigated by System Type\nEstimates\
    \ of irrigated acres by system type are compiled for each State at the county\
    \ level. Irrigated acreage is reported by \nthree general methods of application—sprinkler,\
    \ surface, and microirrigation. Many types of irrigation systems are included\
    \ in \neach of these categories.\n34  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use\
    \ Estimates for 2015\n• Sprinkler methods include all boom, center-pivot, lateral-move,\
    \ low-energy precision application (LEPA), permanent, \nportable, side-move, side-roll,\
    \ solid-set, traveling-gun, towed, and other sprinkler irrigation systems.\n•\
    \ Surface methods include all borders, ditch, flood, furrow, gated-pipe, surge-flow,\
    \ water-spreading, and other gravity \nsystems.\n• Microirrigation methods include\
    \ all bubbler, drip, micro-jet, mist, porous trickle-tubing, spray, trickle, and\
    \ other low-\nvolume irrigation systems, and subsurface systems.\nReliable data\
    \ on irrigated acreage also are essential for most methods of estimating irrigation\
    \ water withdrawals. Site-\nspecific irrigated acres by irrigation system type\
    \ generally are difficult to obtain, unless State agencies require irrigators\
    \ to report \ndetailed information that includes irrigation methods.\nThe USDA\
    \ Census of Agriculture, conducted in years ending in “2” and “7,” provides the\
    \ most recent national dataset \nof irrigated crop acreages by county (U.S. Department\
    \ of Agriculture, 2002). The USDA Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey \nprovides\
    \ a national dataset of irrigated acreage by irrigation method by State. County\
    \ assessors also are possible sources for \ncounty-level information on irrigated\
    \ acreage and irrigation system type. Remote sensing has been used as an indirect\
    \ method of \ndetermining acres irrigated and crop types (Raymond and others,\
    \ 1992), but is not a common tool used in this study.\nIn some parts of the United\
    \ States, the growing season is long enough that double and triple cropping can\
    \ occur on the same \nirrigated acreage. In these cases, irrigated acres are counted\
    \ each time an acre is irrigated to reflect the total acreage irrigated \nduring\
    \ the year; therefore, when any acre of land is cropped twice, it is counted as\
    \ 2 irrigated acres. Counting acreage in this \nmanner produces an application\
    \ rate that is comparable to a single-cropping season. The irrigation method used\
    \ on subsequent \ncrops may be different. If multiple irrigation methods are used\
    \ on a crop in a single growing season, acreages are reported under \nthe method\
    \ that provides most of the water to the crop.\nGolf Course Irrigation\nGolf courses\
    \ may use water from ground or surface sources, purchased water (from a public\
    \ supplier or irrigation district), \nreclaimed water from a public wastewater-treatment\
    \ facility, or a combination of these sources. If the data and resources are \n\
    available, it is best to obtain metered withdrawals for specific golf courses.\
    \ Water withdrawals by golf courses may also be \nreported to State water-resource\
    \ agencies. The metered or reported withdrawal data can be used to estimate water\
    \ use for similar \ngolf courses for which data are not available. For golf courses,\
    \ the best information on source of water is obtained directly from \nthe golf\
    \ course maintenance personnel who may know how much water is diverted, withdrawn,\
    \ or delivered from each of the \npossible sources.\nFactors affecting the amount\
    \ of irrigation water used at golf courses include course design, climatic conditions,\
    \ acreage, \nirrigation systems, soils, availability of water for irrigation,\
    \ and local irrigation practices. Normally, more water per unit of \narea is applied\
    \ to the greens and tees than to the fairways. If site-specific data are not available,\
    \ irrigation withdrawals may be \nestimated by using coefficients developed based\
    \ on information on other golf courses in a State. Information collected should\
    \ \ninclude all necessary data to estimate withdrawals based on an application\
    \ rate and the irrigated acres.\nHydroelectric Power\nThe hydroelectric power\
    \ water-use category was a mandatory category through 1995 and became an optional\
    \ category for \nthe 2000 national compilation (Kenny, 2004) and is an optional\
    \ category for the current compilation. Hydroelectric power water \nuse is defined\
    \ as the amount of water used at power plants where the turbine generators are\
    \ driven by falling water. In most \ninstances, the facility is located in the\
    \ stream channel, and water used to drive the generators is considered to be an\
    \ instream \nwater use and is reported as such. In some instances, however, the\
    \ water may be diverted away from the stream channel in order \nto generate power\
    \ at a hydroelectric facility potentially in a different watershed. The amount\
    \ of water diverted is reported as an \noffstream water withdrawal. References\
    \ used in previous compilations for hydroelectric power include Warnick (1984),\
    \ Fardo \nand Patrick (1985), Viessman (1985), and Jog (1989).\nThe annual production\
    \ of electricity, in gigawatthours, may also be reported for the hydroelectric\
    \ power plants. Power \nplants may report power production in kilowatt- or megawatthours\
    \ that will have to be converted to gigawatthours (1 gigawatthour \nequals 1 million\
    \ kilowatthours). \nPumped-storage power plants are hydroelectric facilities capable\
    \ of pumping water to a storage reservoir at a higher eleva-\ntion or upstream\
    \ to store the water for use to generate electricity during peak electrical demands.\
    \ Many of the pumped-storage \nsites are intended to supplement peak electrical\
    \ needs and actually have an overall negative net power generation due to the\
    \ fact \nHydroelectric Power  35\nthat more power is expended during off-peak\
    \ periods to lift the water to the storage reservoir than is generated. Water\
    \ use and \nnet power generation for pump storage sites should not be reported\
    \ in AWUDS for the current compilation, but may be compiled \nand recorded for\
    \ State or regional needs. \nData Elements\nWater use for hydroelectric power\
    \ is an optional category. If reported, the following data elements should be\
    \ included: \n• Instream water use.\n• Offstream surface-water withdrawals.\n\
    • Power generation by instream use (gigawatthours).\n• Power generation by offstream\
    \ use (gigawatthours).\n• Number of instream facilities.\n• Number of offstream\
    \ facilities.\nSources of Information\nInformation concerning hydroelectric power\
    \ water use may be obtained from the following sources. These sources are \nexamples,\
    \ and other sources may be available. \n• Individual facilities or utility companies.\n\
    • State agencies that administer water rights, allocate water to users, or collect\
    \ water-use data or issue permits for the use \nof water.\n• EPA NPDES general\
    \ permits (permit may give information on turbines and pump-storage status) and\
    \ ICIS database.\n• DOE-EIA form EIA-860, Electric Generator Capacity Data, (http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/)\
    \ and form EIA-\n923, Power Plant Operations Report (http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/index.html).\n\
    • U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land\
    \ Management, Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, Bonneville Power Administration, or\
    \ other Federal agencies that operate hydroelectric plants.\n• State agency for\
    \ power administration.\n• FERC.\nCompilation Techniques\nData compiled for the\
    \ hydroelectric category includes water withdrawals for offstream use, instream\
    \ water use, the amount \nof power generated, and the number of facilities. The\
    \ estimation methods described in this section are not intended to be all-\nencompassing\
    \ but do provide a consistent set of techniques if better methods are not available.\
    \ \nInstream Water Use\nInformation on the withdrawal of water (instream water\
    \ use) to generate electric power at hydroelectric power plants can be \nobtained\
    \ directly or estimated by utilizing other available data on the power generated\
    \ and the relative difference in water eleva-\ntion. The data on the instream\
    \ use of water in generating electric power will normally be obtained from each\
    \ individual utility or \npossibly a State regulatory agency. Because the water\
    \ is diverted from the stream channel, hydroelectric power withdrawals may \n\
    also be available from State water regulatory agencies that do not otherwise regulate\
    \ hydroelectric power facilities. The amount \nof water to be reported is the\
    \ flow through the turbines to generate power, and should not include spillway\
    \ flow or other amounts \nthat do not flow through the turbines. If the contact\
    \ person for a utility is not known, a good place to start is the person at the\
    \ \nutility who prepares the DMRs for the EPA. \n36  Guidelines for Preparation\
    \ of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\nFor sites where instream use information\
    \ is not available, the instream water use (Qwu) can be estimated by using the\
    \ \nstandard energy equation (equation 1, modified from Hall and others, 2004).\
    \ The equation estimates instream water use by using \ngross head (difference\
    \ in height between the water intake level and the tailrace level) for the dam,\
    \ generated electricity, and \nplant efficiency.\nP = H × Q × r × (1.356 × 10–3)\
    \ × e                                                                       (1)\n\
    where\n \nP  \nis the power generated, in kilowatts\n \nH  \nis the gross head,\
    \ in feet;\n \nQ  \nis the flow rate through the penstock, in cubic feet per second;\n\
    \ \nr  \nis the density of water (62.4 pounds per cubic foot);\n1.356 × 10–3 \n\
    is the conversion factor for foot-pounds per second to kilowatts where 0.746 kW\
    \ = 1 horsepower (hp) and \n550 ft-lb/sec = 1 hp; and\n \ne  \nis the efficiency\
    \ of the turbines and generators. \nSolving Equation 1 for flow:\n Q = P / (H\
    \ × r × (1.356 × 10–3) × e)                                                  \
    \                     (2)\nThe flow rate in equations 1 and 2 are in cubic feet\
    \ per second, and the power generated is in kilowatts. The power term \nshould\
    \ be converted to kilowatthours by dividing P (power in kilowatts ) by the hours\
    \ (t) of operation of the facility and the \nresulting flow rate converted to\
    \ million gallons per day, so that:\nQwu = Pt / (H × r × (1.356 × 10–3) × e ×\
    \ 1.55)                                                                    (3)\n\
    where\n \nQwu \nis instream water use, in million gallons per day;\n \nPt  \n\
    is the power generated in kilowatthours; and \n \n1.55  \nis the conversion from\
    \ cubic feet per second to million gallons per day.\nPower Generation\nThe DOE-EIA\
    \ maintains power generation statistics such as ownership, location, generation\
    \ capacity, and power generated \nfor a given calendar year. The monthly net power\
    \ generation is available on EIA Form 923. More extensive yearly information \n\
    on each facility is also available from the DOE-EIA. \nSome of the electricity\
    \ generated at a hydroelectric power plant is used to run the power plant itself.\
    \ It is important to ask \na plant operator if the power production estimate is\
    \ for the gross or net amount of power produced. The net amount is to be \nreported.\
    \ \nSome industrial facilities also generate electric power. These combined heat\
    \ and power facilities are called CHP or cogene-\nration facilities. The amount\
    \ of water used by the industry to generate electricity should be reported as\
    \ a power generation water \nuse in the thermoelectric power generation category,\
    \ if the data provided from the industrial facility are sufficient to differentiate\
    \ \nwater used in power generation and the amount of water used for the industrial\
    \ processes of the plant. These water and power \ngeneration values should not\
    \ be reported in the hydroelectric category.\nSome hydroelectric power plants\
    \ have been designed to pump water to a reservoir at a higher elevation during\
    \ non-peak \nhours. The water is then run through the turbines to produce electricity\
    \ during peak demand periods. Currently, the net power \nproduction is assumed\
    \ to be zero as is the net water use. \nFor pumped-storage hydroelectric power\
    \ plants, the actual net power production is generally negative—more power is\
    \ used \nthan generated, but with the benefit of shifting production to peak demand\
    \ periods. If actual power production is not available, \nthe net power production\
    \ is assumed to be zero as is the net water use. \nNumber of Facilities\nUse SWUDS\
    \ or a State-maintained site-specific database to determine the number of hydroelectric\
    \ facilities. If site-specific \ndata are not available for your State, use the\
    \ DOE-EIA data to determine the number of facilities. \nWastewater Treatment \
    \ 37\nWastewater Treatment\nThe wastewater-treatment (WWT) category was a mandatory\
    \ category in the 1980 through 1995 national water-use com-\npilations, then it\
    \ became an optional category in the 2000 compilation (Kenny, 2004), and will\
    \ remain optional for the current \ncompilation. The WWT category includes information\
    \ on facilities engaged primarily in the collection, treatment, and disposal \n\
    of wastewater conveyed through a sewer system. This category includes information\
    \ on water returned to the hydrologic system \nby WWT facilities, water released\
    \ for beneficial reuse, and the number of facilities that treat wastewater. Treatment\
    \ facilities are \nseparated into two categories: publicly owned treatment works\
    \ (POTWs) and “other.” POTWs receive and treat wastewater from \nvarious domestic,\
    \ commercial, and industrial users. “Other” wastewater facilities are privately\
    \ owned and include commercial, \nindustrial, and other facilities that treat\
    \ their own wastewater.\nWater returns generally refer to flows leaving WWT facilities.\
    \ However, for the purpose of the current compilation, flows \nentering a WWT\
    \ facility are assumed equal to those leaving the facility, with no losses occurring\
    \ from consumptive use by the \nfacility. Overflows from wastewater holding lagoons\
    \ are considered water returns, but seepage from lagoons is not.\nReclaimed wastewater\
    \ (also known as reclaimed sewage) is that water which is released for reuse after\
    \ being processed at \na WWT facility. No attempt should be made to make the quantity\
    \ of reclaimed wastewater released by WWT plants equal to the \ndeliveries of\
    \ reclaimed wastewater. If the purpose of the land spreading of reclaimed wastewater\
    \ is to dispose of the water, this \ndoes not qualify as reclaimed wastewater.\n\
    Prior to 2000, the WWT category included only return flows from the POTWs. Also,\
    \ prior to 2000, privately owned waste-\nwater facilities including commercial,\
    \ industrial, and other facilities that treated and released their own wastewater\
    \ were coded \nas “Other.” After 2000 and continuing to the current compilation,\
    \ the wastewater-treatment category is total wastewater releases \nand includes\
    \ wastewater releases from WWT plants and those systems that would have been considered\
    \ as “Other” prior to \n2000. Return-flow data from WWT facilities in the pre-2000\
    \ datasets will remain in the originally reported data elements. \nData Elements\n\
    The WWT category and all of its data elements are optional.\n• Number of WWT facilities\
    \ in a site-specific database.\n• Total wastewater returns by public wastewater\
    \ facilities.\n• Reclaimed wastewater released to other facilities by the public\
    \ wastewater facilities.\nSources of Information\nInformation concerning WWT may\
    \ be obtained from any or all of the following sources. Other sources of data\
    \ may be \navailable for the compilation.\n• Individual WWT facilities.\n• City\
    \ water departments.\n• State pollution control or environmental protection agencies.\n\
    • PCS and ICIS database—EPA.\n• Clean Watershed Needs Survey—EPA.\n• EPA Pollutant\
    \ Loading Tool.\n• EPA Industrial Facilities Discharge (IFD) files.\n• USGS surface-water\
    \ modeling teams.\n38  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates\
    \ for 2015\nCompilation Techniques\nData compiled for the wastewater category\
    \ include the number of facilities, wastewater returns, and the amount of \nreclaimed\
    \ wastewater used. The estimation methods described in this section are not intended\
    \ to be all encompassing but do \nprovide a consistent set of techniques if better\
    \ methods are not available. \nNumber of Facilities\nIf site-specific data are\
    \ not available for the State, use the EPA IFD files or the EPA PCS to determine\
    \ the number \nof facilities.\nWastewater Returns\nWater-return information is\
    \ typically available from the State agency responsible for the program that supports\
    \ the Clean \nWater Act. Information may also be available from the EPA PCS-ICIS\
    \ (https://www.epa.gov/enviro/pcs-icis-overview), which \nis a national database\
    \ that contains water quantity and quality information about facilities that have\
    \ an NPDES permit to return \nwater. Information available from PCS/ICIS includes\
    \ return flows, location, and facility type (such as public or industrial). \n\
    Information on wastewater management facilities including wastewater facilities,\
    \ stormwater and combined sewers, and decen-\ntralized wastewater management is\
    \ available at the Clean Watershed Needs Survey (https://www.epa.gov/cwns). Wastewater\
    \ \npollutant discharge data including rates and loads are available through the\
    \ Pollutant Loading Tool (https://cfpub.epa.gov/dmr/). \nWater returns may be\
    \ estimated from design-flow capacity data, which may be available from the previously\
    \ listed sources. \nDesign-flow capacity data represent the flow that a facility\
    \ is designed to support, and is expressed as an average or maximum. \nFacility\
    \ operators may be able to provide information about how actual returns compare\
    \ to the average or maximum-design \ncapacity of the plant. An effort should be\
    \ made to contact large WWT facilities to verify data obtained by indirect sources\
    \ of \ninformation. Information on wastewater generation rates, peak rates, and\
    \ return coefficients are available in Chapter 6 Wastewater \nPlanning Criteria\
    \ by the Vallecitos Water District (2011).\nWater returns for a community may\
    \ be estimated by using deliveries by public supply and subtracting estimated\
    \ distribution \nlosses, adding distribution gains, subtracting consumptive uses\
    \ and wastewater returns by water users (commercial, industrial, \netc.), and\
    \ adding any discharges to the community wastewater system by self-supplied users.\
    \ Stated as an equation:\nwastewater-treatment returns = deliveries – distribution\
    \ losses + distribution gains – consumptive uses – private returns to \nhydrologic\
    \ system + self-supplied user discharge to sewer. It should be noted however,\
    \ that many of these terms are difficult to \nquantify or have large margins of\
    \ error. If this methods is used, the source and estimates for all of the terms\
    \ should be included \nin the documentation.\nCoefficients for estimating water\
    \ returns are generally not available from the literature because distribution\
    \ systems vary, \nalthough some information may be available. If public-supply\
    \ deliveries and population served are not available for a commu-\nnity, however,\
    \ then wastewater returns may be estimated by using coefficients determined for\
    \ the State. Per capita uses and dis-\ntribution losses or gains coefficients\
    \ can be determined from communities with delivery and return-flow information,\
    \ and then \napplied to facilities that support a similar population size and\
    \ type of distribution system. Selected references with coefficients \nfor WWT\
    \ are Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. (1991) and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental\
    \ Resources (1991). Distribution loss \nand gain estimates are sometimes available\
    \ from consulting firms. It is helpful to use available return-flow information\
    \ for WWT \nfacilities with similar population sizes and similar type distribution\
    \ systems to develop coefficients.\nAn arithmetic check between public-supply\
    \ withdrawals and WWT return should be made and be part of the QA/QC \nreview.\
    \ If the WWT return is significantly larger than public-supply withdrawals minus\
    \ consumptive uses and distribution \nlosses, then determine if an interbasin\
    \ transfer, stormwater runoff, or self-supplied users are affecting the amount\
    \ of water \nentering the WWT.\nReclaimed Wastewater\nInformation about the amount\
    \ of reclaimed wastewater can be obtained from WWT plant operators and local utility\
    \ depart-\nments in the State. Summaries on city/town water and wastewater websites\
    \ can also indicate whether wastewater is sold or \nreused for irrigation (rights-of-way,\
    \ parks, cemeteries, golf courses), for industrial purposes, and for thermoelectric\
    \ cooling. \nContacting officials for the city/town may provide reclaimed wastewater\
    \ sales amounts.\nReservoir Evaporation  39\nReservoir Evaporation\nReservoir\
    \ evaporation is water loss by evaporation from manmade impoundments with a normal\
    \ capacity of 5,000 acre-feet \nor greater. The reservoir evaporation category\
    \ was a mandatory category in 1995, and was aggregated to the eight-digit HUC\
    \ \nareas only, but the data were not published in the water-use compilation for\
    \ 1995 (Solley and others, 1998). Estimates for res-\nervoir operation were not\
    \ made for 2000 (Kenny, 2004) and were optional for the 2005 (Hutson, 2007) and\
    \ 2010 compilations. \nReservoir evaporation is an optional water-use category\
    \ for 2015.\nEvaporation is a major component of the hydrologic cycle, especially\
    \ in western States. Evaporation from a lake or reser-\nvoir surface is controlled\
    \ by several factors, in simple terms—the complexities in climatic conditions\
    \ and the location, size, and \ndepth of reservoirs. Recent advancements in the\
    \ science of estimating reservoir evaporation employ the use of new climate mod-\n\
    els, other models (eddy covariance and Bowen Ratio Energy Balance), remote sensing\
    \ technology, and on-site instrumentation. \nLarge reservoirs, particularly in\
    \ the West, are managed by Federal agencies such as the USACE and the Bureau of\
    \ Reclamation. \nThese agencies, along with the USGS, are cooperatively monitoring\
    \ and improving their understanding of reservoir evapora-\ntion and the implications\
    \ on their management operations. The Bureau of Reclamation, West-Wide Climate\
    \ Risk Assessments \n(http://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/wcra/) describes the results\
    \ of projects specifically targeted to evaluate irrigation demand and \nreservoir\
    \ evaporation in 17 western States, plus parts of Iowa and Missouri. \nThe National\
    \ Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explained the relationship between\
    \ pan evaporation, free \nwater surface (FWS) evaporation, and lake evaporation\
    \ in their publication by Farnsworth and others (1982). Pan evaporation \nis the\
    \ observed evaporation rate at a standard National Weather Service (NWS) Class\
    \ A pan installation. FWS evaporation is \ndefined as evaporation from a thin\
    \ film of water having no appreciable heat storage. Lake evaporation may differ\
    \ substantially \nfrom FWS evaporation during a given month because of changes\
    \ in heat storage in the water body. On an annual basis, FWS \nevaporation and\
    \ lake evaporation are generally about the same. Use of a pan evaporation method\
    \ to calculate reservoir evapora-\ntion is not recommended because the class A\
    \ pan evaporation rate is consistently greater than the water evaporation from\
    \ a lake.\nMore recent studies by the USACE and the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau\
    \ of Reclamation, 2015), in cooperation with the \nDesert Research Institute (http://www.dri.edu/),\
    \ have improved the understanding of reservoir evaporation. The Desert Research\
    \ \nInstitute has an Open Water Evaporation Network (https://owen.dri.edu/) with\
    \ a geographic extent in the Pacific Northwest \nand Southwest States. The network\
    \ was developed and funded through collaboration between the Bureau of Reclamation,\
    \ the \nCalifornia Department of Water Resources, and the Desert Research Institute,\
    \ with the intent to improve estimates of reservoir \nevaporation through continuous\
    \ and near real-time monitoring of water temperatures and weather variables at\
    \ sites on or over \nthe water surface. The network of sites has expanded and\
    \ shrunk over time, but information may be available to help determine \nreservoir\
    \ evaporation in other places. Estimates of reservoir evaporation for selected\
    \ reservoirs in California and Nevada and the \nmethods used are described in\
    \ Huntington and McEvoy (2011).\nThe reservoirs behind some dams may extend into\
    \ more than one State. In these instances, coordination between neighbor-\ning\
    \ States is essential to ensure that the surface area of the reservoir is divided\
    \ proportionately between the States and that the \nsame method for calculating\
    \ the reservoir evaporation is used. \nData Elements\nReservoir evaporation is\
    \ an optional category. If the data are reported in AWUDS, the following data\
    \ elements should be \nincluded for this category: \n• Reservoir surface area.\n\
    • Reservoir evaporation.\nReservoir evaporation estimates are only reported for\
    \ the eight-digit HUC. \nSources of Data\nInformation concerning reservoir area\
    \ and location may be obtained from many of the following sources. The sources\
    \ \nbelow are not all encompassing and are examples only. \n• Owner of the dam\
    \ or reservoir.\n• State agency responsible for dam safety.\n• State agency that\
    \ administers permits for the storage of water.\n40  Guidelines for Preparation\
    \ of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\n• USGS Reservoir File.\n• Federal agencies,\
    \ including the USACE, NRCS, Bureau of Reclamation, Tennessee Valley Authority,\
    \ and Federal Emer-\ngency Management Agency.\nSources for information concerning\
    \ lake evaporation, in addition to the sources listed above, include the following:\
    \ \n• State climatologist.\n• NOAA Technical Report NWS 33, Map 3, Annual FWS\
    \ evaporation (shallow lake).\n• Hydrology textbooks.\n• Desert Research Institute.\n\
    • Bureau of Reclamation Technical Services Office (Denver).\nCompilation Techniques\
    \ \nThe estimation methods described in this section are not intended to be all\
    \ encompassing. They offer techniques if better \nmethods are not available. \n\
    Surface Area\nThe USGS Reservoir File contains surface area for reservoirs with\
    \ a total capacity of at least 25,000 acre-feet or a normal \ncapacity of at least\
    \ 5,000 acre-feet (Ruddy and Hitt, 1990). Total capacity is defined as the total\
    \ volume in the reservoir below \nthe maximum attainable water-surface elevation\
    \ and includes any surcharge storage (surcharge storage is the storage above the\
    \ \ntotal retention level). It is recommended that each USGS WSC review the reservoirs\
    \ in their State and consult with the Federal \nor legal entity that operates\
    \ the dam and reservoir (Bureau of Reclamation, USACE, Tennessee Valley Authority,\
    \ etc.). Be aware \nthat the area data in a reservoir file may show the reservoir\
    \ area values at normal capacity, and evaporation estimates should be \nbased\
    \ on the average reservoir surface area, which may be different from the area\
    \ value listed. Surface area should be propor-\ntional between adjoining States\
    \ when a reservoir is in more than one State.\nAcknowledgments\nThis report was\

    46  Guidelines for Preparation of State Water-Use Estimates for 2015\nGlossary\n\
    Water-use terminology has changed in the series of water-use circulars prepared\
    \ at 5-year intervals. The term water use, as \ninitially used in the report for\
    \ 1950, meant withdrawals of water; in the report for 1960, the term was redefined\
    \ to include con-\nsumptive use of water as well as withdrawals. With the beginning\
    \ of the U.S. Geological Survey National Water-Use Informa-\ntion Program in 1978,\
    \ the term was again redefined to include withdrawals plus deliveries from public\
    \ suppliers. In the water-\nuse circular for 2000, water use was defined as it\
    \ was initially used in 1950 as withdrawals of water. Beginning with the 2005\
    \ \ncircular, water use was defined as water withdrawals plus deliveries. The\
    \ following terms are referenced in the text and are part \nof the water-use circular\
    \ series.\nA\naquaculture water use Water used in the production of organisms\
    \ that live in water within a confined space and under \ncontrolled feeding, sanitation,\
    \ and harvesting procedures, and establishments primarily engaged in hatching\
    \ fish and in operating \nfishing preserves. See also commercial water use, fish\
    \ farms, and fish hatcheries.\naquifer A geologic formation, group of formations,\
    \ or part of a formation that contains sufficient saturated permeable material\
    \ \nto yield significant quantities of water to wells and springs.\nB\nblowdown\
    \ The continuous or intermittent discharge, or purging, of a small amount of circulating\
    \ water, such as in a \nrecirculating cooling tower. Blowdown normally is expressed\
    \ as a percentage of the water being circulated. Its purpose is to \nprevent an\
    \ increase in the concentration of solids in the water because of evaporation.\n\
    C\ncapacity The average amount of water circulating in the cooling system of a\
    \ thermoelectric power plant, usually expressed in \ngallons per minute.\nclosed-loop\
    \ cooling system A cooling system in which water is withdrawn, circulated through\
    \ heat exchangers, then cooled \nand recycled. Subsequent withdrawals are used\
    \ to replace water lost to evaporation, blowdown, drift, and leakage.\ncommercial\
    \ water use Water used for motels, hotels, restaurants, office buildings, other\
    \ commercial facilities, and institutions. \nThe water may be obtained from a\
    \ public supply or may be self-supplied. Also includes irrigation water provided\
    \ by public \nsuppliers to golf courses, parks, and other landscaped areas as\
    \ well as deliveries for clubhouses and other non-irrigation uses at \ngolf courses.\
    \ In previous compilations, commercial water use included water use by fish hatcheries\
    \ which is now included in \naquaculture. \nconsumptive use The part of water\
    \ withdrawn that is evaporated, transpired, incorporated into products or crops,\
    \ consumed by \nhumans or livestock, or otherwise removed from the immediate water\
    \ environment. Also referred to as water consumed. \nconveyance loss Water that\
    \ is lost because of leakage or evaporation while in transit through a pipe, canal,\
    \ conduit, or ditch. \nLeakage from an irrigation ditch may percolate to a groundwater\
    \ source and be available for further use.\ncooling system Equipment that is used\
    \ for cooling purposes, such as condensers at power plants or factories. Includes\
    \ water \nintakes and outlets, cooling towers, and cooling ponds.\ncooling-system\
    \ type See closed-loop cooling system and once-through cooling system.\nD\ndeliveries\
    \ Water distributed by public-water suppliers for domestic, commercial, industrial,\
    \ or thermoelectric-power uses.\ndesalination Separation of water from salts and\
    \ minerals using thermal and membrane processes. Sources of water are \nbrackish\
    \ groundwater, brackish surface water, and seawater. See also freshwater and saline\
    \ water.\ndewatering The removal of water through draining or pumping to lower\
    \ the water table for mining or agriculture.\ndissolved solids A measure of the\
    \ dissolved minerals and organic matter in water, usually expressed in milligrams\
    \ per liter \n(mg/L). Water containing 1,000 mg/L or more of dissolved solids\
    \ is considered saline for all purposes except public supply in \nthis report.\
    \ See also desalination.\ndomestic deliveries Water provided to domestic users\
    \ from a public supply.\nReferences  47\ndomestic water use Water used for household\
    \ purposes, such as drinking, food preparation, bathing, washing clothes and \n\
    dishes, flushing toilets, and watering lawns and gardens. Also called residential\
    \ water use. The water may be obtained from a \npublic supply or may be self-supplied.\
    \ See also public-supply water use and self-supplied water.\ndrift Fine water\
    \ droplets blown out of a cooling tower along with exhaust air, usually expressed\
    \ as a percentage of \nwater circulated.\nE\nevaporation Process by which water\
    \ is changed from a liquid into a vapor. See also evapotranspiration and transpiration.\n\
    evapotranspiration Water that is vaporized because of evaporation from the soil\
    \ or plant transpiration. See also evaporation \nand transpiration.\nF\nfinished\
    \ water Water that is filtered or treated. See also raw water and water treatment.\n\
    fish farms Facilities that produce finfish or shellfish under controlled feeding,\
    \ sanitation, and harvesting procedures for \ncommercial purposes. Water use by\
    \ fish farms is included in the aquaculture category. See also aquaculture water\
    \ use.\nfreshwater Water that contains less than 1,000 mg/L of dissolved solids.\
    \ Generally, water with more than 500 mg/L of \ndissolved solids is undesirable\
    \ for drinking and many industrial uses. See also desalination and saline water.\n\

    \ which is a zone where all voids are filled with water.\nH\nhydroelectric power\
    \ water use The use of water in the generation of electricity at plants where\
    \ the turbine generators are \ndriven by falling water. Hydroelectric water use\
    \ is most commonly an instream use.\nhydrologic cataloging unit An eight-digit\
    \ cataloging unit that identifies a geographic area representing part or all of\
    \ a surface \ndrainage basin, a combination of basins, or a distinct hydrologic\
    \ feature. Sometimes known as a watershed. Each hydrologic unit \nis identified\
    \ by a unique hydrologic unit code (HUC).\nhydrologic unit code A unique number\
    \ consisting of two to eight or more digits based on the levels of classification\
    \ in the \nhydrologic unit system.\nI\nindustrial water use Water used for industrial\
    \ purposes such as fabrication, processing, washing, and cooling, and includes\
    \ \nsuch industries as steel, chemical and allied products, paper and allied products,\
    \ smelting, and petroleum refining. The water \nmay be obtained from a public\
    \ supply or may be self-supplied. See also public-supply water use and self-supplied\
    \ water.\ninstream use Water that is used within a stream channel for such purposes\
    \ as hydroelectric power generation, navigation, \nwater-quality improvement,\
    \ fish propagation, and recreation. Sometimes called nonwithdrawal use or in-channel\
    \ use.\nirrigation district A cooperative, self-governing public corporation with\
    \ definite geographic boundaries and taxing power. Its \nfunction is to obtain\
    \ and distribute water for irrigation of lands within the district.\nirrigation\
    \ system Equipment used to distribute water to crops or other irrigated lands.\
    \ Irrigation systems are grouped into the \nfollowing three broad categories:\n\
    microirrigation An irrigation system that wets only a discrete part of the soil\
    \ surface near the plant by means of applicators \noperated under low pressure.\
    \ The applicators can be placed on or below the surface of the ground or can be\
    \ suspended from \nsupports. Subsurface systems that control the height of the\
    \ water table are included in this category.\nsprinkler An irrigation system in\
    \ which water is applied by means of perforated pipes or nozzles operated under\
    \ pressure \nto form a spray pattern.\nsurface Irrigation by means of flood, furrow,\
    \ or gravity. Flood irrigation is the application of irrigation water in which\
    \ the \nentire soil surface is covered by ponded water. Furrow is a partial surface-flooding\
    \ method of irrigation in which water is \n48  Guidelines for Preparation of State\
    \ Water-Use Estimates for 2015\napplied in furrows or rows of sufficient capacity\
    \ to contain the irrigation stream. Gravity is an irrigation method in which \n\
    water is not pumped, but flows in ditches or pipes and is distributed by gravity.\n\
    irrigation water use Application of water on lands to assist in the growing of\
    \ crops and pastures or to maintain vegetative \ngrowth on recreational lands\
    \ such as parks and golf courses. Includes water applied for pre-irrigation, frost\
    \ protection, chemical \napplication, leaching salts from the root zone, and dust\
    \ suppression, as well as water lost in conveyance. Also includes irrigation \n\
    for cemeteries, turf farms, and other landscaped areas but does not include domestic\
    \ lawns and gardens, which are included in \nthe domestic water-use category.\n\
    K\nkilowatthour (kWh) A unit of energy equivalent to 1,000 watthours.\nL\nlivestock\
    \ water use Water for livestock watering, feedlots, dairy operations, and other\
    \ on-farm needs. Livestock includes \ncattle, sheep, goats, hogs, poultry, horses,\
    \ and fur-bearing animals.\nM\nmakeup water The water pumped into a closed-loop\
    \ cooling system to replace the circulating water lost by evaporation, drift,\
    \ \nblowdown, and leakage. Makeup water usually is expressed as a percentage of\
    \ the total amount of water circulated.\nmining water use Water used for the extraction\
    \ of naturally occurring minerals including solids, such as coal and ores; \n\
    liquids, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural gas. Also includes\
    \ uses associated with quarrying, well operations, \nmilling, and other preparations\
    \ customarily done at a mine site or as part of a mining activity. Mining water\
    \ use does not include \nwater used in processing, such as smelting, refining\
    \ petroleum, or slurry pipeline operations, which are included in industrial \n\
    water use. \nN\nNorth American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes Three-digit\
    \ codes established in 1997 by the Office of \nManagement and Budget in cooperation\
    \ with its counterparts in Canada and Mexico. NAICS are used in the classification\
    \ of \nestablishments by type of activity in which they are engaged, thus enabling\
    \ comparison of industries from the three countries. \nNAICS replaces the Standard\
    \ Industrial Classification (SIC) system. See also Standard Industrial Classification\
    \ (SIC) codes.\nO\noffstream use Water withdrawn or diverted from a surface-water\
    \ source for public-water supply, domestic, industry, irrigation, \nlivestock,\
    \ thermoelectric-power generation, and other uses. Sometimes called off-channel\
    \ use or withdrawal.\nonce-through cooling system A cooling system in which water\
    \ is withdrawn, circulated through heat exchangers, and then \nreturned to a body\
    \ of water at a higher temperature. Also referred to as an open-loop cooling system.\n\
    P\nper capita water use The average amount of water used per person during a standard\
    \ time period, generally per day. Per capita \nuse may be calculated based on\
    \ total water use, public-supply water use, self-supplied domestic water use,\
    \ or domestic deliveries \nfrom public supply.\npre-irrigation The application\
    \ of water to cropland before planting to assure adequate soil moisture for crop\
    \ germination and \nearly plant growth.\npublic-supply water use Water withdrawn\
    \ by public and private water suppliers that furnish water to at least 25 persons\
    \ \nor have a minimum of 15 connections. Public suppliers provide water for a\
    \ variety of uses, such as domestic, commercial, \nindustrial, thermoelectric\
    \ power, and public use. See also domestic water use, industrial water use, thermoelectric-power\
    \ water \nuse, and public water use.\nReferences  49\npublic water use Water provided\

    \ also \nreclaimed wastewater, recycled water, and wastewater treatment.\nS\n\
    saline water Water that contains 1,000 mg/L or more of dissolved solids. For public\
    \ supply, water that requires desalination or \ndilution to make it potable is\
    \ considered saline. See also desalination and freshwater.\nself-supplied water\
    \ Water that is withdrawn directly from a groundwater or a surface-water source\
    \ by a user, as opposed to \nwater that is delivered by a public supplier.\nStandard\
    \ Industrial Classification (SIC) codes Four-digit codes established by the Office\
    \ of Management and Budget, last \nrevised during 1987, and used in the classification\
    \ of establishments by type of activity in which they are engaged. SIC codes are\
    \ \nbeing replaced by NAICS codes. See also North American Industry Classification\
    \ System codes.\nsurface water An open body of water, such as a stream, lake,\

    \ at the USGS internal-only website \nat http://water.usgs.gov/usgs/watuse/2015compilation/coding-forms/forms2015.html.\
    \ The coding forms show the water-use \ncategory names in columns and the associated\
    \ data elements for each category in rows. The forms are not intended to be used\
    \ as \nmanual coding forms, but as references summarizing the scope of the data\
    \ to be collected for the national water-use compilation. \nThe first form shows\
    \ the mandatory data elements for all States at the county aggregation level.\
    \ The second, third, and fourth \nforms show all data elements that may be stored\
    \ in the Aggregate Water-Use Data System (AWUDS) for areas such as county, \n\
    aquifer, and hydrologic unit code (HUC), respectively. \nThe cells on the coding\
    \ forms are color coded to indicate the data to be stored in AWUDS and whether\
    \ the data are man-\ndatory or optional. A black cell on the coding form indicates\
    \ that data cannot be stored in AWUDS for the category and data \nelement corresponding\
    \ to that cell. Mandatory data elements are shaded in yellow on the data coding\
    \ forms, and cells with black \nstripes and yellow shading indicate mandatory\
    \ elements that allow null values to be reported for an unknown water use. Cells\
    \ on \nthe coding forms shaded light blue indicate optional categories and data\
    \ elements that can be stored in AWUDS for State use. \nThe coding forms use the\

    \ aquifer \ncodes for the principal aquifer of the United States (https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/NatlAqCode-reflist.html)\
    \ to identify and aggre-\ngate the water-use data, and identify the mandatory\

    20, 7163. Copy Abstract Research has shown the multitude of applications that
    IoT, cloud computing and forecast technologies present in every sector. In agriculture,
    one application is the monitoring of factors that influence crop development to
    assist in making crop management decisions. Research on the application of such
    technologies in agriculture has been mainly conducted at small experimental sites
    or under controlled conditions. This research has provided relevant insights and
    guidelines for the use of different types of sensors, application of a multitude
    of algorithms to forecast relevant parameters as well as architectural approaches
    of IoT platforms. However, research on the implementation of IoT platforms at
    the commercial scale is needed to identify platform requirements to properly function
    under such conditions. This article evaluates an IoT platform (IRRISENS) based
    on fully replicable microservices used to sense soil, crop and atmosphere parameters,
    interact with third party cloud services, planning and scheduling irrigation as
    well as control of irrigation water control devices. The proposed IoT platform
    was evaluated during one growing season at four commercial scale farms on two
    different broadacre irrigated crops with very different water management requirements
    (rice and cotton). Five main requirements for IoT platforms to be used in agriculture
    at commercial scale were identified from implementing IRRISENS in rice and cotton
    production: scalability, flexibility, heterogeneity, robustness to failure and
    security. The platform addressed all these requirements. The results showed that
    the microservice approach followed in the platform is robust against both intermittent
    and critical failures in the field that could occur in any of the monitored sites.
    Further, processing or storage overload caused for any reason at one farm did
    not affect the performance of the platform regarding the other monitored farms.
    This paper also discusses how the microservice approach can address the data heterogeneity
    issue when crops with different management requirements are monitored. Since there
    are no shared microservices among farms, the IoT platform proposed here also provides
    data isolation maintaining data confidentiality for each user, which is relevant
    in a commercial farm scenario. Keywords IoT platform; microservice; smart agriculture;

    Abstract: Data-driven technologies are employed in agriculture to optimize the\
    \ use of limited\nresources. Crop evapotranspiration (ET) estimates the actual\
    \ amount of water that crops require\nat different growth stages, thereby proving\
    \ to be the essential information needed for precision\nirrigation. Crop ET is\
    \ essential in areas like the US High Plains, where farmers rely on groundwater\n\
    for irrigation. The sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the region is threatened\
    \ by diminishing\ngroundwater levels, and the increasing frequency of extreme\
    \ events caused by climate change further\nexacerbates the situation. These conditions\
    \ can signiﬁcantly affect crop ET rates, leading to water\nstress, which adversely\
    \ affects crop yields. In this study, we analyze historical climate data using\n\
    a machine learning model to determine which of the climate extreme indices most\
    \ inﬂuences crop\nET. Crop ET is estimated using reference ET derived from the\
    \ FAO Penman–Monteith equation,\nwhich is multiplied with the crop coefﬁcient\
    \ data estimated from the remotely sensed normalized\ndifference vegetation index\
    \ (NDVI). We found that the climate extreme indices of consecutive dry\ndays and\
    \ the mean weekly maximum temperatures most inﬂuenced crop ET. It was found that\n\
    temperature-derived indices inﬂuenced crop ET more than precipitation-derived\
    \ indices. Under the\nfuture climate scenarios, we predict that crop ET will increase\
    \ by 0.4% and 1.7% in the near term,\nby 3.1% and 5.9% in the middle term, and\
    \ by 3.8% and 9.6% at the end of the century under low\ngreenhouse gas emission\
    \ and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios, respectively. These predicted\n\
    changes in seasonal crop ET can help agricultural producers to make well-informed\
    \ decisions to\noptimize groundwater resources.\nKeywords: extreme weather events;\
    \ crop evapotranspiration; climate change; machine learning\n1. Introduction\n\
    Crop evapotranspiration (ET), when estimated accurately, can enable agricultural\
    \ pro-\nducers to make effective irrigation management decisions. In areas such\
    \ as the High Plains\nregion, agricultural production relies heavily on groundwater\
    \ resources [1]. However, due\nto the declining amount of yearly precipitation,\
    \ groundwater withdrawals have greatly\nsurpassed recharge, posing a threat to\
    \ the sustainability of agriculture in the future [2–5].\nSince crop ET is the\
    \ estimate of the actual amount of water required by the crops at any\ngiven time\
    \ during growing season, the effective use of crop ET information can help miti-\n\
    gate this problem. Therefore, when incorporated into irrigation scheduling, crop\
    \ ET data\ncan help agricultural producers optimize the use of limited groundwater\
    \ resources and\nensure its sustainability by reducing the rate of groundwater\
    \ pumping while also meeting\ncrop water needs [6,7].\nCrop ET rates and amounts,\
    \ however, are affected by the variability of growing\nseason weather conditions.\
    \ More speciﬁcally, the increased frequency and intensity of\nthe occurrence of\
    \ extreme climate events caused by climate change inﬂuences in-season\nLand 2023,\
    \ 12, 1500. https://doi.org/10.3390/land12081500\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/land\n\
    Land 2023, 12, 1500\n2 of 26\nvariation in the crop water requirement [8]. Climate\
    \ extremes are instances of harsh weather\nconditions, such as heat waves and\
    \ highly variable precipitation. They have become a global\nconcern to agricultural\
    \ researchers and producers, especially due to the extent of the effect\nthey\
    \ can have on the hydrological cycle and on crop productivity [9]. Many studies\
    \ have\nassessed the impact of climate extremes on the end-of-season yield of\
    \ crops and discovered\nthat relationships exist between climate extremes and\
    \ crop yields [10–12]. For example,\nresearchers [13,14] report that extreme heat\
    \ occurrences, which are conditions where the\nmaximum temperature during the\
    \ growing season exceeds 30 ◦C, have a negative effect on\nmaize yield. This is\
    \ because prolonged exposure to high temperatures induces water stress\nby increasing\
    \ the rate of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, as plants are then forced\n\
    to close their stomata in order to prevent desiccation [15]. A decreased yield\
    \ at the end\nof the growing season is therefore likely if sufﬁcient water is\
    \ not provided to relieve the\nwater stress brought on by these extreme temperature\
    \ conditions. These extreme weather\nconditions may even have more devastating\
    \ effects on crop productivity, particularly if\nthey occur at growth stages where\
    \ the crops are most vulnerable to water stress [16]. In an\nexperimental study,\
    \ Hatﬁeld and Prueger [17] reported that the reproductive stage of maize\nis most\
    \ sensitive to warmer temperatures, and when compared to maize growth under\n\
    normal temperatures, these warmer temperatures can reduce the end-of-season yield\
    \ by as\nmuch as 80% to 90%. A similar study [18] also reported that with the\
    \ exposure of crops to\nclimate extremes, like 24 h under temperatures above 33\
    \ ◦C, the biomass yield is reduced\nby up to 3%. Maize is highly susceptible to\
    \ water stress [19], and it needs more adequate\nwatering during its vegetative\
    \ and tasseling stages in order to prevent signiﬁcant yield\ndecline at the end\
    \ of its growing season [20]. However, under well-managed conditions,\nmaize responds\
    \ quite well to irrigation in terms of production, yielding 673 kg/ha to\n1009\
    \ kg/ha for every 25 mm of water (one inch) applied. This makes maize the most\n\
    heavily irrigated crop in Kansas, covering over half of the state’s three million\
    \ acres of\nmaize-producing land. Rogers et al. [21] report that the full-season\
    \ variety types of maize\nneed between 500 mm and 800 mm of water, often at a\
    \ rate of 9 mm to 13 mm per day,\ndepending on the weather during the growing\
    \ season.\nClimate-driven variability in in-season weather conditions will likely\
    \ impact maize’s\naverage crop water needs. Rising annual and seasonal temperatures\
    \ resulting from in-\ncreased greenhouse gas emissions due to human activities\
    \ [22] are already being reported\nin the Midwest [23] and other parts of the\
    \ world [24]. These observed changes are expected,\ngiven that future climate\
    \ estimates from global climate models (GCMs) show an upward\ntrajectory in global\
    \ warming and aridity in the future [25]. GCMs are models developed\nbased on\
    \ the knowledge of the earth’s system and how its components interact. Using\n\
    historically observed data and scenarios that depict the levels of greenhouse\
    \ gas emis-\nsions from human activities, these GCMs generate data for various\
    \ climate parameters\nlike temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc., at various\
    \ regional and temporal scales.\nFour gas emission scenarios, referred to as representative\
    \ concentration pathways (RCPs),\nwere developed and standardized by the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report [26].\
    \ Two of these scenarios are commonly\nused in studies, which are the RCP4.5 scenario—a\
    \ future in which mitigation efforts are\nimplemented to reduce greenhouse gas\
    \ emissions—and the RCP8.5 scenario, which depicts\na future in which greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions continue to rise all through the twenty-ﬁrst\ncentury. The scenarios\
    \ serve as input data to over twenty GCMs that have been developed\nby the Coupled\
    \ Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The predictions from the GCMs are\nusually\
    \ compared with historically observed data to estimate the severity of climate\
    \ change\nto be anticipated in the future. The changes projected by these GCMs\
    \ pose a signiﬁcant\nthreat to the sustainability of agriculture in semi-arid\
    \ regions like the US High Plains\nregion, particularly since the current limitation\
    \ in groundwater resources might not be\nadequate to satisfy a change in the growing\
    \ season water requirement of maize in the future.\nFurthermore, Seneviratne et\
    \ al. [23] reported a likely increase, globally, in the frequency\nand severity\
    \ of extreme weather events.\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n3 of 26\nThe US High Plains—a\
    \ portion of the great plains—comprises eight states, which\ninclude South Dakota,\
    \ Nebraska, eastern Colorado, southern Wyoming, western Kansas,\nnorthwestern\
    \ Texas, eastern New Mexico, and northwestern Oklahoma. Together, these\nstates\
    \ produce more than 50 million tons of grain annually [27]. Agricultural production\
    \ in\nthe region depends heavily on irrigation activities, which account for approximately\
    \ 90% of\nthe yearly water use. Irrigation signiﬁcantly lowers heat stress on\
    \ maize, which is brought\non by extreme climatic conditions during the growing\
    \ season [28]. Research shows that\nirrigation increases the overall seasonal\
    \ biomass yield of crops in the region by 51% [27],\nwhich is approximately USD\
    \ 3 billion today. However, irrigation induces a strain on water\nresources, as\
    \ it further depletes the limited groundwater resources that are available [29].\n\
    A related study shows that the current groundwater management conditions in the\
    \ High\nPlains region are inadequate and may lead to a decrease in maize production\
    \ by acreage by\nas much as 60% if no further adaptation strategies are implemented\
    \ [2]. Furthermore, a\nlong-term trend analysis of climate in western Kansas,\
    \ which is a part of the High Plains\nregion, revealed that the annual number\
    \ of frost-free days has increased by 5.2 days [30].\nWith this rate of warming,\
    \ future moisture loss from evapotranspiration can rise, which\nwill lead to a\
    \ corresponding increase in the amount of water needed to irrigate the maize\n\
    crop. This can eventually impact the crop yield, as the limited amount of groundwater\n\
    might not be adequate to support the irrigation demand, which is determined by\
    \ the crop\nevapotranspiration estimates.\nCrop evapotranspiration is often modeled\
    \ as a function of the reference evapotran-\nspiration ETo, which accounts for\
    \ most of the environmental inﬂuences like temperature,\nsolar radiation, and\
    \ wind, and the crop coefﬁcients (Kc), which account for the effects of\ncrop\
    \ characteristics like crop height, albedo, canopy resistance, and even evaporation\
    \ from\nthe soil [31]. ETo estimation models may be broadly classiﬁed into the\
    \ following: (1) fully\nphysically based models such as the widely accepted Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation, and the\nSurface Energy Balance System (SEBS) [32] that incorporates\
    \ mass and energy conservation\nprinciples; (2) semi-physically based models like\
    \ the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm\nfor Land (SEBAL), the mapping evapotranspiration\
    \ at high resolution with internalized\nCalibration (METRIC) model, and the Variable\
    \ Inﬁltration Capacity model—often applied\nin spatiotemporal studies using remote\
    \ sensing—which combines empirical adjustments\nwith either mass or energy conservation\
    \ principles [33–35]; and (3) black-box or machine\nlearning models based on artiﬁcial\
    \ neural networks [36,37], adaptive neuro fuzzy com-\nputing [38], and genetic\
    \ algorithms [39], which estimate ETo by learning patterns and\nrelationships\
    \ from a given set of input data. Physically based models are computationally\n\
    demanding as they require a lot of data, and as a result, they can be cost intensive.\
    \ In\ncontrast, semi-physically based models [33] offer less expensive options,\
    \ especially when\ncarrying out studies over larger areas.\nHowever, due to recent\
    \ advances in technologies and processing capabilities, machine\nlearning (ML)\
    \ models are becoming popular in estimating ETo, and also in studying its\nassociated\
    \ climatic impacts. This is largely because machine learning models are more\n\
    effective than other methods at predicting both linear and non-linear relationships,\
    \ as is\noften the case for climate-related phenomena [40,41]. ML models such\
    \ as random forest\n(RF), support vector machine, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs),\
    \ and many more have\nbeen applied in predicting crop water demands and crop water\
    \ stress [42] for various\nvegetation types [43] and under limited climatic data\
    \ [44,45]. For example, a comparative\nstudy in China [46] evaluated the performance\
    \ of simple tree-based machine learning\nmodels like random forest (RF), extreme\
    \ gradient boosting (XGBoost), and the M5 model in\ncomparison to other related\
    \ machine learning models like support vector machines (SVMs).\nThe result indicates\
    \ that based on determining factors like complexity level, prediction\naccuracy,\
    \ stability, and computational costs, the RF model generally provided satisfactory\n\
    estimates of ETo (R2 > 0.9) in the temperate continental, mountain plateau, and\
    \ temperate\nmonsoon zones of China. In a similar study [47], the same determining\
    \ factors were used\nto compare RF, SVM, and gradient boosting on decision trees\
    \ with support for categorical\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n4 of 26\nfeatures (Catboost),\
    \ and it was revealed that in humid regions, the SVM generally exhibited\nhigher\
    \ levels of accuracy and stability (R2 > 0.98) for ETo estimation under limited\
    \ climatic\ndata, although it is worth noting that in the study, the RF model\
    \ also demonstrated a\nstrong performance during the model’s training phase, suggesting\
    \ a potential robustness\nacross different climatic zones. Furthermore, in a comprehensive\
    \ comparison of eight\nmachine learning models conducted across multiple climatic\
    \ regions in China [48], the\nSVM model demonstrated a strong prediction capability.\
    \ The study categorized the models\ninto different types, including neuron-based\
    \ models such as generalized regression neural\nnetworks (GRNNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ neural networks (MLP), and adaptive neuro-\nfuzzy inference systems (ANFISs);\
    \ kernel-based models like support vector machines\n(SVMs) and the kernel-based\
    \ nonlinear extension of Arps decline model (KNEA); tree-\nbased models like the\
    \ M5 model tree (M5Tree) and XGBoost, as well as a curve-based\nmodel called multivariate\
    \ adaptive regression spline (MARS). Among these models, the\nSVM model consistently\
    \ performed well and exhibited strong predictive capabilities across\nthe evaluated\
    \ regions in China.\nIn semi-arid regions like the High Plains region of the United\
    \ States, ML models\nhave also demonstrated their effectiveness in accurately\
    \ estimating evapotranspiration.\nIn Kansas, the RF model was observed to effectively\
    \ capture the temporal and spatial\nvariability of irrigation amounts with a satisfactory\
    \ accuracy (R2 = 0.82) using hydrome-\nteorological and remote sensing products\
    \ [49]. Similarly, in Texas, a comparative study\nbetween a linear regression\
    \ model and two more advanced ML models—artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks (ANNs) and\
    \ Gaussian process models (GPs)—was conducted to predict daily\nreference ET.\
    \ The ﬁndings indicate that the GP machine learning model yielded the highest\n\
    estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.95) [50]. These results highlight the effectiveness\
    \ of ML models\nin accurately estimating ET in semi-arid regions, therefore showcasing\
    \ the potential of\ncapturing the complex relationships associated with ET estimation.\
    \ However, most of these\nstudies were conducted using mean meteorological variables\
    \ and only considering the\nimpacts of mean climate change conditions. The seasonal\
    \ interactions of extreme climate\nconditions with crop evapotranspiration, which\
    \ is a crucial component in determining crop\nyield, have not yet been extensively\
    \ studied.\nTo ensure well-informed decision making with regard to irrigation,\
    \ it is therefore\nnecessary to study the impacts of these climate extremes on\
    \ crop ET, especially in the face\nof climate change. There is also a need to\
    \ quantify how much change in seasonal crop water\nrequirements of a water-intense\
    \ crop like maize is likely to occur in the future, given the\nlikelihood of an\
    \ increase in the intensity and duration of extreme climate occurrences. The\n\
    objectives of this study, therefore, are (i) to analyze historical weather data\
    \ to determine\nwhich climate extremes most inﬂuence crop ET, and (ii) to use\
    \ a machine-learning-based\nmodel to quantify the seasonal change in crop ET for\
    \ future climate change scenarios.\n2. Data and Methods\n2.1. Study Area\nThe\
    \ southwest portion of Kansas is semi-arid. Its annual minimum and maximum\ntemperatures\
    \ are averaged at 4 ◦C and 20 ◦C, respectively [51]. Also, the mean annual pre-\n\
    cipitation is less than 500 mm, with a positive trend of only about 2.54 mm per\
    \ decade [52].\nFinney County (latitude = 38.0625◦ N, longitude = 100.8903◦ W,\
    \ elevation of 867 m), which\nis located in the southwest part of Kansas, was\
    \ selected as the area of focus for this study.\nDuring the growing season—usually\
    \ from May to October—Finney County (Figure 1)\nexperiences an average precipitation\
    \ of 349 mm, a maximum temperature of 28.3 ◦C, and\na minimum temperature of 12.3\
    \ ◦C, respectively [53]. Furthermore, only approximately\n35% of the reference\
    \ evapotranspiration is met by the yearly precipitation, and during the\ngrowing\
    \ season, the percentage usually falls between 29 and 48% [53]. The arid condition\n\
    in the region can be seen in the 30-year time series plot of annual cumulative\
    \ precipitation\nand evapotranspiration shown in Figure 1 below. This makes groundwater\
    \ supplies a\ncrucial resource for agricultural productivity in the study area.\
    \ There are 1629 wells used\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n5 of 26\nfor irrigation; however,\
    \ the water table in some of the wells has dropped by 15 m since\n1950 [54] due\
    \ to excess pumping.\n°C, and a minimum temperature of 12.3 °C, respectively [53].\
    \ Furthermore, only approxi-\nmately 35% of the reference evapotranspiration is\

    \ Regional Climate Center\n(HPRCC) for a 30-year historical time period (from\
    \ 1991 to 2020). Eleven indices (Table 1)\nrepresenting agriculturally relevant\
    \ climate extremes [56] were calculated from HPRCC\ntemperature and precipitation\
    \ datasets following the procedure recommended by the\nExpert Team on Climate\
    \ Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) [57,58]. To represent\nmoderate climate\
    \ extreme indicators, a core set of 27 indices was ﬁrst created by the ETC-\n\
    CDI. The initial set of indices developed, however, could not be used in many\
    \ specialized\ndisciplines, such as agriculture. The indices were then revised\
    \ by the Expert Team on\nSector-Speciﬁc Climate Indices (ET-SCI) to make them\
    \ useful for speciﬁc industries like\nagriculture. Therefore, the indices chosen\
    \ for this study were those that were considered\nto be pertinent to agricultural\
    \ crop production, particularly for growing maize. These\nindices were also selected\
    \ based on their capability to be aggregated at a weekly temporal\nresolution,\
    \ unlike other indices published by the ETCCDI, which were commonly aggre-\ngated\
    \ at a monthly or annual temporal scale. The calculated indices were aggregated\
    \ to a\nweekly temporal scale for the maize growing period to ensure the homogeneity\
    \ of their\ntemporal resolution with that of the crop ET data. Indices derived\
    \ from precipitation and\ntemperatures data were categorized as precipitation-based\
    \ indices and temperature-based\nindices, respectively. Indices of temperature\
    \ expressed in percentages—which are com-\nmonly called warm spells—were further\

    2.2.2. Estimation of Crop Evapotranspiration\nThe crop evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ was estimated using two variables, including the\nreference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo), which was calculated from weather data extracted\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n\
    7 of 26\nfrom the High Plains Regional Climate Center (HPRCC), and crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kc) data\n(Equation (1)) using the following:\nETc = Kc × ETo.\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ ETc is the crop evapotranspiration in mmday−1; Kc is the crop coefﬁcient; and\
    \ ETo\nis the reference evapotranspiration in mmday−1.\nThis crop coefﬁcient approach\
    \ in Equation (1) above is recommended by the Food and\nAgriculture Organization\
    \ (FAO) for estimating ETc more accurately from weather datasets\nwhen ﬁeld measurements\
    \ are not readily available [59]. The step-by-step procedure applied\nis similar\
    \ to the one reported by Reyes-González et al. [60], as shown in Figure 3. The\
    \ ETo\nwas estimated using the FAO Penman–Monteith equation (Equation (2)) [61]\
    \ and from\nweather datasets extracted for Finney County from the HPRCC using\
    \ the following:\nETo =\n0.408∆(Rn − G) + γ\n900\nT+273u2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ(1 +\
    \ 0.34u2)\n.\n(2)\nwhere ETo is the reference evapotranspiration in mmday−1; Rn\
    \ is the net radiation at the\ncrop surface in MJm−2day−1; T is the average daily\
    \ temperature at 2 m height in ◦C; u2 is\nthe wind speed at 2 m height in ms−1;\
    \ (e s − ea) represent the saturation vapor pressure\ndeﬁcit in kPa; ∆ is the\
    \ slope vapor pressure curve in kPa ◦C−1; γ is the psychometric\nconstant (kPa\
    \ ◦C−1); and G is the soil heat ﬂux in MJm−2day−1, which was considered to\nbe\
    \ equal to zero. This assumption is in accordance with recommendations provided\
    \ by\nAllen et al. [61] for calculating ETo at daily time steps, using a well-watered\
    \ hypothetical\ncrop of height of 0.12 m, albedo of 0.23, and a ﬁxed surface resistance\
    \ of 70 sm−1, as\na reference.\nCrop coefﬁcient (Kc) of maize crop was estimated\
    \ from remotely sensed normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI). The FAO’s\
    \ irrigation and drainage paper 56 [31]\nprovide Kc values for maize at the early,\
    \ midseason, and late season phases of growth.\nHowever, these values do not take\
    \ into consideration the daily and weekly variations of\nKc values throughout\
    \ the course of the full growing season. Several studies [62–65] have\nreported\
    \ that a linear relationship exists between the single Kc and the NDVI. Wieder-\n\
    stein et al. [66] compared Kc values of maize, which he estimated from several\
    \ of these\nempirical relationships reported by researchers, using NDVI raster\
    \ images extracted from\nthe Landsat 7 satellite and aerial images captured from\
    \ uncrewed aircraft. He found that\nKamble et al.’s [64] empirical model for Kc\
    \ produced the best results in Finney County.\nWe therefore applied Kamble et\
    \ al.’s [64] empirical model in this study to determine Kc\nvalues for maize using\
    \ NDVI data. Surface reﬂectance images were extracted from both the\nLandsat 5\
    \ satellite for the period of 1991 to 2000 and the Landsat 7 satellite for the\
    \ years\n2001 to 2020. NDVI was computed using the surface reﬂectance values in\
    \ near-infrared\n(NIR) and red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in the\
    \ widely applied NDVI index\n(Equation (3)) [67,68] as follows:\nNDVI = NIR −\
    \ RED\nNIR + RED.\n(3)\nwhere NDVI is normalized difference vegetation index;\
    \ NIR is percent reﬂectance of light\nin the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum; RED is percent reﬂectance of\nlight in the red region of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum.\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n8 of 26\n(3)) [67,68] as follows: \n\U0001D441\

    The images obtained from the Landsat satellite sensors are often subject to various\
    \ \ninﬂuences, including atmospheric eﬀects and bidirectional reﬂectance distribution\
    \ func-\ntion (BRDF), which result from the sun’s position, sensor view angle,\
    \ and the nature of \nthe terrain [69]. Due to the combination of atmospheric\
    \ inﬂuences with these BRDF eﬀects, \nremote sensing techniques might be particularly\
    \ challenging, especially in mountainous \nregions with steep slopes. Although\
    \ the study area chosen for this research is a relatively \nﬂat area with an average\
    \ slope of less than 2% and an elevation of 867 m above sea level \n[53], the\
    \ potential errors that may arise from variations in the elevation and slope,\
    \ as well \nas potential atmospheric eﬀects on the quality of the images, were\
    \ taken into considera-\ntion. To address potential errors that may occur due\
    \ to the BRDF eﬀects, the Landsat sat-\nellite surface reﬂectance products were\
    \ pre-processed [70] by using approximated BRDF \nFigure 3. Flowchart showing\
    \ procedure for modeling crop ET from crop coefﬁcient and climate\nextreme indices.\
    \ Adapted from Reyes-González et al. [60].\nThe images obtained from the Landsat\
    \ satellite sensors are often subject to various\ninﬂuences, including atmospheric\
    \ effects and bidirectional reﬂectance distribution function\n(BRDF), which result\
    \ from the sun’s position, sensor view angle, and the nature of the\nterrain [69].\
    \ Due to the combination of atmospheric inﬂuences with these BRDF effects,\nremote\
    \ sensing techniques might be particularly challenging, especially in mountainous\n\
    regions with steep slopes. Although the study area chosen for this research is\
    \ a relatively\nﬂat area with an average slope of less than 2% and an elevation\
    \ of 867 m above sea level [53],\nthe potential errors that may arise from variations\
    \ in the elevation and slope, as well as\npotential atmospheric effects on the\
    \ quality of the images, were taken into consideration. To\naddress potential\
    \ errors that may occur due to the BRDF effects, the Landsat satellite surface\n\
    reﬂectance products were pre-processed [70] by using approximated BRDF parameters,\n\
    which are derived from complex algorithms [71]. To further eliminate atmospheric\
    \ effects,\nthe Landsat surface reﬂectance images were processed further within\
    \ the Google Earth\nEngine (GEE) code editor platform. This process involved ﬁltering\
    \ out only the days with\nno cloud cover (i.e., cloud cover = 0%). The ﬁltered\
    \ images were then clipped to a raster\nmask of maize-cultivated ﬁelds in Finney\
    \ County using ESRI’s ArcGIS pro software. The\nraster mask containing pixels\
    \ for maize growing areas was extracted from the cropland\ndata layer (CDL) of\
    \ the USDA [55]. The clipped images of NDVI were then imported into\nGEE platform\
    \ for additional processing. Since the NDVI data were only available for every\n\
    16 days because of the Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 thematic mapper satellites’ 16-day\
    \ revisit\ncycles, further data processing was required in order to provide daily\
    \ time series for NDVI.\nSeveral researchers have adopted statistical smoothing\
    \ techniques such as the weighted\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n9 of 26\nleast-squares\
    \ linear regression method, Kernel, and Gaussian smoothing techniques to\nincrease\
    \ the data quality of time series NDVI [72–74]. The Gaussian technique was applied\n\
    to the NDVI curve using the “gam” function in R [75] in order to extract the NDVI\
    \ data\nat daily time steps. The power of polynomial (k = 300) was found to produce\
    \ the best\napproximation of the seasonal and temporal pattern of the estimated\
    \ NDVI data. The\nsmoothened daily NDVI values were then aggregated to weekly\
    \ time steps to homogenize\nwith the temporal resolution of the climate extreme\
    \ indices and the evapotranspiration\ndata. The selected NDVI-based Kc model (Equation\
    \ (4)) [64] was then used to estimate crop\ncoefﬁcient values from the 30-year\
    \ historical NDVI data.\nKc = 1.4571 ∗ NDVI − 0.1725.\n(4)\nThe obtained values\
    \ of Kc were then multiplied with the FAO Penman–Monteith\nreference ET to obtain\
    \ the potential crop ET of maize using Equation (1). The estimated\ncrop coefﬁcients\
    \ were kept constant in historical and future time periods, because the\neffects\
    \ of various weather conditions on crop evapotranspiration are largely accounted\
    \ for\nby the reference evapotranspiration estimate [31], while the crop-speciﬁc\
    \ characteristics\nare integrated into the crop coefﬁcient, which is primarily\
    \ inﬂuenced by physiological\ndevelopment stages of the crop, irrigation management,\
    \ and soil conditions.\n2.2.3. Future Climate Data and Extreme Indices\nFuture\
    \ climate data for Finney County were retrieved from twenty global climate\nmodels\
    \ (GCMs) (Table 2), for a 75-year time period, which were divided into the near-term\n\
    period (2025–2049), the mid-term period (2050–2074), and the end-of-century period\
    \ (2075–\n2099). GCMs are chosen based on how well they perform in capturing the\
    \ dynamics of\nvarious climate phenomena, including precipitation, the paciﬁc\
    \ oscillations, the dynamics of\nthe El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and\
    \ robust simulations of future climate scenar-\nios. The ability of each GCM to\
    \ model a particular climate process, however, varies because\nof the complexity\
    \ of climate processes [76]. As a result, an ensemble of GCMs is frequently\n\
    used in climate change research in order to account for the numerous errors and\
    \ biases\nthat may be present in the individual models. The Coupled Model Intercomparison\
    \ Project\nPhase 5 (CMIP5) output of daily statistically downscaled data [77]\
    \ has been pre-processed\nby the University of Idaho to extract daily future temperature\
    \ and precipitation data for\nthe 20 GCMs available at a 1/24-degree spatial resolution.\
    \ The data were downscaled\nusing the multivariate adaptative constructed analogs\
    \ (MACA) method [78]. In this study,\ntwo representative concentration pathways\
    \ (RCPs) developed by the intergovernmental\npanel on climate change were taken\
    \ into account, including the RCP4.5 scenario, which\nprojects that reduced greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions will stabilize radiative forcing at about\n4.5 Wm−2, and the RCP8.5\
    \ scenario, which projects that greenhouse gas emissions will\nincrease radiative\
    \ forcing above 8.5 Wm−2 by the end of the century, implying much higher\nwarming\
    \ in the future under RCP8.5 than under the RCP4.5 scenario. These data were used\n\
    to calculate the same set of climate extreme indices that were previously calculated\
    \ using\nhistorical weather data. The calculated indices were then used as input\
    \ data to predict\nreference evapotranspiration for each GCM and for both the\
    \ RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n10 of 26\nTable 2. Statistically\

    \ of Machine Learning Model and Performance Evaluation\nThe random forest (RF)\
    \ regression model [80,81] was used to model the association\nbetween climate\
    \ extremes and crop ET. Studies show that when compared to linear and\ngeneralized\
    \ additive models, the random forest machine learning (ML) model performed\nbetter\
    \ in estimating linear and non-linear relationships involving climate change parameters\n\
    with minimal errors [41,82]. RFs are regression-type ML techniques that are devised\
    \ for\ncreating a prediction ensemble utilizing numerous decision trees that are\
    \ randomly trained\non a subset of the input data [80]. Each decision tree is\
    \ produced by randomly resampling\nthe input data using bootstrapping approach.\
    \ The same sample of predictors may be chosen\nfor splitting at each node, and\
    \ the trees run independently of one another [83]. The RF\nmodel was validated\
    \ by splitting the dataset containing the eleven climate extreme indices\ninto\
    \ two parts, including an initial 70% of the data, which were used to train the\
    \ model,\nand the remaining 30% of the data, which were used to test the model.\
    \ To improve the RF\nmodel’s performance, the model parameters were adjusted through\
    \ a process known as\n“tuning.” The parameters tuned for optimum performance were\
    \ the number of trees (ntree),\nwhich speciﬁes the number of trees that can be\
    \ generated, and the mtry parameter, which\nrandomly distributes the variables\
    \ that are used as candidates at each split to form the\ndatasets on which the\
    \ trees are formed [84]. Using 70% of the data for the parameter tuning\nresulted\
    \ in the optimal RF model parameters being the number of variables randomly\n\
    sampled at each split (mtry = 4) and the number of regression trees to build (ntree\
    \ = 500).\nThe coefﬁcient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE),\
    \ and mean absolute\nerror (MAE) statistics were used to assess the model’s performance\
    \ accuracy on both the\ntraining and the test data. The coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ given by Equation (5) quantiﬁes\nthe percentage of variance in the response\
    \ variable that can be explained by the predictor\nvariables [85]. Therefore,\
    \ it indicates how well the data ﬁt the model. Similarly, when\ncomparing predicted\
    \ values to actual values in a dataset, the root mean squared error\n(Equation\
    \ (6)) reveals the square root of the average squared difference between them.\
    \ The\nlower the RMSE, the better the model ﬁts the data [86]. Additionally, the\
    \ mean absolute\nerror (Equation (7)) is a measure of the average deviation of\
    \ the predicted values of a model\nfrom the actual values [87]. These statistical\
    \ metrics deﬁned above were utilized to assess\nthe RF model’s effectiveness on\
    \ both the test and training period data.\nR2 = 1 − ∑m\ni=1(Xi − Yi)2\n∑m\ni=1\n\

    \ 1\nm\nm\n∑\ni=1\n|Xi − Yi|.\n(7)\nwhere Xi is the predicted value; Yi is the\
    \ actual value; ¯Y is the mean of the actual values; m\nis the number of samples\
    \ in the equations above.\nThe inﬂuence of each climate extreme index on crop\
    \ ET was determined using a\nvariable importance plot. The variable importance\
    \ plot in an RF model illustrates how the\nelimination of each variable affects\
    \ the mean squared error (MSE) of the model. Therefore,\nvariables that have a\
    \ greater inﬂuence on the MSE of the model will have a negative\nimpact on evapotranspiration.\
    \ Additionally, the variable importance plot is very useful\nfor reducing the\
    \ complexity of machine learning models, since it identiﬁes and selects the\n\
    most crucial predictors [88]. As a result, it can be used to eliminate variables\
    \ that have the\nleast impact on the accuracy of the model, further simplifying\

    Future prediction of weekly crop ETo was estimated using the RF model, using climate\n\
    extreme variables that were extracted from 20 GCMs each, under the two gas emission\n\
    scenarios considered in the study, and for three future time periods including\
    \ the near-term\n(2025–2049), mid-term (2050–2074), and end-of-century (2075–2099)\
    \ periods. The conﬁdence\nin the model predictions rely on the performance of\
    \ the already developed RF model [89],\nwhich was assessed using statistical metrics.\
    \ We computed the average ensemble of the ETo\nforecasts from the 20 selected\
    \ GCMs for each scenario and time period. The ensemble of ETo\nforecasts were\
    \ then multiplied with the crop coefﬁcient values to estimate ETc. An analysis\n\
    of variance (ANOVA) test [90] was performed at a 95% conﬁdence level to determine\
    \ if\nthe forecasted mean crop ET values for all the future scenarios were signiﬁcantly\
    \ different\nfrom the historical time period and from each other. Since an ANOVA\
    \ test does not provide\ninformation about which of the future time periods show\
    \ signiﬁcant differences in means\nfrom each other and from the historical time\
    \ period, we further performed Dunnett’s\ntest [91] on the forecasted crop ET\
    \ values for the three time periods using the historical\ncrop ET values as the\
    \ control group, and then compared each forecasted crop ET values\nwith the crop\
    \ ET determined from historical weather data so as to quantify the expected\n\
    percentage change in crop ET in the future.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Summary\
    \ Statistics for Historical Climate Extreme Indices\nOccurrences of unusually\
    \ extreme weather conditions during the growing season\npose a threat to the sustainability\
    \ of maize production in the High Plains region. This is\nbecause they affect\
    \ the crop evapotranspiration rates, which may have an effect on the\nregion’s\
    \ limited water resources. Climate extreme indices, which represent instances\
    \ of\nextreme weather and are thought to affect the evapotranspiration rate of\
    \ maize, were\nselected and used as input variables in a random forest model in\
    \ order to estimate reference\nevapotranspiration from which to determine the\
    \ actual crop water requirement. Figure 4\nbelow comprises boxplots of summary\
    \ statistics showing the weekly variations in the\noccurrences of these eleven\
    \ selected climate extreme indices during the maize growing\nseason. Figure 4a\
    \ shows the boxplot summary of indices derived from the precipitation\ndata, Figure\
    \ 4b represents the summary of indices derived from the temperature data, and\n\
    Figure 4c is a summary of the indices of temperature expressed in percentages,\
    \ represented\nhere as percentile-based indices. The mean weekly maximum number\
    \ of consecutive dry\ndays (CDDs) over a 30-year period was 4.2 days, with a standard\
    \ deviation of 2.1 days.\nAlthough the CDD showed less variability, as indicated\
    \ by its coefﬁcient of variation of\n48.6%, the upper quartile (75th percentile)\
    \ of the data revealed that there were instances of\nup to six consecutive days\
    \ in the week being completely dry or having a weekly rainfall\namount of less\
    \ than 1 mm. Similarly, the mean weekly total precipitation was 12.8 mm, with\n\
    an SD of 17.6 mm, while the mean of the consecutive wet days was 1.7 days, with\
    \ an SD of\n1.6 days. The observed signiﬁcant deviations from their means explain\
    \ their high coefﬁcient\nof variations of about 137.7% and 92.8%, respectively.\
    \ A similar analysis of the distribution\nof rainfall in western Kansas [92] showed\
    \ that there is signiﬁcant variability in the precipita-\ntion patterns due to\
    \ the climate, with an overall tendency of drier conditions. Our analysis\nalso\
    \ showed high variations in the warm spells, which comprises the weekly percentage\
    \ of\ndays with a minimum temperature (Tmin) that is greater than the 90th percentile\
    \ (mean\n= 26.2%, SD = 29.3%), and the weekly percentage of days with a maximum\
    \ temperature\n(Tmax) that is greater than the 90th percentile (mean = 26.2%,\
    \ SD = 29.3%). Both displayed\nCVs of 116.3% and 111.9%, respectively. We observed\
    \ up to 42.2% days in a week where the\ntemperature was greater than the 90th\
    \ percentile. This is similar to the study by Anandhi\net al. [93], which reported\
    \ that for Kansas, the annual warm spells typically last up to 4 days\non average\
    \ (i.e., up to 60% of days in a week), especially in the summer months. Similarly,\n\
    other temperature-derived indices such as the mean weekly minimum temperature\
    \ (mean\n= 14.2 ◦C, SD = 4.8 ◦C), the mean weekly maximum temperature (mean =\
    \ 29.5 ◦C, SD =\nLand 2023, 12, 1500\n13 of 26\n5.3 ◦C), the weekly number of\
    \ days with Tmax greater than 30 ◦C (mean = 3.7 days, SD\n= 2.4 days), and the\
    \ daily temperature range (mean = 15.3 ◦C, SD = 2.7 ◦C) in a week all\nshowed\
    \ less seasonal variation than the precipitation-based indices. Their CVs of 33.6%,\n\
    18.1%, 65.7%, 17.8%, and 92.8%, respectively, implied that their individual weekly\
    \ varia-\ntions remained relatively constant throughout the entire growing season\
    \ from year to year.\nMeanwhile, much higher variations surpassing those of all\
    \ the other indices were observed\nin the weekly number of days with a mean temperature\
    \ of less than 10 ◦C (mean = 0.1 days,\nSD = 0.5) and in the tropical nights (mean\
    \ = 0.6 and SD = 1.1), as indicated by the high\ncoefﬁcient of variations (CV)\
    \ of 401.7%, and 188.4%, respectively. These extremely high\nvalues were expected,\
    \ however. This is due to the fact that their mean values were very\nclose to\
    \ zero, causing the CV to become very sensitive to changes in the mean. However,\n\
    the boxplot summary of the weekly number of days with a mean temperature of less\
    \ than\n10 ◦C was skewed to the right with an unusually high frequency of outliers,\
    \ indicating\nmultiple occurrences of cold temperatures with signiﬁcantly higher\
    \ magnitudes than the\nmean observations.\nLand 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n\

    \ Maize Pixels\nUsing Kamble et al.’s [64] linear regression model, the values\
    \ of the average weekly\ncrop coefﬁcient (Kc) for the pixels of maize were determined\
    \ using Landsat NDVI images.\nThe estimated Kc curve (Figure 5) follows a similar\
    \ trend with the maize crop coefﬁcient\ncurve reported in the FAO’s irrigation\
    \ and drainage paper 56 [31]. The Kc curve typically\nstarts out with low values\
    \ at the initial growth stage of maize, and gradually increases\nover the ﬁrst\
    \ 4 weeks (0–30 days) after planting. It reaches its apex at the midseason stage,\n\
    when the canopy ground cover is between 25% and 60%, before declining to a constant\n\
    value at the end stage, which typically occurs 12 to 24 weeks (50 to 170 days)\
    \ after planting.\nDuring the early stage of growth, the estimated minimum Kc\
    \ value was 0.46, while the\nmaximum value observed was 0.65. The observed mean\
    \ value for the early growth season,\nwhich was averaged over the 30-year historical\
    \ time period, was 0.55, indicating higher\nvalues than the Kc value of 0.35,\
    \ which was reported by the FAO for the initial growth\nstage. This variation\
    \ in the values can be attributed to the differing ﬁeld conditions and\nmanagement\
    \ practices of the corn ﬁelds in Finney County compared to the conditions in\n\
    which the FAO Kc values were developed. The FAO provides Kc values based on standard\n\
    climate conditions involving a sub-humid climate with an average minimum relative\n\
    humidity of 45% and a moderate windspeed of 2 ms−1. However, ﬁeld conditions often\n\
    differ signiﬁcantly from that of the FAO, as seen in a similar study by Singh\
    \ and Irmak,\nperformed in southcentral Nebraska [94], and also in a study by\
    \ Abedinpour Meysam in\nNew Delhi, India [95]. Similarly, during the midseason\
    \ growth stage, when the crop reaches\nits peak, the values of Kc ranged between\
    \ 0.55 and 0.99, with peak estimated values of up to\n1.06. Meanwhile, the mean\
    \ peak value of Kc for the 30-year period was 0.90, thus showing\na slight under-estimation\
    \ when compared to the typical FAO value of 1.2. This difference\nis likely due\
    \ to the normalization of peak values of Kc, resulting from averaging all of the\n\
    Landsat NDVI values from the pixels of maize-growing areas to produce a single\
    \ value of\nNDVI for each day. During the late season, the Kc values ranged between\
    \ 0.19 and 0.30. The\nmean value was estimated at 0.24. The FAO value for this\
    \ phase typically ranges between\n0.60 and 0.35 depending on whether the crop\
    \ was harvested fresh or dried, respectively.\nThese ﬁndings suggest that the\
    \ Kc values for maize are inﬂuenced by site-speciﬁc variables,\nand therefore\
    \ underscores the importance of the site-speciﬁc calibration of Kc values for\n\
    accurate crop ET calculations. For semi-arid areas like Finney County in western\
    \ Kansas,\nthe FAO irrigation and drainage paper offers adjustment steps, including\
    \ considering the\nfrequency of growing season irrigation events, to adjust the\
    \ Kc values appropriately before\nthey are used to calculate the actual crop ET.\n\
    3.3. RF Model Performance Evaluation\nAfter training the RF ML model using 70%\
    \ of the entire data and testing it on the\nremaining 30% of the data, our analysis\
    \ showed that these selected climate extreme indices\nexplained up to 70% variability\
    \ (R2 = 0.70) in crop ET on the training data and up to 71%\nvariability (R2 =\
    \ 0.71) on the test data (Figure 6), implying a satisfactorily robust model.\n\
    However, we observed that the R2 also increased to about 80% when more variables\
    \ of\nmean weather conditions such as the solar radiation and wind speed were\
    \ added as inputs\nto the model. It was therefore evident that the R2 is not always\
    \ a good metric for evaluating\nthe accuracy of the model, even though it has\
    \ been recommended and widely accepted\nby researchers as a metric for evaluating\
    \ machine learning models [96]. The training set’s\nRMSE and MAE values were observed\
    \ to be 5.73 mm and 4.41 mm, respectively, while\nfor the test data, the RMSE\
    \ and MAE values were 5.35 mm and 4.30 mm, respectively. A\ncomparison between\
    \ the observed evapotranspiration from the test data and the predicted\nevapotranspiration\
    \ revealed that both very low and large levels of ET were underestimated\nby the\
    \ model. This is probably because RF averages values at each node’s end when\n\
    building decision trees, causing extremely high values to be averaged with low\
    \ values.\nThis was observed in a similar study by Khanal et al. [82].\nLand 2023,\

    \ an inability to meet the crop water demands of\nthe maize crop. This has critical\
    \ implications, as inadequate water supply might impact\ncrop productivity, and\
    \ ultimately, food security. Although crop ET was reported to vary\ngreatly based\
    \ on a number of other factors such as the planting date and the irrigation\n\
    management [48], it is advised that robust frameworks be put in place to monitor\
    \ growing\nseason climate extremes and understand their likely impacts so as to\
    \ develop adaptation\nand mitigation strategies against the impacts.\nFurthermore,\
    \ this study provides future projections of crop ET under two represen-\ntative\
    \ concentration pathway scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The projections, based on\n\
    the ensemble of 20 downscaled GCMs, revealed that crop ET would increase signiﬁcantly\n\
    under both scenarios in the near-century, mid-term, and end-of-century timeframes.\
    \ More\nsigniﬁcant increases were predicted under the RCP8.5 scenario, emphasizing\
    \ the necessity\nof reducing greenhouse gas emissions to lessen the effects of\
    \ climate change on agriculture.\nIn comparison to the historical time period,\
    \ an average ensemble of the models under\nRCP4.5 indicated an increase in the\
    \ weekly ET by 0.4% in the near-term period, 3.1% in the\nmid-term period, and\
    \ 3.8% by the end of the century, while predictions under the RCP8.5\nscenario\
    \ indicated an increase in the weekly ET by 1.7% in the near-term period, 5.9%\
    \ in the\nmid-term period, and 9.6% by the end of the century. The overall results\
    \ of this study imply\na steady potential increase in crop water requirement in\
    \ the future. With the aid of these\npredicted crop ET data and the anticipated\
    \ changes in crop ET during the growing season,\nagricultural producers can be\
    \ better informed in developing strategies to optimize their\nuse of the limited\
    \ water resources, particularly where limited water rights are allotted to\nproducers.\
    \ Some of the strategies may include adopting more efﬁcient irrigation techniques,\n\
    cultivating maize cultivars that are more drought tolerant, and other precision\
    \ agriculture\ntechniques that could be relevant in increasing crop productivity\
    \ while reducing groundwa-\nter pumping. Additionally, it is imperative to assess\
    \ the current management practices in\nthe region to evaluate their adaptability\
    \ to extreme climatic conditions. By identifying areas\nfor improvement and implementing\
    \ more efﬁcient technologies, farmers and stakeholders\ncan optimize production\
    \ while reducing the vulnerability to climate extremes and ensuring\nthe long-term\
    \ sustainability of agriculture.\nThe effects of these extremes on evapotranspiration,\
    \ however, were examined by con-\nsidering the individual inﬂuence of each extreme\
    \ index. However, some of these extreme\nconditions frequently take place in quick\
    \ succession or all at once [104]. These situations\nare frequently referred to\
    \ as compound extremes. Recent studies [33,105] have reported\nthat the combined\
    \ effects of dry periods and warming on the evaporative demand are\nlikely responsible\
    \ for changes in groundwater levels. Therefore, studying these compound\nextremes\
    \ might prove to be valuable since their combined effects can have a greater impact\n\
    on crop ET, and eventually, the end-of-season crop yield. Also, some indices such\
    \ as the\nCombined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI) [106], the Evaporative\
    \ Demand\nDrought Index (EDDI), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI)\nuse anomalies in atmospheric evaporative demand and precipitation\
    \ to establish a rela-\ntionship with climate extreme conditions, especially droughts.\
    \ These indices might better\nestimate the nature of relationships between climate\
    \ extremes and crop water needs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.I.\

    \ an approach using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR)\ndata and the Optirrig\
    \ crop growth and irrigation model to detect irrigation dates and amounts for\n\
    maize crops in the Occitanie region, Southern France. The surface soil moisture\
    \ (SSM) derived from\nSAR data was analyzed for changes indicating irrigation\
    \ events at the plot scale in four reference\nplots located in Montpellier (P1)\
    \ and Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4). As rain most likely covers several\nsquare kilometers,\
    \ while irrigation is decided at the plot scale, a difference between SSM signals\n\
    at the grid scale (10 km × 10 km) and plot scale is a clear indication of a recent\
    \ irrigation event.\nIts date and amount are then sought by forcing irrigation\
    \ dates and amounts in Optirrig, selecting\nthe most relevant (date, amount) combination\
    \ from an appropriate criterion. As the observed SSM\nvalues hold for a depth\
    \ of a few centimeters, while the modeled SSM values hold for exactly 10 cm,\n\
    the best irrigation combination is the one that gives similar relative changes\
    \ in SSM values rather\nthan similar SSM values. The irrigation dates were detected\
    \ with an overall accuracy (recall) of\n86.2% and a precision of 85.7%, and thus,\
    \ with relatively low numbers of missed or false irrigation\ndetections, respectively.\
    \ The performance of the method in detecting seasonal irrigation amounts\nvaried\
    \ with climatic conditions. For the P1 plot in the semi-arid climate of Montpellier,\
    \ the mean\nabsolute error percentage (MAE%) was 16.4%, showing a higher efﬁciency\
    \ when compared with\nthe humid climate of Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4 plots), where\
    \ a higher MAE% of 50% was recorded,\nindicating a larger discrepancy between\
    \ the detected and actual irrigation amounts. The limitations of\nthe proposed\
    \ method can be attributed to the characteristics of the Sentinel-1 constellation,\
    \ including\nits 6-day revisit time and signal penetration challenges in dense\
    \ maize cover, as well as the mismatch\nbetween the parameterization of Optirrig\
    \ for SSM simulations and the actual irrigation practices\nfollowed by farmers.\
    \ Despite these weaknesses, the results demonstrated the relevance of combining\n\
    Optirrig and S1 SAR-derived SSM data for ﬁeld-scale detection of irrigation dates\
    \ and, potentially,\nirrigation amounts.\nKeywords: Sentinel-1; surface soil moisture;\
    \ Optirrig; crop growth model; irrigation; maize\n1. Introduction\nIrrigated agriculture\
    \ is the largest consumer of fresh water, accounting for a substantial\n70% of\

    \ 36\nparticularly in water-scarce regions like the Mediterranean basin [2]. As\
    \ areas affected by\ndrought increase, irrigation becomes more and more crucial\
    \ for achieving optimal crop\ngrowth and production [3–5].\nSatellite remote sensing\
    \ has exhibited considerable effectiveness in the diagnostic\nand supervisory\
    \ aspects of irrigation, particularly in the context of mapping and monitor-\n\
    ing cropped and irrigated areas [6–8], either with optical [9–12] or radar sensors\
    \ [13–17].\nIn detail, the interpretation of several optical vegetation indices,\
    \ such as the NDVI [12],\nthe normalized difference water index (NDWI) [18], or\
    \ the greenness index (GI) [19],\nwas demonstrated to be effective in exploring\
    \ discrepancies in the spectral attributes of\ncrops [20]. Recently, Hamze et\
    \ al. [21] developed a novel methodology to detect irrigation\ndates and amounts\
    \ for maize crops in the Occitanie region, France, using leaf area index\n(LAI)\
    \ values derived from optical images and the Optirrig crop growth and irrigation\n\
    model. The approach involved analyzing cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S2) optical images\
    \ to iden-\ntify potential irrigation events and selecting the most probable event\
    \ that minimized the\ndifference between the predicted and observed LAI values\
    \ derived from S2. The method-\nology achieved an overall recall of 81.6% for\
    \ irrigation date detection when evaluated\nwith daily interpolated LAI data.\
    \ Although the methods described above, which depend\non optical satellite observations,\
    \ have shown promising outcomes in mapping irrigated\nareas and detecting irrigation\
    \ events, their effectiveness is constrained in various tropical\nand temperate\
    \ regions due to the sensitivity of optical data to weather conditions and\ncloud\
    \ cover.\nSurface soil moisture (SSM) is directly inﬂuenced by rain and irrigation\
    \ practices (time,\nfrequency, and amounts), which makes it relevant information\
    \ for irrigation detection and\nmonitoring or supervision purposes [22–24]. By\
    \ monitoring SSM at the plot scale, farmers\nand water managers can make informed\
    \ decisions about irrigation scheduling, optimizing\nwater resources, and maintaining\
    \ crop health for real-time irrigation monitoring, as well\nas long-term irrigation\
    \ practice supervision [25,26]. Over the past four decades, there has\nbeen notable\
    \ enhancement in the quality of surface soil moisture (SSM) products derived\n\
    from both active and passive microwave remote sensors [27]. These advancements\
    \ have\ngreatly improved the ability to estimate and monitor the moisture content\
    \ of the top layer\nof soil, typically not exceeding a depth of 10 cm [28]. Kumar\
    \ et al. [29] were the pioneers\nin utilizing the disparities between low-resolution\
    \ microwave-based SSM products, such\nas ASCAT [30], AMSR-2 [31], SMOS (Soil Moisture\
    \ and Ocean Salinity [32]), AMSR-E [33],\nWindSat [34], and ESA ECV (ESA’s essential\
    \ climate variable product [34]), and the SSM\nsimulated using a land surface\
    \ model (Noah) that does not include anthropogenic interven-\ntions like irrigation\
    \ [35]. Similarly, Malbéteau et al. [36] employed a comparable approach\nby assimilating\
    \ coarse-scale SSM data derived from SMOS products, disaggregated to a\n1 km resolution,\
    \ into a basic land surface model driven solely by precipitation. In this\nmethod,\
    \ irrigated areas were identiﬁed with satisfactory accuracy by examining the cu-\n\
    mulative analysis increment, which represents the difference between the analyzed\
    \ and\nbackground SSM values throughout the season. Similarly, Zaussinger et al.\
    \ [22] employed\nvarious coarse-resolution datasets and compared them with a water\
    \ balance driven by the\nMERRA-2 model in order to assess the utilization of irrigation\
    \ water. The examination\nconducted at a statewide level yielded divergent ﬁndings\
    \ (with correlation coefﬁcients\nranging from 0.36 to 0.8) and notably lower estimations\
    \ compared with the documented\nirrigation water withdrawals.\nHowever, the estimations\
    \ of irrigation mentioned above are generally obtained at\na monthly time scale\
    \ and for pixels covering several square kilometers (km2), making\nthem inadequate\
    \ for effective irrigation supervision, both in terms of spatial and temporal\n\
    resolutions. Therefore, acquiring irrigation information at the plot scale requires\
    \ the use\nof high-spatial-resolution SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data, which\
    \ was found to be\nespecially beneﬁcial for efﬁcient irrigation monitoring at\
    \ smaller agricultural scales. Hence,\nthe sensitivity of SAR signals to soil\
    \ and vegetation water could help in the detection of\nirrigation events, as irrigation\
    \ gradually enhances the water content of both the soil and\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n3 of 36\nvegetation. Extensive literature has consistently shown a\
    \ direct correlation between the\nSAR backscattering coefﬁcient (σ0) and the water\
    \ content of the soil and vegetation [37–40].\nAmong various SAR satellite constellations,\
    \ the Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR constellation (S1A and\nS1B) stands out as an effective\
    \ tool for mapping and monitoring large-scale irrigated areas.\nThis is attributed\
    \ to its unique combination of a high revisit time (6-day interval) and high\n\
    spatial resolution (pixel spacing of 10 m × 10 m). Benabdelouhab et al. [41] demonstrated\n\
    that C-band S1 SAR data can effectively detect irrigation activities in irrigated\
    \ wheat plots\nwith a three-day interval between irrigation and SAR acquisition.\
    \ Detecting consecutive\nirrigation events requires a comprehensive multi-temporal\
    \ dataset due to the dynamic\nnature of irrigation. In a recent study by Bazzi\
    \ et al. [17], a near real-time approach was\ndeveloped to determine irrigation\
    \ timing in diverse summer and winter crop ﬁelds located\nin France and Spain.\
    \ The approach involved a change detection methodology that examined\ntwo consecutive\
    \ S1 observations to detect irrigation activities using the S1 SAR σ0 and S2\n\
    NDVI. The ﬁndings revealed that the proposed method achieved an approximate overall\n\
    accuracy of 84% in detecting irrigation events that occurred in agricultural plots.\n\
    In addition, several studies showed the potential of SSM products derived from\n\
    S1 SAR observations for monitoring and detecting irrigation events over agricultural\n\
    areas [13,42–44] since the SAR signal is sensitive to SSM through the dielectric\
    \ properties of\nthe soil [45,46]. Le Page et al. [43] examined the potential\
    \ of the S2MP (Sentinel-1/Sentinel-\n2-derived soil moisture product [47]) in\
    \ detecting irrigation events at the individual plot\nlevel over irrigated maize\
    \ ﬁelds of southwest France. S2MP is a soil moisture estimation\nproduct that\
    \ combines Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data for SSM estimation\n\
    using the neural networks technique [47]. The results demonstrated a high accuracy\
    \ in\ndetecting irrigation timing, with an F-score ranging from 80% to 83% for\
    \ all the maize plots\nexamined. The ability to detect irrigation events from\
    \ SAR data is predominantly inﬂuenced\nby several factors, including the revisit\
    \ time; radar wavelength (SAR characteristics); and\nvegetation cover, which encompasses\
    \ crop type and growth phase [43]. Additionally, the\neffectiveness of irrigation\
    \ event detection may be impeded by extended revisit times that\ndo not align\
    \ with the rapid drying of the soil surface, which occurs within 2–3 days after\n\
    irrigation, resulting in water content values similar to those observed before\
    \ irrigation [48].\nMoreover, El Hajj et al. [49] demonstrated limitations in\
    \ estimating soil moisture over cereal\ncrops and grasslands using (C-band) S1\
    \ SAR data that were attributed to the limited signal\npenetration under well-developed\
    \ vegetation covers. Consequently, this highlights the\npotential advantages of\
    \ utilizing L-band data (lower frequency, longer wavelength, and\nenhanced penetration\
    \ capabilities) for future applications [50].\nFrom a different perspective, relying\
    \ on the modeling of biophysical processes, crop\ngrowth models have emerged as\
    \ highly valuable tools over the past three decades, en-\nabling the assessment\
    \ of agronomical needs and traits such as crop water requirements,\nbiomass, and\
    \ yield, which has made them suitable for crop development and monitoring\nirrigation\
    \ [51–53]. Extensive multidisciplinary efforts in crop modeling have led to the\n\
    reﬁnement of various dynamic process-based crop models incorporating water balance\n\
    and evapotranspiration components, such as AquaCrop [54], STICS [55], SAFYE [56],\
    \ and\nOptirrig [57]. The latter focuses on the identiﬁcation of appropriate plot-scale\
    \ water man-\nagement strategies while being as parsimonious as possible in the\
    \ description of plant\nphysiology and soil water budget dynamics. These models\
    \ were shown to be useful for\nmonitoring water application effects and stress\
    \ on plant growth, as well as simulating\nthe crop response to irrigation [58–62].\
    \ Consequently, crop models, such as Optirrig, are\nregarded as powerful tools\
    \ for deﬁning crop water requirements and optimizing irrigation\nmanagement strategies\
    \ based on management practices and soil conditions, particularly\nsoil water\
    \ balance [63,64]. Notably, soil water content plays a critical role in Optirrig,\
    \ as it\nrepresents the available water in the soil proﬁle for plant utilization,\
    \ which is essential for\npredicting crop development, biomass accumulation, and\
    \ overall crop yield. The Optirrig\ncrop model incorporates factors such as climatic\
    \ conditions, soil properties, and manage-\nment practices (e.g., irrigation,\
    \ sowing, and harvest dates) to simulate the water balance in\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n4 of 36\nthe soil [57,65]. For example, Mailhol et al. [65] conducted\
    \ a study on irrigated maize ﬁelds\nto assess the capabilities of the Pilote model\
    \ (subsequently transformed and enhanced to\nserve as the agronomic and hydrological\
    \ core of Optirrig) for crop development and yield\nprediction. The model demonstrated\
    \ the capacity to provide satisfactory simulations and\npredictions of leaf area\
    \ index (LAI) values, which is a pivotal variable within its conceptual\nand numerical\
    \ schemes due to its precise estimations of soil water balance, even in the\n\
    initial shallow reservoir of 10 cm in depth, throughout the crop’s growth cycle.\
    \ However,\nthe implementation of crop and irrigation models is often limited\
    \ by the availability of\ninput data [66], which could hamper the accuracy of\
    \ soil water content simulation in the\nmodel and, therefore, the accuracy of\
    \ crop yield predictions and irrigation scheduling [67].\nConsequently, the uncertainties\
    \ encountered in estimating daily or seasonal model vari-\nables, encompassing\
    \ soil water reserves, crop development, biomass accumulation, and\nﬁnal yield,\
    \ are frequently attributable to the limited understanding of soil characteristics\n\
    and crop management practices across extensive geographical extents [68,69].\n\
    To mitigate these uncertainties, several studies have integrated information obtained\n\
    from remote sensing-derived soil moisture data into crop and soil water models,\
    \ thereby\nenhancing agricultural assessments and irrigation monitoring approaches\
    \ [70–73]. For\ninstance, Zhou et al. [71] integrated ESA CCI SSM at a spatial\
    \ resolution of 0.25 degrees into\nthe DSSAT model. The aim was to estimate both\
    \ the surface and root-zone soil moisture\nand assess the impact of data assimilation\
    \ on agricultural drought monitoring. The ﬁndings\nrevealed a signiﬁcant improvement\
    \ in soil moisture estimates following the assimilation of\nSSM data, which potentially\
    \ improves the estimation accuracy of crop yields and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ [74–77]. Similarly, [78] conducted a study to assess the impact of integrating\n\
    in situ and remote sensing soil moisture observations with the APSIM model through\n\
    sequential data assimilation. The evaluation was conducted across ﬁve experimental\
    \ sites\nin the US Midwest, focusing on the improvement in model predictions for\
    \ downstream\nstate variables. The results demonstrated that assimilating remote\
    \ sensing soil moisture\ndata led to enhanced crop yield estimates, with a median\
    \ reduction of 17.2% in RMSE\ncompared with the model predictions.\nConversely,\
    \ recent studies assessed the potential of incorporating SSM derived from\nhigh-spatial-\
    \ and -temporal-resolution Sentinel-1 data into simple land surface and water\n\
    budget models for irrigation events detection [42,44]. For instance, Ouaadi et\
    \ al. [44]\nconducted a study to introduce and assess a novel method for predicting\
    \ irrigation timing\nand amounts at the ﬁeld scale. The approach involved incorporating\
    \ S1 SSM data into a\nsimple water budget model, namely, FAO-56 [79]. The results\
    \ demonstrated that both the\ntiming of irrigation and the amount of water used\
    \ could be accurately determined if a priori\ninformation about irrigation techniques\
    \ is collected. However, land surface and water\nbudget models often rely on observations\
    \ or empirical functions to simulate vegetation\neffects and lack a mechanistic\
    \ representation [80,81]. They also tend to overlook the impact\nof human activities,\
    \ such as irrigation, on soil moisture changes. On the other hand, crop\nmodels\
    \ have the capability to explicitly capture the entire growth process and simulate\n\
    interactions between the root-zone soil moisture and crop water uptake. Therefore,\
    \ crop\nmodels, when combined with agronomic parameters and soil information derived\
    \ from\nremote sensing, can effectively monitor crop yield and irrigation [80,82,83].\n\
    The linkage between crop models and remote sensing observations for detecting\
    \ irri-\ngation is not commonly explored, and there is a dearth of evaluations\
    \ regarding the impact\nof integrating soil moisture estimates into crop modeling,\
    \ among others for irrigation\nmonitoring or supervision. Consequently, this study\
    \ aimed at incorporating SSM obser-\nvations derived from the S2MP product [47]\
    \ into Optirrig for irrigation dates and amount\ndetection. In this study, the\
    \ Optirrig model [57,84] was used for simulating, analyzing,\nand optimizing irrigation\
    \ scenarios. The speciﬁc objective assigned to Optirrig was to\nidentify the actual\
    \ sequence of irrigation events (including dates and amounts) for multiple\nmaize\
    \ ﬁelds under irrigation in the Occitanie region of Southeast France. By simulating\n\
    the dynamics of soil water content, Optirrig could assess the impact of different\
    \ irrigation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n5 of 36\nmanagement practices and/or\
    \ water stress on the SSM. The method aimed at retrieving\nthe irrigation that\
    \ has probably occurred, leading to changes in the SSM between two\nSAR image\
    \ acquisition dates. The approach involved detecting changes in the SSM values\n\
    derived from the S2MP (SSMS1) between the t(l) date of the current SAR image and\
    \ the t(i)\ndate of the previous image. The main objective was, therefore, to\
    \ determine the irrigation\n(date and amount) that could have caused this variation\
    \ in SSM. This was done through\nthe simulation of the SSM using Optirrig for\
    \ various irrigation combinations (dates and\ndoses) injected between t(i) and\
    \ t(l). The irrigation combination that resulted in a similar\nchange in SSM as\
    \ observed in the SSMS1 was considered the most likely one that occurred.\nIt\
    \ is important to note that in this study, the changes in SSM values were examined\
    \ by\ncalculating the rate of change between t(i) and t(l). By examining these\
    \ rates of change,\nwe could assess the similarity or disparity between the observed\
    \ (SSMS1) and simulated\nSSM variations in Optirrig, providing insights into retrieving\
    \ the most probable irrigation\ndate and amount. First, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2,\
    \ weather, and irrigation data were collected\nand then SSMS1 values were estimated\
    \ over maize plots using S2MP. Second, the rate of\nchange of SSMS1 was computed\
    \ between subsequent S1 acquisition dates for ascending\nand descending orbits\
    \ separately. Then, irrigation combinations of dates and amounts\nwere entered\
    \ into Optirrig in order to detect the irrigation combination that led to a rate\
    \ of\nchange that matched that of SSMS1. The performance of the proposed method\
    \ for detecting\nirrigation was evaluated by comparing the actual irrigation dates\
    \ and amounts applied in\nthe studied maize ﬁelds with those estimated.\n2. Materials\n\

    \ is a process-based crop growth and irrigation model that comprises an in-\n\
    ner layer responsible for hydrological and agronomical calculations, and an outer\
    \ layer\ndedicated to generating, analyzing, and optimizing irrigation scenarios.\
    \ It is derived from\nthe Pilote model [64,65] developed by the same research\
    \ team, with some adaptations\nregarding process modeling (and a thorough rewriting\
    \ in the R language in a completely\nexplicit, agile, and modular form that ﬁts\
    \ the modern international standards). Optirrig\nsimulates crop growth and yield\
    \ based on water and nutrient availability and consumption,\nemphasizing the identiﬁcation\
    \ of effective irrigation and fertilization practices and decision\nrules, particularly\
    \ for cereals and horticulture [57,84]. The model version used in this study\n\

    \ S1 SAR images operating at the C-band frequency of\n5.405 GHz were utilized.\
    \ These images were acquired by S1A and S1B satellites in both\nascending mode\
    \ (afternoon at 18:00 UT) and descending mode (morning at 06:00 UT).\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ 72 images (36 ascending and 36 descending) were obtained for each of the\nfour\
    \ reference plots (6-day revisit time) located in Montpellier (P1) and Tarbes\
    \ (P2, P3, and\nP4). The data spanned from April to October for each year, with\
    \ 2017 for P1 and 2018,\n2019, and 2020 for P2, P3, and P4, respectively. This\
    \ period corresponds to the irrigation\nperiod for these reference plots. The\
    \ SAR images were acquired in the interferometric-wide\n(IW) swath with two polarizations:\
    \ VV (vertical–vertical) and VH (vertical–horizontal).\nFor the purpose of this\
    \ study, only the VV and VH polarizations were considered in the\nSSM (surface\
    \ soil moisture) estimation algorithm. The 288 images were derived from\nthe ground-range-detected\
    \ (GRD) product, featuring a pixel spacing of 10 m × 10 m.\nThese images were\
    \ downloaded via the European Space Agency (ESA) website (https:\n//scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home,\
    \ accessed on 9 November 2022).\nFigure 3 illustrates the repetitiveness of S1\

    \ orbits as the P1 plot were\nacquired for P3 (2019) and P4 (2020). Each study\
    \ site underwent the acquisition of 10 SAR\nimages per month, comprising 5 ascending\
    \ and 5 descending images. The descending SAR\nimage (morning) for the Montpellier\
    \ site (Figure 3a) was acquired 36 h before the ascending\nevening image, exhibiting\
    \ incidence angles of 38.1◦ and 39.3◦, respectively. Similarly, in\nTarbes (Figure\
    \ 3b), the morning acquisition preceded the evening acquisition by 36 h, and\n\
    the incidence angles were 36.2◦ and 40.3◦, respectively.\n \np\npurpose of this\
    \ study, only the VV and VH polarizations were considered in the SSM \n(surface\

    ground-range-detected (GRD) product, featuring a pixel spacing of 10 m × 10 m.\
    \ These \nimages were downloaded via the European Space Agency (ESA) website (https://sci-\n\

    \ angles of 38.1° and 39.3°, respectively. Sim-\nilarly, in Tarbes (Figure 3b),\
    \ the morning acquisition preceded the evening acquisition by \n36 h, and the\
    \ incidence angles were 36.2° and 40.3°, respectively. \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure\

    \ namely, in April 2017\nfor the P1 plot in Montpellier (a) and in April 2018\
    \ for the P2 plot in Tarbes (b). Also indicated are the\nincidence angles associated\
    \ with each acquisition.\nESA’s S1 toolbox was employed to calibrate a total of\
    \ 288 S1 images. This calibration\nprocess encompassed radiometric and geometric\
    \ adjustments, which transformed the\ndigital numbers into backscattering coefﬁcients\
    \ (σ0) in linear units (radiometric calibration)\nand ortho-rectiﬁed the images\
    \ (geometric calibration) using a 30 m digital elevation model\nderived from the\
    \ Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Finally, two distinct sets of\nσ0 temporal\
    \ series were derived for each study site. These series represent the repeated\n\
    images obtained through the same acquisition mode (ascending and descending) every\
    \ six\ndays. The ﬁrst set corresponded to the morning acquisition and was labeled\
    \ as DM1 for\nthe Montpellier site in 2017, and DM2, DM3, and DM4 for Tarbes in\
    \ 2018, 2019, and 2020,\nrespectively. Moreover, the temporal series acquired\
    \ in the afternoon were denoted as MA1\nfor the Montpellier site in 2017, while\
    \ for the Tarbes site, they were labeled as MA2, MA3,\nand MA4 for the years 2018,\
    \ 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nFor each acquired S1 SAR image of the temporal\
    \ series (DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, MA1,\nMA2, MA3, and MA4), the SAR σ0 at plot scale\
    \ (σ0\nP) was calculated by averaging the\npixel values within each plot (P1,\
    \ P2, P3, and P4) in both the VV and VH polarizations.\nThe SAR incidence angle\
    \ (θP) was determined for each SAR image at every plot. The\nincrease in SSM values\
    \ can be attributed not only to irrigation events but also to rainfall\nevents,\
    \ which are the primary contributors to SSM variations. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to\ndistinguish between rainfall events and irrigation events. Both rainfall\
    \ and irrigation events\nare considered water supplements and can have a similar\
    \ effect on the value of σ0\nP and SAR\nbackscattering coefﬁcient at the grid\
    \ scale (σ0\nG\n\x01\n. Thus, resolving the ambiguity between\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n11 of 36\nrainfall and irrigation is crucial for accurately detecting\
    \ irrigation events. To achieve better\ndetection of irrigation events, information\
    \ about rainfall is essential.\nIn this study, information about rainfall occurrence\
    \ was determined through the SSM\nvalue obtained at the grid scale (Section 2.4).\
    \ It was assumed that if the bare soil plots\nwith low vegetation cover within\
    \ the 10 km × 10 km spatial extent exhibited an increase\nin SSM values between\
    \ two consecutive SAR acquisitions, a rainfall event likely occurred.\nThis correlation\
    \ between rainfall and σ0\nG was demonstrated by Bazzi et al. [88], where they\n\
    compared SSM estimations at bare soil plots in a 10 km grid scale with rainfall\
    \ events at\nthe same scale, revealing a strong consistency between rainfall events\
    \ and SSM values at\nthe 10 km grid scale. The backscattering coefﬁcient at grid\
    \ scale (10 km × 10 km), namely,\nσ0\nG, was obtained for each SAR acquisition\
    \ of each temporal series by averaging the SAR\nbackscattering coefﬁcient of all\
    \ pixels within each grid cell that corresponded to either\nbare soil or areas\
    \ with small vegetation cover. The identiﬁcation of bare soil pixels with\nlow\
    \ vegetation cover was achieved by using a land cover map of France [89] to delineate\n\
    agricultural regions and subsequently applying a threshold value to the NDVI (NDVI\
    \ < 0.3)\nobtained from the S2 images (Section 2.5). Additionally, the σ0\nG values\
    \ were obtained for\nboth VV and VH polarizations, along with the average SAR\
    \ incidence angle (θG) at each\ngrid cell for every SAR image.\n2.5. Sentinel-2\
    \ Optical Data\nSentinel-2 (S2), which comprises optical satellites, was deployed\
    \ by the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) in 2015 and 2017 as two constellations,\
    \ S2A and S2B. Operating in\ntandem, these constellations offer a revisit time\
    \ of 5 days. S2 provides optical images that\nencompass 13 different bands, with\
    \ bands 4 and 8 speciﬁcally employed in calculating\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI). The high temporal resolution of the\nS2 satellite enabled\
    \ the acquisition of 15 cloud-free optical images for plot P1 in 2017,\n19 images\
    \ for plot P2 in 2018, 21 images for plot P3 in 2019, and 17 images for plot P4\
    \ in 2020\nthroughout the maize cropping seasons (between April and October).\
    \ For each reference\nplot, the images were downloaded from the Theia website\
    \ (https://www.theia-land.fr/,\naccessed on 9 November 2022), which offers ortho-rectiﬁed\
    \ level-2 products corrected for\natmospheric effects using the Level-2A operational\
    \ processor. The time span covered by\nthe S2 images aligned with that of the\
    \ S1 acquisitions for each reference plot and year. The\nprocessor employs algorithms\
    \ for scene classiﬁcation and atmospheric correction. These\noptical images were\
    \ used to calculate the NDVI values by averaging the values of all\nthe pixels\
    \ at the plot scale for each S2 date (Figure 4). The NDVI values serve as input\n\
    for estimating the SSM at the plot scale (S2MP (Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 Moisture\
    \ Product)\ndescribed in Section 3.1). Furthermore, for each grid cell, the average\
    \ NDVI value was\nobtained speciﬁcally for bare soil pixels exhibiting low vegetation\
    \ cover, as discussed in\nSection 3.1.2, to estimate the SSM at the grid scale.\n\
    3. Methods\nOur methodology focused on retrieving irrigation dates and amounts\
    \ at the plot\nlevel by integrating surface soil moisture (SSM) data obtained\
    \ from Sentinel-1 (SSMS1,\ndescribed in Section 3.1) into Optirrig using an inversion\
    \ technique. The approach relied\non comparing the change in the SSMS1 between\
    \ two S1 SAR acquisition dates, namely, t(l)\nand the previous date t(i), to the\
    \ change in the SSM simulated by Optirrig when forcing\ncombinations of irrigation\
    \ dates and amounts (I(j,k), j accounting for the dates and k for the\namounts)\
    \ in the input ﬁles of the model. In return, Optirrig provides SSM values in its\
    \ ﬁrst,\nshallow reservoir of 10 cm depth, which exceeded by a few centimeters\
    \ the penetration\ndepth of the radar signal in soils. Due to this difference,\
    \ comparing the SSMS1 and Optirrig\nSSM simulations (SSMM) was not a straightforward\
    \ task. We, therefore, proposed to\ninstead compare the rates of change (ΨSSMS1,\
    \ ΨSSMM) between successive observation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n12 of 36\n\
    dates, seeking the irrigation date and amount that reduced the difference between\
    \ those\ntwo rates, deﬁning the rate of change between any two t(i) and t(i+1)\
    \ dates as\nΨSSM =\nSSM(i+1) − SSM(i)\nSSM(i)\n(1)\nHowever, the SSM estimated\
    \ from SAR data might be inﬂuenced by various factors,\nespecially rainfall and\
    \ irrigation: both lead to an increase in the backscattering coefﬁcient,\nwhich\
    \ affects the SSM values. Hence, it was mandatory to ﬁrst distinguish between\
    \ rainfall\nand irrigation events, which is expected from a combined analysis\
    \ of changes in SSM values\nat the plot scale (SSMP) and the grid scale (SSMG).\n\
    The method for detecting irrigations was based on identifying changes in the plot-scale\n\
    surface soil moisture (SSMP) values between the current SAR acquisition at time\
    \ t(l) and\nthe previous SAR acquisition at time t(i). In essence, the approach\
    \ assumed that an increase\nin SSMP between two consecutive SAR dates (t(i) and\
    \ t(l)), resulting in a positive rate of\nchange (ΨSSMP), was attributable to\
    \ either rainfall or irrigation (Section 3.1.1). Conversely,\nan increase in SSMG\
    \ values at the grid scale (10 km × 10 km) likely denoted a rainfall event\n(Section\
    \ 3.1.2). Consequently, a ΨSSMP value higher than the ΨSSMG value between t(i)\n\
    and t(l) signaled the effect of local water application (which a priori excluded\
    \ rainfall) and\nwas considered indirect evidence of irrigation.\nFurther veriﬁcations\
    \ were performed using Optirrig. The evolution of SSM throughout\nthe maize growing\
    \ cycle was simulated using Optirrig without the presence of irrigation in\nso-called\
    \ “rainfed” conditions (SSMr), thus taking into account the sole effect of rainfall\n\
    on the soil water content (Section 3.2.1). The ΨSSMr rate of change between t(i)\
    \ and t(l)\nwas computed and compared with ΨSSMP. A ΨSSMP value lower than or\
    \ equal to the\nΨSSMr value meant that there was no effect of water application\
    \ other than rainfall on\nthe plot-scale surface soil moisture. Conversely, if\
    \ the ΨSSMP value was higher than the\nΨSSMr value, it was interpreted as evidence\
    \ of irrigation between t(i) and t(l).\nThe proposed methodology for irrigation\
    \ detection consisted of (i) applying the above\nconditions to the SSM values\
    \ derived from Sentinel-1 at plot and grid scales to determine\nwhether irrigation\
    \ took place, and (ii) if so, simulating the SSM values with Optirrig for\ndifferent\
    \ combinations of irrigation dates and amounts, seeking the combination that\n\
    produced the best match between the rates of change of the observed and simulated\n\
    SSM values.\n3.1. S2MP for SSM Estimation\nThe estimation of the surface soil\
    \ moisture (SSM) was accomplished using the S2MP\ndeveloped by El Hajj et al.\
    \ [47] using time series data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\nand a neural network\
    \ technique for estimating SSM within the upper 3–5 cm layer. The\nneural network\
    \ employed sought the optimal ﬁt between the reference and estimated SSM\nby incorporating\
    \ the calibrated water cloud model (WCM) [90], along with the integral\nevaluation\
    \ model for soil backscattering [91–93]. Within the WCM, the total backscattered\n\
    coefﬁcient was computed as the combined contribution of direct vegetation and\
    \ soil,\nmultiplied by an attenuation factor. This approach, which was used in\
    \ this study, delivered\nsatisfactory estimations of surface soil moisture (SSM)\
    \ with a root mean square error (RMSE)\nof 5 vol.%. It required three inputs:\

    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n14 of 36\n3.1.1. SSM Estimation at Plot Scale\nThe\
    \ proposed approach relied on identifying variations in the level of surface soil\n\
    moisture at the plot scale. For each SAR date, the SSMS1 values were estimated\
    \ at each\nplot, denoted by SSMP (Figure 4). When the SSMP level increased between\
    \ two successive\nsynthetic SAR acquisitions, the σ0\nP value also tended to increase,\
    \ leading to an increasing\nSSMP. Consequently, if an irrigation event occurred\
    \ between two SAR acquisitions, the\nSAR SSMP value would show an increase [16].\n\
    Additionally, the stability or slight decrease of SSMP values between two dates\
    \ could\nalso be linked to irrigation and not only when increasing values of SSMP\
    \ are observed (as\nmentioned in the previous paragraph), particularly when SSMP\
    \ values are already high. In\nfact, without any interventions like irrigation,\
    \ rainfall, soil activities, or vegetation growth,\nthe SAR signal tends to decrease\
    \ between two SAR acquisitions (within a maximum of\n6 days), particularly during\
    \ the spring and summer seasons. This decrease is inﬂuenced\nby various water\
    \ cycle factors, such as inﬁltration, evaporation, and evapotranspiration,\nwhich\
    \ contribute to a decline in SSM values. Thus, the stabilization or slight decrease\
    \ in\nSSMP between the SAR acquisition date t(i) (SSMP(i)) and the subsequent\
    \ acquisition date\nt(l) (SSMP(l)) could have been due to an additional water\
    \ supply if no rainfall had occurred\nbetween t(i) and t(l).\nSince the method\
    \ revolved around detecting changes in SSMP values, we proposed\ncalculating the\
    \ rate of change between the SSMP value at each SAR acquisition date t(l)\n(SSMP(l))\
    \ and the SSMP value at the previous SAR acquisition date t(i) (SSMP(i)). Conse-\n\
    quently, we computed the SAR SSMP rate of change (ΨSSMP) for each SAR acquisition\
    \ t(l)\nat the plot scale as follows:\nΨSSMP(l) =\nSSMP(l) − SSMP(i)\nSSMP(i)\n\
    (2)\nA positive, stable, or even slightly negative ΨSSMP(l) provided indirect\
    \ evidence of\nirrigation and/or rainfall occurrence between t(i) and t(l). Therefore,\
    \ additional criteria\nneeded to be included to verify a potential irrigation\
    \ event. This involved comparing\nΨSSMP to ΨSSM at the grid scale (ΨSSMG), as\
    \ well as to the variations in shallow reservoir\nsoil moisture simulated in Optirrig\
    \ without the presence of irrigation (ΨSSMr). The latter\ntook into account the\
    \ impact of rainfall on the surface soil moisture (SSM) between the\nSAR acquisitions\
    \ t(i) and t(l). The upcoming sections cover the discussion of these criteria\n\
    and conditions.\n3.1.2. SSM Estimation at the Grid Scale\nAt the grid scale, an\
    \ estimation of SSM from σ0\nG (SSMG) for bare soil plots with low\nvegetation\
    \ cover (NDVI < 0.3) was conducted for each grid cell and SAR date (Figure 4).\n\
    This estimation provided information about the surface water content over the\
    \ bare soil\nplots at the basin scale. It was assumed that high soil moisture\
    \ values observed at the grid\nscale (10 km × 10 km) centered around the plots\
    \ were more likely to be associated with\npotential rainfall events than with\
    \ irrigation events: high soil moisture conditions at the\ngrid scale indicate\
    \ humid soil conditions “everywhere”, which is typically associated with\nrainfall\
    \ events showing no “plot by plot” patterns.\nAt a given SAR acquisition date\
    \ t(l), the change in SAR SSM at each 10 km cell could\nbe determined by calculating\
    \ the rate of change of SSMG (ΨSSMG(l)) between the SSMG\nvalue at t(l) and the\
    \ SSMG value at the previous SAR acquisition date t(i):\nΨSSMG(l) =\nSSMG(l) −\
    \ SSMG(i)\nSSMG(i)\n(3)\nA positive value of ΨSSMG(l) meant that SSMG increased\
    \ between t(i) and t(l) and\na rainfall event was assumed to have occurred. On\
    \ the other hand, when the SSMG\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n15 of 36\nvalues\
    \ decreased or remained stable between two SAR acquisitions, it likely indicated\
    \ the\nabsence of precipitation or low precipitation amounts, resulting in negative\
    \ or null values\nof ΨSSMG(l). By contrast, as discussed in the previous sections,\
    \ increasing values of SSM\nat the plot scale (positive ΨSSMP(l)) could be attributed\
    \ to irrigation, rainfall (leading to\npositive ΨSSMG(l)), or a combination of\
    \ both. Therefore, a positive difference between\nΨSSMP(l) and ΨSSMG(l) (ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ − ΨSSMG(l) > 0) was assumed to signal the occurrence\nof plot-scale irrigations.\n\
    3.2. Optirrig Simulations\n3.2.1. Simulated SSM Evolution\nOptirrig simulates\
    \ the soil water balance and crop yield on a daily basis by combining\na soil\
    \ module and a crop module, assuming that water is the sole limiting factor. The\
    \ soil\nmodule comprises a three-reservoir system [57,84] that spans from the\
    \ surface layer to the\nmaximum rooting depth. The ﬁrst reservoir, with a shallow\
    \ depth of 10 cm, controls the\nwater balance at the soil surface. In this reservoir,\
    \ the evaporation demand is reduced for\nincreasing values of the leaf area index\
    \ (LAI), while the transpiration demand progressively\ntakes over by means of\
    \ a partitioning coefﬁcient. The second reservoir, referred to as R2,\naccounts\
    \ for the root section and its capacity expands as roots grow. Before the potential\
    \ root\narea is fully occupied by the second reservoir, the third reservoir represents\
    \ the remaining\nportion of the soil root zone. Initially, water is extracted\
    \ from the shallow reservoir (R1,\n10 cm deep) through evaporation, and subsequently,\
    \ the plant draws water exclusively\nfrom the second reservoir. Therefore, Optirrig\
    \ allows for the simulation of SSM at 10 cm\ndepth for different irrigation scenarios.\
    \ Those simulations serve to compare the effect of\ndifferent irrigation applications\
    \ on the SSM to the observed SSM from Sentinel-1, and thus,\nretrieve the irrigation\
    \ that leads to the same SSM behavior between SAR acquisitions.\nThe SSMr values\
    \ obtained from Optirrig for rainfed conditions are affected by rainfall\nonly,\
    \ while the SSM values derived from Sentinel-1 at the plot scale (SSMP) are affected\n\
    by rainfall and irrigation. In fact, the aim of this study was to detect potential\
    \ irrigation\nthat occurred between a SAR acquisition date (t(l) and the previous\
    \ date t(i)). Therefore, the\nrate of change of SSMr (ΨSSMr) between t(i) and\
    \ t(l) was computed in order to quantify the\neffect of rainfall alone on the\
    \ SSM:\nΨSSMr(l) =\nSSMr(l) − SSMr(i)\nSSMr(i)\n(4)\nThe approach assumed that\
    \ when there was an increase in SSMP between t(i) and t(l),\nresulting in a positive\
    \ rate of change (ΨSSMP(l), Equation (2)), it was mainly due to the\nrise in SSMP\
    \ caused by rainfall and/or irrigation. On the other hand, an increase in SSMr\n\
    values could indicate a rainfall event between the SAR acquisitions, leading to\
    \ a positive\nΨSSMr(l). Therefore, a ΨSSMP(l) value higher than the ΨSSMr(l) value\
    \ between t(i) and t(l),\nprovided indirect evidence of irrigation occurrence.\n\
    3.2.2. Inversion Approach for Irrigation Detection\nThe previous sections proposed\
    \ two criteria (Section 3.1.2: ΨSSMP(l) > ΨSSMG(l) and\nSection 3.2.1: ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ > ΨSSMr(l)) to seek the possible irrigation events I(j,k) having taken\nplace\
    \ at a date j between t(i) and t(l), with an amount given by the k index. However,\
    \ El Hajj\net al. [72] highlighted that the SSM is estimated with an accuracy\
    \ of 5 vol.%, which applies\nin our case to the SSM values estimated at the plot\
    \ scale (µSSMp = 5%). The uncertainty on\nΨSSMP will then depend on the uncertainties\
    \ in the measurements of SSMp at t(i) and t(l)\nas follows [94]:\nµ(l) = ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ ×\nv\nu\nu\nt\n \nµSSMP(l)\nSSMP(l)\n!2\n+\n \nµSSMP(i)\nSSMP(i)\n!2\n(5)\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n16 of 36\nFor instance, at the SAR acquisition date\
    \ t(l), a value of the SSMp is recorded as\nSSMP(l) = 25 vol.%. Furthermore, our\
    \ approach focuses on detecting the change in SSMP\nbetween t(l) and the previous\
    \ image date t(i), where SSMP(i) = 15 vol.%. As a result, the\nΨSSMp value is\
    \ determined using Equation (2) yielding ΨSSMP(l) ∼= 0.67. Subsequently,\nthe\
    \ error value on ΨSSMP(l) (µ(l)) is computed using Equation (5), with a calculated\n\
    value of µ(l) ∼= 0.26. The presence of too large uncertainties may hamper the\
    \ identiﬁ-\ncation of irrigation events from the previous arguments involving\
    \ the ΨSSMP(l) values\n(ΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMG(l) > 0 and ΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMr(l) > 0).\
    \ The following two conditions\nthus have to be met:\nΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMG(l) > µ(l)\n\
    (6)\nΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMr(l) > µ(l)\n(7)\nMoreover, El Hajj et al. [48] and Ouaadi\
    \ et al. [44] highlighted that the effect of a rain\nor irrigation event on the\
    \ SAR backscattering coefﬁcient can last up to 3 days before the\ntotal dry-out\
    \ of the surface. It is essential to note that the duration of dry-out largely\
    \ relies\non the speciﬁc soil type and its inﬁltration characteristics, as well\
    \ as the vegetation cover.\nHence, an irrigation that occurred 3 days (n = 3)\
    \ before t(i) can have an effect on the change\nobserved in SSM between SSMP(I)\
    \ and SSMP(l), and therefore, on the computed ΨSSMP(l).\nFrom this point of view,\
    \ a light rain that occurred shortly before the acquisition could\nhave the same\
    \ signature as a signiﬁcant rain occurring 3 days before would. This means\nsearching\
    \ for an irrigation event that occurred at the j date between t(i)−3 and t(l).\
    \ As for the\npossible irrigation amounts, we restrained the set to realistic\
    \ values with three possibilities:\nk = 20, 30, or 40 mm. This produced the I(j,k)\
    \ combinations of dates and amounts to test,\nresulting in SSMR(j,k) values simulated\
    \ by Optirrig, and therefore, in ΨSSMR(j,k) values, for\neach I(j,k) between t(i)\
    \ and t(l):\nΨSSMR(j,k) =\nSSMR(l) − SSMR(i)\nSSMR(i)\n(8)\nThe most probable\
    \ irrigation combination between t(i) and t(l) was the I(j,k) that min-\nimized\
    \ the absolute value of the discrepancy between ΨSSMR(j,k) and ΨSSMP(l), which\n\
    was denoted |∆Ψ(j,k)|. Consequently, our goal was to ﬁnd the irrigation event\
    \ I(j,k) that\nminimized the difference between the ΨSSMR(j,k) and ΨSSMP(l) values.\
    \ By contrast, the\nhighest |∆Ψ(j,k)| values for a hypothesized I(j,k) event indicated\
    \ the lowest probability for\nI(j,k) to have occurred:\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j,k)\n\f\f\f\
    =\n\f\f\fΨSSMR(j,k) − ΨSSMP(l)\n\f\f\f\n(9)\nWhen trying to minimize the |∆Ψ(j,k)|\
    \ values, seeking |∆Ψ(j,k)| values as close to\nzero as possible, it is very likely\
    \ that both negative and positive values of ∆Ψ(j,k) will be\nencountered. A negative\
    \ ∆Ψ(j,k) (∆Ψ(j,k) < 0) occurs when the tested irrigation I(j,k) yields a\nΨSSMR(j,k)\
    \ lower than ΨSSMP(l). The negative value indicates a shortfall in the impact\
    \ of\nI(j,k) on ΨSSMR(j,k) when compared with ΨSSMP(l). Conversely, a positive\
    \ ∆Ψ(j,k) suggests\nthat the tested irrigation I(j,k) outperforms the ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ by leading to ΨSSMR(j,k) values\nhigher than ΨSSMP(l). This indicates a desire\
    \ to make the ∆Ψ(j,k) of an I(j,k) at j and ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\nof an I(j,k) at j + 1 comparable\
    \ and a change in sign occurs between ∆Ψ(j,k) and ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\nvalues, from negative\
    \ to positive (10) or from positive to negative (11):\n∆Ψ(j,k) < 0 And ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\

    17 of 36\nThis change in sign is a “necessary but not sufﬁcient condition” for\
    \ the detection of an\nirrigation event having taken place between t(i) and t(l),\
    \ as the magnitude of the change in\n∆Ψ(j,k) values also has to be compared with\
    \ the intrinsic uncertainties, which requires\n∆Ψ(j,k) < −µ(l) And ∆Ψ(j+1,k) ≥\
    \ −µ(l)\n(12)\n∆Ψ(j,k) > µ(l) And ∆Ψ(j+1,k) ≤ µ(l)\n(13)\nIn the last step, Equations\
    \ (12) and (13) establish the conditions for detecting an irriga-\ntion event\
    \ between two speciﬁc time points, namely, t(i) and t(l). These conditions involve\n\
    comparing the magnitudes of ∆Ψ(j,k) values with the intrinsic uncertainties represented\
    \ by\nµ(l). Equation (12) states that if ∆Ψ(j,k) is less than the negative intrinsic\
    \ uncertainty (−µ(l)),\nand ∆Ψ(j+1,k) is greater than or equal to −µ(l), it suggests\
    \ the possibility of an irrigation\nevent that occurred between t(i) and t(l).\
    \ In addition, Equation (13) implies that when the\ndifference ∆Ψ(j,k) is greater\
    \ than the positive intrinsic uncertainty (µ(l)), and the subsequent\ndifference\
    \ ∆Ψ(j+1,k) is less than or equal to µ(l), it indicates the potential occurrence\
    \ of an\nirrigation event between time points t(i) and t(l).\nTherefore, if either\
    \ condition (12) or (13) is met, the magnitudes of |∆Ψ(j,k)| and\n|∆Ψ(j+1,k)|\
    \ are compared. The one with the smallest value represents the most probable\n\
    combination of irrigation date and amount (I(j,k)). This means that if an irrigation\
    \ event\nis detected based on either condition, the comparison of the absolute\
    \ values helps to\ndetermine which I(j,k) is the most likely based on the smallest\
    \ difference in ∆Ψ values:\nI(j,k)opt = min(\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j,k)\n\f\f\f,\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j+1,k)\n\
    \f\f\f)\n(14)\nThe minimum value of |∆Ψ(j,k)| and |∆Ψ(j+1,k)| corresponds to the\
    \ irrigation event\nwith the highest likelihood in terms of the date and amount,\
    \ as it represents the irrigation\ncombination that caused the least discrepancy\
    \ in ∆Ψ (between ΨSSMR(j,k) and ΨSSMP(l)),\nconsidering the given uncertainties\
    \ µ(l).\n3.3. Workﬂow for the Detection of Irrigation Events\nFigure 5 provides\
    \ a comprehensive ﬂowchart of the proposed irrigation detection\nmethodology,\
    \ highlighting its key steps and processes. The approach aimed at retrieving\n\
    the irrigation dates and amounts between a SAR acquisition date (t(l)) and the\
    \ previous\ndate (t(i)). It is good to mention that SSM values derived from S1\
    \ SAR images acquired in\nthe ascending and descending modes were used independently.\
    \ For example, over the P1\nplot and at t(l) (SAR acquisition date) the detection\
    \ approach was applied between the SSM\nderived from ascending SAR time series\
    \ (MA1) at t(l) and the date of the previous image t(i)\nfrom the same time series,\
    \ at a ﬁxed interval of 6 days. For each plot and between t(l) and\nt(i), ten\
    \ primary indicators could be derived for the plot, as presented in Table 4.\n\
    The chain started with phase 1, which consisted of distinguishing the occurrence\
    \ or\nnot of an irrigation event. It was crucial to differentiate between rainfall\
    \ and irrigation\nevents, as both can cause changes in SSM values. To eliminate\
    \ the ambiguity between\nirrigation and rainfall events, two ﬁlters were implemented.\
    \ The ﬁrst ﬁlter compared the\nchange rate of SSM at the plot scale ΨSSMP(l) between\
    \ t(l) and t(i) with the rate of change\nof SSM at the grid scale (ΨSSMG(l)).\
    \ A higher value of ΨSSMP(l) indicated the presence of\nwater application apart\
    \ from rainfall.\nThe second ﬁlter involved a comparison between ΨSSMP(l) and\
    \ the simulated change\nrate of SSM without irrigation (ΨSSMr(l)). Similarly,\
    \ if ΨSSMP(l) was higher than ΨSSMr(l),\nit indicated the presence of a water\
    \ application other than rainfall. Once it was conﬁrmed\nthat an irrigation event\
    \ occurred, the approach moved to phase 2, which aimed to determine\nthe irrigation\
    \ date and amount between two SAR acquisitions.\nIn phase 2, irrigation combinations\
    \ of date j (ranging between t(i)−3 and t(l)) and dose\nk (I(j,k)) were entered\
    \ into Optirrig between t(i) and t(l). This resulted in simulated SSM\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n18 of 36\nvalues generated by Optirrig, and corresponding\
    \ change rates ΨSSMR(j,k)(l) were computed.\nThe objective was to ﬁnd the most\
    \ probable irrigation combination (I(j,k)opt) between t(i) and\nt(l) by minimizing\
    \ the absolute discrepancy between ΨSSMR(j,k)(l) and ΨSSMP(l) (|∆Ψ(j,k)(l)|).\n\
    This process is elaborated in Section 3.2.2 and illustrated in Figure 5.\nRemote\

    \ the results of assessing the performance of the irrigation detection\napproach\
    \ discussed earlier by examining its capability to accurately retrieve irrigation\
    \ dates\nand amounts over the four reference plots. Three metrics were calculated\
    \ based on the\nconcepts of true positive, false positive, and false negative,\
    \ which are deﬁned as follows. A\n“probably detected irrigation” I(j,k) was classiﬁed\
    \ as a true positive (TP) if it was detected\nwithin three days of a real irrigation\
    \ date (dRe) collected during the ﬁeld trials. On the other\nhand, any probably\
    \ detected irrigation I(j,k) that deviated signiﬁcantly from these dates was\n\
    classiﬁed as a false positive (FP). Conversely, if an irrigation event was not\
    \ detected, it was\nconsidered a false negative (FN).\nThe methodology was applied\
    \ to SSM temporal series from the ascending (evening\noverpass) and descending\
    \ (morning overpass) SAR acquisitions separately due to diurnal\nvariations caused\
    \ by differences in vegetation water content between morning and evening.\nStudies\
    \ consistently showed that the radar backscattering coefﬁcient (σ0) is generally\
    \ higher\nin the morning overpass compared with the evening overpass [95,96].\
    \ As a result, it is\nrecommended to investigate each SAR temporal series separately,\
    \ with one acquired in the\nmorning and the other in the evening for each of the\
    \ four reference plots (Section 2.4). In\nother words, the method of irrigation\
    \ retrieval was employed by examining the variation\nin SSM between consecutive\
    \ SAR images, which were denoted as t(l) and the previous\nimage t(i), acquired\
    \ within the same SAR time series acquisition. It is important to note\nthat this\
    \ approach was applied, independently, to both the ascending and descending SAR\n\
    time series. Therefore, the time interval between two SSM observations was ﬁxed\
    \ at 6 days\n(t(l) − t(i) = 6 days, revisit time of S1).\nMoreover, there was\
    \ an overlap in the time span between t(i) and t(l) in both ascending\nand descending\
    \ temporal series, as the morning acquisition was only 36 h prior to the\nevening\
    \ acquisition. For example, the evaluation of irrigation retrieval was conducted\n\
    between the t(l) = 6 August 2017 SAR image acquired in the ascending mode and\
    \ the\ndate of the previous image t(i) = 31 July 2017. Similarly, in the descending\
    \ mode, another\nSAR image was acquired at t(l) = 5 August 2017 (36 h before the\
    \ evening image), with\nt(i) = 30 July 2017. Consequently, a real irrigation event\
    \ that occurred on 3 August 2017\ncould potentially be detected using either the\
    \ descending SAR image (t(l) = 5 August 2017)\nor the ascending SAR image (t(l)\
    \ = 6 August 2017). As a result, two dates of irrigation\ndetection could be recorded\
    \ for the same actual irrigation date. The retrieved irrigation date\nthat exhibited\
    \ the shortest time lapse between the real irrigation event and the retrieved\n\
    irrigation date was considered a true positive (TP).\nThe “Recall” (Re) was the\
    \ ﬁrst metric, representing the overall accuracy and sensitivity\nin detecting\
    \ irrigation dates (Equation (15)). It is calculated as TP divided by TP + FN\
    \ (all\nirrigation events). A low FN count favors a higher Re value, indicating\
    \ better irrigation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n20 of 36\ndate detection accuracy.\
    \ The “Precision” (Pn) was the second metric, deﬁned as the ratio\nof TP to TP\
    \ + FP (all detected events) (Equation (16)). False positive detections decrease\n\
    Pn, affecting the precision. The third metric calculated the harmonic mean of\
    \ recall and\nprecision, resulting in the F-score (Equation (17)). The F-score\
    \ enables comparison of the\nharmonic mean of Re and Pn in detecting irrigation\
    \ dates across multiple cases, providing\na balanced evaluation of the performance:\n\
    Recall =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False negative\n(15)\nPrecision =\nTrue\
    \ Positive\nTrue Positive + False positive\n(16)\nF-score = 2 × Recall × Precision\n\
    Recall + Precision\n(17)\nOnce the probable dates of irrigation were retrieved,\
    \ additional investigations were\nconducted to evaluate the detection of irrigation\
    \ amounts applied at the detected dates\nof irrigation (t(m)). To assess the accuracy\
    \ of the estimation, the mean absolute error\npercentage (MAE%) was calculated\
    \ by comparing the detected irrigation amounts (AD)\nwith the corresponding actual\
    \ (real) irrigation amounts (AR) over the t(m) for the four\nreference plots.\
    \ The MAE% quantiﬁes the average deviation between the estimated and\nactual irrigation\
    \ amounts, allowing for a seasonal assessment of the performance of the\nestimation\
    \ method:\nMAE% = 1\nn ×\n∑n\nt(m)|ADm − ARm|\nAR\n× 100\n(18)\nwhere t(m) is\
    \ the detected irrigation date; n is the total number of detected irrigation dates\n\
    (t(m)); AR is the average of the actual irrigation amounts; and ADm and ARm are\
    \ the detected\nand actual irrigation amounts, respectively, at t(m).\nA lower\
    \ MAE% indicates a higher level of accuracy in estimating the irrigation amount,\n\
    as the probable amounts closely align with the actual amounts applied. Conversely,\
    \ a higher\nMAE% suggests a larger discrepancy between the probable and actual\
    \ amounts.\n4. Results\n4.1. Detection of Irrigation Dates and Amounts\nThe proposed\
    \ methodology for detecting irrigation involved two main steps. First, the\nSSM\
    \ values derived from Sentinel-1 were analyzed at both the plot and grid scales\
    \ using\nspeciﬁc conditions, as described in Section 3.2.2, to determine whether\
    \ irrigation took place\nbetween two subsequent SAR images (phase 1). If irrigation\
    \ was detected, the second step\ninvolved simulating the SSM values with Optirrig,\
    \ considering various combinations of\nirrigation dates and amounts. The goal\
    \ was to ﬁnd the combination that best matched the\nobserved and simulated SSM\
    \ value changes (phase 2).\nPhase 1 consisted of applying two ﬁlters to distinguish\
    \ between irrigation and rainfall\nevents. The ﬁrst ﬁlter compared the plot-scale\
    \ SSM change rate (ΨSSMP) with grid-scale\nchange rate (ΨSSMG) and the second\
    \ ﬁlter compared ΨSSMP with ΨSSMr (rate of change\nof SSM simulated using Optirrig\
    \ with no irrigation). Previous sections explored two\nirrigation detection conditions\
    \ based on the difference observed between ΨSSMP and\nΨSSMG (Equation (6)), as\
    \ well as ΨSSMr (Equation (7)). In order to identify the occurrence\nof an irrigation\
    \ event, ΨSSMP − ΨSSMG and ΨSSMP − ΨSSMr have to show values higher\nthan the\
    \ error on ΨSSMP (µ(l), Equation (5)).\nFigure 6 shows an example of the detection\
    \ of irrigation occurrence between the\nt(l) date of SAR acquisition and t(i)−3,\
    \ where real irrigation was recorded (represented\nby blue dashed vertical lines),\
    \ for the four reference plots: P1 at t(l) = 6 August 2017\n(Figure 6a), P2 (Figure\
    \ 6c) at t(l) = 30 June 2018, P3 at t(l) = 30 July 2019 (Figure 6e), and P4\n\
    at t(l) = 13 July 2020 (Figure 6g). The blue, green, and red horizontal dash lines\
    \ represent\nΨSSMP, ΨSSMG, and ΨSSMr, respectively, between t(l) and t(i). To\

    \ low or no precipitation, both\nΨSSMG and ΨSSMr exhibited a slight decrease or\
    \ remained stable. Concurrently, in all\nfour cases documented, ΨSSMP demonstrated\
    \ higher values than both ΨSSMG and ΨSSMr.\nThis observed difference, which exceeded\
    \ the error margin of ΨSSMP (µ(l)), conﬁrming\nthe conditions in Equations (6)\
    \ and (7) were met, which served as evidence of irrigation\noccurrence in the\

    \ in Figure 6b,d,f,h for each of the\nexamples where irrigation occurrence was\
    \ suspected in phase 1 (Figure 6a,c,e,g).\nFor instance, an occurrence of irrigation\
    \ was identiﬁed between t(i) = 31 July 2017 and\nt(l) = 6 August 2017, with ascending\
    \ SAR image dates (Figure 6a). A detailed analysis was\ncarried out in Figure\
    \ 6b to determine the speciﬁc irrigation date and amount that probably\noccurred\
    \ between t(i)−3 and t(l). This investigation involved examining the changes in\n\
    ∆Ψ(j,k) for different irrigation dates j ranging from 28 July 2017 to 5 August\
    \ 2017, and k\namounts of 20, 30, and 40 mm to compare ∆Ψ(j,k) values to the error\
    \ on ΨSSMP (µ(l)). It is\nimportant to note that the error on ΨSSMP between t(i)\
    \ and t(l) was µ(l) = 0.068.\nConcerning the plot P1 (Figure 6a,b), on the date\
    \ j = 31 July 2017, the observed values\nof ∆Ψ(j,k) ranged from −0.71 for k =\
    \ 20 mm to −0.76 for k = 30 and 40 mm, all of which were\nlower than −µ(l). This\
    \ discrepancy could be attributed to signiﬁcantly lower ΨSSMR(j,k)\nvalues compared\
    \ with ΨSSMP (∆Ψ(j,k) < −µ(l)) observed at j in Figure 6a. Furthermore,\non j\
    \ + 1 = 1 August 2017, the ∆Ψ(j+1,k) values exhibited positive values greater\
    \ than −µ(l)\n(∆Ψ(j+1,k) = 0.22 > −µ(l)) for k = 20, 30, and 40 mm. This satisﬁed\
    \ one of the criteria for\nidentifying the most likely irrigation event (I(j,k)),\
    \ as stated in Equation (12) (∆Ψ(j,k) < −µ(l)\nand ∆Ψ(j+1,k) ≥ −µ(l)).\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be concluded that an irrigation event occurred between j = 31 July 2018\n\
    and j + 1 = 1 August 2017. To determine the most probable irrigation date (I(j,k)opt)\
    \ the irriga-\ntion combination (I(j,k)) leading to the smallest absolute value\
    \ between ∆Ψ(j,k) and ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\nwas identiﬁed, as described in Equation (14)\
    \ (I(j,k)opt = min(\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j,k)\n\f\f\f,\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j+1,k)\n\f\f\f)). Accord-\n\
    ingly, since |∆Ψ(j+1,k)| = 0.22 (regardless of the amount k) is smaller than |∆Ψ(j,k)|\
    \ = 0.71\nfor k = 20 mm and |∆Ψ(j,k)| = 0.76 for k = 30 and 40 mm, the irrigation\
    \ date j + 1 = 1 Au-\ngust 2017 was identiﬁed as the most probable date of I(j,k)opt.\
    \ However, the analysis of\n∆Ψ(j+1,k) did not reveal any discernible variations\
    \ across different irrigation amounts k = 20,\n30, and 40 mm, making it impossible\
    \ to identify irrigation amounts beyond k = 20 mm.\nIn Figure 6b, the actual irrigation\
    \ date, marked in blue, was 3 August 2017. Therefore,\nthe detected irrigation\
    \ date (1 August 2017) had a time difference of 2 days compared with\nthe actual\
    \ date.\nBased on the reasoning above, for the remaining three cases over P2 (Figure\
    \ 6c,d), P3\n(Figure 6e,f), and P4 (Figure 6g,h), the actual irrigation dates\
    \ were successfully detected\nwith a time lapse of 1 day from the actual irrigation\
    \ dates:\n•\nFor P2: The detected irrigation date was 26 June 2018 and the actual\
    \ date was 27 June 2018;\n•\nFor P3: The detected irrigation date was 25 July\
    \ 2019 and the actual date was 24 July 2019;\n•\nFor P4: The detected irrigation\
    \ date was 8 July 2020 and the actual date was 9 July 2020.\nFurthermore, it is\
    \ noteworthy that the detected irrigation amounts for the P2, P3, and\nP4 plots\
    \ were consistently k = 20 mm. This demonstrates that the analysis did not identify\n\
    any discernible differences in the ∆Ψ(j,k) values when testing irrigations with\
    \ different\namounts (k = 20, 30, and 40 mm) at the detected irrigation dates.\n\
    4.2. Irrigation Events Detection Performance\nThe performance of the irrigation\
    \ dates detection was evaluated using the accuracy\nmetrics (recall, precision,\
    \ and F-score) across the four reference plots. The irrigation\ndetection approach\
    \ yielded varying levels of accuracy across different plots (Figure 7).\nRemote\

    \ ten dRe over P1, four each over P2 and P3, and three over P4. \nTo ensure operational\
    \ eﬀectiveness, it is important to not only identify irrigation \ndates but also\
    \ estimate the irrigation amounts. Therefore, we conducted a comparison be-\n\
    tween the detected amounts (AD) and the actual amounts (AR) on the P1, P2, P3,\
    \ and P4 \nplots over the irrigation dates detected using the SSM derived from\
    \ SAR temporal series \nin the ascending and descending modes. In Figure 8, both\
    \ the detected dates and irrigation \namounts were presented alongside the real\
    \ ﬁeld data. The ﬁgure illustrates all observed \nSentinel-2 NDVI values, categorizing\
    \ them based on the vegetative or reproductive stages. \nIt also highlights instances\
    \ of missed irrigation detection, false detections, and correct de-\ntections.\
    \ Within Figure 8, grey and yellow bars correspond to the real and detected irriga-\n\
    tion amounts, respectively. Thus, a true irrigation date detection is represented\
    \ when a \nyellow bar is positioned over a grey bar for each actual irrigation\
    \ date. Conversely, a false \nirrigation detection (false positive) is indicated\
    \ by a single yellow bar, indicating that our \napproach detected irrigation on\
    \ a date that did not correspond with an actual irrigation \nevent. Likewise,\
    \ an undetected irrigation date (false negative) is represented by a single \n\
    grey bar, indicating that our approach failed to detect an irrigation date. \n\
    In the present study, Figure 8 displays only three instances of false positive\
    \ date de-\ntections, speciﬁcally in Figure 8a on the date 01 July (DOY = 182),\
    \ in Figure 8c on the date \n20 August (DOY = 233), and in Figure 8d on the date\
    \ 19 August (DOY = 232). Moreover, \nthe analysis revealed the failure to detect\
    \ four irrigation events. Among these undetected \nevents, three occurred in Figure\
    \ 8a on the dates 11 August, 22 August, and 26 September \n(DOYs = 223, 234, 269),\
    \ while the fourth one took place in Figure 8b on the date 05 August \n(DOY =\
    \ 217). \nThese results illustrate one of the inherent limitations of the approach\
    \ employed, \nwhich relies on the progressive growth of crop cover, as indicated\
    \ by the ascending dy-\nnamics of NDVI, along with the revisit time of the SAR\
    \ data. This limitation explains the \noccurrence of false detections during the\
    \ reproductive stage and the missed detections of \nactual irrigation events.\
    \ The reliance on crop cover development and the timing of SAR \nobservations\
    \ introduced constraints on the accuracy of the detection method (see the Dis-\n\
    cussion section). \nNext, the investigation focused on analyzing the changes in\
    \ ΔΨ(j,k) over the detected \nirrigation dates (t(m)) to gain insights into the\
    \ applied amounts of irrigation water. Among \nFigure 7. The accuracy metrics\

    \ to conduct a seasonal assessment of the irrigation \namounts to provide insights\
    \ into the performance of the amount-detection method \nthroughout the season.\
    \ The MAE% (Equation (18)) served as a measure of the average \ndeviation between\
    \ the detected irrigation amounts (AD) with the corresponding actual \n(real)\
    \ irrigation amounts (AR) for all the detected irrigation dates (t(m)) in the\
    \ four reference \nplots. A lower MAE% indicates a higher level of accuracy in\
    \ estimating the irrigation \namounts, indicating a close alignment between the\
    \ estimated and actual amounts applied. \nConversely, a higher MAE% suggests a\
    \ larger discrepancy between the estimated and ac-\ntual amounts. Based on the\
    \ obtained results, a MAE% of 16.4% was achieved for the P1 \nplot in Montpellier,\
    \ indicating relatively high accuracy in estimating the irrigation \namounts.\
    \ The estimated amounts closely matched the actual amounts applied in this plot.\
    \ \nHowever, for the Tarbes plots (P2, P3, and P4), a MAE% of 50% was obtained,\
    \ indicating \nFigure 8. Real irrigation amounts (grey bars), detected irrigation\

    \ (recall), with\n88% accuracy among the detected dates (precision). The F-score,\
    \ which is a combined\nmeasure of precision and recall, achieved a satisfactory\
    \ value of 78%, indicating a reasonably\nbalanced performance in identifying irrigated\
    \ areas. In P2, the recall was slightly higher\nat 75%, indicating that 25% of\
    \ the irrigated areas were not correctly detected. However,\nthe precision was\
    \ 100%, meaning that all the identiﬁed irrigated events were accurate.\nThe associated\
    \ F-score was 86%, indicating a good overall performance with a trade-off\nbetween\
    \ recall and precision. For P3 and P4, both exhibited a high recall of 100%, indicating\n\
    that all irrigated events were correctly identiﬁed. However, the precision varied\
    \ between\n80% for P3 and 75% for P4, suggesting that 20% to 25% of the detected\
    \ irrigated areas were\nfalse positives. The F-scores were 89% for P3 and 86%\
    \ for P4, demonstrating a good overall\nperformance with a slightly higher emphasis\
    \ on recall. These results highlight the strengths\nof the approach, providing\
    \ valuable insights for improving the accuracy and reliability of\nirrigation\

    \ by\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n26 of 36\nthe presence of false detections,\

    \ operational effectiveness, it is important to not only identify irrigation dates\n\
    but also estimate the irrigation amounts. Therefore, we conducted a comparison\

    \ by a single yellow bar, indicating that our\napproach detected irrigation on\
    \ a date that did not correspond with an actual irrigation\nevent. Likewise, an\
    \ undetected irrigation date (false negative) is represented by a single\ngrey\
    \ bar, indicating that our approach failed to detect an irrigation date.\nIn the\
    \ present study, Figure 8 displays only three instances of false positive date\n\
    detections, speciﬁcally in Figure 8a on the date 01 July (DOY = 182), in Figure\
    \ 8c on the date\n20 August (DOY = 233), and in Figure 8d on the date 19 August\
    \ (DOY = 232). Moreover,\nthe analysis revealed the failure to detect four irrigation\
    \ events. Among these undetected\nevents, three occurred in Figure 8a on the dates\
    \ 11 August, 22 August, and 26 September\n(DOYs = 223, 234, 269), while the fourth\
    \ one took place in Figure 8b on the date 5 August\n(DOY = 217).\nThese results\
    \ illustrate one of the inherent limitations of the approach employed, which\n\
    relies on the progressive growth of crop cover, as indicated by the ascending\
    \ dynamics of\nNDVI, along with the revisit time of the SAR data. This limitation\
    \ explains the occurrence of\nfalse detections during the reproductive stage and\
    \ the missed detections of actual irrigation\nevents. The reliance on crop cover\
    \ development and the timing of SAR observations\nintroduced constraints on the\
    \ accuracy of the detection method (see the Discussion section).\nNext, the investigation\
    \ focused on analyzing the changes in ∆Ψ(j,k) over the detected\nirrigation dates\
    \ (t(m)) to gain insights into the applied amounts of irrigation water. Among\n\
    the detected irrigation dates, a dose of k = 20 mm was identiﬁed as the most probable\n\
    amount of irrigation for ﬁve occurrences and k = 30 mm for two occurrences out\
    \ of a total\nof seven detected irrigation dates out of the 10 actual irrigation\
    \ dates. In the case of plots P2,\nP3, and P4, a dose of k = 20 mm was detected\
    \ for all the detected irrigation dates. However,\nthe detected irrigation amounts\
    \ underestimated the real irrigation amounts in most cases.\nTherefore, it could\
    \ be valuable to conduct a seasonal assessment of the irrigation\namounts to provide\
    \ insights into the performance of the amount-detection method through-\nout the\
    \ season. The MAE% (Equation (18)) served as a measure of the average deviation\n\
    between the detected irrigation amounts (AD) with the corresponding actual (real)\
    \ irrigation\namounts (AR) for all the detected irrigation dates (t(m)) in the\
    \ four reference plots. A lower\nMAE% indicates a higher level of accuracy in\
    \ estimating the irrigation amounts, indicating\na close alignment between the\
    \ estimated and actual amounts applied. Conversely, a higher\nMAE% suggests a\
    \ larger discrepancy between the estimated and actual amounts. Based\non the obtained\
    \ results, a MAE% of 16.4% was achieved for the P1 plot in Montpellier,\nindicating\
    \ relatively high accuracy in estimating the irrigation amounts. The estimated\n\
    amounts closely matched the actual amounts applied in this plot. However, for\
    \ the Tarbes\nplots (P2, P3, and P4), a MAE% of 50% was obtained, indicating a\
    \ larger discrepancy\nbetween the estimated and actual amounts. The estimation\
    \ method exhibited a lower level\nof accuracy in these plots, with more signiﬁcant\
    \ deviations between the estimated and\nactual amounts applied.\nRemote Sens.\

    \ irrigation dates and amounts at the plot level by\nintegrating surface soil\
    \ moisture (SSM) data obtained from Sentinel-1 (SSMS1) into Optirrig\nusing an\
    \ inversion technique. To achieve this, we compared the change in SSMS1 between\n\
    two Sentinel-1 SAR acquisition dates, namely, t(l) and the previous date t(i),\
    \ with the change\nin SSM simulated by Optirrig under various combinations of\
    \ irrigation dates and amounts\n(I(j,k), where j represents the date and k represents\
    \ the amount) injected into the model.\nThe analysis that produced the results\
    \ presented in the previous sections focused on\ndetermining irrigation dates\
    \ and amounts for which the disparity between the change\nin SSM predictions and\
    \ simulations between two SAR observations (i) was minimized,\naiming for a value\
    \ as close to zero as possible, and (ii) met speciﬁc criteria by demonstrating\n\
    signiﬁcant changes between the SSM simulated for different irrigation scenarios\
    \ in Optirrig\nand its difference with the SSM obtained from Sentinel-1 data.\
    \ These criteria were applied\nusing a change detection approach commonly used\
    \ in signal analysis and remote sensing\napplications. For a more detailed understanding\
    \ of the process of inversion and the\nspeciﬁc selection criteria utilized to\
    \ detect irrigation events, please refer to Figure 6 and its\naccompanying explanations.\n\
    The method yielded signiﬁcant results, highlighting the value and interest in\
    \ combin-\ning SSM derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data and Optirrig SSM simulations.\
    \ This combination\ndemonstrated the potential beneﬁts of detecting irrigation\
    \ events over maize plots. How-\never, there were limitations to detecting irrigation\
    \ events through the combined use of\nSSMS1 and Optirrig SSM simulations, which\
    \ could result in both missed (false negative)\nand false positive irrigation\
    \ detections, between two SAR observations. These limitations\nprimarily stemmed\
    \ from four factors: (1) the 6-day temporal resolution of the Sentinel-1\nSAR\
    \ being insufﬁcient to detect all the irrigation events, (2) heavy rainfall and\
    \ soil satura-\ntion, (3) the limit of penetration of the C-band SAR signal in\
    \ dense vegetation cover, and\n(4) farmer’s irrigation practices.\n5.1. Sentinel-1\
    \ Revisit Time\nFirst, these limitations were inﬂuenced by the soil texture, ﬁeld\
    \ capacity, and rapid\ndrying of the soil, which could impact the effectiveness\
    \ of irrigation event detection. The\nrapid drying of the soil necessitated a\
    \ sensor with a higher temporal resolution to detect\nquick changes in soil moisture\
    \ content, such as an increase due to irrigation followed by a\ndecrease due to\
    \ drying. Previous studies conﬁrmed the importance of a maximum time\ndelay of\
    \ three days between an irrigation event and the subsequent SAR image to accurately\n\
    detect the event’s impact on the SAR backscattering signal [44,48]. Beyond this\
    \ timeframe,\nit becomes challenging to detect the effect of an irrigation event.\
    \ The temporal resolution\nof the S1 SAR should ideally be no more than three\
    \ days for a more effective irrigation\ndetection [16,43].\nThe 6-day revisit\
    \ time of the S1 SAR constellation poses a signiﬁcant challenge in\ndetecting\
    \ irrigation events due to the rapid dry-out of certain soil surfaces, as previously\n\
    mentioned. It also creates difﬁculties in distinguishing the effects of rainfall\
    \ and irrigation\nevents, especially in the worst-case scenario, where both rain\
    \ and irrigation occur between\nthe same two consecutive acquisition dates. The\
    \ increase in SSM values after rainfall and\nirrigation may be similar, even for\
    \ different amounts, which makes it even more difﬁcult. In\nthe speciﬁc case described\
    \ in the P2 plot (Figure 8b), there was a missed irrigation detection\non 5 August\
    \ 2018 following a heavy rainfall event (∼=33 mm) on 2 August 2018, which\nlikely\
    \ caused a signiﬁcant increase in soil moisture, resulting in high SSM values.\
    \ This\nmissed detection could be attributed to the method’s inability to effectively\
    \ distinguish\nbetween the impact of the heavy rainfall and the irrigation. As\
    \ a result, the occurrence\nof the irrigation event went undetected, leading to\
    \ a false negative detection. It is worth\nnoting that this particular case was\
    \ observed only once in the analysis due to the applied\nﬁlters and methods used\
    \ to distinguish between rainfall and irrigation events. These ﬁlters\ninvolved\
    \ analyzing Optirrig SSM simulations and SSM at both plot and grid scales, as\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n28 of 36\ndescribed in Section 3. Unfortunately,\
    \ due to an anomaly affecting S1B, the revisit time for\nS1 SAR data has increased\
    \ from 6 days to 12 days, as only S1A remains operational. This\nreduced revisit\
    \ frequency presents a challenge for SSM estimation frequency and accurate\nirrigation\
    \ detection and monitoring. To address this challenge, an effective strategy involves\n\
    integrating SSM estimations from other SAR data sources. Collaborating with SAR\
    \ satellites\nlike ALOS PALSAR, RADARSAT, and COSMO-SkyMed can provide supplementary\
    \ SSM\ndata, effectively augmenting the frequency of observations. Additionally,\
    \ leveraging the\nbeneﬁts of small- or micro-SAR satellites, which can be launched\
    \ in constellations, offers\na promising solution. These satellites provide increased\
    \ revisit frequencies and higher\nspatial resolutions, which are essential for\
    \ capturing frequent and detailed observations\nof irrigation patterns and soil\
    \ moisture dynamics. By combining the data from different\nSAR sources, both large\
    \ and small, a more comprehensive dataset covering a broader\nrange of time intervals\
    \ and spatial scales can be created. This integrated approach can\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ enhance the potential for the precise analysis of irrigation patterns and soil\n\
    moisture dynamics, despite the limitations imposed by the reduced revisit time.\
    \ Moreover,\nthere is promising news on the horizon—the launch of a new constellation\
    \ of SAR satellites,\nnamely, Sentinel-1C, is planned for the end of 2023. Once\
    \ operational, Sentinel-1C is\nexpected to mitigate the revisit time challenge\
    \ by providing more frequent observations,\nbolstering the accuracy of irrigation\
    \ detection and soil moisture estimation efforts.\n5.2. Climatic and Soil Conditions\n\
    Optirrig SSM simulations were crucial in differentiating rainfall and irrigation\
    \ events.\nIn the present study, the observed SSM changes derived from the S1\
    \ data at the plot and\ngrid scales were compared with the simulated SSM changes\
    \ from Optirrig under rainfall\nconditions. This comparison provided valuable\
    \ insights into the expected SSM values,\nallowing for the accurate interpretation\
    \ of S1 data and avoiding irrigation misinterpreta-\ntions. However, Optirrig\
    \ ﬁlter effectiveness may vary depending on speciﬁc cases, and the\ncontext and\
    \ limitations should be considered.\nIndeed, heavy rainfall can also lead to false\
    \ positive irrigation detection, particularly\nin situations where there is a\
    \ moderately developed maize cover that restricts soil evap-\noration [97]. This\
    \ effect is particularly pronounced during the early vegetative stage and\nlate\
    \ reproductive stages of maize growth when the vegetation cover is not dense enough\n\
    to attenuate the SAR signal (NDVI < 0.7) [49], and thus, allow for effective monitoring\
    \ of\nthe underlying SSM. During this period, the moderately dense vegetation\
    \ canopy acts as a\nbarrier, limiting the evaporation of soil moisture. In this\
    \ context, if a heavy rainfall event\noccurs, the soil can become saturated with\
    \ water, which means that the soil has reached its\nmaximum water-holding capacity\
    \ and cannot absorb any more moisture. As a result, the\nsoil remains wet even\
    \ after the rainfall has ceased. When using Optirrig SSM simulations,\nwhich estimate\
    \ SSM levels based on rainfall inputs, simulations may not exhibit signiﬁcant\n\
    changes between two consecutive SAR acquisition dates when soil saturation occurs.\
    \ This\nis because the simulations account for the limited capacity of the soil\
    \ to absorb additional\nmoisture beyond saturation. In fact, the detection of\
    \ irrigation amounts was found to\nbe less efﬁcient for the plots in the humid\
    \ climate of Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4) compared\nwith the “semi-arid” climate of\
    \ Montpellier (P1). For the P1 plot, the estimation of the\nseasonal irrigation\
    \ amounts exhibited a relatively high accuracy, with a mean absolute error\npercentage\
    \ (MAE%) of 16.4%. In contrast, for the P2, P3, and P4 plots in the humid climate,\n\
    a higher MAE% of 50% was obtained, suggesting a larger discrepancy between the\
    \ detected\nand actual amounts of irrigation. This discrepancy was likely due\
    \ to the challenges posed\nby the humid climate, where heavy rainfall events can\
    \ contribute to soil saturation, thereby\naffecting the accuracy of irrigation\
    \ detection and amount estimation. The effectiveness of\nthe irrigation detection\
    \ approach, particularly in estimating irrigation amounts, appears\nto be inﬂuenced\
    \ by the local climate conditions, with the humid climate introducing addi-\n\
    tional complexities. Moreover, SSMS1 values at the plot scale may remain high\
    \ due to the\nwater content in the saturated soil, where evaporation and rapid\
    \ dry-out are restrained. In\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n29 of 36\nfact, the\
    \ S1 SAR signal is sensitive to the presence of water in the soil, resulting in\
    \ elevated\nSSM values. However, at the grid scale (10 km × 10 km), SSM values\
    \ calculated over bare\nsoils may show stability or decrease since bare soil areas\
    \ have higher evaporative capacities\ncompared with plots with developed maize\
    \ cover. In such situations, the method used for\nirrigation detection may interpret\
    \ the observed increase in SSM variation at the plot scale\nas an indication of\
    \ irrigation occurrence. In other words, Optirrig simulations for rain-fed\nconditions\
    \ may not show substantial SSM changes, and the S1 SSM values at the plot scale\n\
    may remain high, leading to false irrigation detection. In the study, three false\
    \ positive\nirrigation detections were observed after relatively heavy rainfall\
    \ events, speciﬁcally over\nP1 on 01-Jul (DOY = 182), P3 on 20 August (DOY = 232),\
    \ and P4 on 19 August (DOY = 232).\nThese false positive detections occurred due\
    \ to the restrained evaporation of soil moisture\nunder developed maize cover\
    \ (NDVI values that ranged from 0.6 to 0.7), which resulted in\nhigh SSM values\
    \ that were mistaken as indications of irrigation occurrence.\n5.3. C-Band SAR\
    \ Signal Penetration through Dense Vegetation Cover\nThe limited penetration of\
    \ the C-band SAR signal through dense vegetation cover\nhas a direct impact on\
    \ the effectiveness of irrigation detection using Sentinel-1 SAR data.\nThe method\
    \ proposed in this study relies on analyzing the change of SSM derived from S1\n\
    data and SSM simulations through Optirrig to identify irrigation events. However,\
    \ when\nthe SAR signal is impeded by dense vegetation, the accurate estimation\
    \ of SSM becomes\nchallenging. This limitation arises from the S1 signal’s inability\
    \ to penetrate through\nvegetation and reach the surface soil. Research conducted\
    \ by El Hajj et al. [49] focused\non the penetration of the C-band SAR signal\
    \ across different plots of maize, wheat, and\ngrassland. Their ﬁndings revealed\
    \ that the C-band SAR signal’s penetration is limited to an\nNDVI value of 0.7.\
    \ Therefore, dense vegetation cover can hinder the detection of irrigation\nevents\
    \ due to the SAR signal’s limited sensitivity to surface soil moisture. Therefore,\
    \ if the\nC-band SAR signal is unable to penetrate dense vegetation, the estimated\
    \ SSM values may\nnot adequately represent the irrigation-induced changes in soil\
    \ moisture. Consequently,\nthe threshold criteria, which were based on S1 and\
    \ Optirrig SSM simulations, used in this\nmethod to identify irrigation events\
    \ (Section 3.2.2) may not be met, resulting in missed\ndetections or false negative\
    \ results. In our case, missed detections were observed for peak\nNDVI values\
    \ between 0.7 and 0.8 over the P1 and P2 plots (Figure 8a,b). These ﬁndings\n\
    are consistent with the results obtained by El Hajj et al. [48] for grassland\
    \ plots and Le\nPage et al. [43] for maize plots. Both studies highlight the limitations\
    \ of irrigation detection\nover dense vegetation cover (NDVI > 0.7) due to the\
    \ restricted penetration of the C-band\nSAR signal.\n5.4. Farmer’s Irrigation\
    \ Practice Variability\nOne additional reason for missed or false negative detections\
    \ of irrigation events is\nthe variation in farmers’ irrigation practices, particularly\
    \ in terms of timing and quantity.\nIt is likely that the accurate detection of\
    \ irrigation is hindered because farmers do not\nalways follow the irrigation\
    \ decisions based on a soil water balance and exact crop water\nrequirements or\
    \ decisions that could be advised by Optirrig, including triggers, criteria,\n\
    and doses. Instead, their irrigation decisions are inﬂuenced by a combination\
    \ of factors,\nincluding their experience, local knowledge, and perceptions of\
    \ water availability. They\nmay prioritize ensuring an adequate water supply to\
    \ the crops, leading to irrigation\namounts that exceed the exact crop water requirements.\
    \ For instance, it appeared to be\nchallenging to detect the last irrigation applied\
    \ on 26-Sep (DOY = 269) over the P1 plot.\nThis irrigation event may not be deemed\
    \ necessary from the water balance perspective\nof Optirrig, but farmers still\
    \ apply it for reasons such as grain ﬁlling or to prevent soil\ncrusting [98].\
    \ On the other hand, Optirrig relies on a soil water balance equation to simulate\n\
    and predict the soil moisture content in the root zone of the crops. This equation\
    \ takes into\naccount factors such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil\
    \ characteristics, and irrigation\nevents to estimate the water balance in the\
    \ soil. Therefore, when testing different irrigation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n\
    30 of 36\ndates and amounts, Optirrig determines the exact SSM induced by the\
    \ irrigation and other\nwater sources (rainfall), which may not align precisely\
    \ with farmers’ irrigation timing and\nthe amounts they apply. In the present\
    \ study, we consistently noticed that the detected\nirrigation amounts in the\
    \ four plots (P1, P2, P3, and P4) were consistently lower than\nthe actual irrigation\
    \ amounts applied by the farmers in the ﬁeld. This indicates a case\nof underestimation\
    \ or missed detection of irrigation events. This discrepancy between\nfarmers’\
    \ actual irrigation practices and the detected irrigation amounts can explain\
    \ the low\naccuracy of detecting real irrigation amounts (which is somehow expected\
    \ as Optirrig is\nused here as a tool for analysis, not for recommendations).\
    \ Farmers tend to overestimate\ncrop water requirements and apply higher levels\
    \ of irrigation that do not match the exact\ncrop water needs.\n5.5. Uncertainties\
    \ Associated with Optirrig’s Simulations\nIn a broader context, the SSM simulations\
    \ in Optirrig are subject to inherent uncertain-\nties, which can impact the accuracy\
    \ of irrigation detection. These uncertainties arise from\nseveral factors, including\
    \ the variability in input parameters and the temporal dynamics of\nvegetation\
    \ [99,100]. In fact, the accuracy of SSM simulations depends on the availability\n\
    and quality of input parameters, such as soil properties, vegetation characteristics,\
    \ and\nmeteorological data [101]. However, these parameters can vary spatially\
    \ and temporally,\nleading to uncertainties in the simulations [102]. Moreover,\
    \ the temporal dynamics of\nvegetation, including growth stages, leaf area index,\
    \ and canopy density, can also introduce\nuncertainties in SSM simulations. Vegetation\
    \ plays a crucial role in the water balance of\nthe soil–plant–atmosphere system,\
    \ as it affects evapotranspiration rates and soil moisture\ndepletion in crop\
    \ models [103], such as Optirrig. However, accurately representing the\ndynamics\
    \ of vegetation within the model is challenging. Changes in vegetation charac-\n\
    teristics over time can lead to variations in evapotranspiration rates and water\
    \ uptake by\nplants, impacting the simulated SSM values [104] and potentially\
    \ affecting the detection\nof irrigation events. To mitigate these uncertainties,\
    \ there is growing interest in incorpo-\nrating multiple external and independent\
    \ data, such as radar and optical data, in various\nirrigation mapping, detection,\
    \ and crop monitoring approaches [105,106]. In a recent study,\nNie et al. [107]\
    \ demonstrated the potential of using remotely sensed vegetation and soil\nmoisture\
    \ observations (MODIS LAI and SMAP data) to constrain irrigation estimation in\n\
    the Noah-MP land surface model. Results have shown that incorporating these constraints\n\
    reduces model sensitivity to irrigation parameterization, improves characterization\
    \ of\nirrigation patterns and their effects on evapotranspiration and soil moisture,\
    \ and corrects\nfor vegetation conditions and irrigation timing. This approach\
    \ highlights the importance\nof utilizing remotely sensed data for irrigation\
    \ detection and provides a less engineered\nmethod to constrain irrigation modeling\
    \ uncertainty. The integration of several remote\nsensing data sources aims to\
    \ inform crop models and reduce uncertainties associated with\nirrigation estimation.\
    \ In the present case, incorporating both radar data for soil surface\nmoisture\
    \ estimates and optical data, such as LAI observations, into the inversion process\n\
    would likely yield substantial beneﬁts. By combining these data, it becomes possible\
    \ to\nconstrain both the water balance and crop growth schemes of Optirrig. This\
    \ approach\nenhances the accuracy and reliability of the crop model, enabling\
    \ improved detection of\nirrigation events and more precise estimation of crop\
    \ water requirements. For instance,\nFerrant et al. [106] developed and tested\
    \ a methodology using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\nsatellite observations to monitor\
    \ the spatiotemporal variations in irrigated areas in the\nKudaliar catchment,\
    \ Telangana State, South India. The methodology employed a machine\nlearning algorithm\
    \ and achieved high accuracy by combining radar and optical data. The\nresults\
    \ showed the variability of irrigated areas across different seasons and highlighted\n\
    the potential of this approach for near-real-time monitoring in South India. These\
    \ ﬁndings\ncontribute to calibrating agro-hydrological models and assessing the\
    \ impact of agriculture\non water resources. Incorporating biophysical data, such\
    \ as LAI, from high-resolution\noptical images, like those from Sentinel-2, in\
    \ conjunction with SSM SAR estimations can\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n31 of\
    \ 36\ngreatly beneﬁt the constraint of Optirrig simulations. This combination\
    \ of data sources\nenhances the monitoring of irrigation practices by providing\
    \ complementary information\non vegetation dynamics and soil moisture levels.\
    \ By integrating LAI and SSM data, Optirrig\ncan achieve improved accuracy and\
    \ reliability in detecting and monitoring irrigation prac-\ntices. The results\
    \ of the present study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and\noffer\
    \ valuable insights into the precision and dependability of irrigation date and\
    \ amount\ndetections, providing reliable information for monitoring irrigation\
    \ practices. With further\nvalidation using a larger dataset encompassing diverse\
    \ crops and irrigation methods, we\ncould potentially develop a near-real-time\
    \ tool for irrigation detection.\n6. Conclusions\nThis study aimed at the detection\
    \ of irrigation dates and amounts at the plot level by\nintegrating Sentinel-1\
    \ surface soil moisture (SSMS1) data into Optirrig using an inversion\ntechnique,\
    \ which ﬁts in the idea of providing methods for the supervision of irrigated\n\
    perimeters. The methodology involved comparing the change in SSMS1 between two\
    \ SAR\nacquisition dates with the change in SSM simulated by Optirrig for various\
    \ combinations\nof irrigation dates and amounts. Two ﬁlters were applied to remove\
    \ the ambiguity between\nirrigation events and rainfall, and thus, determine the\
    \ occurrence or not of a potential\nirrigation event. These ﬁlters relied on comparing\
    \ the change in the SSM at plot scale to\nthe change in SSM at grid scale (10\
    \ km × 10 km) and in the SSM simulated by Optirrig\nunder the effect of the rainfall\
    \ alone. The detected irrigation date with the shortest time\ndifference from\
    \ the real irrigation event date was considered the detected event. To assess\n\
    the accuracy and robustness, the method was tested against documented situations\
    \ in\nfour experimental maize plots located in the Occitanie Region of southern\
    \ France (near\nMontpellier and Tarbes). This testing helped to evaluate the method’s\
    \ applicability for\noperational purposes, such as supervising irrigated territories,\
    \ and provided insights into\nits strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.\n\
    The performance of the inversion process in retrieving correct irrigation dates\
    \ between\ntwo successive Sentinel-1 images was evaluated using three metrics:\
    \ recall, precision, and\nF-score. These metrics assess the accuracy based on\
    \ false negative (missed irrigation de-\ntection), false positive (incorrectly\
    \ detected irrigation), and true positive detections. The\nevaluation of the inversion\
    \ process using real irrigation data yielded promising results. The\nrecall, which\
    \ represents the ratio of true positive detections to the sum of the true positives\n\
    and false negatives, was determined to be 86.2%. This indicates that the inversion\
    \ process\nsuccessfully captured a signiﬁcant portion of the irrigation events.\
    \ Similarly, the precision,\nwhich denotes the ratio of true positive detections\
    \ to the sum of the true positives and false\npositives, was calculated to be\
    \ 85.7%. This metric demonstrates the accuracy of the inver-\nsion process in\
    \ correctly identifying irrigation events while minimizing false detections.\n\
    Furthermore, the assessment of seasonal irrigation amounts estimation performance\
    \ for\neach plot revealed variations based on the climate conditions. The efﬁciency\
    \ of irrigation\namount detection proved to be lower for the plots situated in\
    \ the humid climate of Tarbes\nin comparison with the “semi-arid” climate of Montpellier.\
    \ The estimation of seasonal\nirrigation quantities for the P1 plot demonstrated\
    \ relatively accurate results. However, for\nthe plots in Tarbes, a notably higher\
    \ mean absolute error percentage (MAE%) was recorded,\nindicating a more signiﬁcant\
    \ disparity between the detected and actual irrigation amounts.\nA comprehensive\
    \ and meticulous analysis of the results provided valuable insights\ninto the\
    \ weaknesses and instances of failure in detecting irrigation dates and amounts.\
    \ The\nexamination of missed and false irrigation detection brought to light the\
    \ primary limitations\nof the method, which could be attributed to two key factors.\
    \ First, the characteristics of the\nSentinel-1 constellation, including its 6-day\
    \ revisit time and the challenges associated with\nsignal penetration in dense\
    \ maize cover, were identiﬁed as contributing to the limitations.\nAdditionally,\
    \ it was found that the parameterization of Optirrig for SSM simulations did\n\
    not precisely align with the irrigation practices and decision rules followed\
    \ by farmers,\nfurther impacting the accuracy of the method.\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n32 of 36\nThe incorporation of external information and constraints\
    \ to enhance the inversion pro-\ncess represents a valuable perspective for future\
    \ practical implementations of the method,\nboth at speciﬁc plots and across larger\
    \ irrigated areas. One promising approach is the\nincorporation of additional\
    \ data sources and constraints to inform and reﬁne the inversion\nprocess in Optirrig.\
    \ For instance, combining soil surface moisture estimates obtained from\nradar\
    \ data with leaf area index (LAI) observations derived from optical data can offer\n\
    signiﬁcant beneﬁts to the inversion process. Especially notable is the upcoming\
    \ launch of\nthe new SAR mission NISAR in the L-band, which offers the potential\
    \ for more precise and\ndeeper SSM (surface soil moisture) estimations. This capability\
    \ will be particularly advan-\ntageous in regions with dense canopy cover, as\
    \ the L-band SAR signal can penetrate further\ninto the soil and crop canopy.\
    \ L-band SAR data bring a distinct advantage due to their\nsuperior ability to\
    \ penetrate dense vegetation cover, resulting in more accurate estimations\nof\
    \ soil moisture content within such areas. To tackle the challenge of observation\
    \ frequency\nand to further reﬁne the accuracy of soil moisture estimations and\
    \ irrigation detection, a\npotential strategy involves incorporating L-band NISAR\
    \ data as an additional data source\ncomplementing the existing C-band data. The\
    \ integration of these two data types can\nlead to an increased observation frequency,\
    \ thereby furnishing valuable insights into both\nwater balance and crop growth\
    \ dynamics within the Optirrig model. By leveraging such\ncomplementary information\
    \ and further validation using a larger dataset encompassing\ndiverse crops and\
    \ irrigation methods, it becomes possible to enhance the accuracy and\nreliability\
    \ of the method’s performance and potentially develop a near real-time tool for\n\
    irrigation detection.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.H., B.C. and\

    \ ik op de schouders van reuzen stond.” \nIsaac Newton \n \n \niii \nSummary \n\
    Freshwater stems from precipitation, which is limited in time and space. Precipitation\
    \ \nover land differentiates into a blue water flow (runoff via groundwater and\
    \ surface \nwater) and a green water flow (evaporation). Both flows are partially\
    \ allocated to serve \nthe economy, resulting in blue and green water footprints\
    \ (WF). There are maximum \nsustainable levels to the blue and green WF, since\
    \ part of the flows need to be reserved \nto meet environmental flow requirements\
    \ and conserve terrestrial biodiversity. Water \nscarcity, the degree to which\
    \ the actual approaches the maximum sustainable WF, is \nbecoming increasingly\
    \ important due to increasing water consumption but limited water \navailability.\
    \ The goal of this thesis is to broaden the discourse on freshwater scarcity in\
    \ \ntwo respects. First, by assessing how Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) for\
    \ a country \ncan contribute to more sustainable and efficient allocation of blue\
    \ water resources. \nSecond, by assessing the allocation of the world’s green\
    \ water resources with respect to \nmaximum sustainable levels. The first sub\
    \ goal is approached by two case studies for \nblue water-scarce and water-dependent\
    \ countries. Three subsequent studies work \ntowards the second sub goal: a review\
    \ of green water scarcity indicators; a global \nassessment of the WF of wood\
    \ production; and a first assessment of green water scarcity. \nThe Added Value\
    \ of Water Footprint Assessment for National Water Policy: A Case \nStudy for\
    \ Morocco. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the added value of detailed\
    \ \nanalysis of the human WF within a country and thorough assessment of the virtual\
    \ \nwater flows leaving and entering a country (the water needed to produce traded\
    \ \ncommodities) for formulating national water policy. A WFA is carried out for\
    \ Morocco, \nmapping the WF of different activities per river basin per month,\
    \ distinguishing between \nsurface- and groundwater. Green, blue and grey WF (the\
    \ grey WF represents the volume \nof water required to assimilate pollutants)\
    \ estimates and virtual water flows are mainly \nderived from a previous grid-based\
    \ (5 × 5 arc minute) global study for the period 1996-\n2005. These estimates\
    \ are placed in the context of monthly natural runoff and waste \nassimilation\
    \ capacity per river basin derived from Moroccan data sources. The study \nfinds\
    \ that: (i) evaporation from storage reservoirs is the second largest form of\
    \ blue \nwater consumption in Morocco, after irrigated crop production; (ii) Morocco’s\
    \ water and \nland resources are mainly used to produce relatively low-value (in\
    \ US$/m3 and US$/ha) \ncrops such as cereals, olives and almonds; (iii) most of\
    \ the virtual water export from \nMorocco relates to the export of products with\
    \ a relatively low economic water \nproductivity (in US$/m3); (iv) blue water\
    \ scarcity on a monthly scale is severe in all river \nbasins and pressure on\
    \ groundwater resources by abstractions and nitrate pollution is \niv \nconsiderable\
    \ in most basins and; (v) the estimated potential water savings by partial \n\
    relocation of crops to basins where they consume less water and by reducing WFs\
    \ of \ncrops down to benchmark levels are significant compared to demand reducing\
    \ and \nsupply increasing measures considered in Morocco’s national water strategy.\
    \ \nMitigating the Risk of Extreme Water Scarcity and Dependency: The Case of\
    \ Jordan. \nJordan faces great internal water scarcity and pollution, conflict\
    \ over transboundary \nwaters, and strong dependency on external water resources\
    \ through trade. This study \nanalyses these issues and subsequently reviews options\
    \ to reduce the risk of extreme \nwater scarcity and dependency. It is found that:\
    \ (i) even while taking into account the \nreturn flows, blue water scarcity in\
    \ Jordan is severe; (ii) groundwater consumption is \nnearly double the groundwater\
    \ availability; (iii) water pollution aggravates blue water \nscarcity and (iv)\
    \ while Jordan’s dependence on transboundary resources is already large \n(34%),\
    \ its dependency on external water resources through trade is much larger (86%).\
    \ \nThe review of response options yields 10 ingredients for a strategy for Jordan\
    \ to mitigate \nthe risks of extreme water scarcity and dependency. With respect\
    \ to these ingredients, \nJordan’s current water policy requires a strong redirection\
    \ towards water demand \nmanagement. More attention should be paid to reducing\
    \ water demand by changing the \nconsumption pattern of Jordanian consumers and\
    \ planned desalination projects require \ncareful consideration regarding the\
    \ sustainability of their energy supply. Sustainable \nmitigation of the inevitable\
    \ large external water dependency involves importing water-\nintensive products\
    \ and commodities from a diverse number of countries that are under a \nsignificantly\
    \ lower degree of water scarcity than Jordan. \nReview and Classification of Indicators\
    \ of Green Water Availability and Scarcity. This \nstudy reviews and classifies\
    \ around 80 indicators of green water availability and \nscarcity, and discusses\
    \ the way forward to develop operational green water scarcity \nindicators that\
    \ can broaden the scope of water scarcity assessments, which previously \nfocused\
    \ on blue water. It is found that the number of green water availability indicators\
    \ \nby far outnumbers the existing green water scarcity indicators. A suitable\
    \ – yet \ntheoretical – green water scarcity indicator, which measures the degree\
    \ to which the \nactual approaches the maximum sustainable green WF in a geographic\
    \ area, faces two \nmain operational challenges. First, the quantification of\
    \ the green WF of wood \nproduction, considering that forest evaporation needs\
    \ to be separated into a green and a \nblue part (because trees can directly take\
    \ up groundwater through capillary rise) and \nthat only part of the forest evaporation\
    \ can be attributed to wood production in semi-\nnatural production forests. Second,\
    \ a spatially-explicit assessment of green water \nv \navailability, considering\
    \ land suitability and the need to conserve additional lands for \nnature with\
    \ respect to the current protected area network. \nThe Water Footprint of Wood\
    \ for Lumber, Pulp, Paper, Fuel and Firewood. This study \ntackles the first operational\
    \ challenge to measuring green water scarcity, previously \nidentified. For the\
    \ period 1961-2010, forest evaporation is estimated at a high spatial \nresolution\
    \ and separated into green and blue components. Subsequently, total water \nconsumption\
    \ is attributed to various forest products, including ecosystem services. It is\
    \ \nfound that global water consumption for roundwood production increased by\
    \ 25% over \n50 years to 961×109 m3/y (96% green; 4% blue) in 2001-2010. The WF\
    \ per m3 of wood is \nsignificantly smaller in (sub)tropical forests compared\
    \ to temperate/boreal forests, \nbecause (sub)tropical forests host relatively\
    \ more value next to wood production in the \nform of other ecosystem services.\
    \ In terms of economic water productivity and energy \nyield from bio-ethanol\
    \ per unit of water, roundwood is rather comparable with major \nfood, feed and\
    \ energy crops. Recycling of wood products could effectively reduce the \nWF of\
    \ the forestry sector, thereby leaving more water available for the generation\
    \ of \nother ecosystem services. Intensification of wood production can only reduce\
    \ the WF per \nunit of wood if the additional wood value per ha outweighs the\
    \ loss of value of other \necosystem services, which is often not the case in\
    \ (sub)tropical forests. The results of this \nstudy contribute to a more complete\
    \ picture of the human appropriation of water, thus \nfeeding the debate on water\
    \ for food or feed versus energy and wood. \nLimits to the World’s Green Water\
    \ Resources for Food, Feed, Fibre, Timber and Bio-\nEnergy. This study quantifies\
    \ the allocation of the world’s green water resources – the \nmain source of water\
    \ to produce food, feed, fibre, timber and bio-energy – and compares \ngreen WFs\
    \ to regional maximum sustainable levels of green water availability, thereby\
    \ \ntackling the second challenge to measuring green water scarcity, previously\
    \ identified. \nActual and maximum sustainable green WFs of crop production, livestock\
    \ grazing, \nwood production and urban areas are estimated at a 5 x 5 arc minute\
    \ grid cell spatial \nresolution, using a sophisticated allocation procedure that\
    \ includes accounting for \necosystem services provided by forests and pastures.\
    \ The study shows how the world’s \nlimited green water resources are allocated\
    \ to different purposes and where we \napproach or overshoot maximum sustainable\
    \ levels. It is found that green water is \nscarcer than blue water in 91 out\
    \ of 163 countries, and that humanity is closer to the \nplanetary boundary for\
    \ green water (56% appropriation) than for blue water (27-54% \nappropriation).\
    \ Human’s green WF is close to or beyond the maximum sustainable level \nin Europe,\
    \ Central America, the Middle East and South Asia. Globally, 18% of the green\
    \ \nvi \nWF is in areas to be reserved for nature. For a sustainable future, overshoot\
    \ should be \nprevented and the green water resources below the maximum sustainable\
    \ level should \nbe used as productive as possible. This requires protection of\
    \ lands, contraction of \nactivities in areas with high conservation value and\
    \ efficient production systems with \nincreased water and land productivities\
    \ through management of the full range of \necosystem services along the lines\
    \ of sustainable intensification. \nConclusion. Dealing with freshwater scarcity\
    \ requires sustainable and efficient \nallocation of blue and green water resources.\
    \ This research has shown that national \npolicies for sustainable and efficient\
    \ use of blue water resources can be enriched by \nWFA. First, WFA feeds discussion\
    \ on whether water is efficiently allocated, by showing \nthe WF of end-purposes\
    \ and the associated economic value. Second, WFA can provide \nenriching insights\
    \ in pressures on blue water resources, by assessing the ratio of the \nactual\
    \ to the maximum sustainable blue WF in a river basin at a monthly resolution\
    \ and \nby quantifying the role of water pollution through assessment of the grey\
    \ WF. Third, \nWFA reveals options to reduce water demand by changing production\
    \ and consumption \npatterns, which can lead to significant savings compared to\
    \ traditional measures \nconsidered in water management. Fourth, WFA emphasizes\
    \ the risks of being dependent \non water resources outside the country’s borders\
    \ when virtual water imports are placed \nin the context of water scarcity in\
    \ the exporting nations. Furthermore, this research has \nshown that, to date,\
    \ green water scarcity did not receive the attention it deserves. By \nquantifying\
    \ the limits to green water availability, the main source of water to produce\
    \ \nfood, feed, fibre, timber and bio-energy, this research emphasizes the critical\
    \ role green \nwater has to play in the discourse on freshwater scarcity. \n \n\
    \ \nvii \nSamenvatting \nZoetwater is afkomstig van neerslag en die neerslag is\
    \ beperkt in de tijd en in de ruimte. \nNeerslag boven land kan worden onderverdeeld\
    \ in blauw water (afvoer via grondwater \nen oppervlaktewater) en groen water\
    \ (verdamping). Beide stromen worden deels \ntoebedeeld aan economische activiteiten,\
    \ met blauwe en groene watervoetafdrukken \n(WV) tot gevolg. De blauwe en groene\
    \ watervoetafdruk kennen een maximaal \nduurzaam niveau, want een deel van de\
    \ blauwe en groene waterstroom moet \ngereserveerd worden voor ecosystemen in\
    \ de rivier en op het land. Waterschaarste – de \nmate waarin de daadwerkelijke\
    \ watervoetafdruk het maximaal duurzame niveau \nbenadert – wordt steeds belangrijker,\
    \ omdat de watervraag toeneemt terwijl de \nbeschikbaarheid van water beperkt\
    \ is. Het doel van deze dissertatie is om het \nwaterschaarstedebat op twee manieren\
    \ te verbreden. Ten eerste, door te kijken hoe een \nwatervoetafdrukanalyse (WVA)\
    \ voor een land kan bijdragen aan een meer duurzame en \nefficiënte allocatie\
    \ van blauw water. Ten tweede, door in te schatten hoe het groene \nwater op aarde\
    \ is toebedeeld aan verschillende doeleinden en hoe dit zich verhoudt tot \neen\
    \ maximaal duurzaam niveau van de groene WV. Het eerste subdoel is benaderd door\
    \ \nmiddel van twee case studies voor landen die blauwe waterschaarste kennen\
    \ en die \n(indirect) sterk afhankelijk zijn van water in het buitenland. Drie\
    \ achtereenvolgende \nstudies werken naar het tweede subdoel toe: een evaluatie\
    \ van indicatoren voor groene \nwaterschaarste; een schatting van de WV van houtproductie\
    \ wereldwijd; en een eerste \nkwantificatie van groene waterschaarste. \nDe Toegevoegde\
    \ Waarde van Watervoetafdrukanalyse voor Nationaal Waterbeleid: \nEen Case Studie\
    \ voor Marokko. Het doel van deze studie is om aan te tonen wat de \ntoegevoegde\
    \ waarde is van een gedetailleerde analyse van de WV in een land en een \ndiepgaande\
    \ evaluatie van de in- en uitgaande virtuele waterstromen van dat land (het \n\
    water dat nodig is voor de productie van handelswaar) voor het formuleren van\
    \ \nnationaal waterbeleid. Er is een WVA uitgevoerd voor Marokko waarbij – per\
    \ \nstroomgebied per maand – de WV van verschillende activiteiten in kaart is\
    \ gebracht en \nwaarbij onderscheid is gemaakt tussen oppervlaktewater en grondwater.\
    \ De schattingen \nvan de groene, blauwe en grijze WV (de grijze WV is een maat\
    \ voor de hoeveelheid \nwater die nodig is om vervuilende stoffen op te nemen\
    \ of te verdunnen) en die van de \nvirtuele waterstromen, zijn voornamelijk afgeleid\
    \ van een voorgaande globale studie op \nrasterniveau (5 x 5 boogminuten) voor\
    \ de periode 1996-2005. Deze schattingen zijn in de \ncontext geplaatst van de\
    \ natuurlijke rivierafvoer (per maand) en de capaciteit van een \nrivier om vervuilende\
    \ stoffen op te nemen; beiden per stroomgebied en afgeleid van \nviii \nMarokkaanse\
    \ databronnen. De uitkomsten van deze studie zijn dat: (i) verdamping van \nstuwmeren\
    \ de op één na grootste vorm van blauw watergebruik is, na geïrrigeerde \nlandbouw;\
    \ (ii) het water en land in Marokko voornamelijk wordt ingezet om relatief \n\
    laagwaardige (in US$/m3 en US$/ha) gewassen te produceren, zoals granen, olijven\
    \ en \namandelen; (iii) het leeuwendeel van het water dat Marokko virtueel verlaat\
    \ gerelateerd \nis aan de export van producten met een relatief lage economische\
    \ waterproductiviteit (in \nUS$/m3); (iv) ernstige blauwe waterschaarste optreedt\
    \ in alle stroomgebieden op \nmaandelijkse schaal en dat de meeste stroomgebieden\
    \ kampen met een aanzienlijke \ndruk op grondwater door onttrekkingen en nitraatvervuiling;\
    \ (v) er potentieel veel water \nbespaard zou kunnen worden – zeker in vergelijking\
    \ met de huidige plannen in de \nMarokkaanse waterstrategie om de watervraag te\
    \ verminderen en de beschikbaarheid te \nvergroten – door gewassen deels te verplaatsen\
    \ naar stroomgebieden waar ze minder \nwater verbruiken en door de WV van gewassen\
    \ te reduceren naar benchmarkniveaus. \nBeperking van het Risico van Extreme Waterschaarste\
    \ en Waterafhankelijkheid: Het \nVoorbeeld van Jordanië. Jordanië heeft te maken\
    \ met grote interne waterschaarste en \nwatervervuiling, conflicten over grensoverschrijdende\
    \ wateren, en een sterke \nafhankelijkheid van externe waterhulpbronnen door de\
    \ handel. In deze studie worden \ndeze kwesties onder de loep genomen om vervolgens\
    \ tot een evaluatie te komen van \nmaatregelen om het risico van extreme waterschaarste\
    \ en -afhankelijkheid te reduceren. \nDe bevindingen zijn dat: (i) blauwe waterschaarste\
    \ in Jordanië ernstig is, zelfs als de \nterugstroom van ongebruikt water wordt\
    \ meegenomen; (ii) de consumptie van \ngrondwater bijna twee keer zo groot is\
    \ als de beschikbaarheid ervan; (iii) \nwatervervuiling blauwe waterschaarste\
    \ versterkt en (iv) terwijl Jordanië al een grote \nafhankelijkheid kent van grensoverschrijdende\
    \ wateren (34%), het land nog veel sterker \nafhankelijk is van externe waterhulpbronnen\
    \ door handel (86%). De evaluatie van \nmaatregelen heeft 10 ingrediënten opgeleverd\
    \ voor een waterstrategie voor Jordanië die \nhet risico van extreme waterschaarste\
    \ en -afhankelijkheid vermindert. Met betrekking tot \ndeze ingrediënten dient\
    \ het huidige waterbeleid van Jordanië sterk bijgestuurd te \nworden richting\
    \ het managen van de watervraag. Daarbij zou meer aandacht \ngeschonken moeten\
    \ worden aan het reduceren van de watervraag door aanpassingen in \nhet consumptiepatroon\
    \ van de Jordaanse consumenten. Verder is het zaak om \nzorgvuldig na te denken\
    \ over een duurzame energievoorziening voor de geplande \nontziltingsprojecten.\
    \ Het op een duurzame manier beperken van de onontkoombaar \ngrote waterafhankelijkheid\
    \ betekent dat water-intensieve producten en handelswaren \nix \nvanuit een divers\
    \ aantal landen worden geïmporteerd, en wel landen die een significant \nlager\
    \ niveau van waterschaarste ervaren dan Jordanië zelf. \nEvaluatie en Classificatie\
    \ van Indicatoren voor Groene Waterbeschikbaarheid en \nWaterschaarste. Deze studie\
    \ omvat een evaluatie en classificatie van circa 80 indicatoren \nvoor groene\
    \ waterbeschikbaarheid en -schaarste, en geeft aan welke weg er te gaan is om\
    \ \noperationele groene waterschaarste-indicatoren te ontwikkelen die kunnen bijdragen\
    \ \naan een verbreding van waterschaarstestudies die nu vooral op blauw water\
    \ gericht zijn. \nEr is vastgesteld dat er veel meer indicatoren zijn voor de\
    \ beschikbaarheid van groen \nwater, dan voor groene waterschaarste. Een geschikte\
    \ groene waterschaarste-indicator \nmeet de mate waarin de daadwerkelijke groene\
    \ WV in een geografisch gebied de \nmaximaal duurzame groene WV in dat gebied\
    \ benadert. Een dergelijke indicator is op \ndit moment nog niet operationeel,\
    \ hoofdzakelijk vanwege de volgende twee \nuitdagingen.  Ten eerste, het kwantificeren\
    \ van de groene WV van houtproductie, \ngegeven dat er onderscheid gemaakt dient\
    \ te worden tussen de groene en de blauwe \ncomponent van de verdamping van een\
    \ bos (want bomen kunnen met hun wortels het \ngrondwater bereiken) en gegeven\
    \ dat slechts een deel van die verdamping \ntoegeschreven kan worden aan houtproductie\
    \ in semi-natuurlijke bossen die ook andere \ndoeleinden dienen. Ten tweede, een\
    \ ruimtelijk expliciete inschatting van groene \nwaterbeschikbaarheid, gezien\
    \ variabele landgeschiktheid en de noodzaak om het \nhuidige netwerk aan beschermde\
    \ gebieden uit te breiden. \nDe Watervoetafdruk van Hout voor Bouwhout, Pulp,\
    \ Papier, Brandstof en Brandhout. \nDeze studie richt zich op de eerste, zojuist\
    \ geïdentificeerde, uitdaging voor het meten \nvan groene waterschaarste. Bosverdamping\
    \ is geschat op een hoge ruimtelijke resolutie \nvoor de periode 1961-2010 en\
    \ gescheiden in groene en blauwe componenten. Vervolgens \nis de totale waterconsumptie\
    \ toegekend aan verschillende bosproducten, inclusief \necosysteemdiensten. De\
    \ bevinding is dat de wereldwijde waterconsumptie voor \nhoutproductie met 25%\
    \ is toegenomen in 50 jaar tijd naar gemiddeld 961×109 m3/y (96% \ngroen; 4% blauw)\
    \ gedurende 2001-2010. De WV per m3 hout is significant kleiner in \n(sub)tropische\
    \ bossen vergeleken met bossen in de gematigde en boreale zones, omdat \n(sub)tropische\
    \ bossen relatief meer waarde herbergen naast houtproductie in de vorm \nvan andere\
    \ ecosysteemdiensten. In termen van economische waterproductiviteit en de \nenergieopbrengst\
    \ van bio-ethanol per eenheid water, is hout tamelijk vergelijkbaar met \ngrote\
    \ voedsel-, voeder- en energiegewassen. Het hergebruiken van houtproducten is\
    \ een \neffectieve manier om de WV van de bosbouwsector te reduceren, waarbij\
    \ meer water \nbeschikbaar blijft voor het genereren van andere ecosysteemdiensten.\
    \ Intensivering van \nx \nhoutproductie kan alleen tot een kleinere WV per eenheid\
    \ hout leiden als de additioneel \nverkregen houtwaarde per ha opweegt tegen het\
    \ verlies aan waarde van andere \necosysteemdiensten; wat vaak niet het geval\
    \ is in (sub)tropische bossen. Het resultaat \nvan deze studie draagt bij aan\
    \ een completer beeld van de inzet van water ten gunste \nvan de mens en voedt\
    \ daarmee het debat over water voor voedsel en voeder versus \nenergie en hout.\
    \ \nGrenzen aan de Mondiale Groene Waterhulpbronnen voor Voedsel, Voeder, Vezels,\
    \ \nHout en Bio-energie. Deze studie omvat een kwantificatie van de toedeling\
    \ van de \ngroene waterhulpbronnen op aarde – de hoofdbron van water voor de productie\
    \ van \nvoedsel, voeder, vezels, hout en bio-energie – en een vergelijking van\
    \ de groene WV met \nregionaal maximaal duurzame niveaus van groene waterbeschikbaarheid.\
    \ Zodoende \nwordt de tweede eerder geïdentificeerde uitdaging voor het meten\
    \ van groene \nwaterschaarste aangepakt. Daadwerkelijke en maximaal duurzame groene\
    \ WV-en van \ngewasproductie, begrazing door vee, houtproductie en stedelijk gebied\
    \ zijn ingeschat op \nhet niveau van rastercellen van 5 x 5 boogminuten. Daarbij\
    \ wordt een geavanceerde \ntoekenningsprocedure gehanteerd die rekening houdt\
    \ met de ecosysteemdiensten die \nbossen en graslanden leveren. De studie laat\
    \ zien hoe de beperkte hoeveelheid groen \nwater op de wereld is toegekend aan\
    \ verschillende doeleinden en waar we maximaal \nduurzame niveaus benaderen of\
    \ overschrijden. Het blijkt dat groen water schaarser is \ndan blauw water in\
    \ 91 van 163 landen en dat de mensheid dichter bij de mondiale grens \nvan groen\
    \ water (56% in gebruik) dan voor blauw water (27-54% in gebruik) is. De \ngroene\
    \ WV van de mens is nabij of zelf voorbij het maximaal duurzame niveau in \nEuropa,\
    \ Centraal Amerika, het Midden Oosten en Zuid-Azië. Wereldwijd is 18% van de \n\
    groene WV in gebieden die voor de natuur gereserveerd zouden moeten zijn. Voor\
    \ een \nduurzame toekomst moet overschrijding van het maximaal duurzame niveau\
    \ vermeden \nworden en dient het groene water beneden dat niveau zo productief\
    \ mogelijk ingezet te \nworden. Dit vraagt om de bescherming van land, het beperken\
    \ van activiteiten in \ngebieden met een hoge biodiversiteitswaarde en efficiëntie\
    \ productiesystemen waarin \nhogere water- en landproductiviteit wordt nagestreefd\
    \ door het managen van het gehele \npalet aan ecosysteemdiensten volgens de principes\
    \ van duurzame intensivering. \nConclusie. Omgaan met waterschaarste vraagt om\
    \ een duurzame en efficiënte allocatie \nvan blauw en groen water. Dit onderzoek\
    \ laat zien dat nationaal beleid om duurzaam en \nefficiënt gebruik van blauw\
    \ water te bewerkstelligen verrijkt kan worden met behulp \nvan WVA. Ten eerste\
    \ voedt WVA de discussie over een efficiënte waterallocatie door \ninzicht te\
    \ geven in de WV van doeleinden en hun economische waarde. Ten tweede kan \nxi\
    \ \nWVA extra inzichten verschaffen in de druk op blauw water. Dit, door een analyse\
    \ van \nde blauwe WV ten opzichte van de maximaal duurzame blauwe WV per stroomgebied\
    \ \nper maand en door het kwantificeren van de rol van watervervuiling door middel\
    \ van \nde grijze WV. Ten derde komen uit WVA maatregelen naar voren ter reductie\
    \ van de \nwatervraag door aanpassingen in productie- en consumptiepatronen die\
    \ tot significante \nwaterbesparingen kunnen leiden in vergelijking met conventionele\
    \ water management \nmaatregelen. Ten vierde benadrukt WVA het risico van de afhankelijkheid\
    \ van water \nbuiten de landsgrenzen wanneer de virtuele waterimport in de context\
    \ wordt geplaatst \nvan de aanwezige waterschaarste in de exporterende landen.\
    \ Verder heeft dit onderzoek \nuitgewezen dat, tot de dag van vandaag, groene\
    \ waterschaarste niet de verdiende \naandacht heeft ontvangen. Door het kwantificeren\
    \ van de grenzen aan de \nbeschikbaarheid van groen water, de hoofdbron van water\
    \ voor het produceren van \nvoedsel, voeder, vezels, hout en bio-energie, benadrukt\
    \ dit onderzoek de kritieke rol van \ngroen water in het debat over zoetwaterschaarste.\
    \ \n \n1 \n1. \nIntroduction \n1.1. Increasing Water Consumption but Limited Water\
    \ Availability \nWater scarcity is becoming increasingly important. As the world\
    \ population grows, \nthere is an increasing need to produce food, feed, fibre,\
    \ timber, energy and other goods \nand services (Hejazi et al., 2014; WWAP, 2015).\
    \ The food and energy sectors are \nincreasingly water-intensive, due to more\
    \ consumption of animal products (Molden, \n2007) and policies towards an increased\
    \ share of bio-energy in the global energy mix \n(Mekonnen et al., 2016). Water\
    \ scarcity is aggravated by a changing climate with \nincreased variability and\
    \ more extremes (IPCC, 2013; WWAP, 2014). \nFresh water stems from precipitation.\
    \ Precipitation over land differentiates into blue and \ngreen water (Falkenmark,\
    \ 2000) (see Figure 1-1). The water that recharges groundwater \nand runs through\
    \ rivers to the ocean, is called blue water. The water that does not end \nup\
    \ in groundwater or surface water, but directly evaporates1 back to the atmosphere\
    \ \nfrom the land surface, is called green water. Precipitation is limited in\
    \ time and space, \nand so are the resulting blue and green water flows (Hoekstra,\
    \ 2013). Both flows are \nallocated to serve human activities, explicitly through\
    \ blue water withdrawals and \nimplicitly through the allocation of land with\
    \ its associated green water flow. We use \nthese flows to grow rain-fed (with\
    \ green water only) and irrigated (through a \ncombination of green and blue water)\
    \ crops, sustain production forests (green water) \nand grazing pastures (green\
    \ water), and apply it in households (blue water) and \nindustries (blue water).\
    \ These productive purposes have a water footprint, because \nwater allocated\
    \ to one purpose will no longer be available in the same area and time \nperiod\
    \ for another purpose (Hoekstra et al., 2011; Hoekstra, 2017). There are maximum\
    \ \nsustainable levels to the blue and green water footprints (Hoekstra & Wiedmann,\
    \ 2014) \n(Figure 1-1), since a minimum flow in rivers is required for aquatic\
    \ biodiversity (Richter \net al., 2012) and part of the land with its associated\
    \ green water flow should be left to \nsustain terrestrial biodiversity (Pouzols\
    \ et al., 2014) and other ecosystem services \n(Costanza et al., 2014; Costanza\
    \ et al., 2017). \n                                                          \
    \       \n1 Throughout this thesis the term evaporation is used (instead of the\
    \ often used term \nevapotranspiration) to refer to the entire vapour flux from\
    \ land to atmosphere which \nincludes soil evaporation, evaporation of intercepted\
    \ water, transpiration and in some \ncases (e.g. wetlands or rice fields) open-water\
    \ evaporation (Savenije, 2004). \n2 \n \nFigure 1-1. The partitioning of precipitation\
    \ over land into blue and green water flows. \nBoth flows further partition into\
    \ environmental and non-utilizable (or non-accessible) \nflows, flows allocated\
    \ to human activities (i.e. water footprint) and under-utilized flows \nbelow\
    \ the maximum sustainable level. \n1.2. Blue and Green Water Scarcity \nThe ratio\
    \ of the actual to the maximum sustainable water footprint (Figure 1-1) shows\
    \ \nthe extent to which limited water resources have been allocated to human activities\
    \ and \nis thus an indicator of the degree of water scarcity (Hoekstra et al.,\
    \ 2011). This water \nscarcity ratio can be expressed for both blue and green\
    \ water, separately.  \nBlue water scarcity has been assessed at numerous spatial\
    \ and temporal resolutions \n(Vanham et al., 2018). Most development has been\
    \ in the temporal resolution. In the \npast, blue water scarcity assessments have\
    \ been mostly done per year (Vörösmarty et al., \n2000; Oki et al., 2001; Alcamo\
    \ et al., 2003). Recent assessments per month (Wada et al., \n2011; Hoekstra et\
    \ al., 2012; Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2016) have revealed that these annual \nassessments\
    \ resulted in an underestimation of blue water scarcity due to the failure to\
    \ \ncapture the intra-annual mismatch between water demand and availability. \n\
    People have been managing blue water scarcity for ages. Traditionally, management\
    \ is \nfocused on supplying water to the users, which resulted in the constructions\
    \ of dams, \ninter-basin water transfers and irrigation networks. Since the nineties,\
    \ there is more \nattention for water demand management (Savenije et al., 2014).\
    \ In practice, this usually \n3 \nhappens through campaigns – often combined with\
    \ water pricing – that encourage \nhouseholds to use less water and train farmers\
    \ in applying less irrigation. Two main \naspects are, however, rarely considered\
    \ in the development of national water policies to \nsustainably manage blue water\
    \ scarcity. First, the end-purposes themselves to which \nwater is allocated are\
    \ rarely questioned (allocation efficiency). Second, the global \ndimension of\
    \ water is generally not taken into account (Hoekstra, 2011). There is \ninternational\
    \ trade in goods which have a water footprint (i.e. virtual water trade). This\
    \ \nmeans that, on the one hand, countries allocate water to produce goods for\
    \ export and, \non the other hand, countries are dependent on water resources\
    \ in other countries from \nwhich they import. Therefore, national water policies\
    \ might be enriched by a Water \nFootprint Assessment (Hoekstra et al., 2011)\
    \ that includes these two aspects. \nIn the 1990s, Falkenmark (1995; 2000) pointed\
    \ to the importance of green water, which is \nthe main source of water for the\
    \ production of biomass. The recognition of green next to \nblue water consumption\
    \ increasingly gained acceptance in the past decades (Postel et al., \n1996; Savenije,\
    \ 2000; Rockström, 2001; Falkenmark & Rockström, 2006; Rijsberman, 2006; \nRost\
    \ et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Falkenmark & Rockström, 2010; Hanasaki et al.,\
    \ 2010; \nSiebert & Döll, 2010; Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012). However, limits to\
    \ green water \nconsumption have not been quantified. The notion that there is\
    \ a maximum sustainable \ngreen water footprint and that green water is thus a\
    \ scarce resource is so far only \ntheoretical (Hoekstra et al., 2011). A few\
    \ attempts have been made to incorporate green \nwater in the discourse on freshwater\
    \ scarcity, using different definitions of green water \nscarcity from the one\
    \ used in this research (see top of this section). Combined green-blue \nwater\
    \ scarcity assessments (Rockström et al., 2009; Gerten et al., 2011; Kummu et\
    \ al., \n2014) reflect green and blue water resource availability with respect\
    \ to hypothetical \ngreen and blue water needs to sustain a standard diet. Falkenmark\
    \ et al. (2007) and \nFalkenmark (2013a) define green water scarcity as an issue\
    \ of limited green water \naccessibility in the root zone and the occurrence of\
    \ unproductive evaporation losses \nfrom the field, which results in lower yields\
    \ than potentially achievable by proper crop \nand soil management. \nWhile green\
    \ water is just entering the scientific debate on freshwater scarcity, limits\
    \ to \ngreen water availability are not at all on the radar of policy makers.\
    \ Low-carbon energy \nscenarios heavily rely on biomass and green water (Mekonnen\
    \ et al., 2016), while the \nInternational Energy Agency in their World Energy\
    \ Outlook still ignores green water \n(OECD/IEA, 2016). Therefore, an assessment\
    \ of the degree to which green water \nconsumption approaches maximum sustainable\
    \ levels is highly due. \n4 \n1.3. Goal and Approach of this Research \nThe goal\
    \ of this thesis is to broaden the discourse on freshwater scarcity in two respects.\
    \ \nFirst, by assessing how Water Footprint Assessment for a country can contribute\
    \ to more \nsustainable and efficient allocation of blue water resources. Second,\
    \ by assessing the \nallocation of the world’s green water resources with respect\
    \ to maximum sustainable \nlevels. This is captured in two main research questions:\
    \ \n1. \nHow can national policies for sustainable and efficient use of blue water\
    \ resources be \nenriched by Water Footprint Assessment? \n2. \nHow are the world’s\
    \ limited green water resources allocated to different purposes and \nwhere do\
    \ we approach or overshoot maximum sustainable levels? \nQuestion 1 is approached\
    \ by means of two case studies for countries that face internal \nwater scarcity\
    \ and external water dependency: Morocco (Chapter 2) and Jordan (Chapter \n3).\
    \ For these countries, I have carried out a Water Footprint Assessment and assessed\
    \ the \nadded value with respect to existing national water policies and river\
    \ basin plans. For \nMorocco, the focus is on internal blue water scarcity and\
    \ allocation efficiency. For \nJordan, more attention is paid to sustainable mitigation\
    \ of the external water \ndependency through trade. \nQuestion 2 is simple in\
    \ nature, but requires several preceding questions to be answered. \nFirst, conceptual\
    \ clarity is needed on the concept of green water scarcity. I have \nreviewed\
    \ and classified indicators of green water availability and scarcity, thereby\
    \ \nexposing the lack of green water scarcity indicators in Chapter 4. Second,\
    \ to assess global \ngreen water scarcity we need to know the green water footprint\
    \ (WFg) of humanity. We \nwant to know WFg of humanity at the grid level to quantify\
    \ actual versus maximum \nsustainable WFg’s using a bottom-up approach, which\
    \ is more accurate than lumping \nthese variables to higher spatial aggregation\
    \ levels before comparing them (see also \nGerten et al. (2013)). However, in\
    \ contrast to WFg of crops – which has been estimated at \nhigh spatial resolution\
    \ by many (Liu et al., 2009; Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2011a; Siebert & \nDöll, 2010;\
    \ Rost et al., 2008; Hanasaki et al., 2010) – WFg of wood production has not been\
    \ \nquantified before, and WFg of livestock grazing is not available at the grid\
    \ level \n(Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2012b; De Fraiture et al., 2007). A complication\
    \ is that forests \nand pastures provide several other ecosystem services besides\
    \ wood and food \nproduction, respectively. How to properly account for this when\
    \ estimating WFg of \nwood production and livestock grazing? In Chapter 5, I address\
    \ this question while \nestimating the WFg of wood production world-wide. In Chapter\
    \ 6, I complete the picture \n5 \nof human’s WFg by estimating the grid-specific\
    \ WFg of livestock grazing and urban areas \n(that occupy land with its associated\
    \ green water flow) and show how the world’s \nlimited green water resources are\
    \ allocated to different purposes and where we \napproach or overshoot maximum\
    \ sustainable levels. \n1.4. Structure of the Research \nThe structure of this\
    \ thesis is conceptually visualized in Figure 1-2. Overarching \nconclusions of\
    \ this thesis and a future outlook are provided in Chapter 7. \n \nFigure 1-2.\

    \ Added Value of Water Footprint Assessment for \nNational Water Policy: A Case\
    \ Study for Morocco2 \nAbstract \nA Water Footprint Assessment is carried out\
    \ for Morocco, mapping the water footprint \nof different activities at river\
    \ basin and monthly scale, distinguishing between surface- \nand groundwater.\
    \ The paper aims to demonstrate the added value of detailed analysis of \nthe\
    \ human water footprint within a country and thorough assessment of the virtual\
    \ \nwater flows leaving and entering a country for formulating national water\
    \ policy. Green, \nblue and grey water footprint estimates and virtual water flows\
    \ are mainly derived from \na previous grid-based (5 × 5 arc minute) global study\
    \ for the period 1996-2005. These \nestimates are placed in the context of monthly\
    \ natural runoff and waste assimilation \ncapacity per river basin derived from\
    \ Moroccan data sources. The study finds that: (i) \nevaporation from storage\
    \ reservoirs is the second largest form of blue water \nconsumption in Morocco,\
    \ after irrigated crop production; (ii) Morocco’s water and land \nresources are\
    \ mainly used to produce relatively low-value (in US$/m3 and US$/ha) crops \n\
    such as cereals, olives and almonds; (iii) most of the virtual water export from\
    \ Morocco \nrelates to the export of products with a relatively low economic water\
    \ productivity (in \nUS$/m3); (iv) blue water scarcity on a monthly scale is severe\
    \ in all river basins and \npressure on groundwater resources by abstractions\
    \ and nitrate pollution is considerable \nin most basins and; (v) the estimated\
    \ potential water savings by partial relocation of \ncrops to basins where they\
    \ consume less water and by reducing water footprints of crops \ndown to benchmark\
    \ levels are significant compared to demand reducing and supply \nincreasing measures\
    \ considered in Morocco’s national water strategy. \n2.1. Introduction \nMorocco\
    \ is a semi-arid country in the Mediterranean facing water scarcity and \ndeteriorating\
    \ water quality. The limited water resources constrain the activities in \ndifferent\
    \ sectors of the economy of the country. Agriculture is the largest water \nconsumer\
    \ and withdrawals for irrigation peak in the dry period of the year, which \n\
    contributes to low surface runoff and desiccation of streams. Currently, 130 reservoirs\
    \ \nare in operation to deal with this mismatch in water demand and natural water\
    \ supply \nand to serve for generation of hydroelectricity and flood control (Ministry\
    \ EMWE, 2011). \n                                                            \
    \     \n2 This chapter has been published as: \nSchyns, J.F. & Hoekstra, A.Y.\
    \ (2014) The added value of water footprint assessment for \nnational water policy:\
    \ a case study for Morocco, PLoS ONE, 9(6): e99705. \n8 \nGroundwater resources\
    \ also play an important role in the socio-economic development \nof the country,\
    \ in particular by ensuring the water supply for rural communities \n(Ministry\
    \ EMWE, 2012). However, a large part of the aquifers is being overexploited and\
    \ \nsuffer from deteriorating water quality by intrusion of salt water, caused\
    \ by the \noverexploitation, and nitrates and pesticides that leach from croplands,\
    \ caused by \nexcessive use of fertilizers. Surface water downstream of some urban\
    \ centres is also \npolluted, due to untreated wastewater discharges. \nIn 1995,\
    \ the Moroccan Water Law (no. 10-95) came into force and introduced \ndecentralized\
    \ integrated water management and rationalisation of water use, including \nthe\
    \ user-pays and polluter-pays principles. It also dictates the development of\
    \ national \nand river basin master plans (Official State Gazette, 1995), which\
    \ are elaborated in \naccordance with the national water strategy. To cope with\
    \ water scarcity and pollution, \nthe national water strategy includes action\
    \ plans to reduce demand, increase supply and \npreserve and protect water resources\
    \ (Ministry EMWE, 2011). It also proposes legal and \ninstitutional reforms for\
    \ proper implementation and enforcement of these actions. \nDemand management\
    \ focuses on improving the efficiency of irrigation and urban \nsupply networks\
    \ and pricing of water to rationalise its use. Plans to increase supply \ninclude\
    \ the construction of more dams and a large North-South inter-basin water \ntransfer,\
    \ protection of existing hydraulic infrastructure, desalinization of sea water\
    \ and \nreuse of treated wastewater. \nAlthough the national water strategy considers\
    \ options to reduce water demand in \naddition to options to increase supply,\
    \ it does not include the global dimension of water \nby considering international\
    \ virtual water trade, nor does it consider whether water \nresources are efficiently\
    \ allocated based on physical and economic water productivities \nof crops (the\
    \ main water consumers). Analysis of the water footprint (WF) of activities in\
    \ \nMorocco and the virtual water trade balance of the country therefore might\
    \ reveal new \ninsights to alleviate water scarcity. \nThe concept of WF was introduced\
    \ by Hoekstra (2003); this subsequently led to the \ndevelopment of Water Footprint\
    \ Assessment as a distinct field of research and \napplication (Hoekstra & Chapagain,\
    \ 2008; Hoekstra et al., 2011). The WF is an indicator \nof freshwater use that\
    \ looks not only at direct water use of a consumer or producer, but \nalso at\
    \ the indirect water use. As such, it provides a link between human consumption\
    \ \nand human appropriation of freshwater systems. Water Footprint Assessment\
    \ refers to a \nvariety of methods to quantify and map the WF of specific processes,\
    \ products, \nproducers or consumers, to assess the environmental, social and\
    \ economic sustainability \n9 \nof WFs at catchment or river basin level and to\
    \ formulate and assess the effectiveness of \nstrategies to reduce WFs in prioritized\
    \ locations. The WF of a product is the volume of \nfreshwater used to produce\
    \ the product, measured over the full supply chain (Hoekstra \net al., 2011).\
    \ Three different components of a WF are distinguished: green, blue and grey.\
    \ \nThe green WF is the volume of rainwater evaporated or incorporated into the\
    \ product. \nBlue water refers to the volume of surface- or groundwater evaporated,\
    \ incorporated \ninto the product or returned to another catchment or the sea.\
    \ The grey WF relates to \npollution and is defined as the volume of freshwater\
    \ that is required to assimilate the \nload of pollutants given natural background\
    \ concentrations and existing ambient water \nquality standards (Hoekstra et al.,\
    \ 2011). The total freshwater volume consumed or \npolluted within the territory\
    \ of a nation as a result of activities within the different \nsectors of the\
    \ economy is called the WF of national production. International trade of \nproducts\
    \ creates ‘virtual water flows’ leaving and entering a country. The virtual-water\
    \ \nexport from a nation refers to the WF of the products exported. The virtual-water\
    \ import \ninto a nation refers to the WF of the imported products. \nSeveral\
    \ authors have assessed the WF and virtual water trade balance of nations and\
    \ \nregions and state the relevance of the tool for well-informed water policy\
    \ on the national \nand river basin level (Aldaya et al., 2010a; Aldaya et al.,\
    \ 2010b; Chahed et al., 2011; \nHoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012). In a case study for\
    \ a Spanish region, Aldaya et al. (2010b) \nconclude that WF analyses can provide\
    \ a transparent framework to identify potentially \noptimal alternatives for efficient\
    \ water use at the catchment level and that this can be \nvery useful to achieve\
    \ an efficient allocation of water and economic resources in the \nregion. Chahed\
    \ et al. (2011) state that integration of all water resources at the national\
    \ \nscale, including the green water used in rain-fed agriculture and as part\
    \ of the foodstuffs \ntrade balance, is essential in facing the great challenges\
    \ of food security in arid countries. \nThe objective of this study is to explore\
    \ the added value of analysing the WF of activities \nin Morocco and the virtual\
    \ water flows from and to Morocco in formulating national \nwater policy. The\
    \ study includes an assessment of the WF of activities in Morocco (at the \nriver\
    \ basin level on a monthly scale) and the virtual water trade balance of the country\
    \ \nand, based on this, response options are formulated to reduce the WF within\
    \ Morocco, \nalleviate water scarcity and allocate water resources more efficiently.\
    \ Results and \nconclusions from the Water Footprint Assessment are compared with\
    \ the scope of \nanalysis of, and action plans included in Morocco’s national\
    \ water strategy and river \nbasin plans in order to address the added value of\
    \ Water Footprint Assessment relative \nto these existing plans. \n10 \nThe WF\
    \ of Morocco has not been assessed previously on the river basin level on a \n\
    monthly scale. Morocco has been included in a number of global studies, but these\
    \ \nstudies did not analyse the spatial and temporal variability of the WF within\
    \ the country \n(Hoekstra & Chapagain, 2007b; Hoekstra & Chapagain, 2007a; Mekonnen\
    \ & Hoekstra, \n2011b). Furthermore, this study is the first to include specific\
    \ estimates of the \nevaporative losses from the irrigation supply network and\
    \ from storage reservoirs as \npart of a comprehensive Water Footprint Assessment.\
    \ Finally, it is new in providing \nquantitative estimates of the potential water\
    \ savings by partial relocation of crop \nproduction to regions with lower water\
    \ consumption per tonne of crop by means of an \noptimization and by reducing\
    \ WFs of crops down to benchmark levels. \nSeveral insights and response options\
    \ emerged from the Water Footprint Assessment, \nwhich are currently not considered\
    \ in the national water strategy of Morocco and the \ncountry’s river basin plans.\
    \ Therefore, Water Footprint Assessment is considered to have \nan added value\
    \ for formulating national water policy in Morocco. \n2.2. Method and Data \n\
    2.2.1. Water Footprint of Morocco’s Production \nThis study follows the terminology\
    \ and methodology developed by Hoekstra et al. \n(2011). The WF of Morocco’s production\
    \ is estimated at river basin level on a monthly \nscale for the activities included\
    \ in Table 2-1. The river basins are chosen such that they \ncoincide with the\
    \ action zones of Morocco’s river basin agencies (Figure 2-1A). Due to \ndata\
    \ limitations, the grey WF is analysed on an annual scale and the WFs of grazing\
    \ and \nanimal water supply are analysed at national and annual level. The study\
    \ considers the \naverage climate, production and trade conditions over the period\
    \ 1996-2005. The WFs of \nagriculture, industry and households are obtained from\
    \ Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010b, \n2011b), who estimated these parameters globally\
    \ at a 5 x 5 arc minute spatial resolution. \nThe annual blue WF estimates for\
    \ industries and households by Mekonnen & Hoekstra \n(2011b) are distributed throughout\
    \ the year according to the monthly distribution of \npublic water supply obtained\
    \ from Ministry EMWE (unpublished data 2013). These \ndistributions are available\
    \ for the basins Loukkos, Sebou, Bouregreg and Oum Er Rbia. \nFor the other basins\
    \ an average of these distributions is taken. \n \n11 \nTable 2-1. Water footprint\

    \ (B), blue (C) and grey (D) water footprint of \nMorocco’s production per river\
    \ basin (in 106 m³/y). \n12 \nThe monthly WF of storage reservoirs (in m3/y) is\
    \ calculated as the open water \nevaporation (in m/y) times the surface area of\
    \ storage reservoirs (in m2). Data on open \nwater evaporation from the reservoirs\
    \ in the basins Loukkos, Sebou, Bouregreg and \nOum Er Rbia is obtained from Ministry\
    \ EMWE (unpublished data 2013) and for the \nother basins from a model simulation\
    \ with the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB \ncarried out by Sperna Weiland\
    \ et al. (2010). The surface area of reservoirs at upper \nstorage level is derived\
    \ from Ministry EMWE (unpublished data 2013) and FAO (2013c). \nSince storage\
    \ levels vary throughout the year (and over the years), and reservoir areas \n\
    accordingly, this gives an overestimation of the evaporation from reservoirs.\
    \ To \ncounteract this overestimation, but due to lack of data on monthly storage\
    \ level and \nreservoir area, for all months a fraction of the evaporation at\
    \ upper storage level (43%) is \ntaken as estimate of the WF of storage reservoirs.\
    \ This fraction represents the average \nreservoir area as fraction of its area\
    \ at upper storage level, calculated as the average over \nthe reservoirs in the\
    \ basins Loukkos, Sebou, Bouregreg and Oum Er Rbia for which data \non surface\
    \ area at different reservoir levels is available from Ministry EMWE \n(unpublished\
    \ data 2013). \nThe WF of the irrigation supply network refers to the evaporative\
    \ loss in the network \nand is estimated based on a factor K, which is defined\
    \ as the ratio of the blue WF of the \nirrigation supply network to the blue surface\
    \ WF of crop production at field level (i.e. \nevaporation of irrigation water\
    \ stemming from surface water). The blue WF of crop \nproduction at field level\
    \ is taken from Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2010b) and the split to \nsurface water is\
    \ made according to the fraction of irrigation water withdrawn from \nsurface\
    \ water (as opposed to groundwater) per river basin based on data from the \n\
    associated river basin plans. K is calculated as (see Appendix A.1): \nE\na\n\
    c\na\n1\n1\nf\ne\ne\ne\nK\n×\n»¼\nº\n«¬\nª\n−\n×\n=\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Eq. 2-1)\
    \ \nin which ea represents the field application efficiency, ec the irrigation\
    \ canal efficiency \nand fE the fraction of losses in the irrigation canal network\
    \ that evaporates (as opposed to \npercolates). The irrigation efficiencies ea\
    \ and ec are estimated based on data from a local \nriver basin agency and FAO\
    \ (2013a). The value of fE is assumed at fifty percent. The \nresultant K for\
    \ Morocco’s irrigated agriculture as a whole is 15%, i.e. the evaporative loss\
    \ \nfrom the irrigation water supply network represents a volume equal to 15%\
    \ of the blue \nsurface WF of crop production at field level on average. \n13\
    \ \n2.2.2. Water Footprint and Economic Water and Land Productivity of Crops \n\
    The WF of crops per unit of production (in m3/t) is calculated by dividing the\
    \ WF per \nhectare (in m3/ha/y) by the yield (in t/ha/y), for which data are obtained\
    \ from Mekonnen \n& Hoekstra (2010b). Economic water productivity (in US$/m3)\
    \ represents the economic \nvalue of farm output per unit of water consumed and\
    \ is calculated as the average \nproducer price for the period 1996–2005 (in US$/t)\
    \ obtained from FAO (2013b) divided \nby the green plus blue WF (in m3/t). Similarly,\
    \ economic land productivity (in US$/ha) \nrepresents the economic value of farm\
    \ output per hectare of harvested land and is \ncalculated as the same producer\
    \ price multiplied by crop yield (in t/ha/y), which is also \nobtained from Mekonnen\
    \ & Hoekstra (2010b). \n2.2.3. Virtual Water Flows and Associated Economic Value\
    \ \nGreen, blue and grey virtual water flows related to Morocco’s import and export\
    \ of \nagricultural and industrial commodities for the period 1996-2005 are obtained\
    \ from \nMekonnen & Hoekstra (2011b), who estimated these flows at a global scale\
    \ based on \ntrade matrices and WFs of traded products at the locations of origin.\
    \ The virtual water \nexport that originates from domestic water resources (another\
    \ part is re-export) is \nestimated based on the relative share of the WF within\
    \ the nation to the total water \nbudget: \ne\nnational\ni\nnational\ne,dom.res.\n\
    V\nWF\nV\nWF\nV\n×\n+\n=\n  \n \n \n \n \n(Eq. 2-2) \nin which WFnational is the\
    \ WF within the nation (in m3/y), Vi the virtual water import (in \nm3/y) and\
    \ Ve the virtual water export (in m3/y). \nThe average earning per unit of water\
    \ exported (in US$/m3) is calculated by dividing the \nvalue of export (in US$/y)\
    \ by virtual water export (in m3/y). Similarly, the cost per unit of \nvirtual\
    \ water import is calculated by dividing the import value (in US$/y) by virtual\
    \ \nwater import (in m3/y). The average economic value of import and export for\
    \ the period \n1996-2005 are derived from the Statistics for International Trade\
    \ Analysis (SITA) \ndatabase from the International Trade Centre (ITC, 2007).\
    \ \n2.2.4. Water Footprint versus Water Availability and Waste Assimilation Capacity\
    \ \nTo assess the environmental sustainability of the WF within Morocco, the total\
    \ blue \n(surface- plus groundwater) WF of production is placed in the context\
    \ of monthly \nnatural runoff and the ground-WF in the context of annual groundwater\
    \ availability. \n14 \nThe water needed to assimilate the nitrogen fertilizers\
    \ that reach the water systems due \nto leaching is compared with the waste assimilation\
    \ capacity of aquifers. \nThe ground-WF is calculated by splitting the blue WF\
    \ of crop production, industrial \nproduction and domestic water supply according\
    \ to the fraction withdrawn from \ngroundwater per river basin based on data from\
    \ the associated river basin plans. \nAssuming that none of the water abstracted\
    \ from groundwater for industrial production \nand domestic water supply returns\
    \ (clean) to the groundwater in the same period of \ntime, the ground-WFs of these\
    \ purposes are increased to equal water withdrawal (as \nopposed to consumption)\
    \ by dividing them by the consumptive fractions assumed by \nMekonnen & Hoekstra\
    \ (2011b): 5% for industries and 10% for households. \nLong-term average monthly\
    \ natural runoff (1980-2011) for the river basins of Loukkos, \nSebou, Bouregreg\
    \ and Oum Er Rbia is derived from Ministry EMWE (unpublished data \n2013). Natural\
    \ runoff is estimated as the inflow of reservoirs. It is considered undepleted\
    \ \nrunoff, since large-scale blue water withdrawals come from the reservoirs.\
    \ For the other \nbasins, long-term average annual natural runoff is derived from\
    \ the river basin plans for \nthe respective river basins and subsequently distributed\
    \ over the months according to \nintra-annual rainfall patterns (Riad, 2003; Tekken\
    \ & Kropp, 2012) or monthly natural \ndischarge (JICA/MATEE/ABHT, 2007). Due to\
    \ lack of data, for the Souss Massa basin the \nsame monthly variation is applied\
    \ as for the adjacent Tensift basin. Groundwater \navailability is assessed on\
    \ river basin scale and defined as the recharge by percolation of \nrainwater\
    \ and from rivers, minus the direct evaporation from aquifers. These data are\
    \ \nobtained from the river basin plans and from Laouina (2001) for the basin\
    \ of Souss \nMassa. \nBlue water scarcity is defined as the ratio of the total\
    \ blue WF in a catchment over the \nblue water availability in that catchment\
    \ (Hoekstra et al., 2011). In this study, this ratio is \ncalculated as the total\
    \ blue WF to monthly natural runoff and as the ground-WF to \nannual groundwater\
    \ availability. Following Hoekstra et al. (2012), blue water scarcity \nvalues\
    \ have been classified into four levels of water scarcity. The classification\
    \ in this \nstudy corresponds with their classification, with the note that the\
    \ current study does not \naccount for environmental flow requirements in the\
    \ definition of blue water availability, \nsince they are generally not considered\
    \ in Morocco’s river basin plans and local studies \non the level of these requirements\
    \ are lacking. This is compensated for by using stricter \nthreshold values for\
    \ the different scarcity levels, so that the resultant scheme is \nequivalent\
    \ to that of Hoekstra et al. (2012): \n15 \n\x83 \nlow blue water scarcity (<0.20):\
    \ the blue WF is lower than 20% of natural runoff; \nriver runoff is unmodified\
    \ or slightly modified. \n\x83 \nmoderate blue water scarcity (0.20-0.30): the\
    \ blue WF is between 20 and 30% of \nnatural runoff; runoff is moderately modified.\
    \ \n\x83 \nsignificant blue water scarcity (0.30-0.40): the blue WF is between\
    \ 30 and 40% of \nnatural runoff; runoff is significantly modified. \n\x83 \n\
    severe water scarcity (>0.40): the monthly blue WF exceeds 40% of natural \nrunoff,\
    \ so runoff is seriously modified. \nThe water pollution level is defined as the\
    \ total grey WF in a catchment divided by the \nwaste assimilation capacity (Hoekstra\
    \ et al., 2011). In other words, it shows the fraction \nof actual runoff that\
    \ is required to dilute pollutants in order to meet ambient water \nquality standards.\
    \ A water pollution level greater than 1 means that ambient water \nquality standards\
    \ are violated. The nitrate-related grey WF of crop production is \nassumed to\
    \ mostly contribute to groundwater pollution and is therefore compared with \n\
    the waste assimilation capacity of groundwater. As a measure of the latter, we\
    \ use the \nactual groundwater availability, calculated as (natural) groundwater\
    \ availability minus \nthe ground-WF. \n2.2.5. Relocation of Crop Production and\
    \ Reducing Water Footprints of Crops to \nBenchmark Levels \nThe potential water\
    \ savings by changing the pattern of crop production across river \nbasins (which\
    \ is possible due to spatial differences in crop water use) are quantified by\
    \ \nmeans of an optimization model. The total green plus blue WF of twelve main\
    \ crops in \nthe country (in m3/y) is minimized by changing the spatial pattern\
    \ of production (in t/y) \nover the river basins under constraints for production\
    \ demand (in t/y) and land \navailability (in ha/y). The analysed crops are: almonds,\
    \ barley, dates, grapes, maize, \nolives, oranges, sugar beets, sugar cane, mandarins,\
    \ tomatoes and wheat. Results are \ncompared with a base case, which corresponds\
    \ with the average green plus blue WF of \nthe analysed crops over the period\
    \ 1996-2005. Land availability is restricted per river \nbasin and taken equal\
    \ to the average harvested area in the period 1996-2005 obtained \nfrom Mekonnen\
    \ & Hoekstra (2010b). Two cases are distinguished: A) all crops can be \nrelocated;\
    \ B) only annual crops (barley, maize, sugar beets, tomatoes and wheat) can be\
    \ \nrelocated, perennials cannot. For both cases, the restriction is imposed that\
    \ the total \nnational production per crop (in t/y) should be equal to (or greater\
    \ than) the total \nnational production of the crop in the base case, which is\
    \ defined as the average \nproduction in the period 1996-2005 obtained from Mekonnen\
    \ & Hoekstra (2010b). \n16 \nTable 2-2. Comparison of river basins based on reference\

    \ is made of the potential water savings by reducing the WFs \nof the twelve main\
    \ crops down to certain benchmark levels. For each basin and crop a \nbenchmark\
    \ is set in the form of the lowest water consumption (green plus blue) of that\
    \ \ncrop which is achieved in a comparable river basin in Morocco. In this case,\
    \ basins are \nconsidered comparable when the reference evaporation (E0 in mm/y)\
    \ is in the same order \nof magnitude (see Table 2-2). E0 expresses the evaporating\
    \ power of the atmosphere at a \nspecific location (and time of the year) and\
    \ does not consider crop characteristics and soil \nfactors (Hoekstra et al.,\
    \ 2011). Differences in soil and development conditions are thus \nnot accounted\
    \ for. \n2.3. Results \n2.3.1. Water Footprint of Morocco’s Production \nThe total\
    \ WF of Morocco’s production in the period 1996-2005 was 38.8x106 m3/y (77% \n\
    green, 18% blue, 5% grey), see Table 2-3. Crop production is the largest contributor\
    \ to \nthis WF, accounting for 78% of all green water consumed, 83% of all blue\
    \ water \nconsumed (evaporative losses in irrigation water supply network included)\
    \ and 66% of \nthe total volume of polluted water. Evaporative losses from storage\
    \ reservoirs are \nestimated at 884x106 m3/y, which is 13% of the total blue WF\
    \ within Morocco. For most \nreservoirs, these losses are ultimately linked to\
    \ irrigated agriculture and in some cases \npotable water supply. \n17 \nTable\

    \ the basins Oum Er Rbia and Sebou, the \nbasins containing the main agricultural\
    \ areas of Morocco (see Figure 2-1B–D). Together, \nthese two basins account for\
    \ 63% of the total WF of national production. In general, the \ngreen WF is largest\
    \ in the rainy period December-May, while the blue WF is largest in \nthe period\
    \ April-September when irrigation water use increases. \nIn the basins Bouregreg\
    \ and Loukkos, evaporation from storage reservoirs accounts for \n45% and 55%\
    \ of the total blue WF, respectively. Irrigated agriculture is the largest blue\
    \ \nwater consumer in the other basins, but evaporation from storage reservoirs\
    \ is also \nsignificant in these basins. Main irrigated crops in the Oum Er Rbia\
    \ basin are maize, \nwheat, olives and sugar beets, which together account for\
    \ 60% of the total irrigation \nwater consumed in the period 1996-2005. In the\
    \ basin of Sebou, 56% of the blue WF of \ncrop production relates to the irrigation\
    \ of wheat, olives, sugar beets, sugar cane and \nsunflower seed. \n2.3.2. Water\
    \ Footprint and Economic Water and Land Productivity of Main Crops \nIn the period\
    \ 1996-2005, most green water was consumed by the production of wheat, \nbarley\
    \ and olives (Figure 2-2). The largest blue WFs relate to the production of wheat,\
    \ \nolives and maize. For wheat, the number one blue water consuming crop, the\
    \ blue WF \nwas largest in the period March-May and peaked in April. \n18 \n \n\

    \ main \ncrops in Morocco. Period: 1996-2005. Source: Water footprint from Mekonnen\
    \ & \nHoekstra (2010b), producer prices from FAO (2013b). \nWater consumption\
    \ of crops (green plus blue, in m3/t) varies significantly per river basin \n\
    due to differences in climatic conditions. In general, water consumption of crops\
    \ is above \ncountry-average in the basins Oum Er Rbia and Tensift and below country-average\
    \ in \nthe northern basins Bouregreg, Sebou, Loukkos and Moulouya (Figure 2-3).\
    \ In the basins \nSud Atlas and Souss Massa the picture is not so clear, with\
    \ some crops having above and \nothers below country-average WFs (in m3/t). \n\
    The five crops that consumed the most green plus blue water in the period 1996-2005\
    \ are \nthe crops with the lowest economic water productivity, ranging from 0.08\
    \ US$/m3 for \nwheat to only 0.02 US$/m3 for almonds (Figure 2-2). Production\
    \ of tomatoes yielded 22 \ntimes more value per drop than production of wheat.\
    \ The same five crops also have the \nlowest economic land productivity, ranging\
    \ from 375 US$/ha for olives to 112 US$/ha for \nalmonds (Figure 2-4). The highest\
    \ value per hectare cultivated was obtained by \nproduction of tomatoes. \n19\

    \ virtual water trade balance for the period 1996-2005 is shown in Figure 2-5.\
    \ \nVirtual water import exceeds virtual water export, which makes Morocco a net\
    \ virtual \nwater importer. Only 31% of the virtual water export originates from\
    \ Morocco’s water \nresources, the other 69% is related to re-export of imported\
    \ virtual water. By import of \nproducts instead of producing them domestically,\
    \ Morocco saved 27.8 km3/y (75% green, \n21% blue and 4% grey) of domestic water\
    \ in the period 1996-2005, equivalent to 72% of \nthe WF within Morocco. \nThe\
    \ value of the total virtual water imported in the period 1996-2005 was 12.4 billion\
    \ \nUS$/y. Import of industrial products accounted for 83%, import of crop products\
    \ for 16% \nand import of animal products for 1%. The average cost of imported\
    \ commodities per \nunit of virtual water imported was 0.98 US$/m3. The value\
    \ of the total virtual water \nexported in this period was 7.1 billion US$/y (industrial\
    \ products: 51%, crop products: \n48%, animal products: 1%). The average earning\
    \ of exported commodities per unit of \nvirtual water exported was 1.66 US$/m3.\
    \ \n \nFigure 2-5. Morocco's virtual water trade balance related to trade in agricultural\
    \ and \nindustrial commodities. Period: 1996-2005. Source: Virtual water import\
    \ and (total) \nvirtual water export from Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2011b). \n \n \n\
    21 \nThe total volume of Morocco’s water virtually exported out of the country\
    \ (i.e. excluding \nre-export) in the period 1996-2005 is estimated at 1,333x106\
    \ m3/y. This means that about \n4% of the water used in Morocco’s agricultural\
    \ and industrial sector is used for making \nexport products. The remainder is\
    \ used to produce products that are consumed by the \ninhabitants of Morocco.\
    \ Virtual export of blue water from Morocco’s resources was \n435x106 m3/y, which\
    \ is to equivalent 3.4% of long-term average natural runoff (13 km3/y). \nMost\
    \ of the virtual water export from Morocco’s resources returns relatively little\
    \ foreign \ncurrency per unit of virtual water exported. Export of crop products\
    \ had the largest \nshare in the virtual water export from Morocco’s water resources\
    \ (1,305x106 m3/y), \nreturning 0.87 US$/m3 on average. Specific crop products\
    \ associated with large virtual \nwater export from Moroccan origin are olives,\
    \ oranges, wheat, sugar beets and \nmandarins. Out of these products, only export\
    \ of mandarins (122x106 m3/y) returned a \nvalue (1.37 US$/m3) larger than the\
    \ average for crop products (0.87 US$/m3). On the \nother hand, virtual water\
    \ export related to Moroccan tomatoes (24x106 m3/y) yielded 7.13 \nUS$/m3. \n\
    2.3.4. Water Footprint versus Water Availability and Waste Assimilation Capacity\
    \ \nBlue water scarcity manifests itself in specific months of the year (Figure\
    \ 2-6; Table 2-4). \nThe average monthly water scarcity indicates severe water\
    \ scarcity, more severe than \nannual (total) water scarcity values suggest. In\
    \ all basins, the total blue WF exceeds \nnatural runoff during a significant\
    \ period of the year. In the months June, July and \nAugust, severe water scarcity\
    \ occurs in all river basins. Crops with a large blue WF in \nJuly are: sugar\
    \ beets in Oum Er Rbia and Sebou; grapes in the basins of Sud Atlas, Souss \n\
    Massa and Oum Er Rbia; dates in Oum Er Rbia and Sebou; sunflower seed in the Sebou\
    \ \nbasin; maize in the basin of Oum Er Rbia. Demand for potable water peaks in\
    \ the \nmonths June, July and August due to tourism and evaporation from storage\
    \ reservoirs is \nlarge in these months due to the strong evaporative power of\
    \ the atmosphere. Annual \nrunoff in the Oum Er Rbia basin is almost completely\
    \ consumed (inter-basin water \ntransfers not yet considered), which raises the\
    \ question whether it is wise to export water \nout of this basin to the basins\
    \ of Bouregreg and Tensift as is common practice. \n22 \n \nFigure 2-6. Total\
    \ blue water footprint and natural runoff per river basin (both in 106 \nm3/month).\
    \ Period of blue water footprint: 1996-2005. Natural runoff is estimated as the\
    \ \nlong-term average inflow of reservoirs. It is considered undepleted runoff,\
    \ since large-\nscale blue water withdrawals come from the reservoirs. The estimates\
    \ can be considered \nconservative, because net precipitation in areas downstream\
    \ of reservoirs is not \nincluded. Inter-basin water transfers (not included in\
    \ data shown) are 212x106 m3/y from \nOum Er Rbia to Tensift and 91x106 m3/y from\
    \ Oum Er Rbia to Bouregreg. \n \n \n23 \nTable 2-4. Blue water scarcitya per river\

    \ \nThe regional differences in crop water use (Figure 2-3) provide an opportunity\

    \ (green plus \nblue) are in the order of 1.9 and 1.2 km3/y when all crops (case\
    \ A) and when only annual \ncrops (case B) are relocated over the river basins,\
    \ respectively (Table 2-7). Blue water \nsavings are 1,276x106 m3/y in case A\
    \ and 697x106 m3/y in case B. These are significant \nsavings when put in the\
    \ context of Morocco’s national water strategy, which includes \nactions plans\
    \ to mobilize 1.7 km3/y by 2030 through the construction of 60 large and 1000\

    2.3.6. Added Value of Water Footprint Assessment for Morocco’s Water Policy \n\
    Several insights and response options emerged from the Water Footprint Assessment,\
    \ \nwhich are currently not considered in the national water strategy of Morocco\
    \ and the \ncountry’s river basin plans. They include: \ni. New insights in the\
    \ water balance of Morocco and the country’s main river basins:  \n\x83 \nThe\
    \ evaporative losses from storage reservoirs account for a significant part of\
    \ \nthe blue WF within Morocco. This sheds fresh light on the national water \n\
    strategy that proposes to build another 60 large and 1000 small dams by 2030.\
    \ \n\x83 \nBlue water scarcity on a monthly scale is severe and hidden by annual\
    \ analysis \nof demand versus supply, which is the common scale of analysis in\
    \ Morocco’s \nriver basin plans. \nii. New insights in how economically efficient\
    \ water and land resources are used:  \n\x83 \nAnalysis of the economic value\
    \ of crop products per unit of water and land \nused in the period 1996-2005 indicate\
    \ that agricultural policy may be better \nbrought in line with water policy by\
    \ reconsidering which crops to grow. \n\x83 \nIt is shown that the export policy\
    \ in this period was not optimal from a water-\neconomics point of view, which\
    \ raises the question whether the foreign income \ngenerated by export covers\
    \ the direct and indirect costs of mobilization and \n(over)exploitation of Morocco’s\
    \ water resources. This might not be the case \nconsidering the costs of the construction\
    \ and maintenance of the large dams \nand intra- and inter-basin water transfers\
    \ in the country and the costs \nassociated with the negative externalities of\
    \ water (over)consumption, such as \nthe salt-intrusion in Morocco’s coastal aquifers.\
    \ \niii. New response options to reduce the WF of crop production:  \n\x83 \n\
    Analysis of the WF of the main crops in Morocco and its variation across the \n\
    river basins offers new ways of looking at reducing water consumption in the \n\
    30 \nagricultural sector. The estimated potential water savings by partial relocation\
    \ \nof crops to basins where they consume less water and by reducing WFs of crops\
    \ \ndown to benchmark levels are significant compared to demand reducing and \n\
    supply increasing measures considered in the national water strategy of \nMorocco.\
    \ \n2.4. Discussion \nMorocco’s WF is mostly green (77%). This underlines the\
    \ importance of green water \nresources, also (or especially) in semi-arid countries\
    \ with a high dependency on blue \nwater, and is in line with other studies showing\
    \ the dominance of the green over the \nblue water flow in Africa (and most of\
    \ the world) (Rockström et al., 2009; Schuol et al., \n2008). The relevance of\
    \ the green WF should not be underestimated. Although rain is \nfree and evaporation\
    \ happens anyway, green water that is used for one purpose cannot \nbe used for\
    \ another purpose (Hoekstra, 2013). \nStorage reservoir evaporation accounts for\
    \ a significant share (13%) in the blue WF in \nMorocco. The need for seasonal\
    \ storage of water is evident given the large mismatch in \nnatural runoff and\
    \ water demand (Figure 2-6). However, the large evaporation from \nreservoirs\
    \ shows that these should be seen as water consumers, besides their role in \n\
    water supply. This WF can ultimately be linked to the end-purpose of the reservoir,\
    \ \nwhich for most cases in Morocco is primarily serving irrigated agriculture.\
    \ Therefore, to \nreduce the need for seasonal storage and hence the WF of storage\
    \ reservoirs, it would be \nworthwhile to take the timing of crop water demands\
    \ with respect to natural water \navailability into account in deciding which\
    \ crops or crop varieties to grow. Furthermore, \nlocal alternatives to the large\
    \ surface water reservoirs are groundwater dams, which \nenhance underground water\
    \ storage in alluvial aquifers and thereby loose less water by \nevaporation (Al-Taiee,\
    \ 2012). \nOur analysis shows that from a strictly water-economics point of view\
    \ it would be \nworthwhile to reconsider which crops to grow in Morocco (due to\
    \ the low value in \nUS$/m3 and US$/ha for some crops compared to others). In\
    \ practice, the choice of which \ncrops to produce is part of the national strategy\
    \ regarding food security and of course \nclosely linked to the demand for crops\
    \ (national and global). Nevertheless, we consider it \nuseful and important to\
    \ analyse economic water and land productivities (as done in this \nstudy) in\
    \ addition to these considerations. Especially for water-short countries as \n\
    Morocco it is relevant to evaluate the economic efficiency of water allocation.\
    \ This also \nrelates to the question whether the foreign income generated by\
    \ export products, which \n31 \nhave a footprint on national resources, outweighs\
    \ the direct and indirect costs associated \nwith the resource use. \n2.4.1. Uncertainties\
    \ and Limitations \nThe WF of crop production is largely influenced by the input\
    \ data used and assumptions \nmade by Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2010b) and can easily\
    \ contain an uncertainty of ±20% \n(Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2010b; Mekonnen & Hoekstra,\
    \ 2010a; Hoff et al., 2010). The \ncalculated economic water and land productivities\
    \ of crops are, apart from the WFs and \nyields, dependent on the producer prices.\
    \ Variations in these prices largely influence the \neconomic water and land productivity\
    \ of crops. The WFs of industrial production and \ndomestic water supply are very\
    \ sensitive to the consumptive fractions applied. \nAlthough figures on water\
    \ availability are based on data from the river basin plans and \nthe Ministry\
    \ EMWE (unpublished data 2013), the way they are estimated exactly is often \n\
    unclear and so is the uncertainty in them. Since natural runoff is estimated as\
    \ the inflow \nof reservoirs (thus excluding small-scale local abstractions upstream)\
    \ and net \nprecipitation in areas downstream of reservoirs is not included, the\
    \ estimates of natural \nrunoff can be considered conservative. \nIn general,\
    \ the river basin plans indicate larger pressure on groundwater resources than\
    \ \nsuggested in this study. This might be caused by the fact that the river basin\
    \ plans \ninclude more recent withdrawals and because the unit of analysis in\
    \ this study (river \nbasin agency action zone) is larger than the unit used in\
    \ the river basin plans (individual \naquifers), whereby in this study overexploitation\
    \ of one aquifer might be masked by low \nexploitation of another. Also local\
    \ groundwater pollution according to the river basin \nplans is sometimes worse\
    \ than the water pollution level estimated here. This could be \nexplained by\
    \ the fact that the water quality measurements recorded in the basin plans \n\
    are partly more recent and are measured at specific points, whereas this study\
    \ \nconsidered homogeneous distribution of nitrates in the groundwater. \nGiven\
    \ the uncertainties and limitations of the study, the presented WF estimates and\
    \ \nwater scarcity values should be interpreted with care. Nevertheless, the order\
    \ of \nmagnitude of the estimates in this study gives a good indication to which\
    \ activities and \ncrops Morocco’s water resources are allocated, in which months\
    \ and basins the WFs are \nrelatively large or small and where and when this leads\
    \ to highest water scarcity. \nUncertainties in the estimated potential savings\
    \ by relocation of crop production and \nreducing the WFs of crops to benchmark\
    \ levels are closely linked to the uncertainties in \nthe estimates of the WF\
    \ of crop production and the results should be interpreted \n32 \ncarefully. However,\
    \ the order of magnitude of the estimated savings gives a rough \nindication of\
    \ the potential of these measures. When considering relocation of crop \nproduction\
    \ it is necessary to assess how the green and blue WFs of crops manifest \nthemselves\
    \ on a monthly scale. This study looked at annual water savings, but the \nassociated\
    \ relocation of crops might well aggravate monthly water scarcity in some river\
    \ \nbasins. Furthermore, the feasibility and desirability of relocation of crop\
    \ production are \nof course largely determined by social and economic factors\
    \ which are not considered in \nthis study. \n2.5. Conclusion \nThe study finds\
    \ that: (i) evaporation from storage reservoirs is the second largest form of\
    \ \nblue water consumption in Morocco, after irrigated crop production; (ii) Morocco’s\
    \ \nwater and land resources are mainly used to produce relatively low-value (in\
    \ US$/m3 \nand US$/ha) crops such as cereals, olives and almonds; (iii) most of\
    \ the virtual water \nexport from Morocco relates to the export of products with\
    \ a relatively low economic \nwater productivity (in US$/m3); (iv) blue water\
    \ scarcity on a monthly scale is severe in all \nriver basins and pressure on\
    \ groundwater resources by abstractions and nitrate \npollution is considerable\
    \ in most basins; (v) the estimated potential water savings by \npartial relocation\
    \ of crops to basins where they consume less water and by reducing WFs \nof crops\
    \ down to benchmark levels are significant compared to demand reducing and \n\
    supply increasing measures considered in Morocco’s national water strategy. \n\
    On the basis of these new insights and response options it is concluded that Water\
    \ \nFootprint Assessment has an added value for national water policy in Morocco.\
    \ Water \nFootprint Assessment forces to look at end-users and -purposes of freshwater,\
    \ which is \nkey in determining efficient and equitable water allocation within\
    \ the boundaries of \nwhat is environmentally sustainable, both on the river basin\
    \ and on the national level. \nThis is especially relevant for water-scarce countries\
    \ such as Morocco. Furthermore, \nconsidering the green and grey components of\
    \ a WF provides new perspectives on blue \nwater scarcity, because pressure on\
    \ blue water resources might be reduced by more \nefficient use of green water\
    \ and by less pollution. \n \n33 \n3. \nMitigating the Risk of Extreme Water Scarcity\
    \ and \nDependency: The Case of Jordan3 \nAbstract \nJordan faces great internal\
    \ water scarcity and pollution, conflict over transboundary \nwaters, and strong\
    \ dependency on external water resources through trade. This paper \nanalyses\
    \ these issues and subsequently reviews options to reduce the risk of extreme\
    \ \nwater scarcity and dependency. Based on estimates of water footprint, water\
    \ availability, \nand virtual water trade, we find that groundwater consumption\
    \ is nearly double the \ngroundwater availability, water pollution aggravates\
    \ blue water scarcity, and Jordan’s \nexternal virtual water import dependency\
    \ is 86%. The review of response options yields \n10 ingredients for a strategy\
    \ for Jordan to mitigate the risks of extreme water scarcity \nand dependency.\
    \ With respect to these ingredients, Jordan’s current water policy \nrequires\
    \ \na \nstrong \nredirection \ntowards \nwater \ndemand \nmanagement. \nActual\
    \ \nimplementation of the plans in the national water strategy (against existing\
    \ oppositions) \nwould be a first step. However, more attention should be paid\
    \ to reducing water \ndemand by changing the consumption pattern of Jordanian\
    \ consumers. Moreover, \nunsustainable exploitation of the fossil Disi aquifer\
    \ should soon be halted and planned \ndesalination projects require careful consideration\
    \ regarding the sustainability of their \nenergy supply. \n3.1. Introduction \n\
    The water situation in Jordan is complex and unsustainable. Jordan experiences\
    \ growing \nfreshwater demands that already exceed availability and surface and\
    \ groundwater \nresources are polluted (Scott et al., 2003; Mohsen, 2007; Van\
    \ Aken et al., 2009; Alqadi & \nKumar, 2014, 2011; Hadadin et al., 2010; Becker\
    \ et al., 2014). At the same time, Jordan \nheavily relies on water resources\
    \ outside its borders, in physical sense through the \nsharing of rivers and aquifers\
    \ with neighbouring countries as well as in indirect sense \nthrough Jordan’s\
    \ strong dependence on virtual water imports (Hoekstra & Mekonnen, \n2012). Sharing\
    \ water resources with Israel and Syria has led to tensions in the past \n(Medzini\
    \ & Wolf, 2004; Schenker, 2014; Namrouqa, 2012; Gleick, 2014). On top of this,\
    \ \nJordan has experienced large influxes of refugees as a result of the ongoing\
    \ conflicts in \nthe surrounding countries (Gleick, 2014; de Chatel, 2014), which\
    \ increases Jordan’s \n                                                      \
    \           \n3 This chapter has been published as: \nSchyns, J.F., Hamaideh,\
    \ A., Hoekstra, A.Y., Mekonnen, M.M., & Schyns, M. (2015) \nMitigating the risk\
    \ of extreme water scarcity and dependency: the case of Jordan, \nWater, 7(10):\
    \ 5705-5730. \n34 \nstruggle to meet domestic water needs (Scott et al., 2003;\
    \ Mohsen, 2007; Hadadin et al., \n2010; Abu-Shams & Rabadi, 2003; Alqadi & Kumar,\
    \ 2011, 2014; Talozi et al., 2015). \nJordan is partly arid and partly semi-arid\
    \ (Toernros & Menzel, 2014; Hadadin et al., 2010; \nAlqadi & Kumar, 2011; Jaber\
    \ & Mohsen, 2001) and therefore has natural low water \navailability. Climate\
    \ change has caused a decline in precipitation and hence surface \nwater flows\
    \ (Hadadin et al., 2010; Alqadi & Kumar, 2014). Based on model simulations \n\
    for different climate change scenarios, Abdulla et al. (2009) found that decreases\
    \ in \nprecipitation will lead to significant decreases in runoff and groundwater\
    \ recharge in the \nZarqa river basin (Figure 3-1). The percentage of time that\
    \ the Jordan River basin and its \nsurroundings will experience moderate, severe\
    \ and extreme drought conditions is \nexpected to increase in the future (Toernros\
    \ & Menzel, 2014). Such droughts can have \ndevastating effects when agricultural\
    \ and water management practices in place are \nunsustainable (Kelley et al.,\
    \ 2015). Furthermore, the (semi-)arid conditions in the Jordan \nValley, characterized\
    \ by a combination of high potential evaporation and low \nprecipitation, causes\
    \ a lack of salt flushing and leaching of agricultural soils leading to \nalarming\
    \ soil salinity levels (Ammari et al., 2013). \nNaturally low water availability\
    \ in Jordan is reduced further by (over)consumption of \nshared surface water\
    \ resources by upstream and neighbouring countries. Both the \nJordan \nRiver\
    \ \nand \nthe \nYarmouk \nRiver \nhave \nbeen \ndepleted \nby \nupstream \n(over)consumption\
    \ in Israel and Syria (Mohsen, 2007; Hadadin et al., 2010; Alqadi & \nKumar, 2014;\
    \ Haddadin, 2009). The sharing of transboundary water resources has led to \n\
    difficulties and tensions. In 1994, Jordan and Israel signed a Peace Treaty which\
    \ included \nagreements on water allocations (Haddadin, 2011). Jordan is allowed\
    \ a certain outflow \nfrom Lake Tiberius (situated in Israel) into the Lower Jordan\
    \ River. The current national \nwater strategy of Jordan assumes 50×106 m³/y of\
    \ water to be secured by the Peace Treaty \n(Ministry of Water and Irrigation\
    \ (MWI), 2009). When in 1999 the region was struck by a \ndrought event, the agreed\
    \ water allocation was threatened and bilateral talks \ntemporarily broke down\
    \ before the two parties found a resolution in the end (Medzini & \nWolf, 2004;\
    \ Schenker, 2014). With minimal outflow from Lake Tiberius controlled by \nIsrael,\
    \ the Lower Jordan River mainly depends on inflow from its main tributary the\
    \ \nYarmouk River (Van Aken et al., 2009). The Yarmouk River is shared by Jordan,\
    \ Syria \nand Israel (Kliot, 2005). Jordan and Syria signed an agreement on sharing\
    \ the Yarmouk’s \nwater in 1987 (Kliot, 2005; Namrouqa, 2012). Nevertheless, the\
    \ countries have had \ncontinued tensions over the construction and operation\
    \ of Syrian dams on the river \n35 \n(Gleick, 2014). In 2012, The Jordan Times\
    \ (Namrouqa, 2012) reported that Syria violated \nthe agreement, thereby depriving\
    \ Jordan of its legitimate water share. \nCurrent water demand in Jordan exceeds\
    \ the limited renewable water resources \navailable in the country. Agricultural\
    \ water demand is growing (by 38% in the period \n2000-2010 (Alqadi & Kumar, 2014))\
    \ despite efforts to improve irrigation efficiency and \nencouraging farmers to\
    \ grow less water-intensive crops (Scott et al., 2003). Domestic \nwater demand\
    \ is unmet and still increasing (by 40 to 46% in the period 2000-2010 \n(Hadadin\
    \ et al., 2010; Alqadi & Kumar, 2014)). This increase is due to rapid population\
    \ \ngrowth, caused by a high rate of natural population growth and periodic massive\
    \ \ninfluxes of refugees (Scott et al., 2003; Mohsen, 2007; Hadadin et al., 2010;\
    \ Alqadi & \nKumar, 2011; Talozi et al., 2015). In 2014, the refugee population\
    \ in Jordan, mostly \nconsisting of Syrians, was around 10% of the country’s total\
    \ population (Figure 3-2). \nThese are officially registered refugees only and\
    \ the actual number is likely to be higher. \nSince the conflicts in Syria, Iraq\
    \ and Israel/Palestine are still ongoing, there is all the \nreason to believe\
    \ that the number of people seeking refuge in Jordan is still growing. \nOverconsumption\
    \ of Jordan’s surface and groundwater resources is associated with \nseveral environmental\
    \ impacts. Due to the high amount of abstractions along its course, \nthe Jordan\
    \ River has shrunk to a small creek by the time it reaches the Dead Sea, with\
    \ \ncurrent discharge being less than 5% of historical levels (Hadadin et al.,\
    \ 2010; Becker et \nal., 2014). This has led to an alarming decline of the Dead\
    \ Sea level, which in turn causes \nlowering of groundwater tables in adjacent\
    \ aquifers (Alqadi & Kumar, 2014). Since the \n1970s, the water level of the Dead\
    \ Sea has dropped at a rate of about 1 meter per year \n(Abu Qdais, 2008; Abu\
    \ Ghazleh et al., 2009). With each meter of reduction, 300×106 m³ of \nfresh water\
    \ is lost from neighbouring aquifers (Abu Qdais, 2008). Groundwater levels \n\
    are rapidly dropping throughout the country (Mohsen, 2007; Alqadi & Kumar, 2011;\
    \ \nScott et al., 2003). This has led to drying up of springs and disappearance\
    \ of the Azraq \nwetlands (Van Aken et al., 2009) with reduced habitat for endemic\
    \ species and migratory \nbirds as a consequence (Scott et al., 2003). \nProblems\
    \ of surface and groundwater pollution are widespread in Jordan, which \naggravates\
    \ water scarcity (Schyns et al., 2015). Inadequate treatment of industrial and\
    \ \ndomestic wastewater and over- and misuse of fertilizers and pesticides pollute\
    \ these \nresources (Hadadin et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2003; Al-Zu’bi, 2007).\
    \ The canals that \ndistribute water throughout Jordan are more and more polluted\
    \ by salts and other \nagricultural runoff (Alqadi & Kumar, 2014). Pollution of\
    \ groundwater is exacerbated by \noverpumping, which leads to a concentration\
    \ of salts and other pollutants (Jaber & \n36 \nMohsen, 2001; Scott et al., 2003;\
    \ Venot & Molle, 2008; El-Naqa & Al-Shayeb, 2009; Alqadi \n& Kumar, 2013; Al-Ansari\
    \ et al., 2014). Hotspots of groundwater pollution in the regions \nof Amman,\
    \ Zarqa and Balqa have been mapped by Alqadi et al. (2014). The pollution of \n\
    waters in Jordan is also partially a transboundary issue. The Jordan River Basin\
    \ suffers \nby agricultural runoff and untreated wastewater from all riparian\
    \ countries (Scott et al., \n2003). \nJordan thus faces great internal water scarcity\
    \ and pollution, conflict over transboundary \nwaters and great dependency on\
    \ external water resources through trade. Given the great \nvariety of challenges,\
    \ sustainable water management in Jordan is a challenging task, \nwhich thus far\
    \ has not succeeded. The objective of this paper is to analyse Jordan’s \ndomestic\
    \ water scarcity and pollution and the country’s external water dependency, and\
    \ \nsubsequently review options to reduce the risk of extreme water scarcity and\
    \ \ndependency. In the next section we discuss methods and data. In the third\
    \ section we \nanalyse the water situation in Jordan from a water footprint (WF)\
    \ perspective, with the \naim to accurately quantify the severity of water scarcity\
    \ and pollution in Jordan. In the \nfourth section, we analyse the country’s dependency\
    \ on external water resources by \nquantifying and mapping the world-wide water\
    \ consumption associated with the \nproducts and commodities Jordanians consume.\
    \ In the fifth section, we review possible \nresponse options to Jordan’s water\
    \ problems and external water dependency. \n37 \n \nFigure 3-1. Map of Jordan\

    \ and consumption and virtual water trade following the \nglobal standard for\
    \ Water Footprint Assessment (Hoekstra et al., 2011). We quantify the \nWF of\
    \ five different sectors in Jordan: crop production, grazing, animal water supply,\
    \ \nindustrial production and domestic water supply. Therein we distinguish three\
    \ different \nWFs: green, blue and grey. The green WF refers to the appropriation\
    \ of the green water \nflow (i.e. evaporation of precipitation stored in the soil\
    \ moisture and on top of \nvegetation) in crop production and grazing systems.\
    \ The blue WF expresses the \nconsumptive use of surface- and groundwater (blue\
    \ water resources), which excludes \nreturn flows to these resources. The grey\
    \ WF expresses water pollution in the same unit \nas water consumption. It measures\
    \ the volume of freshwater required to dilute the \npollutants that enter blue\
    \ water resources to such an extent that ambient water quality \nstandards are\
    \ not violated. \nWe estimate the WF of crops in Jordan for the period 1996-2005\
    \ following the method of \nand using the same underlying datasets as Mekonnen\
    \ & Hoekstra (2011a). The grey WF \nof crop production is calculated based on\
    \ leaching of nitrogen to the groundwater, \nassuming an ambient water quality\
    \ standard of 10 mg/l of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). The \nWF of grazing and the\
    \ domestic and industrial sectors as well as imported and exported \nvirtual water\
    \ volumes are estimated following the methods of Hoekstra & Mekonnen \n(2012).\
    \ The grey WFs of the industrial and domestic sectors relate to the aggregate\
    \ of \npollutants, but are conservative estimates since we take the part of the\
    \ return flow which \n39 \nis disposed into the environment without prior treatment\
    \ as a measure of the grey WF \n(thus assuming a dilution factor of 1), following\
    \ Hoekstra & Mekonnen (2012). \nThe WF of Jordan’s consumption, defined as the\
    \ volume of water consumed to produce \nall the products consumed by the Jordanian\
    \ population, inside and outside Jordan, is \ncalculated following Hoekstra &\
    \ Mekonnen (2012). The national water saving through \ntrade is the volume of\
    \ water that Jordan saved by importing products instead of \nproducing them domestically,\
    \ and is calculated following Mekonnen & Hoekstra \n(2011b). \nThe total blue\
    \ WF of each sector is split into a part originating from surface water (i.e.\
    \ \nblue surface-WF) and a part originating from groundwater (i.e. blue ground-WF).\
    \ This \nwas done according to the origin of blue water use per sector (groundwater\
    \ versus \nsurface water) which we obtained from Alqadi & Kumar (2014). We scaled\
    \ the estimated \nground-WFs of industries and households to equal water withdrawals\
    \ based on the \nconsumptive use fraction following Schyns & Hoekstra (2014).\
    \ The underlying \nassumption is that none of the water abstracted from groundwater\
    \ for industrial \nproduction and domestic water supply returns (clean) to the\
    \ groundwater in the same \nperiod of time. \nBlue water scarcity is calculated\
    \ as the ratio of the total blue WF in Jordan over total blue \nwater availability\
    \ (Hoekstra et al., 2011). Total blue water availability is defined as the \n\
    total renewable surface and groundwater resources, as defined by the FAO (2015a).\
    \ We \nassess blue water scarcity for the sum of surface and groundwater, but\
    \ also for \ngroundwater separately. Jordan’s renewable surface water resources\
    \ are estimated by \ntaking the sum of treaty allocations and surface run-off\
    \ produced internally. \nGroundwater availability is defined as the groundwater\
    \ recharge minus the fraction of \nnatural groundwater outflow required to sustain\
    \ environmental flow requirements in \nthe river (Hoekstra et al., 2011). In practice,\
    \ groundwater availability in Jordan is often \nreported as the “safe yield” of\
    \ groundwater without further clarification (Hadadin et al., \n2010; Mohsen, 2007;\
    \ Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009; El-Naqa & Al-Shayeb, \n2009; Ministry\
    \ of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2013). The FAO (2015a) defines “safe \nyield”\
    \ as the amount of water (in general, the long term average amount) which can\
    \ be \nwithdrawn from the groundwater without causing undesirable results. Although\
    \ it is a \nvague concept (Dottridge & Abu Jaber, 1999; Sophocleous, 2000), we\
    \ take reported \nfigures on safe yield (Hadadin et al., 2010; Mohsen, 2007; Ministry\
    \ of Water and \nIrrigation (MWI), 2009; El-Naqa & Al-Shayeb, 2009; Ministry of\
    \ Water and Irrigation \n(MWI), 2013) as a proxy for groundwater availability,\
    \ due to lack of data. We consider \n40 \nJordan’s blue water availability around\
    \ the year 2000 as proper context for the WF \nestimates that relate to the period\
    \ 1996-2005. We use the water scarcity classification by \nSchyns & Hoekstra (2014),\
    \ which is derived from that of Hoekstra et al. (2012) but \ncompensated for the\
    \ fact that environmental flow requirements are not considered by \nusing stricter\
    \ threshold values for the different scarcity levels. A blue water scarcity level\
    \ \nbeyond 0.4 is classified as severe water scarcity and indicates that the blue\
    \ WF exceeds \n40% of the maximum sustainable blue WF. Levels in the ranges 0.3-0.4,\
    \ 0.2-0.3 and <0.2 \nare classified as significant, moderate and low blue water\
    \ scarcity, respectively. \nThe water pollution level is calculated as the ratio\
    \ of the actual to the maximum \nsustainable grey WF (Hoekstra et al., 2011).\
    \ The maximum sustainable grey WF, an \nindicator of the assimilation capacity\
    \ for water pollution, equals the actual runoff, which \nis estimated as natural\
    \ runoff minus the blue water consumed. The water pollution level \nthus measures\
    \ the degree to which the waste assimilation capacity of blue water \nresources\
    \ has been consumed. A water pollution level beyond hundred per cent means \n\
    that the grey WF exceeds the sustainable level, thus ambient water quality standards\
    \ are \nviolated. \nFinally, we review the sustainability of proposed solutions\
    \ to Jordan’s domestic water \nproblems and external water dependency in literature,\
    \ while involving the results from \nthe analysis in this paper. We categorize\
    \ the response options into five categories, which \nwe use to position current\
    \ water policy in Jordan. These categories are: (1) increasing \nwater availability;\
    \ (2) reducing water demand per unit of product; (3) reducing water \ndemand by\
    \ changing production and consumption patterns; (4) reducing risks related to\
    \ \nthe external water dependency; and (5) international assistance in taking\
    \ in refugees. \n3.3. The Unsustainability of Water Consumption and Pollution\
    \ in Jordan \n3.3.1. The Water Footprint of Activities in Jordan \nThe total WF\
    \ in Jordan in the period 1996-2005 was 1,446×106 m³/y (53% green; 31% blue; \
    \ \n16% grey) (Table 3-1). The productive use of green water in crop production\
    \ and grazing \nsystems accounts for the largest share in the total. Unsurprisingly,\
    \ the largest blue WF is \nrelated to irrigated agriculture. Forty-five per cent\
    \ of all water consumed (green plus \nblue) in crop production is blue, showing\
    \ the high dependency of Jordanian agriculture \non irrigation water. Blue water\
    \ use is predominant in the Jordan Valley and the desert \nareas, while green\
    \ water use is predominant in the Highlands (Talozi et al., 2015). \n \n \n41\

    \ Hoekstra & Mekonnen (2012). \nb Blue groundwater versus surface water footprint\
    \ based on total blue water footprint \nand Alqadi & Kumar (2014). \nc Total blue\
    \ water footprint is not equal to the sum of blue surface and groundwater \nfootprint,\
    \ because the blue groundwater footprints of industrial production and \ndomestic\
    \ water supply equal water abstraction instead of consumptive use only (Section\
    \ \n3.2). \nWater consumption in the domestic and industrial sectors constitutes\
    \ only about 7% of \nall blue water consumed in Jordan. The grey WF in these sectors\
    \ is 5.6 times their blue \nwater consumption, due to poor wastewater treatment.\
    \ The WF figures relate to water \nconsumption (net water abstraction) as opposed\
    \ to water withdrawal (gross water \nabstraction) and therefore exclude return\
    \ flows to the natural system. This explains the \ndifference between the WF estimates\
    \ in Table 3-1 and the figures on water use \ndistribution over the different\
    \ sectors reported by Hadadin et al. (2010) and Alqadi & \nKumar (2014) that indicate\
    \ that around 35% of all blue water is used in the industrial and \ndomestic sectors.\

    \ \n100% \n \nPart of the WF in Jordan is related to the production of crops and\
    \ products for export. \nTotal virtual water export from Jordan in the period\
    \ 1996-2005 was around 1,046×106 \nm3/y (Table 3-2). This is nearly three-quarters\
    \ of the WF in Jordan (Table 3-1), but it also \nincludes the virtual water related\
    \ to the re-export of imported products. The largest \nvirtual water export volumes\
    \ are related to cotton-based products, animal products, and \nindustrial products.\
    \ However, since cotton is not grown in Jordan, the virtual water \nexport associated\
    \ with seed cotton is due to the re-export of imported cotton that has \nbeen\
    \ processed in Jordan’s textile industry. This means that the virtual water export\
    \ \nfrom Jordanian water resources is mainly related to the export of animal and\
    \ industrial \nproducts, whereby the latter is largely related to pollution (grey\
    \ WF). Large volumes of \nJordanian blue water resources (i.e., surface- and groundwater)\
    \ are also exported in the \nform of tomatoes, wheat, and olives. \n43 \n3.3.2.\
    \ Blue Water Scarcity: Actual versus Maximum Sustainable Blue Water Footprint\
    \ \nPrecipitation over Jordan is highly variable in space and time (Toernros &\
    \ Menzel, 2014; \nNortcliff et al., 2008; Mohsen, 2007). According to Mohsen (2007),\
    \ precipitation varies \nfrom 6000 to 11,500 million m3/y. The rainy season stretches\
    \ from October/November to \nApril/May, with 80% of precipitation occurring in\
    \ the period from December to March \nand practically zero outside the rainy season\
    \ (Toernros & Menzel, 2014; Nortcliff et al., \n2008; Al-Ansari et al., 2014).\
    \ The northwest of Jordan is semi-arid, receiving 200-600 \nmm/y of precipitation.\
    \ Much of the eastern and southern part of the country, \nconstituting about 80-90%\
    \ of Jordan’s surface area, is classified as arid and receives only \n50-100 mm\
    \ or less of precipitation each year (Van Aken et al., 2009; Hadadin et al., 2010;\
    \ \nMohsen, 2007; Nortcliff et al., 2008; Toernros & Menzel, 2014). Groundwater\
    \ availability \nis assumed to be equal to the “safe yield” from renewable groundwater\
    \ resources (see \nSection 3.2), which is approximately 277×106 m3/y (Hadadin\
    \ et al., 2010; Mohsen, 2007; \nMinistry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009;\
    \ El-Naqa & Al-Shayeb, 2009; Ministry of \nWater and Irrigation (MWI), 2013).\
    \ We estimate Jordan’s renewable surface water \nresources in the period 1996-2005\
    \ at 373×106 m3/y by taking the sum of treaty allocations \n(220×106 m3/y) and\
    \ flow from wadis in the Jordan River Valley (153×106 m3/y) in the year \n2000\
    \ according to Hadadin et al. (2010). Total renewable water resources (surface-\
    \ and \ngroundwater) are therefore estimated in this study at 650×106 m3/y. This\
    \ is slightly lower \nthan the 671×106 m3/y of renewable blue water in 2000 as\
    \ estimated by Van Aken et al. \n(2009) and slightly higher than the sum of developed\
    \ surface water resources, flow \nsecured by the peace treaty with Israel, and\
    \ safe yield from groundwater as reported for \nthe year 2007 in Jordan’s national\
    \ water strategy (Ministry of Water and Irrigation \n(MWI), 2009), namely 620×106\
    \ m3/y. Due to Jordan’s high dependency on water from \nupstream and neighbouring\
    \ countries, total blue water availability in Jordan is not \npurely natural runoff.\
    \ Rather, it is actual inflow into Jordan from upstream countries \n(natural inflow\
    \ minus what has been consumed through upstream WFs) plus naturally \ngenerated\
    \ runoff from precipitation over Jordan. \nWhen comparing the blue WF to blue\
    \ water availability, we find that, overall, Jordan is \nseverely water scarce\
    \ (water scarcity ratio >0.4), and that groundwater is overexploited \n(water\
    \ scarcity ratio >1) (Table 3-3). The groundwater scarcity index indicates that\
    \ the \nblue ground-WF in Jordan is nearly double the groundwater availability.\
    \ Other \nquantitative estimates of the country-average ratio of groundwater withdrawal\
    \ over safe \nyield range from 1.6 (El-Naqa & Al-Shayeb, 2009) to 1.9 (Mohsen,\
    \ 2007; Alqadi & Kumar, \n2014). \n44 \nTable 3-3. Blue water scarcity in Jordan\

    b Surface water availability from Hadadin et al. (2010); Groundwater availability\
    \ from as \nthe safe yield reported by various studies (Hadadin et al., 2010;\
    \ Mohsen, 2007; Ministry \nof Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009; El-Naqa & Al-Shayeb,\
    \ 2009; Ministry of Water and \nIrrigation (MWI), 2013). \nAlthough other studies\
    \ have also described water scarcity in Jordan as severe, our \nestimate is even\
    \ more alarming, since we have looked at water consumption (excluding \nreturn\
    \ flows) rather than withdrawals. \n3.3.3. Water Pollution Level: Actual versus\
    \ Maximum Sustainable Grey Water Footprint \nAlthough the grey WFs of the various\
    \ sectors as calculated relate to different forms of \npollution (the grey WFs\
    \ of the industrial and domestic sectors relate to the aggregate of \npollutants,\
    \ while the grey WF of crop production relates to nitrate-nitrogen only), we \n\
    find it appropriate, as a rough estimate, to compare the total grey WF in Jordan\
    \ with \nactual runoff. The latter is calculated as the total blue water availability\
    \ in Jordan minus \nthe total blue WF in Jordan, thus representing runoff after\
    \ depletion by human \nconsumption. This is the volume of water that is available\
    \ to dilute pollutants and is \ntermed “waste assimilation capacity” (Hoekstra\
    \ et al., 2011). The water pollution level, \nthe ratio of the actual to the maximum\
    \ sustainable grey WF, is found to be 1.13 (Table 3-\n4). This indicates that\
    \ the grey WF in Jordan exceeds waste assimilation capacity, \nmeaning that ambient\
    \ water quality standards are violated, which confirms the widely-\nvoiced pollution\
    \ of Jordan’s water resources (Jaber & Mohsen, 2001; Scott et al., 2003; \nMohsen,\
    \ 2007; Venot & Molle, 2008; El-Naqa & Al-Shayeb, 2009; Hadadin et al., 2010;\
    \ \nAlqadi & Kumar, 2014, 2013). \n \n \n45 \nTable 3-4. Water pollution level\
    \ in Jordan. \nWater footprint and pollution level \nValue \nTotal grey water\
    \ footprint \n227×106 m3/y\nMaximum sustainable grey water footprint \n201×106\
    \ m3/y\nWater pollution level \n1.13\n \n3.4. Jordan’s Dependency on Foreign Water\
    \ Resources \nWith respect to transboundary water resources, total treaty allocations\
    \ to Jordan (from \nthe Jordan and Yarmouk rivers and various springs) around\
    \ the year 2000 sum up to \n220×106 m3/y (Hadadin et al., 2010). Comparing this\
    \ with renewable blue water \navailability in Jordan around that time (650×106\
    \ m3/y), we find that the ratio of external \nto total water resources of Jordan\
    \ is 34%. In other words, Jordan is dependent on \nupstream and neighbouring countries\
    \ for one-third of its annual renewable water \nresources. \nJordan’s virtual\
    \ water import dependency is even larger. Of all the water consumption \nassociated\
    \ with the production of the products and commodities Jordanians consume, \n86%\
    \ takes place outside Jordan’s borders and is spread all over the world (Figure\
    \ 3-3). \nThe total WF of Jordan’s consumption in the period 1996-2005 is estimated\
    \ at 8,316×106 \nm3/y, of which 6,712×106 m3/y is virtual water import (Table\
    \ 3-5). With virtual water \nimport being more than six times larger than virtual\
    \ water export (Table 3-2), Jordan is a \nlarge net virtual water importer. Jordan\
    \ obtained a national water savings of  \n7,113×106 m3/y through trade in the\
    \ period 1996-2005. This is the volume of water that \nwould have been required\
    \ had Jordan produced all imported commodities itself.  \n46 \n \nFigure 3-3.\

    \ Data \nbased on Hoekstra & Mekonnen (2012). \nThe largest volumes of imported\
    \ virtual water in the study period are associated with \nimport of: wheat from\
    \ the USA; barley from Syria and Iraq; maize, soybeans, and wheat \nfrom Argentina;\
    \ animal products and soybeans from India; oil palm from Malaysia and \nIndonesia;\
    \ and cotton from China (Table 3-6). However, it should be noted that the \nimport\
    \ pattern has changed since then. Data from FAO (2015b) shows that since \n2004/2005\
    \ barley imports from Syria and Iraq have ceased and instead have mainly come\
    \ \nfrom Ukraine, Germany, Russia, and, more recently, Romania. Also since 2004/2005,\
    \ \nJordan mainly imports wheat from Russia, Ukraine, and Syria, with only relatively\
    \ small \namounts from USA and practically zero from Argentina (FAO, 2015b). Nevertheless,\
    \ \nJordan’s dependency on virtual water imports remains evident. \n \n \n47 \n\

    \ Water Problems and External \nWater Dependency  \nWe review various solutions\
    \ that have been discussed in the past to greater or lesser \nextent to address\
    \ Jordan’s domestic water problems and external water dependency. We \ncategorize\
    \ the various response options into five categories, which are subsequently \n\
    addressed in the following sections: (1) increasing water availability; (2) reducing\
    \ water \ndemand per unit of product; (3) reducing water demand by changing production\
    \ and \nconsumption patterns; (4) reducing risks related to the external water\
    \ dependency; and \n(5) international assistance in taking in refugees. Lastly,\
    \ we reflect upon the position of \ncurrent water policy in Jordan with respect\
    \ to the first three categories. \n \n \n50 \n3.5.1. Increasing Water Availability\
    \ \nDams for Inter-Seasonal Water Storage \nBetween 1950 and 2008, twenty-eight\
    \ dams have been built in Jordan, with a total \nstorage capacity of 368×106 m3\
    \ (Al-Ansari et al., 2014). The newest and largest is the Al-\nWehdah Dam on the\
    \ Yarmouk River with a storage capacity of 110×106 m3 (Ministry of \nWater and\
    \ Irrigation (MWI), 2013), although it only received 41×106 m³ from 2006 to 2010\
    \ \nand its utility is reduced due to water quality issues (Al-Taani, 2013). Constructing\
    \ more \ndams does not seem to be the way to increased water availability and\
    \ reduced water \nscarcity in Jordan. A lot of water is namely lost by evaporation\
    \ from surface water \nreservoirs (Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2012a; Schyns & Hoekstra,\
    \ 2014), especially in arid \nregions such as Jordan. There comes a point where\
    \ inter-seasonal storage and release of \nwater during low flow conditions does\
    \ no longer outweigh the water loss by \nevaporation (Goldsmith & Hildyard, 1984).\
    \ \nDisi Water Conveyance Project \nThe recently realized Disi Water Conveyance\
    \ Project (Namrouqa, 2013), supplies the \ngreater Amman region from the fossil\
    \ Disi aquifer, mainly to prevent public water \nsupply shortages (Aulong et al.,\
    \ 2009; Hadadin et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2003). This is \nhowever a short-term,\
    \ unsustainable solution. The annually abstracted volume from the \nDisi aquifer\
    \ is about 100×106 m3/y (Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2012; \nSalameh\
    \ et al., 2014), which can be regarded as a blue fossil ground-WF since there\
    \ is no \nreturn flow from this abstracted volume to the aquifer. It has been\
    \ estimated that the \nDisi aquifer can be exploited at a rate of 125×106 m3/y\
    \ for 50 years (Mohsen, 2007; World \nBank, 1997). This means that if current\
    \ abstraction rates continue in the future, the Disi \naquifer will be significantly\
    \ depleted in about 50 years from now. The already visible \nconsequences of mining\
    \ the Disi aquifer in the past are discussed by Salameh et al. \n(2014). Besides,\
    \ the Disi Water Conveyance Project has a big energy footprint due to the \ndistance\
    \ and altitude difference that needs to be bridged (Talozi et al., 2015). \nFurthermore,\
    \ the quality of the Disi water has been under discussion, since it has been \n\
    shown that the Disi aquifer contains high amounts of radioactive isotopes (Vengosh\
    \ et \nal., 2009). It would be wise to cap the fossil ground-WF in Jordan to zero\
    \ and use the \nwater from non-renewable resources only when it is urgently needed;\
    \ in low amounts \nand at low frequencies. \n \n \n51 \nDesalination \nAccording\
    \ to several authors (Mohsen, 2007; Hadadin et al., 2010; Alqadi & Kumar, 2014;\
    \ \nSalameh et al., 2014), the most promising long-term solution to the water\
    \ problems in \nJordan is desalination. The main project regarding desalination\
    \ is the Red Sea Dead Sea \nCanal project. Early in 2015, Jordan and Israel signed\
    \ a ‘green-light’ agreement for this \nproject (Al-Khalidi, 2015). Jordan’s national\
    \ water strategy projects for 2022 an additional \namount of 510×106 m3/y desalted\
    \ water compared to 2007, mainly to be realised by the \nRed Sea Dead Sea Canal\
    \ project (Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009). Besides \ndesalination,\
    \ a major goal of the project is to restore the water level of the Dead Sea at\
    \ \naround 400 meters below sea level with imported water from the Red Sea (Beyth,\
    \ 2007). \nThe Red Sea Dead Sea Canal project, which also aims to supply Israel\
    \ and Palestine, \nshould also bring increased political stability to the region\
    \ by improved regional water \nsecurity (Beyth, 2007). According to estimates\
    \ by Al-Omari et al. (2013; 2015), the \nadditional freshwater supply from the\
    \ Red Sea Dead Sea Canal can reduce the domestic \nand irrigation water deficit\
    \ in the Jordan valley down to zero, even under increased \nwater demand and reduced\
    \ water availability in their climate change scenario.  \nIncreasing Jordan’s\
    \ water availability by desalination of salt or brackish seems an \nattractive\
    \ option, especially to ensure public water supply. However, this is under the\
    \ \nprovision that the required energy for the very energy-intensive process of\
    \ desalination \nis driven by sustainable solar and/or wind power. The Red Sea\
    \ Dead Sea Canal requires \nadditional energy for intake of the water from the\
    \ Gulf of Aqaba and transport through \nthe canal and to the public water supply\
    \ stations. Part of the energy is generated in the \nproject itself by hydro turbines\
    \ driven by the large elevation differences, but a significant \nenergy demand\
    \ remains (Beyth, 2007). Meeting this demand with fossil energy is of \ncourse\
    \ not sustainable. Moreover, it would also make Jordan increasingly dependent\
    \ on \nforeign energy resources, since Jordan is poor on oil and gas (U.S. Energy\
    \ Information \nAdministration (EIA), 2014). Most recent data for 2011 shows that\
    \ Jordan already \nimports 96% of the energy it uses (World Bank, 2015). Jordan’s\
    \ energy-dependency is \nthus even larger than its dependency on foreign water\
    \ resources (86%; Section 3.4).  \nWater Harvesting and Productive Use of Precipitation\
    \ \nVarious options have been proposed to make better use of the precipitation\
    \ that falls \nover Jordan: (a) building micro-dams along major water courses\
    \ to store flood water \nduring winter (Mohsen, 2007; Hadadin et al., 2010); (b)\
    \ improved soil management to \nincrease soil moisture storage in rain-fed agriculture\
    \ (leading to less unproductive \n52 \nevaporation and higher yields) (Hadadin\
    \ et al., 2010); (c) productively using the limited \nrainfall over the desert\
    \ areas by growing more drought-tolerant crops (Talozi et al., \n2015); and (d)\
    \ rainwater harvesting in urban areas for domestic purposes that do not \nrequire\
    \ drinking water quality (Hadadin et al., 2010; Jaber & Mohsen, 2001; Abdulla\
    \ & \nAl-Shareef, 2009). Regarding the latter, Abdulla & Al-Shareef (2009) estimate\
    \ that a \nmaximum of 15.5×106 m3/y of rainwater can be harvested from the roofs\
    \ of Jordanian \nresidential buildings, that is, if all rain on all surfaces is\
    \ collected. For drinking purposes, \nthis water would require proper treatment\
    \ (Abdulla & Al-Shareef, 2009). All these \noptions seem worthwhile investigating\
    \ and implementing. Probably, they are able to \nreduce the frequency and size\
    \ of domestic and agricultural water shortages, when \nsupply temporarily falls\
    \ short of demand. E.g., think of weeks in which potable water \nsupply through\
    \ the official network is cut, in which stored urban rainwater from the \nprevious\
    \ week can partially alleviate the shortage for some household purposes. \nRegarding\
    \ agriculture, one could think of a short-term dry spell experienced at a \nparticular\
    \ site – which normally severely limits crop yields – but which the crop can \n\
    survive through better soil management, because previous precipitation events\
    \ \nsufficiently recharged the soil moisture. However, their potential seems insufficient\
    \ to \nsignificantly alleviate water scarcity in Jordan, which is characterized\
    \ by an imbalance \nbetween water availability and demand on a larger spatial\
    \ and temporal scale (Schyns et \nal., 2015). \nTreatment and Reuse of Wastewater\
    \ \nAn important track followed by Jordan is the treatment and reuse of wastewater,\
    \ mainly \nin agriculture (Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009; Ammary,\
    \ 2007). The \npercentage of total generated wastewater in Jordan that was actually\
    \ reused increased \nfrom 30% to 38% in the period 2004-2007 (Alfarra et al.,\
    \ 2011). Treated domestic and \nindustrial wastewater supplies 12% of Jordan’s\
    \ irrigation water (Sowers et al., 2011) and \nthe effect of that on soils and\
    \ crops remains a topic of study (Batarseh et al., 2011). \nPotential future uses\
    \ of treated wastewater are groundwater recharge and industrial \ncooling (Ammary,\
    \ 2007). \nObviously, implementation of proper wastewater treatment will improve\
    \ the water \nquality of Jordan’s surface- and groundwater resources. However,\
    \ reuse of treated \nwastewater is not always possible and limited by the presence\
    \ of certain substances \n(Sowers et al., 2011). There are also several challenges\
    \ to overcome negative perceptions \ntowards the reuse of treated wastewater,\
    \ which may be due to cultural and religious \nconcerns (Carr & Potter, 2013;\
    \ Carr et al., 2011). Furthermore, one should avoid the \n53 \npitfall of viewing\
    \ wastewater as a new freshwater source that comes in addition to other \nwater\
    \ sources such as ground- and surface water and desalinated water (Hoekstra et\
    \ al., \n2011). Wastewater originates from one of those other sources, so one\
    \ cannot increase \nwater availability through reuse. \n3.5.2. Reducing Water\
    \ Demand per Unit of Product \nRationalization of Irrigation Water Use \nIrrigated\
    \ agriculture has the largest blue WF in Jordan (Table 3-1). In theory, irrigation\
    \ \nwater use can be reduced by increasing the price of irrigation water (Van\
    \ Aken et al., \n2009; Ramirez et al., 2011; Doppler et al., 2002; Al-Karablieh\
    \ et al., 2012), improved \nirrigation systems (Molle et al., 2008; Hadadin et\
    \ al., 2010; Comair et al., 2013; Shatanawi \net al., 2005) and training farmers\
    \ in irrigation practices (Venot & Molle, 2008; Ramirez et \nal., 2011). Furthermore,\
    \ reinforcing private ownership of wells may be an option, since \nwell-owners\
    \ have shown to use irrigation water and groundwater resources in a more \nsustainable\
    \ way than well-leasers (Ramirez et al., 2011). \nIn practice, the effectiveness\
    \ of these options is limited though. Molle et al. (2008) argue \nthat the scope\
    \ for pricing mechanisms to improve irrigation and economic efficiency in \nthe\
    \ Jordan Valley is limited. Substantial water price increases are expected to\
    \ have an \neffect, but then farmers should be offered alternatives (e.g. less\
    \ water-intensive crops or \npossibilities to exit agriculture) and positive incentives\
    \ that lower capital and risk \nconstraints for farmers should be co-implemented\
    \ (Molle et al., 2008). According to Van \nAken et al. (2009), improving irrigation\
    \ efficiencies will merely reduce return flows \n(resulting from over-applied\
    \ water) to the underlying aquifers and hence do not lead to \nactual water savings\
    \ from a catchment point of view. Furthermore, since a great deal of \nthe irrigation\
    \ area in Jordan has already been converted to advanced irrigation systems \n\
    supplied from a pressurized pipe network (FAO, 2014; Molle et al., 2008; Shatanawi\
    \ et \nal., 2005; Haddadin, 2009), the remaining potential of increasing irrigation\
    \ efficiency is \nprobably limited. However, there is room for water savings by\
    \ better design and \nmaintenance of the drip irrigation systems and better irrigation\
    \ scheduling (Shatanawi et \nal., 2005; Molle et al., 2008). \nReduce Green and\
    \ Blue Water Footprints of Crops: Benchmarks \nIntroducing crop-specific benchmarks\
    \ is a way to make sure that the green and blue \nwater consumption to produce\
    \ a tonne of a certain crop in Jordan remains below \nreasonable levels (Hoekstra,\
    \ 2014, 2013). These benchmarks can for example be \ndeveloped by looking at the\
    \ best X% performing farmers in Jordan regarding WFs, or in \n54 \nneighbouring\
    \ countries with comparable climate and soil conditions. This can set a \ntarget\
    \ for other farmers, who can reduce their water consumption per unit of crop by\
    \ \nadopting advanced irrigation techniques with smart and efficient irrigation\
    \ scheduling \nand improving soil and crop management (affecting both green and\
    \ blue water use), all \nto avoid unproductive evaporation and increase yields.\
    \ The challenge will be to provide \nsufficient stimuli and capital for farmers\
    \ to achieve the benchmarks (or penalties for not \nachieving them). \nAlthough\
    \ crop production has the largest WF and hence reduction of the WF per unit of\
    \ \ncrop will have the largest overall effect on reducing the WF in Jordan, benchmarks\
    \ can \nalso be developed for other water-consuming sectors in Jordan, for example\
    \ the large \nanimal industry in the country. It should be noted however that\
    \ with options to reduce \nthe water demand per unit of product, the rebound effect\
    \ lures. This refers to the \nsituation in which the saved water is used for extra\
    \ production, thus (partially) offsetting \nthe environmental gains of the efficiency\
    \ improvement (Hoekstra, 2014). \nReduce Grey Water Footprints: Prevent and Treat\
    \ \nTo reduce grey WFs, water pollution should in the first place be prevented\
    \ as much as \npossible and unavoidable waste streams should be properly treated.\
    \ Educating farmers \nin the use of fertilizers could reduce agricultural pollution\
    \ caused by over- and misuse of \nfertilizers. Also here, benchmarks could serve\
    \ as a target for industries and farmers to \nminimize their grey WFs. By properly\
    \ treating unavoidable wastewater streams, much \nof the current pressure that\
    \ pollution puts on blue water resources can be relieved. \nTherefore, Jordan\
    \ should further invest in wastewater treatment plants. \nRehabilitation of Public\
    \ Water Supply Network \nWater savings are expected by rehabilitation of the potable\
    \ water distribution network \nand subsequent proper maintenance of these systems,\
    \ especially in the capital Amman \n(Abu-Shams & Rabadi, 2003; Scott et al., 2003;\
    \ Aulong et al., 2009; Van Aken et al., 2009; \nComair et al., 2013). Currently,\
    \ much water is lost in these networks by leakages (30-50% \n(Van Aken et al.,\
    \ 2009)). However, from a catchment perspective this water that leaks \nfrom underground\
    \ pipes is not considered a loss, because it will probably return to the \ngroundwater\
    \ and surface water rather than evaporate. In other words, this option will \n\
    help in reducing public water supply shortages, but does not reduce water scarcity\
    \ in \nJordan from an environmental point of view. \n55 \n3.5.3. Reducing Water\
    \ Demand by Changing Production and Consumption Patterns \nMaximum Sustainable\
    \ Water Footprints: Caps and Permits \nTo prevent resource overconsumption, a\
    \ WF cap that equals the maximum sustainable \nWF in a river basin or aquifer\
    \ and a system of WF permits could be established \n(Hoekstra & Wiedmann, 2014;\
    \ Hoekstra, 2014). This is especially urgent for Jordan’s \ngroundwater resources.\
    \ We have estimated that the ground-WF in Jordan is nearly \ndouble the groundwater\
    \ availability (Section 3.3.2). All sectors in Jordan heavily rely on \ngroundwater\
    \ (Table 3-1; Alqadi & Kumar (2014)). To prevent this vital resource from \ndrying\
    \ up, Jordan should protect its groundwater from overexploitation by making sure\
    \ \nthat the ground-WFs remain below maximum sustainable levels. For each aquifer,\
    \ the \nMinistry of Water and Irrigation and the Water Authority of Jordan could\
    \ issue ground-\nWF permits amongst the water consumers. The sum of these permits\
    \ shall not exceed the \ngroundwater availability for each aquifer, defined as\
    \ the groundwater recharge minus \nthe fraction of natural groundwater outflow\
    \ required to sustain environmental flow \nrequirements in the river fed by the\
    \ aquifer (Hoekstra et al., 2011). It would be wise to \nformally establish the\
    \ groundwater availability of each aquifer as a ground-WF cap, \nwhich represents\
    \ the maximum sustainable ground-WF for the aquifer. Ideally, such \nground-WF\
    \ caps are reconsidered on a yearly basis (Hoekstra, 2013), to account for the\
    \ \nhigh inter-annual variability in rainfall and groundwater recharge in Jordan.\
    \ \nAlthough in the past efforts have been made to limit groundwater abstractions,\
    \ limits \nhave not been respected and too many abstraction permits have been\
    \ issued (Van Aken \net al., 2009; Venot & Molle, 2008; Molle et al., 2008). Clearly,\
    \ it will be a challenge to \nestablish ground-WF caps and proper issuing and\
    \ enforcement of ground-WF permits \nwhile managing the social and economic consequences\
    \ of reducing groundwater \nconsumption. Promising additional policies include\
    \ regulations on the number of new \nwells being drilled (Alqadi & Kumar, 2014)\
    \ and selective closure of wells by restricted \npermitting and buyouts (Venot\
    \ & Molle, 2008). Moreover, increases in the price of \nenergy (electricity and\
    \ fuels) could give farmers an incentive to reduce groundwater \n(over)pumping\
    \ (Scott et al., 2003). \nA cap on the surface WF in the Jordan River Basin and\
    \ its sub-catchments would also \nbenefit the environment by (partially) restoring\
    \ historical runoff and flow into the Dead \nSea. However, because the basin is\
    \ shared by five countries in a politically tense region, \nthis remains fairly\
    \ far-fetched for the near future. Nevertheless, when first focusing on \ncapping\
    \ ground-WFs, one should be aware of, and try to manage, the risk of increased\
    \ \n56 \nsurface-WFs as a result of that. The opposite happened when surface water\
    \ diversions \nwere capped in the Murray-Darling river basin (Hoekstra, 2013).\
    \ \nProduce High Value-Added Products and Crops: Allocation Efficiency \nMaximum\
    \ sustainable WFs dictate how much water can be used in total (in a specific \n\
    basin or aquifer). Optimal use of the sustainably available water can be achieved\
    \ by \nchanges in the production pattern. It has been voiced that Jordan should\
    \ promote a shift \nfrom water-intensive low value added crops to less water-intensive\
    \ and high value \nadded crops (Scott et al., 2003; Van Aken et al., 2009; Mohsen,\
    \ 2007; Al-Weshah, 2000; \nAbu-Sharar et al., 2012) or completely towards other\
    \ sectors than agriculture (Scott et al., \n2003; Mohsen, 2007). \nWise water\
    \ allocation in Jordan should focus on meeting domestic water demand and \nproduction\
    \ of high value added products and crops with relatively low WFs for export. \n\
    The income generated by export can then be used to import water-intensive \ncommodities\
    \ (mainly agricultural products) required by the Jordan population. This will\
    \ \nindeed be socially difficult to obtain, although Jordan is not so dependent\
    \ on agriculture \nas one might think (Mohsen, 2007), and make Jordan even more\
    \ dependent on foreign \nwater resources than it already is. However, the latter\
    \ is practically unavoidable for \ncountries poor in natural resources such as\
    \ Jordan. \nPolitics is perhaps the biggest reason that water reallocation between\
    \ crops and sectors \nhas not been successful so far. As elaborately discussed\
    \ by Van Aken et al. (2009) and \nZeitoun et al. (2012), there are influential\
    \ tribes and political elites who exert powerful \nopposition against such measures.\
    \ Furthermore, pricing mechanisms do not affect a \nlarge part of the farms where\
    \ water-intensive crops are grown, which are owned by \nabsentee owners who are\
    \ interested in prestige or leisure rather than farm returns (Van \nAken et al.,\
    \ 2009). \nChange Consumption Patterns \nA further step in water demand management\
    \ is to influence consumption patterns that \nultimately drive the demand for\
    \ water and thus the domestic water scarcity and external \nwater dependency.\
    \ Several authors have noted that programs to educate water users \nand raise\
    \ awareness among the public could help in reducing water use (Venot & Molle,\
    \ \n2008; Hadadin et al., 2010; Mohsen, 2007; Al-Ansari et al., 2014). Specifically,\
    \ such \ncampaigns should focus on the WF associated with the products Jordanians\
    \ consume \nand how changes in their consumption pattern could significantly lower\
    \ the pressure on \n57 \nwater resources. This would be far more effective than\
    \ focusing on water conservation \ntechniques in the household, since the WF of\
    \ an average consumer in Jordan relates for \nonly 2% to water consumption in\
    \ and around the house (Figure 3-4). On the other hand, \nnearly half of the WF\
    \ of the average Jordanian consumer is associated with the \nconsumption of animal\
    \ products (of which 22% meat) and this share is likely to increase \ndue to higher\
    \ standards of living. Therefore, effective campaigns to stimulate reduced \n\
    meat consumption, such as meat-free days, seem to be the way to a smaller WF in\
    \ Jordan \n(and elsewhere). Also product labels, physical or digital, that inform\
    \ the consumer about \nthe WF of a product and the degree of water scarcity in\
    \ the catchment where it was \nproduced and/or provide a simple ‘yes or no’ advice\
    \ based on certain sustainability \ncriteria (Hoekstra, 2013), would raise awareness\
    \ and ultimately influence consumer \nchoices for the better (reduced environmental\
    \ impact). \n3.5.4. Reducing Risks Related to the External Water Dependency \n\
    It has long been recognized that Jordan is strongly water-dependent on other countries,\
    \ \nbecause the country is a large net virtual water importer (Haddadin, 2003;\
    \ Chapagain & \nHoekstra, 2003; Hoekstra & Hung, 2005; Hoekstra & Chapagain, 2008;\
    \ Mourad et al., \n2010; Hadadin et al., 2010; Allan, 2002; Abu-Sharar et al.,\
    \ 2012). Externalizing its \nconsumption-related WF is an important mechanism\
    \ for Jordan to reduce water demand \nwithin its borders. \nThe previously discussed\
    \ solutions potentially enable sustainable use of Jordan’s \ndomestic water resources,\
    \ accepting that the country remains heavily dependent on \nexternal water resources.\
    \ Jordan is by far too poor in water resources to be self-sufficient \nor even\
    \ nearly self-sufficient. Hence, Jordan’s already large external water dependency\
    \ \nwill unavoidably continue in the future. There are two important strategies\
    \ for Jordan to \nmitigate the associated risks. \nBy externalizing its WF Jordan\
    \ creates additional pressure on foreign water resources. \nImporting virtual\
    \ water from regions that are under a degree of water scarcity similar or \nworse\
    \ than Jordan is not sustainable and carries the risk of unreliable import flows\
    \ \ncaused by water limitations elsewhere (e.g. failure of yields due to drought).\
    \ Major trade \npartners of Jordan that have river basins facing severe water\
    \ scarcity during several \nmonths of the year are for example Australia, China,\
    \ India, Turkey and the USA \n(Hoekstra et al., 2012). An important strategy for\
    \ Jordan is therefore to aim at importing \nwater-intensive commodities from nations\
    \ that are not under a high degree of water \nscarcity, e.g. from countries in\
    \ Northern Europe, South America, Central Africa, or \n58 \nCanada (Gerten et\
    \ al., 2011; Hoekstra et al., 2012). This is a growing challenge, since \nwater\
    \ scarcity is becoming increasingly important, not only blue but also green water\
    \ \nscarcity (Schyns et al., 2015). When an increasing number of regions in the\
    \ world face \nwater limitations to production, externalizing water consumption\
    \ to other, less water \nscarce, nations will become more difficult. \nAs a second\
    \ strategy, Jordan can reduce the risk of import dependency by diversifying \n\
    its imports over various trade partners. Looking at Jordan’s external WF in the\
    \ period \n1996-2005 and food imports since (Section 3.4), we already see a shift\
    \ in Jordan’s import \npartners away from Syria and Iraq, most probably inevitable\
    \ due to the unstable \nsituations in these countries. \nMoreover, as noted in\
    \ the previous section, to be able to maintain a high virtual water \nimport dependency\
    \ economically, Jordan should generate sufficient income to finance \nimports.\
    \ Therefore it should use its domestic resources to produce high value added low\
    \ \nwater consuming products for export. \nIn contrast to our view, Alqadi & Kumar\
    \ (2014) state that further reliance on virtual \nwater import is not the way\
    \ to go for Jordan and that desalination is the only means to \nreplace current\
    \ virtual water imports. However, it is unthinkable that Jordan \ndomestically\
    \ produces the majority of the commodities it currently imports. Jordan’s \nnational\
    \ water saving by trade is huge, being in the order of annual precipitation over\
    \ \nJordan and more than 10 times larger than renewable blue water resources.\
    \ In other \nwords, even in the hypothetical situation that all rainfall over\
    \ Jordan would be used \nproductively to make the commodities consumed by the\
    \ people in Jordan, this would \nbarely suffice. To put it differently, nearly\
    \ 14 times the projected volume of desalted \nwater in 2022 (520×106 m3/y (Ministry\
    \ of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009)) would be \nrequired to replace the water\
    \ Jordan saved by virtual water imports. Notwithstanding \nthe limitations of\
    \ available arable land in Jordan to becoming more self-sufficient. \nReduced\
    \ risk from Jordan’s dependency on transboundary rivers and aquifers will need\
    \ \nto come from international cooperation towards improved regional water security.\
    \ It \nshall be clear that this is a major challenge considering the history of\
    \ the region \n(Haddadin, 2011), recent conflicts in the region (Gleick, 2014;\
    \ de Chatel, 2014) and biased \nknowledge production (Messerschmid & Selby, 2015).\
    \ \n3.5.5. International Assistance in Taking in Refugees \nJordan has serious\
    \ problems to secure its domestic water supply and has to cope with \nlarge refugee\
    \ influxes (Scott et al., 2003; Mohsen, 2007; Hadadin et al., 2010; Alqadi & \n\
    59 \nKumar, 2011; Talozi et al., 2015). Because Jordan’s water resources are currently\
    \ \ninsufficient to support the already large and rapidly increasing population\
    \ in a \nsustainable manner, the international community should assist Jordan\
    \ in taking in \nrefugees. \nAlongside with Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt, Jordan\
    \ is in the top five host countries \nof Syrian refugees, together hosting roughly\
    \ 95% of the Syrian refugees by 2014 \n(Amnesty International, 2014). A year later,\
    \ with the Islamic State having taken over \nlarge parts of Syria and Iraq and\
    \ the upheaval of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the \nsummer of 2014, the\
    \ numbers of refugees in Jordan has expanded even more (Figure 3-\n2). As Jordan\
    \ and other first-host countries do not have the capacity to cope with the \n\
    sudden large population growth, this could eventually lead to economic and social\
    \ \ninstability in these countries (Achilli, 2015). \nFinancial humanitarian aid\
    \ is mainly coming from the European Union (EU) (Amnesty \nInternational, 2014;\
    \ Trombetta, 2014). However, only about 4% of all Syrian refugees \nsought asylum\
    \ in the EU (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), \n2014) and\
    \ they are predominantly taken in by Germany and Sweden (Amnesty \nInternational,\
    \ 2014). Furthermore, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) could potentially \n\
    provide more assistance. According to Amnesty International (2014), the countries\
    \ of the \nGCC (Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab\
    \ Emirates) have \ncontributed zero resettlement places for Syrian refugees. \n\
    3.5.6. Positioning Current Water Policy in Jordan \nWith respect to the first\
    \ three response categories discussed above (Sections 3.5.1-3.5.3), \ncurrent\
    \ water policy in Jordan is mainly focused on the first category of response:\
    \ \nincreasing water availability (Alqadi & Kumar, 2014; Zeitoun et al., 2012).\
    \ To a lesser \nextent, policy is directed at reducing water demand per unit of\
    \ product by improving \nefficiency in irrigation and public water supply networks\
    \ and treatment and reuse of \nwastewater. \nEfforts in the category of reducing\
    \ water demand by changing production and \nconsumption patterns, concentrate\
    \ on limiting over-exploitation of water resources. \nBesides efforts to combat\
    \ groundwater over-abstraction (Venot & Molle, 2008), Jordan’s \nnational water\
    \ strategy (Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009) includes plans to \n\
    bound and regulate irrigated agriculture. Allocation efficiency is also a topic\
    \ in the \nnational water strategy, which acknowledges that water should be allocated\
    \ to high \nvalue added purposes with relatively low water consumption, while\
    \ ensuring that \n60 \ndomestic water needs are fulfilled (Ministry of Water and\
    \ Irrigation (MWI), 2009). Better \nwater pricing and removing import tariffs\
    \ on agricultural commodities should stimulate \nthis (Ministry of Water and Irrigation\
    \ (MWI), 2009). However, despite the attention to \nthese strategies in Jordan’s\
    \ water strategy, practice shows a focus on meeting demand \nwith supply-side\
    \ measures, while efforts to manage demand face opposition from \npowerful entities\
    \ as previously mentioned (Zeitoun et al., 2012). \nInfluencing dietary consumption\
    \ patterns to reduce water demand remains \nunmentioned in the national water\
    \ strategy (Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), \n2009) and does not seem\
    \ to be on Jordan’s policy agenda. The document does include \ngoals on raising\
    \ awareness, but these rather focus on informing the public on the water \nproblems\
    \ in Jordan so as to create support for intended regulations to increase water\
    \ \nprices and limit abstractions and to provide “concrete suggestions on economically\
    \ cost-\nefficient measures every individual can implement to reduce water demand”\
    \ (Ministry \nof Water and Irrigation (MWI), 2009). The latter applies to water\
    \ conservation techniques \nin the household, rather than choices in what to consume.\
    \ \n3.6. Conclusions \nWe have analysed Jordan’s domestic water scarcity and pollution\
    \ and the country’s \nexternal water dependency and conclude that: \n1. \nEven\
    \ while taking into account the return flows, blue water scarcity in Jordan is\
    \ \nsevere; \n2. \nGroundwater consumption is nearly double the groundwater availability;\
    \ \n3. \nWater pollution aggravates blue water scarcity; \n4. \nWhile Jordan’s\
    \ dependence on transboundary resources is already large (34%), \nits dependency\
    \ on external water resources through trade is much larger, with \n86% of the\
    \ water consumption associated with the production of products and \ncommodities\
    \ consumed by the Jordan population taking place in foreign \ncountries all over\
    \ the world. \nSubsequently, we have reviewed sustainable solutions that reduce\
    \ the risk of this \nextreme water scarcity and dependency. A strategy for Jordan\
    \ to mitigate the risks of \nextreme water scarcity and dependency should involve\
    \ the following ingredients: \n1. \nDo not tap into fossil groundwater resources;\
    \ use only in urgent times, in low \namounts and at low frequencies. \n2. \nDrive\
    \ desalination projects with sustainable solar and wind energy. \n61 \n3. \nInvestigate\
    \ and implement options for water harvesting and productive use of \nrainfall\
    \ to overcome water shortages on the small scale. \n4. \nPrevent pollution, treat\
    \ inevitable waste streams, and possibly reuse \nwastewater flows, but consider\
    \ that treated wastewater is not a new freshwater \nresource in addition to ground-\
    \ and surface water and desalinated water. \n5. \nDevelop WF benchmarks for crops\
    \ and products that reflect reasonable levels \nof water consumption per unit\
    \ of production and work towards achieving \nthose benchmarks by focusing on smart\
    \ and efficient irrigation scheduling and \nimproved soil and crop management.\
    \ \n6. \nCap the WF in each river basin and aquifer to the maximum sustainable\
    \ WF, \nfocusing on groundwater first, while managing the risks of averted impact\
    \ on \nsurface water. \n7. \nIncrease allocation efficiency by making sure domestic\
    \ water demand is met \nand using the remaining available water below the maximum\
    \ sustainable level \nfor the production of high value-added products and crops\
    \ with relatively low \nWFs for export. \n8. \nUse the revenue obtained by export\
    \ to finance the inevitable imports of water-\nintensive products and commodities\
    \ from a diverse number of countries that \nare under a significantly lower degree\
    \ of water scarcity than Jordan. \n9. \nStimulate a change towards consumption\
    \ patterns with a lower WF, e.g., by \nmeans of introducing meat-free days and\
    \ product labelling. \n10. The international community should assist Jordan in\
    \ taking in the large \nnumbers of refugees from neighbouring conflict regions,\
    \ to reduce the domestic \nwater demand. \nWith respect to these ingredients,\
    \ Jordan’s current water policy requires a strong \nredirection towards water\
    \ demand management. Actual implementation of the plans in \nthe national water\
    \ strategy (against existing opposition) would be a first step. However, \nmore\
    \ attention should be paid to reducing water demand by changing the consumption\
    \ \npatterns of Jordanian consumers. Moreover, unsustainable exploitation of the\
    \ fossil Disi \naquifer should soon be halted and planned desalination projects\
    \ require careful \nconsideration on the sustainability of their energy supply.\
    \ \n \n \n62 \n \n \n63 \n4. \nReview and Classification of Indicators of Green\
    \ \nWater Availability and Scarcity4 \nAbstract \nResearch on water scarcity has\
    \ mainly focussed on blue water (ground- and surface \nwater), but green water\
    \ (soil moisture returning to the atmosphere through evaporation) \nis also scarce,\
    \ because its availability is limited and there are competing demands for \ngreen\
    \ water. Crop production, grazing lands, forestry and terrestrial ecosystems are\
    \ all \nsustained by green water. The implicit distribution or explicit allocation\
    \ of limited green \nwater resources over competitive demands determines which\
    \ economic and \nenvironmental goods and services will be produced and may affect\
    \ food security and \nnature conservation. We need to better understand green\
    \ water scarcity to be able to \nmeasure, model, predict and handle it. This paper\
    \ reviews and classifies around 80 \nindicators of green water availability and\
    \ scarcity, and discusses the way forward to \ndevelop operational green water\
    \ scarcity indicators that can broaden the scope of water \nscarcity assessments.\
    \ \n4.1. Introduction \nFreshwater is a renewable resource that is naturally replenished\
    \ over time when moving \nthrough the hydrological cycle (Oki & Kanae, 2006; Hoekstra,\
    \ 2013). Precipitation forms \nthe input of freshwater on land. Subsequently,\
    \ it takes the blue or the green pathway \nback to the ocean and atmosphere before\
    \ eventually returning as precipitation again \n(Falkenmark, 2003; Falkenmark\
    \ & Rockström, 2006; Falkenmark & Rockström, 2010). The \nwater that runs off\
    \ to the ocean via rivers and groundwater is called the blue water flow. \nThe\
    \ green water flow is formed by the water that is temporarily stored in the soil\
    \ and on \ntop of vegetation and returns to the atmosphere as evaporation instead\
    \ of running off \n(Hoekstra et al., 2011). As suggested by Savenije (2004), in\
    \ this paper we use the term \nevaporation (instead of the often used term evapotranspiration)\
    \ to refer to the vapour \nflux from land to atmosphere, which includes soil evaporation,\
    \ evaporation of \nintercepted water, transpiration and in some cases (e.g. rice\
    \ or swamp vegetation) open-\nwater evaporation. About three-fifth of the precipitation\
    \ over land takes the green path \nand two-fifth the blue path (Oki & Kanae, 2006).\
    \ \n                                                                 \n4 This\
    \ chapter has been published as: \nSchyns, J.F., Hoekstra, A.Y. & Booij, M.J.\
    \ (2015) Review and classification of indicators of \ngreen water availability\
    \ and scarcity, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19: 4581-4608. \n64 \nBoth blue and\
    \ green water flows are made productive for human purposes. Blue water is \nused\
    \ for industrial and domestic purposes and irrigation in agriculture. Green water\
    \ \nsustains crop production, grazing lands, forestry and terrestrial ecosystems\
    \ (Rockström, \n1999; Rockström et al., 1999; Savenije, 2000; Gerten et al., 2005).\
    \ These systems provide \nfood, fibres, biofuels, timber and livestock products\
    \ and other ecosystem services \nhumans benefit from (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,\
    \ 2005; Gordon et al., 2010). \nAlthough freshwater is renewable, this does not\
    \ mean that its availability is unlimited. In \nfact, freshwater is also a finite\
    \ resource (Hoekstra, 2013). Over a certain period, there \nfalls a certain amount\
    \ of precipitation. This limits both blue and green water availability \nin time.\
    \ Human society cannot appropriate more water than is available. The finiteness\
    \ \nof freshwater, in combination with the various competing demands for water,\
    \ makes \nwater a scarce resource. \nWater scarcity is becoming increasingly important\
    \ for multiple reasons. The growing \nworld population leads to rising demands\
    \ for food, energy and other water-consuming \ngoods and services (Hejazi et al.,\
    \ 2014; WWAP, 2015). Moreover, people’s diets are \nchanging toward more livestock-based\
    \ products, due to rising incomes and continuing \nurbanization (Molden, 2007).\
    \ Such diets are more water and land intensive (Erb et al., \n2009; Kastner et\
    \ al., 2012; Odegard & van der Voet, 2014). Policies towards more energy \nproduction\
    \ from biomass create additional pressure on water and land (Hejazi et al., \n\
    2014). Additionally, a changing climate with increased variability and more extremes\
    \ \n(IPCC, 2013) amplifies water scarcity (WWAP, 2014). \nGiven that green and\
    \ blue water resources are limited and there are competing demands \nfor both,\
    \ green water as well as blue water are scarce. Therefore, it is surprising that\
    \ \nresearch and debate on water scarcity have been, and still are, mainly focussed\
    \ on blue \nwater (Vörösmarty et al., 2000; Rijsberman, 2006; Vörösmarty et al.,\
    \ 2010; Wada et al., \n2011; Hoekstra et al., 2012; WWAP, 2014, 2015). Although\
    \ the importance of green water \nhas increasingly gained acceptance since Falkenmark\
    \ (1995) drew attention to it in the \nmid-1990s (Savenije, 2000; Rockström, 2001;\
    \ Rijsberman, 2006; Liu et al., 2009; Hanasaki \net al., 2010; Hoekstra & Mekonnen,\
    \ 2012), the notion of green water scarcity is addressed \nin the literature to\
    \ a limited extent (Falkenmark et al., 2007; Falkenmark, 2013a,b). While \nthe\
    \ need to incorporate green water in water scarcity indicators and assessments\
    \ has \nalready been expressed since the beginning of this millennium (Savenije,\
    \ 2000; \nRockström, 2001; Rijsberman, 2006; Falkenmark & Rockström, 2006), only\
    \ a few attempts \nhave been made so far in the form of combined green–blue water\
    \ scarcity assessments \n65 \n(Rockström et al., 2009; Gerten et al., 2011; Kummu\
    \ et al., 2014) (discussed in detail in \nSection 4.3.2). \nGreen water scarcity\
    \ refers to the competition over limited green water resources and \nallocation\
    \ over competing demands. This allocation occurs mostly implicitly and \nindirectly,\
    \ since generally it is land that is been allocated to a certain use. This \n\
    indirectness of allocation, together with the absence of a price, makes green\
    \ water \nscarcity invisible in our economy. This does not mean, though, that\
    \ green water \nresources are not scarce, since using green water for one purpose\
    \ makes it unavailable \nfor another purpose. We need to measure how scarce green\
    \ water is in order to answer \nquestions like following: Can we produce enough\
    \ food, feed, fibres, bioenergy and \nforestry products with limited availability\
    \ of water resources and suitable land? How \ncan we do so without compromising\
    \ natural ecosystems and other sectors that put a \nclaim on water and land resources?\
    \ For studying these crucial questions, a sole \nassessment of blue water scarcity\
    \ is insufficient. \nTherefore, it is due time that more attention is given to\
    \ green water scarcity and how we \ncan measure it. In this review, we make an\
    \ inventory of existing indicators of green \nwater availability and scarcity,\
    \ and classify them based on their scope and purpose of \nmeasurement. The classification\
    \ allows us to discuss similarities and differences between \nindicators and give\
    \ advice on how the various indicator classes could be used to \nmeasure different\
    \ kinds of green water availability or scarcity. This is useful in order to \n\
    properly include limitations in green water availability in water scarcity assessments.\
    \ \nA review of green water scarcity indicators is new in its kind. Past reviews\
    \ of water \nscarcity indicators (Savenije, 2000; Rijsberman, 2006) date back\
    \ a while and hence do not \ninclude recent developments in the field, especially\
    \ those related to the inclusion of \ngreen water. There exist multiple reviews\
    \ of indicators of aridity (Wallén, 1967; Walton, \n1969; Stadler, 2005) and drought\
    \ (World Meteorological Organization, 1975; Wilhite & \nGlantz, 1985; Maracchi,\
    \ 2000; Tate & Gustard, 2000; Keyantash & Dracup, 2002; Heim, \n2002; Hayes, 2007;\
    \ Kallis, 2008; Mishra & Singh, 2010; Sivakumar et al., 2010). We classify \n\
    and discuss these indicators in an overarching way. First, we discuss the multiple\
    \ \ndimensions of water availability and scarcity, and sharpen the scope of this\
    \ review \n(Section 4.2). Next, we classify and review green water availability\
    \ and scarcity \nindicators (Section 4.3). Finally, we draw conclusions and discuss\
    \ future research \ndirections (Section 4.4). \n66 \n4.2. Multiple Aspects of\
    \ Water Availability and Scarcity \nThe concepts of water availability and scarcity\
    \ are examined in Sections 4.2.1 to 4.2.4. We \nwill reflect on these concepts\
    \ in broad terms, not yet focussing on green water. In Section \n4.2.5, we detail\
    \ the scope of the indicators discussed in this paper. \n4.2.1. Water Availability\
    \ and Scarcity \nA straightforward definition of water scarcity is: “an excess\
    \ of water demand over \navailable supply” (FAO, 2012b). Various other definitions\
    \ of water scarcity exist that aim \nto be more inclusive. \n“An imbalance between\
    \ supply and demand of freshwater in a specified domain \n(country, region, catchment,\
    \ river basin, etc.) as a result of a high rate of demand \ncompared with available\
    \ supply, under prevailing institutional arrangements (including \nprice) and\
    \ infrastructural conditions.” (FAO, 2015a) \n“When an individual does not have\
    \ access to safe and affordable water to satisfy her or \nhis needs for drinking,\
    \ washing or their livelihoods we call that person water insecure. \nWhen a large\
    \ number of people in an area are water insecure for a significant period of \n\
    time, then we can call that area water scarce” (Rijsberman, 2006) \nConsidering\
    \ these definitions, we can conclude that water scarcity is not something that\
    \ \nis experienced by a single person at a particular moment (day or week). Rather,\
    \ it is \nexperienced by a larger community within a certain geographic area (e.g.\
    \ catchment or \ncountry) and relates to larger timescales (months or years).\
    \ \nThe concept of scarcity describes a relation between humans and nature (Baumgärtner\
    \ et \nal., 2006). Nevertheless, we can distinguish water scarcity mainly caused\
    \ by natural \nconditions of low water availability from scarcity mainly induced\
    \ by a large human \ndemand relative to natural availability. The latter can also\
    \ occur in naturally water-\nabundant areas (Pereira et al., 2002). \nUntil now\
    \ we have spoken about physical water scarcity, referring to the situation where\
    \ \nthere is insufficient water to meet human demand. If human, institutional\
    \ and financial \ncapital limit access to water, the term economic water scarcity\
    \ applies (Seckler et al., \n1999; Molden, 2007). In a broader sense, Ohlsson\
    \ (2000) defines social resource scarcity \nas the situation in which social resources\
    \ required to successfully adapt to physical \nwater scarcity fall short. \n67\
    \ \n4.2.2. Relative and Absolute Water Scarcity \nAccording to economic theory,\
    \ water is a scarce good because it carries opportunity \ncosts, which are the\
    \ benefits foregone from possible alternative uses of the water (FAO, \n2004).\
    \ This is a form of “relative scarcity” based on the assumption of substitutability\
    \ of \ngoods (Baumgärtner et al., 2006). Water can be scarce in the relative sense\
    \ also in water-\nabundant areas, because allocating water to purpose A implies\
    \ it cannot be allocated to \npurpose B. In other words, water for purpose A is\
    \ scarce in relation to water for other \npurposes. In common language we are\
    \ inclined to say that sometimes water is scarce \nand at other times it is not.\
    \ In economic sense, water is always scarce; the degree of \nwater scarcity can\
    \ vary though, and it can even be zero if alternative uses and thus \ncompetition\
    \ is absent. \nWe speak of “absolute scarcity” when according to Baumgärtner et\
    \ al. (2006) “scarcity \nconcerns a non-substitutable means for satisfaction of\
    \ an elementary need and cannot be \nlevied by additional production”. This means\
    \ that in an area with a limited amount of \nwater resources (that cannot be increased),\
    \ at a certain level of consumption, water for \nelementary purposes (e.g. drinking\
    \ and food production) will no longer be substitutable \nwith water used for less\
    \ essential purposes. In this case, there is absolute scarcity of \nwater. Whether\
    \ water is scarce in the absolute or relative sense thus depends on the \ndegree\
    \ of water scarcity: relative water scarcity turns into absolute scarcity when\
    \ the \nboundaries of water exploitation are approached. \n4.2.3. Blue and Green\
    \ Water \nFreshwater essentially stems from precipitation, which partitions into\
    \ green and blue \nwater (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2006; Falkenmark & Rockström,\
    \ 2010). As discussed in \nthe introduction of this paper, water availability\
    \ and scarcity can pertain to both blue or \ngreen water resources, separately\
    \ or in combination (Falkenmark, 2013a). \nIn contrast to the clear definition\
    \ of blue water, various definitions of green water exist, \ndefining it as an\
    \ inflow (precipitation), a stock (rainwater in the soil) or an outflow \n(evaporation\
    \ of rainwater). Often, the term green water is used to refer to “rainwater \n\
    stored in the soil” or more specifically plant-available soil moisture in the\
    \ unsaturated \nzone (Falkenmark et al., 2007; Falkenmark, 2013a); in this context\
    \ the term green water is \ninterpreted as a stock. Commonly, the distinction\
    \ is made between green water stock \nand green water flow (Falkenmark & Rockström,\
    \ 2006; Falkenmark & Rockström, 2010). \nThe latter is an outflow, usually defined\
    \ as actual evaporation over land (referring to the \nentire land-atmosphere vapour\
    \ flux; see comment in the introduction), but it has also \n68 \nbeen defined\
    \ as transpiration only (Savenije, 2000). Furthermore, some authors include \n\
    precipitation (i.e. an inflow) in the definition of green water (Weiskel et al.,\
    \ 2014). The \nlatter is in contrast with the definition of Falkenmark & Rockström\
    \ (2006) (adhered to in \nthis paper) that precipitation is the undifferentiated\
    \ freshwater resource. Scholars who \nhave tried to quantify green water availability\
    \ in water scarcity assessments defined it as \nthe actual evaporation flux over\
    \ land to the atmosphere (Rockström et al., 2009; Gerten et \nal., 2011; Kummu\
    \ et al., 2014) (Section 4.3). \nWhile not always made explicit in definitions,\
    \ an accurate description of the green water \nstorage and flow excludes the part\
    \ of the storage and vapour flow that originates from \nblue water resources,\
    \ which have been redirected to the soil moisture stock by means of \nirrigation,\
    \ capillary rise or natural flooding (Hoekstra et al., 2011). In such cases, the\
    \ \ngreen and blue contributions to the soil moisture can be tracked with a model-based\
    \ \nwater balance approach (see Chukalla et al. (2015)). \n4.2.4. Water Quantity\
    \ and Quality \nWater scarcity is not only a function of the quantity of the water\
    \ resource in relation to \nthe demand, but also the quality of the resource in\
    \ relation to the required quality for its \nend purpose (Pereira et al., 2002).\
    \ If there is sufficient water available for a certain \npurpose, but it is polluted\
    \ to such an extent that it is not usable for that purpose, then \nwater can be\
    \ considered scarce as long as the means are not available for cleaning the \n\
    water to a desirable level. Pollution of water resources can thus aggravate water\
    \ scarcity \n(FAO, 2012b). \nWater quality in the case of green water differs\
    \ from that of blue water. The quality of \ngreen water depends on soil properties\
    \ such as nutrient availability, nutrient retention \ncapacity and the presence\
    \ of salts and toxic substances. However, close ties with blue \nwater quality\
    \ do exist. For example, blue water used for irrigation can increase soil \nsalinity\
    \ when the water is brackish or saline and it can also flush out excess nutrients\
    \ \nand other substances. \n4.2.5. Scope of the Review and Classification \nThis\
    \ paper focuses on green water, water quantity and physical water scarcity and\
    \ treats \nof both green water availability and scarcity. In the next section,\
    \ we consider indicators \nwithin this scope, including indicators of aridity,\
    \ agricultural, meteorological and \nvegetation drought, soil moisture availability\
    \ and overall green–blue water scarcity. The \nfocus of this paper implies that\
    \ several concepts and indicators fall outside the scope of \n69 \nthe classification..\
    \ The concepts and indicators focussing on blue water that are outside \nthe scope\
    \ of this paper are the following: \n\x83 \nHydrological drought: concerns the\
    \ effects of dry periods on surface and \nsubsurface flows and stocks and is therefore\
    \ related to blue water. Examples of \nassociated indicators are surface water\
    \ supply index (Shafer & Dezman, 1982); \nPalmer Hydrological Drought Index (Karl,\
    \ 1986); several indicators reviewed \nby Smakhtin (2001). \n\x83 \nBlue water\
    \ scarcity: measures demand for blue water resources versus blue \nwater availability\
    \ and is thus purely related to blue water. Examples of \nassociated indicators\
    \ are the water crowding indicator (Falkenmark et al., 1989), \nthe withdrawal-to-discharge\
    \ ratio (Vörösmarty et al., 2000), water poverty \nindex (Sullivan et al., 2003),\
    \ water stress indicator (Smakhtin et al., 2004), water \nstress index (Pfister\
    \ et al., 2009), dynamic water stress index (Wada et al., 2011) \nand blue water\
    \ scarcity (Hoekstra et al., 2012). Note that some of these \nindicators also\
    \ incorporate more than only physical elements of water scarcity \n(e.g. water\
    \ poverty index). \nThe concepts related to broader forms of water scarcity than\
    \ physical water scarcity that \nare outside the scope of this paper are the following:\
    \ \n\x83 \nSocio-economic drought: concerns imbalances in supply and demand of\
    \ \neconomic goods due to the physical characteristics of drought (Wilhite & \n\
    Glantz, 1985; American Meteorological Society, 2013) with effects on the \neconomy\
    \ and society. The American Meteorological Society (2013) mentions the \nfollowing\
    \ effects: loss of income from lower crop yields, reduced spending in \nrural\
    \ communities, health issues and mass migration. \n\x83 \nSocial resource scarcity:\
    \ see Section 4.2.1. \nFurthermore, the review and classification in this paper\
    \ excludes indicators that measure \ndrought by combining multiple drought indicators\
    \ (classified individually) and \nsometimes other information such as land use\
    \ maps. Examples of such indicators are the \nUS Drought Monitor (Svoboda et al.,\
    \ 2002) and the Vegetation Drought Response Index \n(Brown et al., 2008). \n4.3.\
    \ Green Water availability and Scarcity Indicators \nWe have identified around\
    \ 80 indicators of green water availability and scarcity, which \nwe classify\
    \ into the following categories: \n70 \n1. \nGreen water availability indicators\
    \ show whether green water availability is \nlow or high and are insensitive to\
    \ actual water demand. In other words, when \nthe water demand increases, indicator\
    \ values will not reflect this. Within this \ncategory we distinguish absolute\
    \ and relative green water availability indicators: \na. \nAbsolute green water\
    \ availability indicators measure actual conditions \nof green water availability\
    \ (in an absolute sense). \nb. \nRelative green water availability indicators\
    \ measure actual conditions \nof green water availability compared to conditions\
    \ that are perceived \nas normal, which is often defined as the climate-average\
    \ or median \nvalue of the variable of interest. \nNote that this distinction\
    \ between absolute and relative indicators is unrelated to and \ndifferent from\
    \ the concepts of relative and absolute scarcity earlier discussed in Section\
    \ \n4.2.2. \n2. \nGreen water scarcity indicators incorporate elements of both\
    \ water availability \nand demand and therefore respond – in contrast to green\
    \ water availability \nindicators – to changes in water demand as well. We distinguish\
    \ three different \noptions to measure green water scarcity conceptually (explanation\
    \ in Section \n4.3.2): \na. \ngreen water crowding; \nb. \ngreen water requirements\
    \ for self-sufficiency versus green water \navailability; \nc. \nactual green\
    \ water consumption versus green water availability. \nThe term green water availability\
    \ is basically used in two different ways. When we \nspeak of green water availability\
    \ indicators (Section 4.3.1), we refer to indicators that \nmeasure the availability\
    \ of green water in one way or another, without considering \navailability in\
    \ relation to an actual demand for green water. This is in contrast with \ngreen\
    \ water scarcity indicators that always compare demand to availability. In the\
    \ case \nof green water scarcity indicators, the term green water availability\
    \ specifically refers to \nthe part of the green water flow available for biomass\
    \ production for human purposes \n(Section 4.3.2). Also the term demand occurs\
    \ in two different contexts. When we speak of \ndemand in the context of green\
    \ water scarcity, we refer to the demand for green water, \nassociated with the\
    \ production of biomass for human purposes. \n \n \n71 \nTable 4-1. Overview of\

    \ categories and the factors that influence \nthem. \nIn the discussion of agricultural\
    \ drought indicators in Section 4.3.1, the term crop \nmoisture/evaporation/water\
    \ demand is used to refer to the water needs of the crop for \nnon-water limited\
    \ growth. \nThe indicator categories will be discussed in the following sections.\
    \ Table 4-1 provides \nan overview of the categories and summarizes what they\
    \ measure, which human factors \ndirectly influence them and what they are used\
    \ for. Furthermore, the conceptual \ndiagram in Figure 4-1 displays the indicator\
    \ categories and the factors that influence \nthem. \n4.3.1. Green Water Availability\
    \ Indicators \nIndicators of green water availability fall apart in indicators\
    \ that measure availability in \nan absolute sense or in terms of relative to\
    \ normal conditions. These two categories are \ntreated in the next two subsections.\
    \ Descriptions of various specific green water \navailability indicators that\
    \ fall in the two categories are included in Appendices B.1 And \nB.2. The indicator\
    \ abbreviations used in this section are defined in these appendices. \n76 \n\
    4.3.1.1. Absolute Green Water Availability Indicators \nIndicators in this category\
    \ measure green water availability in a certain area (or location) \nand period\
    \ (or moment) in an absolute sense. We find here indicators of aridity, \nagricultural\
    \ drought, soil moisture and agricultural suitability, which are subsequently\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following. Aridity are purely climatic, while the others\
    \ are also \ninfluenced by the characteristics and management of the soil and\
    \ vegetation. \nAridity Indicators \nAridity is seen as a permanent feature of\
    \ a climate, consisting of low average annual \nprecipitation and/or high evaporation\
    \ rates, often resulting in low soil moisture \navailability (Pereira et al.,\
    \ 2002; Heim, 2002; Kallis, 2008). As such, one can say that an \naridity map\
    \ shows the preconditions for vegetation (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2004). \nAridity\
    \ indicators are usually based on long-term average annual comparisons of \nprecipitation\
    \ versus potential evaporation, temperature or atmospheric saturation \ndeficit,\
    \ whereby the latter two were often used in the twentieth century as proxies for\
    \ \npotential evaporation due to lack of data. They have been used for the classification\
    \ of \nclimates, specifically the characterization of (semi-)arid zones. Some\
    \ more recently \ndeveloped aridity indicators compare the actual rather than\
    \ potential evaporation rate \nwith precipitation (ER, HU-ER). These indicators\
    \ reflect the actual availability of water at \na given location (also from lateral\
    \ fluxes) for meeting the evaporative demand of the \natmosphere. \nThe SCMD by\
    \ Wilhelmi et al. (2002) is somewhat different than the classical aridity \nindicators.\
    \ It shows the probability of seasonal crop moisture deficiency based on a \n\
    combination of long-term precipitation records and area-weighted evaporation of\
    \ the \nmixture of crops grown in the study area. Wilhelmi & Wilhite (2002) apply\
    \ the SCMD to \nassess agricultural drought vulnerability in Nebraska. We classify\
    \ the SCMD here under \nthe aridity indicators, because like most aridity indicators,\
    \ it measures precipitation \nversus evaporation and is calculated for a historical\
    \ time period, thus representing a \nlong-term average. \nAgricultural Drought\
    \ Indicators \nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization (1975), agricultural\
    \ drought \nindicators “indirectly express the degree to which growing plants\
    \ have been adversely \naffected by an abnormal moisture deficiency”, which may\
    \ be the result of an unusually \nsmall moisture supply or an unusually large\
    \ moisture demand (World Meteorological \nOrganization, 1975). Formulated differently\
    \ by Sivakumar (2010): “Agricultural drought \n77 \ndepends on the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ demand and the soil moisture availability to \nmeet this demand.” \nTherefore,\
    \ the bulk of agricultural drought indicators measures crop-available water \n\
    compared to crop water needs for non-water limited growth (i.e. potential evaporation)\
    \ \nand are usually applied on a daily, weekly, monthly or seasonal basis (Woli\
    \ et al., 2012). \nSome indicators measure the plant water deficit more specifically\
    \ by looking at the \ndifference between actual and potential transpiration (e.g.\
    \ DTx and WDI). Agricultural \ndrought indicators can be influenced by soil management\
    \ that affects the rates of \ninfiltration and percolation and thus the water\
    \ available to the crop. \nDrought is typically a relative-to-normal phenomenon\
    \ as will be discussed in Section \n4.3.1.2. Agricultural drought indicators,\
    \ which measure actual relative to potential \nevaporation, are relative indicators\
    \ in another way, though. They do not compare actual \nwith normal conditions.\
    \ Instead, they compare moisture supply with a crop water \ndemand in the ideal\
    \ case of non-water limited growth. Therefore these indicators \nactually measure\
    \ absolute green water availability (actual evaporation), set against this \n\
    crop water demand. In fact, these indicators say more about the demand for blue\
    \ water \n(irrigation) to ensure non-water limited crop growth than they do about\
    \ green water \navailability. Some indicators do somehow compare the actual to\
    \ potential evaporation \nratio with a multi-year average (or median) of this\
    \ ratio and are thus in essence relative \nindicators according to our classification.\
    \ Examples are the CMI, DSI and GrWSI and \nanomalies of the ESI and WS. Nevertheless,\
    \ they are classified as agricultural drought \nindicators because they, like\
    \ most of the others, measure actual to potential evaporation.. \nA note is required\
    \ on the GWSI by Nunez et al. (2013) of which the name suggests that it \nis a\
    \ green water scarcity indicator. Nevertheless, we classify it as an agricultural\
    \ drought \nindicator, because it measures actual moisture supply versus crop-specific\
    \ reference \nevaporation, albeit on a larger timescale (3-year crop rotation)\
    \ than most other \nagricultural drought indicators. \nAbsolute Soil Moisture\
    \ Indicators \nMultiple indicators provide a measure of the absolute amount of\
    \ soil moisture available \nat a given location and moment (or summed over a period),\
    \ be it on the basis of field \nmeasurements (e.g. SMIX, SMI) and/or modelling\
    \ of the soil water balance (e.g. Avg-\nGWS and SD-GWS) or remote sensing data\
    \ (e.g. TVDI, MPDI). They can be used for \nmonitoring spatial and/or temporal\
    \ variations in soil moisture availability. Temporal \nanalysis of soil moisture\
    \ availability can warn for the onset of agricultural drought, or in \n78 \ncontrast,\
    \ the proneness to flash floods (Hunt et al., 2009). Several of these indicators\
    \ have \nbeen introduced and applied as indicators of agricultural drought (e.g.\
    \ ADD, SMDI, \nSMIX, SMI), analysing the correlation between soil moisture availability\
    \ and crop yields. \nTherefore, they are typically calculated on intra-annual\
    \ timescales. \nIt should be noted that the soil moisture can partially be blue\
    \ – also under rain-fed \nconditions – due to capillary rise or natural flooding\
    \ (Section 4.2.3). This note also \napplies to the other indicators that are not\
    \ purely based on climatic factors (Figure 4-1). \nAgricultural Suitability under\
    \ Rain-fed Conditions \nMaps that classify land according to agricultural suitability\
    \ under rain-fed conditions \n(green water only) are indirect measures of green\
    \ water availability in the absolute \nsense. Up to date, two global studies have\
    \ made such land suitability classifications for \nrain-fed crop production for\
    \ climate-average temperature and precipitation conditions \nand taking into account\
    \ crop characteristics, various soil parameters and terrain slope: \nGAEZ (IIASA/FAO,\
    \ 2012) and GLUES (Zabel et al., 2014). The GAEZ study additionally \nconsiders\
    \ various levels of agricultural input/management. Both studies classify lands\
    \ as \nnot suitable, marginally suitable, moderately suitable or highly suitable.\
    \ This \nclassification shows where the climate, soil and topographic conditions\
    \ are more or less \nsuitable for agricultural production with green water only.\
    \ In other words, where aridity \nmaps show the preconditions for vegetation in\
    \ general (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2004), \nthese maps show the preconditions\
    \ for rain-fed crop production, therein considering \ncrop, soil and terrain parameters\
    \ in addition to climate. \n4.3.1.2. Relative Green Water Availability Indicators\
    \ \nIndicators in this category measure green water availability relative to a\
    \ normal \ncondition and are usually calculated on intra-annual scales. As opposed\
    \ to aridity, \ndrought is often defined as a condition relative to what is perceived\
    \ as a normal amount \nof precipitation or balance between precipitation and evaporation\
    \ (World Meteorological \nOrganization, 1975; Wilhite & Glantz, 1985). Droughts\
    \ are often termed temporary, \nuncertain and difficult to predict features characterized\
    \ by lower-than-average \nprecipitation (Pereira et al., 2002; Heim, 2002; Kallis,\
    \ 2008; Mishra & Singh, 2010; FAO, \n2015a). Therefore, indicators of meteorological\
    \ drought and vegetation drought are \nclassified into the category of relative\
    \ green water availability indicators. Indicators that \nmeasure soil moisture\
    \ in a relative sense are included in this category as well. Just like \naridity\
    \ indicators, meteorological drought indicators are solely based on climatic \n\
    variables. The other two subcategories are also affected by the soil and vegetation\
    \ and \n79 \nhow they are managed. The three subcategories are sequentially discussed\
    \ in the \nfollowing. \nMeteorological Drought Indicators \nMeteorological drought\
    \ indicators fall apart in indicators that are solely based on \nprecipitation\
    \ (e.g. SPI) and those that consider both precipitation and potential \nevaporation\
    \ (e.g. PDSI, RDI, SPEI). These indicators show whether there is relatively \n\
    little precipitation or whether the normal balance between precipitation and evaporation\
    \ \nis distorted. Unlike aridity indicators, which are generally based on long-term\
    \ annual \naverages reflecting climate, these indicators capture variations in\
    \ the weather. They are \napplied for monitoring the intensity, duration and spatial\
    \ extent of droughts and \ndetermining drought severity based on these characteristics.\
    \ This is useful for \nrecognizing droughts and comparing them with past drought,\
    \ which serves as a basis \nfor early warning systems and decision-support tools.\
    \ \nVegetation Drought Indicators \nVegetation drought indicators show the drought\
    \ impact on vegetation by measuring the \nweather-related variations in greenness\
    \ of vegetation. They reflect whether vegetation \ngreenness is deviating from\
    \ regular conditions. They can be used for studying the \ncorrelation between\
    \ vegetation health and soil moisture availability, thermal conditions \nand crop\
    \ yields (Kogan, 2001). Since the vegetation drought indicators we have \nidentified\
    \ are all based on remote sensing observations, the indicators do not directly\
    \ \nshow whether deviations are caused by relatively dry weather (i.e. meteorological\
    \ \ndrought) or by other factors influencing vegetation growth (e.g. plant diseases\
    \ or human \ninterference such as pruning and clearing). Satellite-based vegetation\
    \ drought indicators \nrespond to subtle changes in vegetation canopy, which makes\
    \ them suitable for early \ndrought detection (Kogan, 2001). \nRelative Soil Moisture\
    \ Indicators \nIn contrast to the absolute soil moisture indicators discussed\
    \ in Section 4.3.1.1, these \nindicators measure the moisture conditions at a\
    \ given location relative to a normal \ncondition. Identified examples are the\
    \ PZI, SMAI and SD. These indicators have similar \nuses as absolute soil moisture\
    \ indicators. They are also used to correlate soil moisture \nconditions to crop\
    \ yields and are considered suitable for measuring agricultural \ndroughts (Keyantash\
    \ & Dracup, 2002; Narasimhan & Srinivasan, 2005). \n80 \n4.3.2. Green Water Scarcity\
    \ Indicators \nAs put forward in Section 4.2, water scarcity pertains to a situation\
    \ with a high water \ndemand compared to water availability, which is experienced\
    \ by a community \n(numerous people) within a certain geographic area (e.g. catchment\
    \ or country) over a \nsignificant period of time (months or years). We can then\
    \ define green water scarcity as \nthe degree of competition over limited green\
    \ water resources, whereby the demand for \ngreen water resources to sustain the\
    \ production of a desirable level of biomass-based \nproducts within a certain\
    \ geographic area is somehow compared to the available green \nwater resources\
    \ in space and time. \nSince production of biomass-based products (food, fibres,\
    \ biofuels, timber) generally \ntakes place in cycles of 1 year (or more in case\
    \ of perennials and forestry), this definition \nof green water scarcity incorporates\
    \ the significant-period-of-time element in the \nimbalance between green water\
    \ demand and availability. Furthermore, limited \nproduction of biomass-based\
    \ products affects numerous people, both producers and \nconsumers. \nAs opposed\
    \ to the indicators discussed in Section 4.3.1, indicators of green water scarcity\
    \ \nthus need to include a measure of green water demand, associated with the\
    \ production \nof biomass for human purposes, compared to green water availability.\
    \ In other words, \nthey should measure the green water demand related to crop\
    \ production, grazing lands \nand forestry in relation to green water availability.\
    \ Note that the term green water \navailability here refers to the part of the\
    \ green water flow available for biomass \nproduction for human purposes (in space\
    \ and time); it thus excludes green water flows \nthat are effectively unavailable,\
    \ for instance green water flows in unsuitable areas (e.g. \nbecause of steep\
    \ slopes) or green water flows in cold parts of the year unsuitable for \ngrowth.\
    \ \nWe distinguish three different options to measure green water scarcity conceptually:\
    \ \n1. \nGreen water crowding: per capita available green water resources in an\
    \ area \ncompared to a global average threshold representing the amount of green\
    \ water \nrequired to sustain a person’s standard consumption pattern of biomass-based\
    \ \nproducts; \n2. \nGreen water requirements for self-sufficiency versus green\
    \ water availability: \ngreen water requirements for producing the consumed biomass-based\
    \ products \nwithin a certain geographic area, assuming self-sufficiency within\
    \ the \ngeographic area, compared to the green water resources in the geographic\
    \ area; \n81 \n3. \nActual green consumption versus green water availability:\
    \ actual green water \nconsumption in a certain geographic area (associated with\
    \ the actual \nproduction of biomass for human purposes) compared to green water\
    \ \navailability in the area. This type of indicator thus acknowledges the possibility\
    \ \nof virtual water trade as opposed to assuming self-sufficiency as in the previous\
    \ \ntwo types of indicators. \nIn Sections 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2, we discuss existing\
    \ indicators that measure overall green-\nblue water scarcity and reflect on how\
    \ these indicators could be adapted to measure \ngreen water scarcity specifically,\
    \ according to above-mentioned options (1) and (2). In \nSection 4.3.2.3, we elaborate\
    \ upon a third way of measuring green water scarcity that has \nyet to be brought\
    \ into practice. The challenges for operationalization of these green \nwater\
    \ scarcity indicators are discussed in Section 4.3.2.4. Finally, in Section 4.3.2.5\
    \ we \nreflect on green water scarcity indicators versus indicators that measure\
    \ overall green-\nblue water scarcity. \n4.3.2.1. Green Water Crowding \nRockström\
    \ et al. (2009) introduced a combined green-blue water shortage index, which \n\
    compares the sum of green and blue water availability with a global average threshold\
    \ \nof 1,300 m3/cap/yr. This threshold represents the green and blue water requirements\
    \ for \nsustaining a global average standard diet. When green-blue water availability\
    \ drops \nbelow the threshold, this indicates a shortage of green-blue water resources\
    \ in the study \narea and reflects the area’s dependency on external water resources.\
    \ The green-blue \nwater shortage index is an indicator of water crowding, similar\
    \ to Falkenmark’s blue-\nwater-focussed water crowding indicator (Falkenmark et\
    \ al., 1989). \nSimilar to the indicator by Rockström et al. (2009), an indicator\
    \ of green water crowding \ncould be defined as the per capita available green\
    \ water resources in an area compared \nto a global average threshold representing\
    \ the amount of green water required to sustain \na person’s standard consumption\
    \ pattern. We intentionally speak here of a consumption \npattern, because green\
    \ water is required not only to produce food, but also to produce \nother biomass-based\
    \ products humans consume, such as fibres, biofuels and forestry \nproducts. As\
    \ such, the measure of green water requirements we propose here is broader \n\
    than the definition of a standard diet according to Rockström et al. (2009) (and\
    \ Gerten et \nal. (2011) and Kummu et al. (2014)), which only pertains to water\
    \ requirements for food \nproduction. \n82 \nRockström et al. (2009) define green\
    \ water availability as “the soil moisture available for \nproductive vapour flows\
    \ from agricultural land”. Technically, they calculate green water \navailability\
    \ as actual evaporation from existing cropland and permanent pasture, \nreduced\
    \ by a factor 0.85 that accounts for minimum evaporation losses that are \nunavoidable\
    \ in agricultural systems (Rockström et al., 2009). This definition is dependent\
    \ \non the extent of agricultural land and excludes available green water on lands\
    \ that are \ncurrently uncultivated, but have potential to be used productively\
    \ in a sustainable \nmanner. \n4.3.2.2. Green Water Requirements for Self-sufficiency\
    \ versus Green Water Availability \nGerten et al. (2011) and Kummu et al. (2014)\
    \ elaborated on the work by Rockström et al. \n(2009) by further developing and\
    \ applying the overall green-blue water scarcity \nindicator. Instead of using\
    \ a global average, Gerten et al. (2011) calculate the green-blue \nwater requirements\
    \ for sustaining a standard diet on the national level based on local \ncrop water\
    \ productivities and compare this with the sum of green and blue availability\
    \ \nin each country of the world. The resulting green-blue water scarcity indicator,\
    \ \ncomputed for each country, is defined as the ratio between green-blue water\
    \ availability \nand green-blue water requirements for producing the standard\
    \ diet. They define green \nwater availability similar to Rockström et al. (2009),\
    \ but a bit more conservative: they do \nnot assume year-round evaporation from\
    \ areas covered with their category of other \ncrops that they parameterized as\
    \ perennial grass, since this category includes non-food \ncrops and crops that\
    \ grow only during a part of the year (Gerten et al., 2011). \nWhereas the studies\
    \ by Rockström et al. (2009) and Gerten et al. (2011) are based on \nclimate-averages,\
    \ Kummu et al. (2014) apply the green-blue water scarcity indicator by \nGerten\
    \ et al. (2011) on a year-by-year basis to account for inter-annual climate variability\
    \ \non the scale of food producing units, the scale at which demand for water\
    \ and food is \nassumed to be managed according to the authors. Kummu et al. (2014)\
    \ measure the \nfrequency of years in which green-blue water availability falls\
    \ short of green-blue water \nrequirements, on which they base their classification\
    \ of green-blue scarcity: no scarcity, \noccasional scarcity (subdivided in four\
    \ levels) or chronic scarcity. \nThe green-blue water scarcity indicator shows\
    \ the potential of a geographic area (e.g. \ncountry or food producing unit) to\
    \ reach food self-sufficiency and reflects its \ndependency on trade in agricultural\
    \ commodities and associated virtual water (Kummu \net al., 2014). A similar indicator\
    \ for green water could show an area’s green water \ndemand (for self-sufficiency\
    \ in biomass-based products, for sustaining the standard \n83 \nconsumption pattern)\
    \ compared to green water availability in the area. It would also \nreflect an\
    \ area’s dependency on internal blue water resources and virtual water trade.\
    \ \nFor the potential green water scarcity indicators discussed in Sections 4.3.2.1\
    \ and 4.3.2.2, \na more comprehensive definition of green water availability is\
    \ advised than the one \napplied by Rockström et al. (2009), Gerten et al. (2011)\
    \ and Kummu et al. (2014). An \nexample of a more comprehensive definition is\
    \ discussed in the following section. \n4.3.2.3. Actual Green Water Consumption\
    \ versus Green Water Availability \nThe green water scarcity indicator by Hoekstra\
    \ et al. (2011) compares the actual green \nwater consumption in an area associated\
    \ with the actual biomass production pattern \n(hence considering virtual water\
    \ trade as opposed to assuming self-sufficiency) with \ngreen water availability\
    \ in the area. Green water scarcity is defined as the ratio of the \ntotal green\
    \ water footprint in a catchment in a period (e.g. a year) over green water \n\
    availability. \nThe sum of green water footprints equals all actual evaporation\
    \ (Eact) related to biomass \nproduction for human purposes (i.e. agriculture\
    \ and forestry) excluding the part of the \nvapour flow that originates from blue\
    \ water resources (irrigation). Note that for cases \nwhere land use is partly\
    \ natural and partly for human production (e.g. a semi-natural \nproduction forest),\
    \ the green water demand related to human production would need to \nbe expressed\
    \ as a fraction of the total green water flow. Methods to do so for a \nproduction\
    \ forest are discussed by Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012). Green water availability\
    \ \nis defined as total Eact over the catchment minus Eact from land reserved\
    \ for natural \nvegetation (so-called environmental green water requirement) and\
    \ minus Eact from land \nthat cannot be made productive, e.g. in areas or periods\
    \ of the year that are unsuitable \nfor crop growth (Hoekstra et al., 2011). In\
    \ fact, green water availability defined like this, \nrepresents the maximum sustainable\
    \ green water footprint in the catchment and period \nunder consideration. Hence,\
    \ the green water scarcity ratio shows the extent to which the \ngreen water footprint\
    \ has reached its maximum sustainable level. Of course, this \ndefinition can\
    \ also be applied to other geographical units than a catchment. \nThe definition\
    \ of green water availability by Hoekstra et al. (2011) is more \ncomprehensive\
    \ than the one used by Rockström et al. (2009), Gerten et al. (2011) and \nKummu\
    \ et al. (2014). However, this is also the reason why the indicator has not been\
    \ \nmade operational yet. Difficulties remain in estimating the amount of land\
    \ that needs to \nbe reserved for nature and when and where the green water flow\
    \ cannot be made \n84 \nproductive (Hoekstra et al., 2011). These challenges are\
    \ discussed in the following \nsection. \nFurthermore, the indicator does not\
    \ deal with green water scarcity at a particular site as \nlooked upon by Falkenmark\
    \ et al. (2007) and Falkenmark (2013a). They describe green \nwater scarcity as\
    \ an issue of lower-than-potential plant-accessible water in the root zone \n\
    and the occurrence of unproductive evaporation losses from the field, which results\
    \ in \nlower yields than potentially achievable. First, blue water losses in the\
    \ form of surface \nrun-off and percolation decrease the plant-accessible water\
    \ in the root zone (smaller \ngreen water flow) (Rockström & Falkenmark, 2000).\
    \ Such losses are the result of a soil’s \nlow infiltration capacity (e.g. soil\
    \ crusting) and poor soil water holding capacity, but can \nbe caused or aggravated\
    \ by human action through soil mismanagement (Falkenmark, \n2013a). Second, low\
    \ root/crop water uptake capacity leads to unproductive evaporation \nlosses (green\
    \ water flow not entirely productive) (Rockström & Falkenmark, 2000). \nTranspiration\
    \ is a productive form of green water use, contributing to biomass \nproduction,\
    \ while other components of the evaporative flow are regarded as \nunproductive\
    \ (Rockström & Falkenmark, 2000; Rockström, 2001; Rockstrom et al., 2007; \nSavenije,\
    \ 2004). Rockstrom et al. (2007) express the productivity of green water use as\
    \ the \nratio of transpiration to evaporation. Rockström et al. (2009) call this\
    \ the transpiration \nefficiency. This transpiration efficiency is complementary\
    \ to the green water scarcity \nindicator by Hoekstra et al. (2011). A green water\
    \ scarcity assessment based on both will \ngive insight into the severity of green\
    \ water scarcity: areas that are considered highly \ngreen-water scarce, but have\
    \ a low transpiration efficiency, may have options to improve \nthe latter and\
    \ thereby yields, which may lower the green water scarcity. \n4.3.2.4. Challenges\
    \ for Operationalization of Green Water Scarcity Indicators \nOperationalization\
    \ of green water scarcity indicators faces three major challenges, \nparticularly\
    \ regarding the quantification of green water availability. First, the \ndetermination\
    \ of which areas and periods of the year the green water flow can be used \nproductively\
    \ is not straightforward. Absolute green water availability indicators, in \n\
    particular land classifications of agricultural suitability, can provide insight\
    \ in the \navailability of green water in the spatial dimension. Relative green\
    \ water availability \nindicators can enrich the picture by showing which areas\
    \ are prone to large inter- and \nintra-annual variations in green water availability,\
    \ making these areas less suitable for \n(certain types of) biomass production.\
    \ To estimate which part of the green water flow \ncan be used productively in\
    \ time, advanced crop growth models (like APSIM (McCown \net al., 1995; Holzworth\
    \ et al., 2014), AquaCrop (Steduto et al., 2009), CropSyst (Stöckle et \n85 \n\
    al., 2003), EPIC (Jones et al., 1991) or SWAP/WOFOST (van Dam et al., 2008)) can\
    \ be used \nto simulate water-limited yields and actual evaporation for various\
    \ cropping periods \nand different types of soil, crop and agricultural water\
    \ management (e.g. adding blue \nwater in the form of deficit irrigation during\
    \ a dry spell, might make it possible for the \ncrop to survive and use the green\
    \ water flow later in the year productively). \nSecond, estimating green water\
    \ consumption of forestry is difficult, because it entails \nseparation of production\
    \ forest evaporation into green and blue parts. This is \nproblematic, because\
    \ trees generally root so deep that, by means of capillary rise, they \ndirectly\
    \ take up water from groundwater (blue) in addition to the soil moisture (green)\
    \ \n(Hoekstra, 2013). \nThird, research is required to determine the environmental\
    \ green water requirements, \ni.e. the green water flow that should be preserved\
    \ for nature, similar to the \nenvironmental flow requirements for blue water.\
    \ Key here is the identification of areas \nthat need to be reserved for nature\
    \ and biodiversity conservation. It is known that the \ncurrent network of protected\
    \ areas is insufficient to conserve biodiversity (Rodrigues et \nal., 2004a; Rodrigues\
    \ et al., 2004b; Venter et al., 2014; Butchart et al., 2015) and that \nattention\
    \ should be paid to conservation of biodiversity in production landscapes that\
    \ \nare shared with humans (Baudron & Giller, 2014). The 11th Aichi Biodiversity\
    \ Target is \nto expand the protected area network, which currently has a terrestrial\
    \ coverage of about \n14.6% (Butchart et al., 2015), to at least 17% terrestrial\
    \ coverage by 2020 (Convention on \nBiological Diversity, 2010). However, to properly\
    \ assess the limitations to green water \navailability, spatially explicit information\
    \ on the additional areas to be preserved is \nrequired. The best-available data\
    \ regarding this are recently published work by Pouzols \net al. (2014). These\
    \ authors have mapped global and national priority areas for expansion \nof the\
    \ protected area network on 0.2 degree spatial resolution and assessed associated\
    \ \nconservation gains (Pouzols et al., 2014; Brooks, 2014). \n4.3.2.5. Measuring\
    \ Green Water Scarcity versus Overall Green-Blue Water Scarcity \nIn Sections\
    \ 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2 we mentioned a few indicators that measure overall green-\n\
    blue water scarcity (Rockström et al., 2009; Gerten et al., 2011; Kummu et al.,\
    \ 2014). \nWhereas useful for getting an overall picture of water scarcity, a\
    \ disadvantage of these \nindicators is that a high degree of green water scarcity\
    \ can be masked by a low degree of \nblue water scarcity and vice versa. Imagine\
    \ for example a river basin where nearly all \nland is in use and natural forest\
    \ is under pressure by conversion to cropland (high \ndegree of green water scarcity),\
    \ while there is enough blue water available to irrigate \n86 \ncroplands if necessary\
    \ (low degree of blue water scarcity). Measuring increasing green \nwater scarcity\
    \ could be relevant, for instance, for the Amazon basin in South America, \nwhere\
    \ increasingly natural forest and associated green water flows are turned into\
    \ use \nand competition is essentially about land and associated green water resources,\
    \ while \nblue water resources are abundant and blue water scarcity is low. Therefore,\
    \ for \nstudying green water scarcity, an indicator specifically comparing green\
    \ water demand \nand green water availability can be more appropriate. \n4.4.\
    \ Conclusions and Future Research \nIn this paper we have reviewed and classified\
    \ around 80 indicators of green water \navailability and scarcity. This list of\
    \ indicators is extensive, but not exhaustive. \nNevertheless, we are confident\
    \ to have identified the most widely used and cited \nindicators. \nThe number\
    \ of green water availability indicators by far outnumbers the existing green\
    \ \nwater scarcity indicators. This reflects that the concept of green water scarcity\
    \ is still \nlargely unexplored. Indicators of overall green-blue water crowding\
    \ and scarcity have \nbeen developed by Rockström et al. (2009), Gerten et al.\
    \ (2011) and Kummu et al. (2014). \nThese have potential to be tailored to measure\
    \ green water crowding and green water \nrequirements for self-sufficiency versus\
    \ green water availability. The green water \nscarcity indicator by Hoekstra et\
    \ al. (2011) measures actual green water consumption \nversus green water availability,\
    \ but has not yet been operationalized due to several \nchallenges discussed in\
    \ Section 4.3.2.4. The biggest challenge is to determine which part \nof the green\
    \ water flow can be made productive in space and time. Application of both \n\
    absolute and relative green water availability indicators will provide insight\
    \ into where \nthe green water flow can be made productive for human purposes.\
    \ Simulations with \ncrop growth models for different management strategies can\
    \ be used to assess during \nwhich parts of the year the green water flow can\
    \ be made productive. \nFuture research should be aimed at overcoming these challenges\
    \ to make the green \nwater scarcity indicators discussed in this paper operational.\
    \ We also encourage the \ndevelopment of additional definitions of green water\
    \ scarcity indicators to the ones \ndiscussed here. The conceptual definition\
    \ of green water scarcity we introduced in \nSection 4.3.2 can be a starting point\
    \ for this. \nDespite scientific obstacles on the way, it is time that the scope\
    \ of water scarcity \nassessments is broadened to include green water. We hope\
    \ that this paper is a stepping \nstone towards this goal by bringing structure\
    \ in the large pool of green water availability \n87 \nindicators and discussing\
    \ the way forward to develop operational green water scarcity \nindicators. Practitioners\
    \ and scholars might also find the classification of indicators \nprovided in\
    \ this paper insightful and helpful for choosing the indicator that suits their\
    \ \npurpose. \n \n \n88 \n \n \n89 \n5. \nThe Water Footprint of Wood for Lumber,\
    \ Pulp, \nPaper, Fuel and Firewood5 \nAbstract \nThis paper presents the first\
    \ estimate of global water use in the forestry sector related to \nroundwood production\
    \ for lumber, pulp, paper, fuel and firewood. For the period 1961-\n2010, we estimate\
    \ forest evaporation at a high spatial resolution level and attribute total \n\
    water consumption to various forest products, including ecosystem services. Global\
    \ \nwater consumption for roundwood production increased by 25% over 50 years\
    \ to \n961×109 m3/y (96% green; 4% blue) in 2001-2010. The water footprint per\
    \ m3 of wood is \nsignificantly smaller in (sub)tropical forests compared to temperate/boreal\
    \ forests, \nbecause (sub)tropical forests host relatively more value next to\
    \ wood production in the \nform of other ecosystem services. In terms of economic\
    \ water productivity and energy \nyield from bio-ethanol per unit of water, roundwood\
    \ is rather comparable with major \nfood, feed and energy crops. Recycling of\
    \ wood products could effectively reduce the \nwater footprint of the forestry\
    \ sector, thereby leaving more water available for the \ngeneration of other ecosystem\
    \ services. Intensification of wood production can only \nreduce the water footprint\
    \ per unit of wood if the additional wood value per ha \noutweighs the loss of\
    \ value of other ecosystem services, which is often not the case in \n(sub)tropical\
    \ forests. The results of this study contribute to a more complete picture of\
    \ \nthe human appropriation of water, thus feeding the debate on water for food\
    \ or feed \nversus energy and wood. \n5.1. Introduction \nAlthough precipitation\
    \ is renewable, it is limited in time and space, and so are its \nsubsequent pathways\
    \ as green and blue water flows (Schyns et al., 2015; Hoekstra, 2013). \nThere\
    \ are alternative competing uses for these limited flows, which makes freshwater\
    \ a \nscarce resource. This explains the interest in the human appropriation of\
    \ water (Postel et \nal., 1996; Rockström et al., 1999; Rockström & Gordon, 2001;\
    \ Hoekstra & Mekonnen, \n2012) in relation to a maximum sustainable level (Hoekstra\
    \ & Wiedmann, 2014) or \nplanetary boundary (Steffen et al., 2015; Rockstrom et\
    \ al., 2009). Freshwater sustains \nterrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and is\
    \ used for the production of goods and services. \nImportant water consuming sectors\
    \ are agriculture, industries, municipalities and \n                         \
    \                                        \n5 This chapter has been published as:\
    \ \nSchyns, J.F., Booij, M.J. & Hoekstra, A.Y. (2017) The water footprint of wood\
    \ for lumber, \npulp, paper, fuel and firewood, Advances in Water Resources, 107:\
    \ 490-501. \n90 \nforestry. Multiple studies have quantified the global blue and\
    \ green water consumption \nfor producing crop and livestock products, and for\
    \ fulfilling industrial and municipal \ndemands (Rost et al., 2008; Hanasaki et\
    \ al., 2010; Liu & Yang, 2010; Liu et al., 2009; \nSiebert & Döll, 2010; Mekonnen\
    \ & Hoekstra, 2011a; Wada et al., 2014; Hoekstra & \nMekonnen, 2012; Döll et al.,\
    \ 2012). As recently identified by Vanham (2016), we do not \nknow how much water\
    \ is used in the forestry sector for the production of wood \nproducts such as\
    \ lumber, pulp and paper, firewood or biofuel. \nForest evaporation accounts for\
    \ 45-58% of the total vapour flow from land to atmosphere \n(Oki & Kanae, 2006;\
    \ Rockström et al., 1999; Rockström & Gordon, 2001). With the term \nevaporation\
    \ we refer to the entire vapour flux from land to atmosphere, including \nevaporation\
    \ through the process of plant transpiration (Savenije, 2004). Determining \n\
    which part of the evaporation is appropriated for the production of roundwood\
    \ (wood \nin the rough) is not as straightforward as it is for crops. For crops,\
    \ all evaporation from \nthe crop field during the growing season is usually attributed\
    \ to crop production. This \nmakes sense, since crop fields are generally used\
    \ quite intensively for a distinct purpose \n(providing food, feed or fibre).\
    \ Forests on the other hand provide numerous other \necosystem services next to\
    \ the provision of wood (Costanza et al., 1997), depending on \nthe intensity\
    \ of forest exploitation. Therefore, forest evaporation is to be attributed to\
    \ \nroundwood production based on the relative value of roundwood production compared\
    \ \nto the value of other ecosystem services provided by the forest. \nThere are\
    \ a few studies that have attributed forest evaporation to wood products. Van\
    \ \nOel & Hoekstra (2012) made a first estimate of the water footprint of paper\
    \ in the main \npulp producing countries. Chiu & Wu (2013) estimated the water\
    \ footprint of ethanol \nfrom wood residues from the southeast United States.\
    \ Tian & Ke (2012) made estimates \nof the water footprint of lumber, panels,\
    \ pulp and paper in China. However, these \nstudies did not account for the value\
    \ of wood production relative to other forest values \n(Van Oel & Hoekstra, 2012;\
    \ Chiu & Wu, 2013; Tian & Ke, 2012). Launiainen et al. (2014) \nargue that one\
    \ should not attribute forest evaporation of rain-fed managed forests to end \n\
    products at all, based on the argument that the evaporation of these forests is\
    \ not \nsignificantly different than that of natural forests (no net difference).\
    \ However, for the \npurpose of measuring the amount of evaporation that is appropriated\
    \ by roundwood \nproduction and therefore not available for other uses we should\
    \ measure total (not net) \nwater consumption (Hoekstra, 2017). \nThe objective\
    \ of this paper is to provide the first estimate of the global water \nconsumption\
    \ related to roundwood production and to subsequently attribute this to \n91 \n\
    various end-uses of wood. Our analysis is at high spatial resolution (30 x 30\
    \ arc minute) \nfor the period 1961-2010 and includes a number of innovations:\
    \ \n\x83 \nGlobal high-resolution estimates of actual evaporation from production\
    \ forests, \ndistinguishing the contribution of green water (precipitation) and\
    \ blue water \n(groundwater through capillary rise). \n\x83 \nAttribution of forest\
    \ evaporation to roundwood production based on the \nrelative value of roundwood\
    \ production compared to the value of other \necosystem services provided by the\
    \ forest. \n\x83 \nEstimates of the green and blue water footprints of wood products,\
    \ including \nsawnwood, wood-based panels, wood pulp, paper and wood-based energy\
    \ \ncarriers. \n5.2. Method and Data \nWe follow the method of water footprint\
    \ assessment to estimate the water consumption \nassociated with roundwood production\
    \ for lumber, pulp, paper, fuel and firewood \n(Hoekstra et al., 2011). Firstly,\
    \ we estimate the volume of water consumed that can be \nattributed to roundwood\

    \ (Section 5.2.1). Secondly, we estimate the period-average water \nfootprint\
    \ per unit of roundwood produced (Section 5.2.2). Finally, we attribute the water\
    \ \nfootprint of roundwood production to various end-uses of wood (Section 5.2.3).\

    \ based on two main assumptions: \n\x83 \nCapillary rise is at its maximum in\
    \ a very dry year (Eact/Pr = 1) and moves \nlinearly to zero in an extremely wet\
    \ year (Eact/Pr = 0). A water potential gradient \nis required to move water upward\
    \ from the groundwater table. When the soil is \ndry this gradient is strong.\
    \ If the soil is saturated this gradient is absent and \nthere will be no capillary\
    \ rise. \n\x83 \nThe distance that needs to be bridged by capillary rise (dcap,\
    \ in m) is defined as \nthe difference between the groundwater table depth (zg)\
    \ and the root depth of \nthe forest type (zr), both in m below a certain reference\
    \ level. The maximum \nheight of capillary rise (dcap,max, in m) depends on the\
    \ soil type. When dcap is non-\nlimiting (ǂ0), the roots take up a share dcap,max\
    \ of zr through capillary rise under \nvery dry conditions. This share decreases\
    \ linearly to zero when dcap approaches \ndcap,max (beyond, there is no capillary\
    \ uptake at all). \n93 \nThese assumptions can be combined into a single equation\

    \ \n5.2.2. Water Footprint per Unit of Roundwood Production \nSince wood production\
    \ cycles are commonly multi-decadal (Bauhus et al., 2009), we \ncalculate the\
    \ water footprint per unit of production as a period-average. The water \nfootprint\
    \ of roundwood production (WFrw, in m3 water/m3 roundwood) for the period of \n\
    m years is defined as: \n¦\n¦\n=\n=\n=\nm\nt\nm\nt\nx\nP\nWU x\nx\nWF\n1\nact\n\

    \ Wood Harvested Area \nWe obtained wood harvested area maps (as fraction of a\
    \ grid cell) at 30 x 30 arc minute \nresolution for each year in the period 1961-2004\
    \ from Chini et al. (2014). For 2005-2010, \nwe keep the pattern from 2004. Hurtt\
    \ et al. (2011) estimated the wood harvest pattern \nwith a global land-use model\
    \ that takes, among others, national wood harvest data as \ninput, constrains\
    \ wood harvesting by the presence of forests, and gives preference to \nwood harvesting\
    \ near existing land-use (proximity to infrastructure or local markets). \nWe\
    \ took the sum of the five different land types from which wood can be harvested\
    \ as \ndistinguished by Hurtt et al. (2011). \nWe apply three restrictions to\
    \ these maps. Firstly, we assumed that roundwood \nproduction only takes place\
    \ in those grid cells that have a forest cover according to the \nIGBP DISCover\
    \ land cover database (Loveland et al., 2009). Secondly, we consider grid \ncells\
    \ with an average Eact ver the study period of less than 100 mm/y to be unsuitable\
    \ for \n94 \nforest growth that enables wood harvesting and hence remove those\
    \ grid cells from our \nfinal map. This threshold is derived from Komatsu et al.\
    \ (2012), who collected 829 forest \nEact data points at locations spread over\
    \ the world, of which only three (0.4%) have an \nEact smaller than 100 mm/y.\
    \ Thirdly, we assumed that no wood is harvested from grid \ncells that are entirely\
    \ located within a protected area of IUCN category Ia (strict nature \nreserves),\
    \ Ib (wilderness areas) or II (national parks) from the year that these areas\
    \ \nreceived this status. The data on protected areas have been obtained from\
    \ IUCN & \nUNEP-WCMC (2016). \nWe made one exception to the above procedure. The\
    \ People's Democratic Republic of \nEthiopia (1961–1992) had a significant contribution\
    \ to world roundwood production \naccording to national statistics (FAO, 2016b).\
    \ However, the cells where wood harvesting \ntook place in this country according\
    \ to the map by Chini et al. (2014) have no forest cover \naccording to the IGBP\
    \ DISCover dataset. To avoid neglect of this roundwood \nproduction, we assigned\
    \ the most common forest type in the region to the cells where \nwood was harvested:\
    \ tropical evergreen broadleaf forest. Finally, we scale the wood \nharvested\
    \ area maps on the national level to the area used for roundwood production \n\
    estimated based on the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (Köhl et al., 2015)\
    \ (see \nAppendix C.1). \n5.2.5. Actual Roundwood Production at the Grid Level\
    \ \nNational annual statistics on actual roundwood production from coniferous\
    \ (C) and non-\nconiferous (NC) forest covering the study period have been obtained\
    \ from FAO (2016b). \nWe downscale these data to the grid level in two steps.\
    \ Firstly, we estimate the \nmaximum sustainable production in a grid cell by\
    \ multiplying the wood harvested area \nwith a long-term maximum sustainable wood\
    \ yield (Section 5.2.6). Therein, we \ndistinguish between C and NC production\
    \ by assuming that C wood is produced in \nneedleleaf forests and NC wood in broadleaf\
    \ forests and that mixed forest contributes to \nboth C and NC production (fifty–fifty).\
    \ For a small number of countries, in some years, \nreported production concerns\
    \ C and/or NC wood, while our maps contain no grid cells \nyielding that type\
    \ of wood (e.g. only NC production is reported, but all grid cells in the \nwood\
    \ harvest map are of the needleleaf type). In these cases, we overwrite the dominant\
    \ \nforest type in all affected grid cells for that year to mixed forest. Secondly,\
    \ we distribute \nthe national annual statistics over all grid cells used for\
    \ roundwood production in that \nyear, according to the estimated maximum sustainable\
    \ production for that roundwood \ntype (C or NC). \n95 \n5.2.6. Long-Term Maximum\
    \ Sustainable Wood Yield \nThe rate of wood production varies over the age of\
    \ the forest stand following an s-\nshaped curve that is different for each species,\
    \ location and type of management (Lutz, \n2011). he mean annual increment is\
    \ the average production rate at any particular age of \nthe forest, calculated\
    \ as the total growing stock volume divided by the age of the forest \nstand (Jürgensen\
    \ et al., 2014; Lutz, 2011; Blanchez, 1997). We obtained minimum and \nmaximum\
    \ forest plantation yields (in m3/ha/y) for different tree species in various\
    \ \ncountries around the world from Brown (2000). These yields represent the mean\
    \ annual \nincrement for the likely rotation length of the forest stand. We assume\
    \ that forests are of \na mixed age, that trees are harvested at their likely\
    \ rotation length and that natural losses \nare minimal. Under these circumstances,\
    \ we consider the yields by Brown (2000) to be a \ngood proxy of the long-term\
    \ maximum sustainable wood yield (Ysus). \nUltimately, we need an estimate of\
    \ Ysus for each grid cell in our roundwood production \nmaps. To arrive there,\
    \ (i) we determine the dominant forest type and climate zone of \neach grid cell;\
    \ (ii) we assume characteristic tree species for each forest type; (iii) we \n\
    determine the dominant climate zone in each country in the dataset by Brown (2000);\
    \ (iv) \nfrom this dataset we calculate the average Ysus of a tree species  per\
    \ climate zone and (v) \nwe assign those Ysus estimates to the grid cells. Details\
    \ are described in Appendix C.2-3. \nThe following assumptions are made under\
    \ (ii), which are loosely based on the forest \ntype descriptions of Matthews\
    \ et al. (2000): \n\x83 \nEvergreen needleleaf forest yields pine (Pinus species)\
    \ in all climate zones. \n\x83 \nEvergreen broadleaf forest yields eucalyptus\
    \ (Eucalyptus species) in all climate \nzones. \n\x83 \nDeciduous needleleaf forest\
    \ yields larch (Larix species) in all climate zones. \n\x83 \nDeciduous broadleaf\
    \ forest yields oak (Quercus species) in all climate zones. \n\x83 \nMixed forest\
    \ in the tropical and subtropical zone yields a 50-50 mix of pine and \neucalyptus.\
    \ \n\x83 \nMixed forest in the temperate zone yields a 50-50 mix of pine and oak.\
    \ \n\x83 \nMixed forest in the boreal zone yields a 50-50 mix of pine and larch.\
    \ \nThe resulting Ysus estimates per forest type and climate zone are presented\
    \ in Table 5-1. \nThe climate zones and forest types are mapped in Figure 5-1.\

    \ precipitation (Pr) and annual mean temperature (T) based on daily data obtained\
    \ \nfrom De Graaf et al. (2014). \n5.2.8. Fraction of Water Use Originating from\
    \ Capillary Rise \nRooting depths were derived from Canadell et al. (1996) (Table\
    \ 5-2). The groundwater \ntable depth per 30 x 30 arc minute grid cell has been\
    \ estimated by averaging over the 30 \nx 30 arc second map by Fan et al. (2013).\
    \ The maximum height of capillary rise is \nestimated using an empirical relation\
    \ based on the soil’s grain size and void ratio (details \nin Appendix C.4). \n\
    5.2.9. Volumetric Moisture Content of Freshly Harvested Wood \nThe fraction fwater\
    \ is estimated by multiplying a species wood density with the \nequilibrium moisture\
    \ content (t water/t oven dried wood) (derivation in Appendix C.5). \nThe wood\
    \ density for each of the characteristic tree species considered in this study\
    \ has \nbeen estimated from Zanne et al. (2009) (Table 5-3). The equilibrium moisture\
    \ content is \nestimated per grid cell for each year with the function of Simpson\
    \ (1998) that takes \ntemperature and relative humidity as inputs. We applied\
    \ the mean annual temperature \n(Section 5.2.7) and a climate-average relative\
    \ humidity per grid cell. The latter is \nestimated based on the 10 × 10 arc minute\
    \ gridded monthly mean relative humidity data \nfor 1961-1990 from New et al.\
    \ (2002). We took the average of all months and \nsubsequently the average of\
    \ all 10 x 10 arc minute grid cells within a 30 x 30 arc minute \ngrid cell. \n\

    \ Production \nWe base our estimate of the value fraction of roundwood production\
    \ (fvalue,rw) on \nCostanza et al. (2014), who estimated the value of 17 ecosystems\
    \ services (in monetary \nunits/ha) around the year 2011 for (sub)tropical forests\
    \ and temperate/boreal forests, \nseparately (Figure 5-2). We assume that the\
    \ service labelled ‘raw materials’ by Costanza \net al. (2014) primarily refers\
    \ to roundwood production. Non-wood forest products that \nare not of interest\
    \ for this study are included under other services, e.g. food and food \nadditives\
    \ (‘food production’) and plant and animal parts for pharmaceutical products \n\
    (‘genetic resources’). \nThe data in Figure 5-2 refer to the entire forest biomes,\
    \ while we are interested in \nproduction forests specifically. Therefore, we\
    \ first distribute the monetary values per \nhectare of the services over production\
    \ and non-production forests for the reference year \n2010 (which lies closest\
    \ to the reporting year by (Costanza et al., 2014)). Secondly, we \nscale the\
    \ values back in time and disaggregate them spatially over the grid cells. Therein,\
    \ \nwe distinguish three categories of ecosystem service values: \n\x83 \nThe\
    \ value of roundwood production that varies with the volume of roundwood \nproduced.\
    \ \n\x83 \nThe value of the services pollination, biological control, habitat/refugia,\
    \ \nrecreation and culture that are inversely proportional to the intensity of\
    \ forest \nexploitation, which is defined as the actual wood production over the\
    \ \nmaximum sustainable wood production. \n\x83 \nThe value of the other services\
    \ given in Figure 5-2 that are invariable with the \nintensity of forest exploitation.\
    \ \n99 \n \nFigure 5-2. The relative value of ecosystems services for tropical\
    \ (left) and \ntemperate/boreal forests (right). Data source: Costanza et al.\
    \ (2014). Descriptions of the \necosystem services can be found in Costanza et\
    \ al. (1997). \nFor the year 2010, and averaged per biome, the resulting ecosystem\
    \ service values are \nconsistent with those reported in Figure 5-2. Details and\
    \ assumptions are described in \nAppendix C.6. Ultimately, we calculate fvalue,rw\
    \ per grid cell per year using Equation C-10 \n(Appendix C.6). \n5.2.11. \nWood\
    \ to End Product Conversion Factors \nConversion factors for sawnwood, panels,\
    \ pulp, paper and energy wood products are \nobtained from UNECE/FAO (2010) and\
    \ represent averages of reported values by \ncountries in the UNECE region. The\
    \ energy values represent higher heating values \n(HHV). Some additional data\
    \ on the HHV of softwood, hardwood, ethanol and charcoal \nare obtained from (Speight,\
    \ 2010). The water footprint of an A4 (=1/16 m2) sheet of paper \nof 80 g/m2 in\
    \ l/sheet is estimated by multiplying the water footprint of paper in m3/t with\
    \ \na factor 0.005 (=80/16/1000). \n5.3. Results \n5.3.1. Water Consumption Attributed\
    \ to Roundwood Production \nThe global water consumption attributed to roundwood\
    \ production increased by 25% \nover 50 years, from 768x109 m3/y in 1961-1970\
    \ to 961x109 m3/y in 2001-2010 (for both \ndecades: 96% green; 4% blue). The water\
    \ consumption equals the evaporated volume \nattributed to roundwood production,\
    \ since the share of the water incorporated in the \nharvested wood is negligible\
    \ (0.01% on average). \n \n \n100 \n \nFigure 5-3. Water consumption attributed\
    \ to roundwood production. Period: 1961-2010. \nFigure 5-3 shows the water consumption\
    \ attributed to roundwood production (WU) and \nthe value fraction of roundwood\
    \ production (fvalue,rw) in the biomes (sub)tropical forests \nand temperate and\
    \ boreal forests, separately. WU is significantly smaller in the former \ncompared\
    \ to the latter caused by the difference in fvalue,rw for those biomes (Figure\
    \ 5-2 and \nAppendix C.7). For (sub)tropical forests, an increasing trend in WU\
    \ is observed, driven \nby increases in the area used for roundwood production\
    \ and the volume of roundwood \nproduced (see Figure C-2, Appendix C.7). For temperate\
    \ and boreal forests, a moderate \nincreasing trend in WU is visible due to an\
    \ increased area used for roundwood \nproduction. Inter-annual variation is larger\
    \ in this case. Variation in WU is caused by \nvariation in fvalue,rw, which in\
    \ turn is mainly driven by variation in the volume of \nroundwood produced (Figure\
    \ C-2, Appendix C.7). The latter explains the sudden decline \nin fvalue,rw and\
    \ WU after 1990 when the statistics (FAO, 2016b) show a drop in roundwood \nproduction\
    \ (in the former USSR). In both forest biomes, varying forest evaporation rates\
    \ \nadd to the temporal variation in WU (Figure C-2, Appendix C.7). \n5.3.2. Water\
    \ Footprint per Unit of Roundwood Production \nThe study period average water\
    \ footprint per unit of roundwood production (WFrw) is \npresented in Figure 5-4.\
    \ Besides the differences between the (sub)tropical and \ntemperate/boreal zones\
    \ (Section 5.3.1), spatial variation in WFrw is mostly explained by \nvarying\
    \ forest evaporation rates (Table C-2, Appendix C.8). \n \n101 \n \nFigure 5-4.\
    \ The water footprint per unit of roundwood production (m3 water/m3 \nroundwood)\
    \ at 30 x 30 arc minute resolution. The table next to the legend shows the \n\
    average (production-weighted) water footprint per climate zone: boreal, continental\
    \ & \narctic (Bca); boreal, oceanic & sub-continental (Bsc); temperate (Tmp);\
    \ subtropics, winter \nrainfall (Swr); subtropics, summer rainfall (Ssr); tropics\
    \ (Tro). Period: 1961-2010. Note \nthat not all grid cells were necessarily used\
    \ for roundwood production in each year. \nThe decade average WFrw increased with\
    \ about ten percent over the study period in \ntemperate and boreal zones, while\
    \ it varied within five percent in the (sub)tropics. \nThe average capillary rise\
    \ contribution to WFrw is mapped in Figure 5-5. The areas with a \ncapillary rise\
    \ contribution of more than 50% are mostly found in Russia and Canada. \nBlue\
    \ water constitutes a significant part of the total water consumption attributed\
    \ to \nroundwood production in countries like the Bahamas (32%), Gambia (28%),\
    \ the \nNetherlands (24%) and Somalia (23%). Variations in the capillary rise\
    \ contribution are \nmainly explained by the groundwater depth. Miller et al.\
    \ (2010) found for a semi-arid \noak savanna in the period 2005-2008 (average\
    \ Eact/Pr ratio of 0.7), that the average \ncontribution of capillary rise to\
    \ the evaporation over the year was about 22%. For grid \ncells with a capillary\
    \ rise contribution to evaporation and an Eact/Pr ratio of at least 0.7, \nwe\
    \ found this contribution to be 18% on average. \n102 \n \nFigure 5-5. The average\

    \ from a \ncombination of a relatively high forest evaporation rate with a relatively\
    \ low wood yield. \n103 \nAlthough pronounced spatial variations in WFrw occur,\

    \ varies \naround the globe (Figure 5-4). The global average water footprint of\
    \ one A4 sheet 80 g \nprinting and writing paper is 5.1 l and ranges from 1.0\

    \ = 29.6 GJ/t charcoal (Speight, 2010). \n5.4. Discussion \n5.4.1. Comparison\
    \ with Previous Estimates \nA rough comparison can be made between our estimates\
    \ of the water footprint of \nroundwood and those by Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012)\
    \ for the main pulp producing \ncountries. Our estimates of actual evaporation\
    \ rates are about 30% higher, while our \nwood yields are about 45% lower. We\
    \ specifically estimate the evaporation of forests, \nwhile Van Oel & Hoekstra\
    \ (2012) used a general actual evaporation map (which \nprobably underestimates\
    \ forest evaporation). Where Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012) use \nrough wood yield\
    \ estimates per country/region, wood yields in our study are derived \nfrom national\
    \ production and area statistics that were downscaled to the grid level. \nMoreover,\
    \ we use different underlying maps of which grid cells are used for roundwood\
    \ \nproduction, which contributes to different spatial average estimates of evaporation\
    \ rates \nand water footprints. Without application of the value fraction of roundwood\
    \ \nproduction, our water footprint of roundwood estimates for the main pulp producing\
    \ \ncountries are significantly higher than those by Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012).\
    \ After \napplying the value fractions (fvalue,rw), our estimates are roughly\
    \ 20% and 140% of those \nby Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012) for tropical and temperate/boreal\
    \ zones, respectively. We \nused the same wood to paper conversion factor as Van\
    \ Oel & Hoekstra (2012), so \ndifferences in the water footprint of paper (assuming\
    \ a recovery rate of zero) are also \nexplained by the above. \nWhen we compare\
    \ the water footprint of seven wood products in China, we find that \nour estimates\
    \ are 5% to 29% of those by Tian & Ke (2012). We used different methods \nand\
    \ data, but the largest difference is probably explained by the fact that we apply\
    \ a \nvalue fraction. \nFor the southeastern United States, Chiu & Wu (2013) found\
    \ that the green water \nfootprint of ethanol from forest wood residue is about\
    \ 400-443 l/l and that the blue water \nfootprint in the forestry stage is minimal.\
    \ Our estimated water footprint per unit of \nroundwood in this region is about\
    \ 70 l/l (Figure 5-4). With a roundwood to bio-ethanol \nconversion factor of\
    \ 6.8 for the United States (UNECE/FAO, 2010), this translates into a \nquite\
    \ similar water footprint of 476 l/l. Where we applied a value fraction to attribute\
    \ \n108 \nforest evaporation to roundwood production followed by a roundwood to\
    \ bio-ethanol \nconversion factor, Chiu & Wu (2013) allocated forest evaporation\
    \ to bio-ethanol \nproduction based on an estimated weight fraction of harvested\
    \ wood residue for bio-\nethanol in the total above-ground wood mass, which also\
    \ greatly reduces the amount of \nevaporation attributed to the bio-ethanol. \n\
    5.4.2. Uncertainties Regarding Method and Data \nMoisture Recycling \nPrecipitation\
    \ over land relies on terrestrial evaporation (moisture recycling) to a varying\
    \ \nextent around the globe (van der Ent et al., 2010) and forests play an important\
    \ role in \nthis (Ellison et al., 2012). When attributing forest evaporation to\
    \ forestry products, one \ncould argue to reduce total forest evaporation by the\
    \ portion of evaporation that returns \nas precipitation (in the same area), based\
    \ on the idea that this returning water can be \nused again and therefore is not\
    \ really consumed (Launiainen et al., 2014). However, \ngreen forest evaporation\
    \ stems from the precipitation amount that already includes the \nrecycled moisture.\
    \ Reducing the attributed evaporation by the recycled part would \nwrongly suggest\
    \ that the recycled water is left for use for other purposes. It is not \nadditional\
    \ water that can be additionally allocated. As mentioned in the introduction,\
    \ we \nare interested in this question of water allocation: which part of the\
    \ available flow is \nbeing appropriated for roundwood production? Therefore,\
    \ we deliberately attribute the \ntotal forest evaporation (that is reduced based\
    \ on a value fraction) to roundwood \nproduction, whatever rate of moisture recycling.\
    \ \nUncertainties Regarding Data \nThe estimates of the water footprint of roundwood\
    \ production provided in this study \nare subject to a number of uncertainties.\
    \ Since the fraction of water in the harvested \nwood turned out to be negligible\
    \ (Section 5.3.1), the main variables governing the end \nresult are the forest\
    \ evaporation (Eact), the area used for roundwood production (Arw), the \nvolume\
    \ of roundwood produced (Pact) and the value fraction of roundwood production\
    \ \n(fvalue,rw). \nOut of these, we expect the least uncertainty in Eact and Pact.\
    \ The estimate of Eact is \nrelatively straightforward and bound by annual precipitation\
    \ and potential evaporation. \nPact is based on downscaled national statistics\
    \ covering the entire study period, although \nthe downscaling to the grid level\
    \ involved coarse data on long-term maximum \nsustainable wood yields. The current\
    \ data limitations regarding Arw (Kuemmerle et al., \n2013) makes our estimate\
    \ of Arw rather uncertain, since it is based on a modeled wood \n109 \nharvest\
    \ pattern that was scaled to an estimated area used for roundwood production \n\
    based on national statistics available from 1990 onwards. The estimated relative\
    \ value of \necosystem services from which we derived fvalue,rw is associated\
    \ with some limitations as \nelaborately described by Costanza et al. (1997) and\
    \ Costanza et al. (2014). The estimates \nare based on a limited number of valuation\
    \ studies that reflect the state at a certain point \nin time (Costanza et al.,\
    \ 2014). Besides, uncertainties are associated with willingness-to-\npay estimates\
    \ and aggregation of values at specific locations to larger spatial and \ntemporal\
    \ scales (Costanza et al., 2014). Furthermore, we needed to make a number of \n\
    assumptions for disaggregating the value of ecosystem services in time and space\
    \ as \noutlined in Appendix C.6. \n5.4.3. Sustainability of the Water Footprint\
    \ \nThis study has provided spatially-explicit estimates of the water footprint\
    \ of roundwood \nproduction and various forest products. One should be cautious\
    \ in evaluating \ndifferences in the water footprints of a similar product from\
    \ two different regions in \nterms of better or worse. The relevance of the data\
    \ presented rather lies in the fact that \nthey can form a basis for further study\
    \ into the alternative uses of the same water to \nproduce more or different goods\
    \ and services. \nTo judge the sustainability of the water footprint of roundwood\
    \ production \n(volume/time), one would need to place the green and blue water\
    \ components in the \ncontext of maximum sustainable levels of green and blue\
    \ water consumption and \nconsider the competition for the limited green and blue\
    \ water resources between \ndifferent demands. This assessment was out of the\
    \ scope of this study, since maximum \nsustainable levels are currently not known\
    \ for green water (Hoekstra & Wiedmann, \n2014; Schyns et al., 2015), the major\
    \ component of the water footprint of roundwood \nproduction. Besides, for understanding\
    \ competing demands for water and the potential \nconflict between (green) water\
    \ use for roundwood production and (green) water use for \nother purposes like\
    \ crops for food, feed or bioenergy, a broader study would be \nrequired. Nevertheless,\
    \ we can roughly contextualize the water footprint of roundwood \nproduction based\
    \ on previous work. \nAddition of the Forestry Sector to the Water Footprint of\
    \ Humanity \nWe can place the global water consumption attributed to roundwood\
    \ production in the \ncontext of the global water footprint for the period 1996-2005\
    \ as estimated by Hoekstra & \nMekonnen (2012), who considered the following five\
    \ sectors: crop production, pasture, \nwater supply in animal raising, industrial\
    \ production, and domestic water supply. \n110 \nAddition of the forestry sector\
    \ raises the global consumptive (green plus blue) water \nfootprint of production\
    \ for the period 1996-2005 by 12%. \nTrade-offs Between Water for Food, Feed,\
    \ Energy and Wood \nThe estimated water footprints of roundwood represent the\
    \ volume of water that is \nallocated to wood production, albeit implicitly through\
    \ land-use decisions (Rockström & \nGordon, 2001). Alternatively, this water could\
    \ be used for the generation of other \nterrestrial ecosystem services or crop\
    \ production (Rockström & Gordon, 2001; Rockström \net al., 1999). We made a rough\
    \ comparison between the value of water for roundwood \nand three major food/feed\
    \ crops (Table 5-5) as well as the water footprint of bio-ethanol \nper unit of\
    \ energy from these four sources (Table 5-6). Both regarding economic water \n\
    productivity and the water footprint of bio-ethanol, roundwood is comparable with\
    \ \nmaize, ranking somewhat better compared to wheat and worse compared to sugar\
    \ beet. \nIt should be noted that the water footprint of second-generation bio-ethanol\
    \ obtained \nfrom crop residues is smaller than the water footprint of first-generation\
    \ bio-ethanol \nfrom these crops (Mathioudakis et al., 2017). \nMekonnen et al.\
    \ (2015) compared the water footprint of heat from various energy \nsources, including\
    \ that from firewood based on Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012). Although \nour estimates\
    \ of the water footprint of heat from wood (i.e. firewood, pellets, briquettes,\
    \ \nbark, chips, charcoal) are different (Section 5.4.1), they remain orders of\
    \ magnitude \nlarger than the water footprint from other energy sources such as\
    \ coal, lignite, oil, gas \nand nuclear (Mekonnen et al., 2015). From this perspective,\
    \ burning wood for the \ngeneration of heat and electricity still is not recommended\
    \ (Mekonnen et al., 2015). \n \n \n111 \nTable 5-5. Economic water productivity\

    \ of the Water Footprint \nIntensification vs. Extensification of Wood Production\
    \ \nIntensification of wood production has two counteracting effects on the water\
    \ footprint \nper unit of roundwood produced (WFrw, Eq. 5-7). Effect A is that\
    \ the value of wood \nproduction increases, partially at the expense of other\
    \ ecosystem service values (fvalue,rw \nincreases), such that the water consumption\
    \ attributed to roundwood production \nincreases. Effect B is that more wood is\
    \ produced per ha with the same amount of water. \nIntensification of wood production\
    \ can only reduce WFrw if the additional wood value \nper ha (effect B) outweighs\
    \ the loss of value of other ecosystem services (effect A). \nThe relationship\
    \ between fvalue,rw and the intensity of forest exploitation (see Appendix \n\
    C.6) determines whether effect A is stronger than effect B or vice versa and hence\
    \ \nwhether WFrw increases (when effect A > effect B) or decreases (when effect\
    \ A < effect B) \nwith intensified production. This relationship is different\
    \ in (sub)tropical forests \ncompared to temperate/boreal forests, and furthermore\
    \ depends on the long-term \nmaximum sustainable yield (Ysus): the higher Ysus\
    \ the larger the theoretical potential to \nobtain a high value of wood production\
    \ from the forest. \nFor (sub)tropical forests we found that intensification leads\
    \ to an increase in WFrw for \nYsus <25 m3/ha (which is always the case in our\
    \ study; see Table 5-1). For \ntemperate/boreal forests we found that intensification\
    \ results in an increase in WFrw for \nYsus <4.5 m3/ha, but a decrease in WFrw\
    \ for higher Ysus. Although we recognize that \nfurther research is needed into\
    \ the value of forests and their maximum sustainable yields \n– with more spatiotemporal\
    \ detail than was available for this study – the following \ngeneral rule seems\
    \ to apply: in forests with a relatively high Ysus, intensification can be \n\
    beneficial in terms of water use efficiency, since the positive effect of intensification\
    \ \n(effect B) can outweigh the loss of value of other ecosystem services (effect\
    \ A).  \nRecycling \nThe water footprint of roundwood can effectively be reduced\
    \ through recycling. The use \nof recycled wood nullifies the attributed evaporation\
    \ to roundwood production, since no \nnew wood is produced. In this study, recovery\
    \ rates were not considered. Hence, water \nfootprint estimates refer to newly\
    \ produced products. Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012) \nalready concluded that increasing\
    \ paper recovery rates is a powerful way to reduce the \nwater footprint of paper.\
    \ Other wood products can also be recycled in various ways. \nWooden pallets or\
    \ furniture can be reused or be remanufactured from recovered wood, \njust like\
    \ particle board (Falk & McKeever, 2004). In construction, wood recovered during\
    \ \n114 \ndemolition is potentially suitable for reuse or remanufacture, particularly\
    \ into flooring \n(Falk & McKeever, 2004). Chipped or shredded wood can be used\
    \ as basis for fuel, \nlandscaping mulch, composting bulk agent, sewage sludge\
    \ bulking medium, or animal \nbedding (Falk & McKeever, 2004). Ideally, the cascading\
    \ use principle is applied, in \nwhich wood is used, recycled and reused as long\
    \ as possible before ultimately being \nused as an energy source (Dammer et al.,\
    \ 2016). It is obvious that reduced consumption \nof end products from wood will\
    \ eventually reduce the total water consumption related \nto roundwood production.\
    \ \n5.5. Conclusion \nThe global water consumption attributed to roundwood production\
    \ for lumber, pulp, \npaper, fuel and firewood has risen from 768×109 m3/y in\
    \ 1961-1970 to 961×109 m3/y in \n2001-2010. Recycling of wood products could effectively\
    \ reduce this volume, thereby \nleaving more water available for the generation\
    \ of other ecosystem services. \nIntensification of wood production can only reduce\
    \ the water footprint per unit of wood \nif the additional wood value per ha outweighs\
    \ the loss of value of other ecosystem \nservices, which is often not the case\
    \ in (sub)tropical forests. Alternatively using the water \nfor crop production\
    \ is generally not beneficial (even apart from the negative effects of \nconverting\
    \ forest to cropland), since roundwood is rather comparable with major food, \n\
    feed and energy crops in terms of economic water productivity and energy yield\
    \ from \nbio-ethanol per unit of water. The results of this study contribute to\
    \ a more complete \npicture of the human appropriation of water and feed into\
    \ the debate on water for food, \nfeed, energy and wood. \n \n \n115 \n6. \nLimits\
    \ to the World’s Green Water Resources for \nFood, Feed, Fibre, Timber and Bio-Energy\
    \ \nAbstract \nFreshwater stems from precipitation, which is limited in time and\
    \ space. Precipitation \nover land partitions into a blue water flow (runoff via\
    \ groundwater and surface water) \nand a green water flow (evaporation). Both\
    \ flows are partially allocated to serve the \neconomy; explicitly through blue\
    \ water withdrawals and implicitly through the use of \nland with its associated\
    \ green water flow. Part of the flows are not sustainably available \nfor productive\
    \ purposes, since rivers require environmental flows and at least 17% of the \n\
    land needs to be protected to conserve terrestrial biodiversity according to Aichi\
    \ \nBiodiversity Target (ABT) 11. Blue water scarcity – the degree to which blue\
    \ water \nconsumption approaches maximum sustainable levels – has been recognized\
    \ as a global \nrisk and thoroughly studied. A similar assessment for green water\
    \ does not exist yet, \nwhich is remarkable given that three-fifths of precipitation\
    \ over land becomes green \nwater – the predominant source of water for agriculture\
    \ and forestry. Here, we show \nhow the world’s limited green water resources\
    \ are allocated to different purposes and \nwhere we approach or overshoot maximum\
    \ sustainable levels. We find that green water \nis scarcer than blue water in\
    \ 91 out of 163 countries, and that humanity is closer to the \nplanetary boundary\
    \ for green water (56% appropriation) than for blue water (27-54% \nappropriation).\
    \ Human’s green water footprint – the green water resources allocated to \nproductive\
    \ purposes – is close to or beyond the maximum sustainable level in Europe, \n\
    Central America, the Middle East and South Asia. Globally, 18% of the green water\
    \ \nfootprint is in areas to be reserved for nature. In quantifying the limits\
    \ to green water \navailability, the main source of water to produce food, feed,\
    \ fibre, timber and bio-energy, \nwe emphasize the critical role green water has\
    \ to play in the discourse on freshwater \nscarcity. \n6.1. Introduction \nPrecipitation,\
    \ the undifferentiated source of freshwater, partitions into blue and green \n\
    water flows (Falkenmark, 2000) (Figure 6-1). Whereas the further partitioning\
    \ of the blue \nwater flow into utilizable, non-utilizable, environmental and\
    \ utilized flows is known, \nthis is not the case for the much larger green water\
    \ flow. The implicit allocation of green \nwater through land-use decisions, the\
    \ lack of a price and its invisibility in the landscape \nmake that green water\
    \ – in contrast to blue water – is off the radar for economists and \npersists\
    \ to be a blind spot for policy makers. \n116 \n \nFigure 6-1. The partitioning\
    \ of precipitation over land into blue and green water flows. \nBoth flows further\
    \ partition into environmental and non-utilizable (or non-accessible) \nflows,\
    \ flows allocated to human activities (i.e. water footprint) and under-utilized\
    \ flows \nbelow the maximum sustainable level. This further partitioning is known\
    \ for the blue \nwater flow (Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2016; Gerten et al., 2013),\
    \ but unknown for the green \nwater flow. The ratio of the actual to the maximum\
    \ sustainable water footprint shows \nthe extent to which limited water resources\
    \ have been allocated to human activities and \nis thus an indicator of the degree\
    \ of water scarcity. \nOnly starting from the 1990s, scholars realized the importance\
    \ of green water flows to \nagriculture, forestry and urban areas (Postel et al.,\
    \ 1996; Rockström et al., 1999). Since \nwater allocated to one purpose will no\
    \ longer be available in the same area and time \nperiod for another purpose,\
    \ there is a limitation to our green water footprint (WFg), \nwhich measures the\
    \ level of consumption of green water resources (Hoekstra, 2017). As \nthe world\
    \ population grows and consumes more animal products, the demand for food, \n\
    feed, fibre, timber and bio-energy increases, and so does the WFg of humanity.\
    \ Because \nthe amount of land and associated rainwater is limited, there is a\
    \ maximum sustainable \nlevel to WFg. Moreover, biodiversity conservation (Pouzols\
    \ et al., 2014) and other \necosystem services put a claim on land and the associated\
    \ rainwater too, thereby \nconstraining the expansion and intensification of land\
    \ use (Kehoe et al., 2017). To date, \nthe maximum sustainable green water footprint\
    \ (WFg,m) has not been quantified. \nAlthough the need for a planetary boundary\
    \ on green water (PBg) has been recognized \n117 \n(Gerten et al., 2013), previous\
    \ research efforts only considered the planetary boundary \non blue water (Steffen\
    \ et al., 2015). \nRecently, indicators for combined green-blue water scarcity\
    \ have been developed \n(Rockström et al., 2009; Gerten et al., 2011; Kummu et\
    \ al., 2014), comparing a \nhypothetical water demand for food self-sufficiency\
    \ to the natural water endowment of a \nregion, which can provide useful information\
    \ on potential food self-sufficiency in a \nregion (Schyns et al., 2015). However,\
    \ these indicators are not suitable for measuring the \ndegree to which limited\
    \ green water resources have been actually allocated to human \nactivities (Schyns\
    \ et al., 2015). First, they do not account for green water consumption \nassociated\
    \ with the actual production pattern, which includes green water use related to\
    \ \nproduction for export. Second, because of their focus on food, they exclude\
    \ the WFg of \nwood production (Schyns et al., 2017). Third, green water availability\
    \ in these water \nscarcity indicators is taken as the green water flow from existing\
    \ agricultural land, which \nexcludes green water flows on currently non-utilized\
    \ yet potentially utilizable lands. \nFourth, with these indicators a high degree\
    \ of green water scarcity can be masked by a \nlow degree of blue water scarcity,\
    \ which makes them unsuitable to identify areas where \ncompetition is essentially\
    \ about green water (Schyns et al., 2015). \nWe aim to illustrate the critical\
    \ role green water plays in the discourse on freshwater \nscarcity, by quantifying\
    \ the allocation of the world’s green water resources and \ncomparing green WFs\
    \ to regional maximum sustainable levels of green water \navailability.  \n6.2.\
    \ Method and Data \nWe estimate WFg of crop production, livestock grazing, wood\
    \ production and urban \nareas at a 5 x 5 arc minute grid cell spatial resolution,\
    \ using a sophisticated allocation \nprocedure that includes accounting for ecosystem\
    \ services provided by forests and \npastures. For each grid cell, we calculate\
    \ green water under-utilization (WFg < WFg,m) or \nover-utilization (WFg > WFg,m).\
    \ Next, we express the degree of green water scarcity (WSg) \nper country as the\
    \ ratio of the country sum of WFg to the country sum of WFg,m (Figure 6-\n1).\
    \ Last, we estimate the global fraction of green water resources appropriation\
    \ as the \nratio of the global aggregate WFg to the global aggregate WFg,m, whereby\
    \ the latter can be \ninterpreted as the planetary boundary for green water (PBg).\
    \ \n \n \n118 \n6.2.1. Actual Green Water Footprints of Crop and Wood Production\
    \ \nWFg of crop production is estimated for 126 crops with a grid-based soil water\
    \ balance \nmodel at 5 x 5 arc minute spatial resolution for the period 1996-2005\
    \ taken from \nMekonnen & Hoekstra (2011a). We averaged WFg of wood production\
    \ for 2000-2009 at \n30 x 30 arc minute from Schyns et al. (2017) and downscaled\
    \ this to 5 x 5 arc minute \nbased on an equal share for all grid cells that are\
    \ not strictly protected. \n6.2.2. Actual Green Water Footprint of Urban Areas\
    \ \nWFg of urban areas is estimated at 5 x 5 arc minute resolution by multiplying\
    \ urban areas \nwith an estimate of the average annual evaporation rate from urban\
    \ areas for 2000-2009. \nWe first estimated urban areas at 0.05 x 0.05 degree\
    \ resolution by multiplying fractional \nurban cover with the grid cell area,\
    \ after which we aggregated absolute areas to 5 x 5 arc \nminute resolution. The\
    \ map (Friedl & Sulla-Menashe, 2015) of fractional urban cover for \nthe year\
    \ 2012 is based on Friedl et al. (2010) and Schneider et al. (2010). The annual\
    \ \nevaporation rate from urban area Eg (m/y) in grid cell x is estimated using\
    \ the formula by \nZhang et al. (2001) based on the average annual precipitation\
    \ P (m/y) and potential \nevaporation E0 (m/y) for the period 2000-2009 – both\
    \ estimated from daily climate data at \n30 x 30 arc minute resolution (De Graaf\
    \ et al., 2014) – and a dimensionless coefficient \nrepresenting plant water availability\
    \ w. Based on an average for 386 European cities \n(Fuller & Gaston, 2009), we\
    \ assumed urban area is made up of 20% green space and 80% \nbuilt-up cover. For\
    \ green space (grass-like cover), we applied a w of 0.5 and for built-up \ncover\
    \ a w of 0.1, which represents very low ability to store water in or on the surface\
    \ \nreadily available for evaporation (Zhang et al., 2001). \n6.2.3. Actual Green\
    \ Water Footprint of Livestock Grazing \nWe estimated WFg of grazing per year\
    \ at 5 x 5 arc minute resolution and then averaged it \nfor 2000-2009. First,\
    \ for the locations where livestock is present (see next paragraph) we \nestimated\
    \ the area used for grazing as the area of permanent meadows and pastures \nminus\
    \ the area of harvested fodder grasses (which are included in WFg of crop \nproduction).\
    \ Second, we estimated the total green water flow over the area used for \ngrazing\
    \ by multiplication with an actual evaporation rate of grazed grassland. Third,\
    \ we \nattributed a fraction of this total green water flow to grazing, based\
    \ on the ratio of the \neconomic value of meat and milk production from grazed\
    \ lands to the total value of \ngrazing lands (which also includes the values\
    \ of other ecosystem services that these \nlands provide, see below). Materials\
    \ are described in the Table D-1 (Appendix D.1). Our \nWFg of grazing estimate\
    \ is discussed in the context of previous assessments in Appendix \nD.3. \n119\
    \ \n6.2.4. Spatiotemporal Distribution of Animal Heads per Production System \n\
    First, we estimated the number of grazing animals at 5 x 5 arc minute resolution\
    \ for each \nyear in 2000-2009. Second, we determined per grid cell per year the\
    \ spread of these \nanimals over these two production systems: pastoral and mixed/landless.\
    \ We considered \nthe following grazing animal categories: dairy cattle, non-dairy\
    \ cattle, asses, buffaloes, \ncamels, horses, mules, llamas, sheep and goats.\
    \ We disaggregated national annual \nstatistics on stocks of these animal categories\
    \ (FAO, 2016c) to a 5 x 5 arc minute grid, \nusing weights derived from livestock\
    \ distribution data (Robinson et al., 2014; Wint & \nRobinson, 2007). To obtain\
    \ the weight per 5 x 5 arc minute grid cell, we first converted \nlivestock densities\
    \ (Robinson et al., 2014; Wint & Robinson, 2007) – available at a finer \nresolution\
    \ – to absolute heads by multiplying density with the grid cell area, and \naggregated\
    \ those numbers to 5 x 5 arc minute resolution. Second, we calculated from \n\
    this map the weight per grid cell as the ratio of animal heads in the grid cell\
    \ to the total \nanimals heads present in the country. The spread of the animals\
    \ over the two production \nsystems per grid cell is based on Robinson et al.\
    \ (2011) and the change in production \nover these two systems during our study\
    \ period is estimated based on a an annual rate \nof change derived from Bouwman\
    \ et al. (2005) (Table D-1, Appendix D.1). \n6.2.5. Attribution of the Green Water\
    \ Flow to the Productive Use Based on a Value \nFraction \nWhile the generation\
    \ of other ecosystem services on cropland is often assumed \nnegligible in water\
    \ accounting exercises (all evaporation during the growing season is \naccounted\
    \ to crop production) (Rost et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Mekonnen & Hoekstra,\
    \ \n2011a; Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012), land that is utilized for livestock grazing\
    \ or wood \nproduction may also generate a significant amount of other ecosystem\
    \ service values \n(Costanza et al., 1997; Costanza et al., 2014). For these lands,\
    \ we therefore only attributed \na part of the year-round green water flow to\
    \ the productive uses. Following Schyns et al. \n(2017), this attribution is based\
    \ on a value fraction that is defined as the ratio of the \nmonetary value of\
    \ the productive use to the total monetary value of the ecosystem \nservices generated\
    \ on a unit of land. As the land utilization rate (Ά) approaches the \nmaximum\
    \ sustainable land utilization rate (Άm), the value of the productive use \nincreases,\
    \ but the value of some of the ecosystem services get reduced, while some other\
    \ \necosystem services maintain their value irrespective of Ά (see Figure D-7,\
    \ Appendix D.2). \nFor livestock grazing, we estimated the value fraction of meat\
    \ and milk production from \ngrazing pastures per country for each year in the\
    \ period 2000-2009. We use global \necosystem service values of grasslands for\
    \ 2011 (Costanza et al., 2014), which we \n120 \ndistributed over grazed and non-grazed\
    \ grasslands. We then estimate per country per \nyear the value of meat and milk\
    \ production and the value of ecosystem services that are \ninversely proportional\
    \ to the intensity of grazing (see below) as described in Table D-2 \n(Appendix\
    \ D.1). \n6.2.6. Estimation of the Intensity of Grazing \nThe intensity of grazing\
    \ (΅) in a country is estimated per year as the ratio of the total \ngrass consumed\
    \ through grazing by animals to the maximum sustainable grass \nproduction on\
    \ grazed pastures. The total grass consumed through grazing by animals is \nestimated\
    \ backwards from national annual statistics on meat and milk production in two\
    \ \nsteps. First, we converted meat and milk production per animal category per\
    \ production \nsystem to the associated total grass consumed (including fodder\
    \ grasses that are not \ndirectly grazed, but harvested and fed to livestock later)\
    \ using feed conversion \nefficiencies and the fraction of grass in feed (Table\
    \ D-1, Appendix D.1). Second, we \nestimated the grass consumed by all animals\
    \ in a production system and subtracted the \nproduction of fodder grasses from\
    \ the total grass consumed in the intensive system \n(assuming that fodder grasses\
    \ are fed to livestock in this system within the country in \nthat year). The\
    \ maximum sustainable grass production on grazed pastures is estimated \nby multiplying\
    \ the area used for grazing with the maximum sustainable grass yield. In \ncases\
    \ where ΅ exceeds one – i.e. grazed grass consumption is larger than the sustainable\
    \ \ngrass production on grazed pastures – we assumed fully intensive use of the\
    \ grazed \npastures, but limited the grass consumed through grazing to the sustainable\
    \ grass \nproduction on grazed pastures. This happens in small and arid countries\
    \ with a \nsubstantial livestock sector that in practice relies on imported animal\
    \ feed. \n6.2.7. Land Set Aside for Nature: Protected Areas and Global Priority\
    \ Areas for \nProtection \nProtected area polygons (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC, 2016) were\
    \ converted to a discrete \nraster of 5 x 5 arc minute grid cells, whereby a grid\
    \ cell is considered fully protected if \n>50% is covered by a protected area\
    \ polygon. Following Schyns et al. (2017) and Smith et \nal. (2012), we only considered\
    \ strictly protected areas, including strict nature reserves \n(IUCN category\
    \ Ia), wilderness areas (IUCN category Ib) and national parks (IUCN \ncategory\
    \ II). Priority areas for protection, representing the most suitable 17% of the\
    \ \nterrestrial land for protection based on conservation value, were obtained\
    \ from Pouzols \net al. (2014) using the map for present land-use conditions.\
    \ We resampled the original \ndiscrete 0.2 x 0.2 degree raster to 5 x 5 arc minute.\
    \ \n121 \n6.2.8. Maximum Sustainable Green Water Footprints on Non-Utilized Utilizable\
    \ Land \nTo estimate WFg,m for utilizable lands that are currently non-utilized,\
    \ we first needed to \nidentify where these lands are located. For this, we used\
    \ – besides the land set aside for \nnature – three maps at 5 x 5 arc minute resolution:\
    \ global land cover for 2012 (Friedl et \nal., 2010), existing cropland around\
    \ 2000 (Ramankutty et al., 2008) and non-accessible or \nnon-productive land (Erb\
    \ et al., 2007). We also used a map of agricultural suitability that \nconsiders\
    \ rain-fed conditions (and irrigation on currently irrigated areas) and several\
    \ \nconstraints on climate, soil and slope (Zabel et al., 2014). This map represents\
    \ the \nmaximum suitability index (ranging from 0 to 100) of 16 crops at 30 x\
    \ 30 arc second \nresolution, which we resampled to 5 x 5 arc minute using the\
    \ average suitability index. \nWe applied several constraints to determine non-utilized\
    \ yet utilizable land for crop \nproduction or livestock grazing. Land is considered\
    \ non-utilized yet utilizable if: \n\x83 \nland \ncover \nis \nopen \nshrublands,\
    \ \nsavannas, \ngrasslands, \ncroplands, \ncropland/natural vegetation, barren/sparsely\
    \ vegetated (similar to previous \nstudies we do not consider agricultural expansion\
    \ into forests (Lambin & \nMeyfroidt, 2011; Smith et al., 2012; Eitelberg et al.,\
    \ 2015)); \n\x83 \nagro-ecologically suitable (suitability index > 0); \n\x83\
    \ \nnot classified as non-accessible or non-productive; \n\x83 \nnot set aside\
    \ for nature; \n\x83 \nnot currently utilized (utilized area is subtracted from\
    \ grid cell total area); \n\x83 \nresulting area is reduced by 15% to account\
    \ for previously unaccounted land \nuses that reduce the potentially available\
    \ land for agriculture (Eitelberg et al., \n2015); \n\x83 \ngrid cells with a\
    \ suitability index ǃ40 are considered suitable for crop \nproduction, the rest\
    \ is considered suitable for grazing. \nLand is considered non-utilized yet utilizable\
    \ for wood production if: \n\x83 \nland cover is evergreen needleleaf forest,\
    \ evergreen broadleaf forest, deciduous \nneedleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf\
    \ forest, mixed forest, closed shrublands or \nwoody savannas; \n\x83 \nnot classified\
    \ as non-accessible or non-productive; \n\x83 \nnot set aside for nature; \n\x83\
    \ \naverage actual annual forest evaporation ǃ100 mm/y (Schyns et al., 2017);\
    \ \n\x83 \nnot currently utilized (utilized area is subtracted from grid cell\
    \ total area); \n122 \n\x83 \nresulting area is reduced by 15% to account for\
    \ previously unaccounted land \nuses that reduce the potentially available land\
    \ for wood production (Eitelberg \net al., 2015). \nNon-utilized utilizable land\
    \ for crop production has a WFg,m equal to the fraction · of the \nyear-round\
    \ green water flow that is representative for the green water flow during the\
    \ \n(potential) crop growing period. The year-round green water flow is estimated\
    \ based on \nthe method proposed by Zhang et al. (2001), with E0 as Penman-Monteith\
    \ FAO reference \npotential evaporation (assuming a crop factor of 1.0) and w\
    \ at 0.5. Hanasaki et al. (2010) \nestimated · at roughly 0.6 (major crops). Liu\
    \ & Yang (2010) found that about 80% of \nevaporation from cropland (incl. blue\
    \ water) took place within the crop growing period \n(major crops). This value\
    \ is rather high, since it includes blue water that is applied \nduring the crop\
    \ growing season. We carried out a global simulation of wheat for the \nperiod\
    \ 1961-2010 (unpublished work) with the AquaCrop model (Steduto et al., 2009),\
    \ \nthereby separating green and blue evaporation (Chukalla et al., 2015). From\
    \ this \nsimulation, we found that · varies from 0.6 in the tropics to 0.7 or\
    \ 0.8 in the temperate \nand boreal zones. We decided to use a spatially-uniform\
    \ · of 0.7. \nNon-utilized utilizable land for livestock grazing and wood production\
    \ has a WFg,m \nequal to the attributed fraction of the year-round green water\
    \ flow at the maximum \nsustainable land utilization rate. For livestock grazing,\
    \ the year-round green water flow \nis taken from Rolinski et al. (2017) (Table\
    \ D-1, Appendix D.1) and the value fraction is \nestimated assuming that animals\
    \ are kept in a pastoral system (which determines the \nvalue of food production\
    \ via the fraction of grass in the animal diet and the feed \nconversion efficiency).\
    \ For wood production, the year-round green water flow is \nestimated based on\
    \ the method proposed by Zhang et al. (2001), in which E0 is estimated \nbased\
    \ on mean annual temperature T (ŴC) (De Graaf et al., 2014) using the empirical\
    \ \nequation derived in Komatsu et al. (2012), and w is 2.0 (Schyns et al., 2017).\
    \ Last, we \nassumed there is no contribution from capillary rise (blue water).\
    \ \n6.2.9. Green Water Flow from Land Set Aside for Nature and Non-Utilizable\
    \ Land \nThe non-utilizable land is estimated by subtracting utilizable area from\
    \ the total area at \nthe grid cell level. The year-round green water flow from\
    \ land set aside for nature and \nnon-utilizable land is estimated based on the\
    \ method proposed by Zhang et al. (2001). \nThe values for E0 and w depend on\
    \ the land cover in a 5 x 5 arc minute grid cell (Friedl et \nal., 2010). For\
    \ wood cover (IGBP classes 1-6, 8), we used a w of 2.0 and estimated E0 as \n\
    described above. For grass-like cover (IGBP classes 7,9,10,12,14,16), E0 is estimated\
    \ using \n123 \nPenman-Monteith FAO reference evaporation, and w is set at 0.5.\
    \ We assumed there is \nno green water flow from the land cover types permanent\
    \ wetlands (class IGBP class 11) \nand snow and ice (IGBP class 15). \n6.2.10.\
    \ \nBlue Water Scarcity per Country \nBlue water scarcity (WSb) per country is\
    \ calculated by first dividing the blue water \nfootprint of national production\
    \ (WFb) by the maximum sustainable blue water footprint \n(WFb,m) on a monthly\
    \ scale, and subsequently taking the average of these monthly ratios. \nMonthly\
    \ WFb has been obtained from Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2011b). WFb,m has been \ncalculated\
    \ by subtracting the environmental flow requirement (EFR) from the total \nrenewable\
    \ water resources (TRWR) of a country. Estimates on annual TRWR per country \n\
    were taken from (FAO, 2012a) and we subsequently converted these annual estimates\
    \ \ninto monthly values using hydrographs from the Composite Runoff V1.0 database\
    \ \n(Fekete et al., 2002). Following Hoekstra et al. (2012), we allocated 80%\
    \ of natural runoff \nas EFR in accordance with the precautionary rule proposed\
    \ in Richter et al. (2012). \n6.3. Results \nWe found that with a global WFg of\
    \ 9.9x10³ km³/y, humanity appropriates 56% of the \nplanetary boundary for green\
    \ water (18x10³ km³/y). The total global WFg (Figure D-1, \nAppendix D.2) is made\
    \ up of 5.7x10³ km³/y for crop production (58%), 2.9x10³ km³/y for \nlivestock\
    \ grazing (29%), 0.9x10³ km³/y for wood production (9%) and 0.3x10³ km³/y for\
    \ \nurban areas (3%) (Figure 6-2). On the contrary, the blue water footprint of\
    \ humanity – \nestimated at 1.0x10³ km³/y (Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012) to 1.5x10³\
    \ km³/y (Wada et al., \n2014) – is only 27% respectively 38% of the most-cited\
    \ planetary boundary for blue water \n(Steffen et al., 2015), or 37% respectively\
    \ 54% if a stricter boundary is used (Gerten et al., \n2013). Humanity is therefore\
    \ closer to the planetary boundary for green than for blue \nwater. \n124 \nFigure\
    \ 6-2. Allocation of the total green water flow from the terrestrial Earth surface\
    \ \n(72x10³ km³/y). Values are in thousand km3/y. \nThe total appropriation of\
    \ green water is approaching or exceeding the maximum \nsustainable level in Europe,\
    \ Central America, the Middle East and South Asia (Figure 6-\n3). Striking examples\
    \ of countries with a high degree of WSg are the United Kingdom \n(1.3), Germany\
    \ (1.8) and the Netherlands (2.5), since these countries have ample rainfall \n\
    and consequently a large green water flow. However, they also fully utilize that\
    \ flow \nand even tap into green water flows in lands designated as priority areas\
    \ for protection. \n125 \n \nFigure 6-3. Green water scarcity (WSg) per country,\
    \ expressed as the ratio of the national \naggregate WFg to the national aggregate\
    \ WFg,m. Countries with WSg = 1 are fully utilizing \ntheir available green water\
    \ flow or under- and over-utilization cancel each other out at \nthe country scale.\
    \ WFg, WFg,m and WSg per country are included in Table D-3 (Appendix \nD.1). \n\
    \ \nFigure 6-4. The ratio of green water scarcity to blue water scarcity per country.\
    \ Green \nwater scarcity is defined as the actual divided by the maximum sustainable\
    \ green water \nfootprint. Blue water scarcity is defined as the annual average\
    \ of monthly ratios of actual \nto maximum sustainable blue water footprint (see\
    \ Methods). In 12 countries both green \nand blue water scarcity are low (<0.2):\
    \ Angola, Botswana, Congo, Congo (DRC), Gabon, \nGuyana, Iceland, Mongolia, Mozambique,\
    \ Namibia, Suriname, and Zambia. In Vietnam, \ngreen and blue water scarcity are\
    \ equally high (1.3). Out of the 150 countries remaining, \ngreen water is scarcer\
    \ in 91 countries and blue water is scarcer in 59 countries. \nGreen water is\
    \ scarcer than blue water in 91 out of 163 countries (Figure 6-4), meaning \n\
    that the degree of human appropriation of sustainably available green water resources\
    \ is \nlarger than the degree of human appropriation of sustainably available\
    \ blue water \nresources in those countries. While blue water scarcity is dominant\
    \ in large parts of \nAfrica, the Middle East, Ukraine, India, Mexico and several\
    \ Mediterranean countries, \n126 \ngreen water is more than four times scarcer\
    \ than blue water in South America, Canada, \nparts of Europe, Scandinavia, Russia\
    \ and Southeast Asia. \nAn alarming 18% of WFg is in areas that should be set\
    \ aside for nature to comply with \nABT 11. This over-utilized green water flow\
    \ (1.8x10³ km3/y) mainly concerns the WFg of \ncrop production (51%) and grazing\
    \ (35%), followed by wood production (11%) and \nurban areas (3%). More than half\
    \ the overshoot occurs in just ten countries: United States \n(8.6%), Brazil (6.9%),\
    \ Indonesia (6.4%), India (5.2%), China (5.0%), Colombia (4.9%), \nPhilippines\
    \ (4.4%), Mexico (4.0%), Germany (3.2%) and Malaysia (2.4%). On the other \nhand,\
    \ world-wide 9.5x103 km3/y of WFg,m is under-utilized, of which over half is located\
    \ \nin just six countries: Russia (15.3%), Brazil (9.9%), Canada (8.0%), United\
    \ States (7.5%), \nChina (6.3%) and Australia (6.3%). In Russia, Canada and the\
    \ United States, the under-\nutilized flow predominantly indicates unleveraged\
    \ potential for wood production, while \nin Brazil, China and Australia, livestock\
    \ grazing could be intensified or expanded. \nCountries in which over-utilization\
    \ exceeds under-utilization (Figure D-2, Appendix \nD.2) need to reduce their\
    \ internal WFg in order to respect WFg,m. In countries where over-\nutilization\
    \ is below under-utilization, increased use of the under-utilized flow could \n\
    compensate for the green water resources that will no longer be available if priority\
    \ \nareas for nature get fully protected. For maps of over- and under-utilization\
    \ of the green \nwater flow per purpose see Figures D-3 to D-6 (Appendix D.2).\
    \ \n6.4. Discussion and Conclusions \nThis first quantification of global green\
    \ water scarcity is conservative for three reasons. \nFirst, although we applied\
    \ several restrictions to identify non-utilized yet utilizable \nlands for crop\
    \ cultivation, grazing or wood production, we may have overlooked other \nfactors\
    \ that prevent actual utilization (e.g. maintenance of local livelihoods or \n\
    biodiversity). Our estimate of non-utilized yet utilizable land with at least\
    \ moderate \nsuitability for crop production (306x106 ha) is comparable to a previous\
    \ global-scale \nestimate of unused potential cropland (Lambin & Meyfroidt, 2011),\
    \ but higher than \nwhen local trade-offs associated with land utilization are\
    \ taken into account (Lambin et \nal., 2013). Second, we assume that intensification\
    \ of livestock grazing and wood \nproduction is possible up to a maximum sustainable\
    \ land utilization rate. However, \nthere may be factors that limit increased\
    \ utilization. For instance, in Namibia, livestock \nraising is constrained by\
    \ a reliable source of drinking water rather than the quantity of \nforage (Sweet,\
    \ 1998). Third, we set aside land for nature based on the map of global \npriority\
    \ areas to achieve 17% of land protection (Pouzols et al., 2014). This map (Pouzols\
    \ \net al., 2014) reflects an efficient way of protecting biodiversity, since\
    \ grid cells are \n127 \nprioritized based on conservation value. To achieve similar\
    \ conservation value in a \ndifferent, less efficient, configuration, probably\
    \ more land would need to be protected, \nlikely resulting in a smaller PBg, more\
    \ overshoot and higher WSg ratios. . In the end, the \nWSg ratio is the most sensitive\
    \ to the land set aside for nature and the under-utilized \ngreen water flow,\
    \ which in turn is mainly determined by maximum sustainable land \nutilization\
    \ rates and the value of ecosystem services in grazing and forestry systems. We\
    \ \nrecommend future work that aims to improve upon our first estimate of green\
    \ water \nscarcity to focus on these areas. \nGreen water is allocated through\
    \ land-use decisions, driven by a demand for biomass-\nbased products. Such decisions\
    \ are made for time horizons of several years and are \ngenerally a matter of\
    \ national concern.  We therefore measured WSg at the country scale \nfor a ten-year\
    \ average period, in contrast to blue water scarcity, which is best measured \n\
    month-by-month at the catchment scale or smaller (Mekonnen & Hoekstra, 2016).\
    \ The \ncomparison of the degree of green versus blue water scarcity in Figure\
    \ 6-4 should not be \ninterpreted in terms of one being more important (e.g. having\
    \ more impact) than the \nother. The impact of 1 m3 of green water consumed cannot\
    \ easily be compared to the \nimpact of 1 m3 of blue water consumed, even not\
    \ when it is in the same catchment area. \nImpact is subject to the way it is\
    \ defined and the local context. Increasing blue water \nscarcity, defined as\
    \ the ratio of blue water consumption to blue water availability in a \ncertain\
    \ restricted geographic area and time period, generally translates to reduced\
    \ river \nflows and declining groundwater, river and lake levels, which affects\
    \ ecosystems and \npeople depending on these flows and levels. Growing blue water\
    \ scarcity also results in \nlarger competition over blue water resources. Increasing\
    \ green water scarcity implies \nthat less and less green water resources are\
    \ left to natural vegetation and that \ncompetition over green water resources\
    \ is increasing. The combination of blue and green \nwater scarcity limit the\
    \ amount of food, feed, fibre and bio-energy that can be produced. \nOver-utilization\
    \ of blue water threatens aquatic biodiversity and over-use of green water \n\
    threatens terrestrial biodiversity; the precise impact depends in both cases on\
    \ the local \ncontext. The existing biodiversity determines the potential impact\
    \ of the over-use. For \nexample, in heavily regulated rivers, not so rich in\
    \ biodiversity anymore, additional \nabstraction of blue water for increased production\
    \ on irrigated cropland, will have less \nenvironmental impact compared to grabbing\
    \ some additional green water flow by \nconverting a natural grassland into rain-fed\
    \ agriculture (to achieve a similar production \nincrease). Hydrological impacts\
    \ of blue or green water use are different as well. Blue \nwater use has a direct\
    \ hydrological impact, because blue water that is used turns into \n128 \nevaporation,\
    \ and blue water that is not used remains in the river. In the case of green \n\
    water used or not used, in both cases we talk about evaporation and the hydrological\
    \ \nimpact is generally marginal (only the difference between natural evaporation\
    \ versus \ncropland evaporation). This paper is not about hydrological or biodiversity\
    \ impacts, but \nabout water scarcity (% of appropriation of limited water resources\
    \ availability). \nOur results demonstrate that many regions have no or very limited\
    \ potential remaining \nto allocate more green water to the production of food,\
    \ feed, fibre, timber and bio-\nenergy. This has implications for both local economies\
    \ and the global economy as a \nwhole. For a sustainable future, overshoot should\
    \ be prevented and the green water \nresources below the maximum sustainable level\
    \ should be used as productive as \npossible. This requires protection of sufficient\
    \ lands and associated green water flows for \nnature and a contraction of human\
    \ activities in areas with high conservation value. \nRegions with a large under-utilized\
    \ green water flow could exploit that potential and \nplay an important role in\
    \ meeting the future demand for biomass-based products. \nEfficient use of green\
    \ water requires increased water and land productivities in \nagricultural and\
    \ forestry systems (Foley et al., 2011) through management of the full \nrange\
    \ of ecosystem services along the lines of sustainable intensification (Rockström\
    \ et \nal., 2017). \n \n129 \n7. \nConclusion \nThe goal of this thesis is to\
    \ broaden the discourse on freshwater scarcity in two respects. \nFirst, by assessing\
    \ how Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) for a country can contribute \nto more\
    \ sustainable and efficient allocation of blue water resources. Second, by assessing\
    \ \nthe allocation of the world’s green water resources with respect to maximum\
    \ sustainable \nlevels. \n7.1. Insights from Water Footprint Assessment to Enrich\
    \ National Policies \nto Manage Blue Water Scarcity \nBased on case studies for\
    \ Morocco (Chapter 2) and Jordan (Chapter 3), I conclude that \nexisting national\
    \ policies for sustainable and efficient use of blue water resources can be \n\
    enriched by WFA. \nFirst, WFA feeds discussion on whether water is efficiently\
    \ allocated, by showing the \nwater footprint of end-purposes and the associated\
    \ economic value: \n\x83 \nIn Morocco, the crops that have the largest water and\
    \ land footprints in \nabsolute terms, have the lowest economic water (US$/m3)\
    \ and land (US$/ha) \nproductivities, respectively. Such an analysis can illustrate\
    \ the degree of \n(dis)alignment between policies on water and agriculture. \n\
    \x83 \nAnalysis of virtual water exports discloses the (implicit) water allocation\
    \ to \nproducts destined for foreign consumers and feeds a debate on whether the\
    \ \ngenerated income outweighs the (increased) costs induced by internal water\
    \ \nscarcity and pollution. \nSecond, WFA can provide enriching insights in pressures\
    \ on blue water resources: \n\x83 \nWater pollution aggravates blue water scarcity\
    \ in Morocco and Jordan to a \ndegree that is made explicit by the grey water\
    \ footprint, which measures the \nvolume of water needed to assimilate pollutants\
    \ to meet ambient water quality \nstandards. \n\x83 \nAnalysis of the total blue\
    \ water footprint in a basin versus blue water \navailability per month, reveals\
    \ that blue water scarcity is particularly high in \nseveral months of the year\
    \ in Morocco – which is masked when the analysis is \ndone per year (as is common\
    \ practice) – and helps target measures to reduce \nblue water scarcity when the\
    \ largest water consumers in these months are \nidentified. \n130 \nThird, WFA\
    \ reveals options to reduce water demand by changing production and \nconsumption\
    \ patterns, which can lead to significant savings compared to traditional \nmeasures\
    \ considered in water management: \n\x83 \nCompared to traditional water supply\
    \ increasing measures planned for \nMorocco, large potential water savings are\
    \ associated with lowering crop water \nfootprints to benchmark levels and relocation\
    \ of crop production based on \nspatial differences in water footprints. \n\x83\
    \ \nCampaigns aimed at reducing the water footprint of the diet of Jordanians\
    \ are \npotentially much more effective in reducing blue water scarcity than those\
    \ \ntargeting the water use at home. \nFourth, WFA emphasizes the risks of being\
    \ dependent on natural resources outside the \ncountry’s borders:  \n\x83 \nAnalysis\
    \ of virtual water imports, reveals a country’s dependency on foreign \nwater\
    \ resources with associated risks, which can be mitigated in a sustainable \n\
    manner by diversifying imports over various trade partners that are under a \n\
    lower degree of water scarcity than the country itself. \n\x83 \nDesalination\
    \ and bulk water transfer projects require careful consideration of \ntheir energy\
    \ supply to avoid increased dependency on fossil and/or foreign \nenergy sources.\
    \ \nThe assessments for Morocco and Jordan have shown that sustainable and efficient\
    \ \nallocation of blue water resources requires integrated policies on water,\
    \ agriculture, \nenergy and trade. Moreover, I found that even in semi-arid countries\
    \ like Morocco and \nJordan, which strongly depend on blue water resources, the\
    \ largest share of the internal \nwater footprint is green. \n7.2. Insights from\
    \ a First Assessment of Green Water Scarcity \nBased on a literature review on\
    \ the concept of green water scarcity and a classification of \nexisting indicators\
    \ of green water availability and scarcity (Chapter 4), I have argued \nthat green\
    \ water is a scarce resource and that appropriate indicators to assess green \n\
    water scarcity are absent. \nSubsequently, in a first time assessment of green\
    \ water scarcity, I have shown how the \nworld’s limited green water resources\
    \ are allocated to different purposes and where we \napproach or overshoot maximum\
    \ sustainable levels (Chapter 6). This assessment \nrequired global gridded estimates\
    \ of green water footprints associated with crop \n131 \nproduction, wood production,\
    \ livestock grazing and urban areas. These were only \navailable for crop production.\
    \ Estimates for the other three purposes have been added in \nthis research (Chapters\
    \ 5 and 6). \nThe main insights from assessing the allocation of the world’s green\
    \ water resources \nwith respect to maximum sustainable levels are: \n\x83 \n\
    Humanity is closer to the planetary boundary for green water (56% \nappropriation)\
    \ than for blue water (27-54% appropriation); \n\x83 \nGreen water is scarcer\
    \ than blue water in 91 out of 163 countries; \n\x83 \nHuman’s green water footprint\
    \ is close to or beyond the maximum sustainable \nlevel in Europe, Central America,\
    \ the Middle East and South Asia; \n\x83 \nGlobally, 18% of the green water footprint\
    \ is in areas to be reserved for nature. \nFor a sustainable future, overshoot\
    \ should be prevented and the green water resources \nbelow the maximum sustainable\
    \ level should be used as productive as possible. This \nrequires protection of\
    \ lands, contraction of activities in areas with high conservation \nvalue and\
    \ efficient production systems with increased water and land productivities \n\
    through management of the full range of ecosystem services along the lines of\
    \ \nsustainable intensification. \n7.3. Recommendations for Further Research \n\
    This research has triggered several questions for further research: \n\x83 \n\
    Reducing crop water footprints to benchmark levels seems to be a promising \n\
    option to significantly reduce the agricultural water footprint, however: How\
    \ \ncan reasonable benchmarks be developed and complied to, considering varying\
    \ agro-\nclimatic conditions in space and time as well as investment constraints?\
    \ \n\x83 \nIntegrated policies on water, agriculture, energy and trade are key\
    \ to achieving \nsustainable water use, though: What are efficient organizational/institutional\
    \ \nstructures to enhance this? \n\x83 \nThe challenge is to increase water and\
    \ land productivities in agricultural and \nforestry systems, while at the same\
    \ time managing the generation of other \necosystem services in these systems.\
    \ Key here is to understand: What is the \nrelationship between increased productivity\
    \ and the generation of other ecosystem \nservices? What are the main factors\
    \ determining this relationship and how case-specific \nare they? \n\x83 \nBoth\
    \ green and blue water consumption are approaching the planetary \nboundaries\
    \ on green and blue water, respectively. Yet there are spatial \n132 \ndifferences\
    \ in the degrees of blue and green water scarcity, so: To which extent \ncan we\
    \ reduce blue water consumption in blue water-scarce areas by increased \nproduction\
    \ in areas with an under-utilized green water flow, and vice versa? \n\x83 \n\
    Green water scarcity has been assessed for the current situation, but: How do\
    \ \nfuture scenarios regarding population growth, land-use change, change in consumption\
    \ \nand production patterns, technology development and climate change affect\
    \ green water \nscarcity? \n7.4. Final Remarks \nDealing with freshwater scarcity\
    \ requires sustainable and efficient allocation of blue and \ngreen water resources.\
    \ This research has shown that national policies to manage blue \nwater scarcity\
    \ can be enriched by detailed analysis of the human water footprint within \n\
    a country and thorough assessment of the virtual water flows leaving and entering\
    \ a \ncountry. I hope that more and more countries will develop coherent inter-sectoral\
    \ \npolicies in a strive for sustainable and efficient water use, informed by\
    \ assessments that \nbroaden the scope of traditional water management. Furthermore,\
    \ by quantifying the \nlimits to green water availability, the main source of\
    \ water to produce food, feed, fibre, \ntimber and bio-energy, this research emphasizes\
    \ the critical role green water has to play \nin the discourse on freshwater scarcity.\
    \ To date, green water scarcity did not receive the \nattention it deserves. I\
    \ hope this research triggers more scientific attention for the topic \nand puts\
    \ it on the radar of policy makers. \n \n \n133 \nList of References \nAbdulla,\

    \ to Chapter 5 \nC.1. Area Used for Roundwood Production \nThe area used for roundwood\
    \ production was estimated based on the Global Forest \nResources Assessment 2015\
    \ (FRA) (Köhl et al., 2015). In the domain “Production”, FRA \ndistinguishes two\
    \ categories, namely production forest area (Aprod) and multiple use \nforest\
    \ area (Amuluse). The latter is defined as “the forest area designated for more\
    \ than one \npurpose and where none of these alone is considered as the predominant\
    \ designated \nfunction” (Köhl et al., 2015). The portion of Amuluse that is used\
    \ for roundwood \nproduction (΅) varies per region, but exact figures are unknown.\
    \ For instance, Köhl et al. \n(2015) deduce from wood removals and the reported\
    \ Aprod and Amuluse per region that \nNorth America produces most wood in multiple\
    \ use forests, while in Europe most \nproduction likely takes place in primary\
    \ production forest. To account for these different \nutilization rates of multiple\
    \ use forest, we calculate ΅ per region as Amuluse/(Aprod+Amuluse). \nThe reasoning\
    \ is that regions that mainly report Amuluse, probably use a larger fraction of\
    \ \nthat area for production compared to regions that mainly report Aprod. We\
    \ then calculate \nper country the forest area used for production as Aprod+΅Amuluse\
    \ for the FRA reporting \nyears 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010, and take the total\
    \ forest area in a country if Aprod and \nAmuluse are not reported. Finally, we\
    \ linearly interpolate between these years and scale the \nwood harvested area\
    \ maps (Section 5.2.4 of main text) to these values per country, using \nthe 1990\
    \ scaling factor for 1961-1989. See Figure C-1 for the area development over time\
    \ \nper biome. \nC.2. Determination of Dominant Forest Type and Climate Zone per\
    \ Grid Cell \nFor each 30 x 30 arc minute grid cell in our wood harvest maps,\
    \ we determined the \ndominant climate and forest type. The dominant climate was\
    \ determined by means of a \nfrequency count on the 5 x 5 arc minute resolution\
    \ map by Van Velthuizen et al. (2007) \nthat distinguishes the following ten climates:\
    \ tropics; subtropics, summer rainfall; \nsubtropics, winter rainfall; temperate,\
    \ oceanic; temperate, sub-continental; temperate, \ncontinental; boreal, oceanic.\
    \ In case of an equal count, we took the colder climate as the \ndominant one.\
    \ Loveland et al. (2009) distinguish five different forest types: evergreen \n\
    needleleaf forest; evergreen broadleaf forest; deciduous needleleaf forest; deciduous\
    \ \nbroadleaf forest; mixed forest. The dominant forest type was determined by\
    \ picking the \nforest type with the maximum fractional cover in a grid cell.\
    \ In rare cases where multiple \n184 \ntypes have the same and maximum fractional\
    \ cover, we arbitrarily selected the first one \noccurring in the alphabet as\
    \ the dominant type. \nC.3. Average Tree Species Yield per Climate Zone \nFirstly,\
    \ we obtained from Brown (2000) the yields for pine, eucalyptus, larch and oak\
    \ for \n84 countries by taking the average of the mentioned yield ranges. Note\
    \ that for many of \nthese countries only yield estimates for one or two of the\
    \ mentioned species was \navailable. Secondly, we determined per country the dominant\
    \ climate zone in the areas \nused for roundwood production (using a similar procedure\
    \ as used to determine the \ndominant climate per grid cell). Thirdly, we calculated\
    \ the long-term maximum \nsustainable annual yield per species and climate zone\
    \ by taking the average of the yield \nper species for all countries with the\
    \ same dominant climate. Therein, we exclude New \nZealand due to its very different\
    \ climate and deviating yield range. The following \nexceptions apply:  \n\x83\
    \ \nFor pine in the (sub)tropics, we took the average for the Pinus caribaea variety\
    \ \nas given in text by Brown (2000). This species is grown throughout the tropics\
    \ \nand in parts of the subtropics (Ugalde & Pérez, 2001). Brown (2000) mentions\
    \ \nyields between 12 and 15 m3/ha/y for Pinus caribaea in Central and South \n\
    America. The average of this range (13.5 m3/ha/y) is about the same as the \n\
    upper limit of the pine yield range in temperate and boreal countries in the \n\
    mid-latitudes (m3/ha/y) (Brown, 2000). \n\x83 \nFor deciduous broadleaf forest\
    \ in the (sub)tropics, eucalyptus is seen as the \ncharacteristic species rather\
    \ than oak, which is not likely to occur in these \nclimate zones. \n\x83 \nFor\
    \ larch in the subtropics, the upper limit of the yield range given in Brown \n\
    (2000) is applied. Generally, higher yields are achieved in (sub)tropical regions\
    \ \ncompared to temperate and boreal regions Brown (2000). \n\x83 \nFor larch\
    \ in the boreal and arctic zones, the lower limit of the yield range given \n\
    in Brown (2000) is applied. \nC.4. Maximum Height of Capillary Rise \nThe maximum\
    \ height of capillary rise (dcap,max, in mm) is estimated using the empirical\
    \ \nrelation by Peck et al. (1974) as cited by Liu et al. (2014): \n10\ncap,max\n\
    D\ne\nC\nd\n×\n=\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Eq. C-1) \n185 \nin which C is a constant\
    \ assumed to be 30 mm2, e the void ratio, and D10 the grain size in \nmm. D10\
    \ is estimated as the square root of the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat)\
    \ of \nthe soil (in cm/s). This is the result of rearranging the formula by Hazen\
    \ (1982) as cited \nby Urumovi° & Urumovi° Sr (2016) for D10 and applying a constant\
    \ that is typically \nassumed 1. Ksat and e for the dominant soil type in a 30\
    \ x 30 arc minute grid cell have \nbeen obtained from de Lannoy et al. (2014).\
    \ To estimate e we needed the porosity, which \nwe estimated following de Lannoy\
    \ et al. (2014) by dividing the soil moisture content at \nsaturation by 0.93.\
    \  \nC.5. Derivation of the Equation for the Volumetric Moisture Content of \n\
    Harvested Wood \nThe amount of water in harvested wood is usually expressed as\
    \ the moisture content, \nwhich is the ratio of the weight of water (wwater, t)\
    \ over the oven-dry weight of the wood \n(wod, t) (Simpson, 1998). The moisture\
    \ content of wood varies with the temperature and \nrelative humidity of the environment.\
    \ When these conditions remain constant, the \nequilibrium moisture content (EMC,\
    \ t/t) will eventually be attained (Simpson, 1998). We \nare interested in the\
    \ volumetric moisture content of harvested wood (m3 water per m3 \nwood): \nwood\n\
    water\nwater\nv\nv\nf\n=\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Eq. C-2) \nIn which vwater (m3)\
    \ is the volume of water incorporated in the wood and vwood (m3) is the \nvolume\
    \ of freshly harvested wood. Since vwater is unknown, we need to rewrite Equation\
    \ \nC-2 based on the EMC and the wood density (d, m3/t): \nod\nwater\nw\nw\nEMC\
    \ =\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Eq. C-3) \nwood\nod\nv\nw\nd =\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n(Eq. C-4) \nSubstituting Equation C-3 in Equation C-4 after rearranging\
    \ for vwood gives: \nEMC\nd\nw\nv\n×\n=\nwater\nwood\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Eq.\
    \ C-5) \n \n186 \nAssuming that 1 m3 water weighs 1 tonne and substituting Equation\
    \ C-5 in Equation C-\n2, yields: \nEMC\nd\nf\n×\nwater =\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    (Eq. C-6) \nC.6. Value Fraction of Roundwood Production \nFirstly, we distribute\
    \ the monetary values per hectare of the ecosystem services over \nproduction\
    \ and non-production forests for the reference year 2010 (Table C-1). Secondly,\
    \ \nwe scale the values back in time and disaggregate them spatially, based on\
    \ the actual \nvolumes of roundwood produced and the intensity of forest exploitation.\
    \ \nThe intensity of forest exploitation (fint, dimensionless) is estimated for\
    \ grid cell x in year \nt as the ratio of the actual roundwood production (Pact,\
    \ in m3/y) over the maximum \nsustainable wood production of the forest (Psus,\
    \ in m3/y). The latter is estimated as the \nlong-term maximum sustainable wood\
    \ yield (Ysus, in m3/m2/y) times the area used for \nroundwood production (Arw,\
    \ in m2): \n¸¸\n¹\n·\n¨¨\n©\n§\n×\n=\n]\n[\n[ ]\n]\n[\n,1\n]\n[\nrw\nsus\nact\n\

    \ in fact equal to the ratio of the actual annual yield (Yact) over the maximum\
    \ \nsustainable annual yield as suggested by Van Oel & Hoekstra (2012). The ratio\
    \ is also \nsimilar to the forest harvesting intensity defined by Levers et al.\
    \ (2014), which is the ratio \nof the harvested timber volume over the net annual\
    \ increment (which equals gross \nannual increment minus natural losses). \n \n\

    \ estimate of the green water footprint (WFg) of grazing falls between previous\
    \ \nestimates that considered the total evaporation from grazing lands and those\
    \ that take \nonly the fraction of this total that relates to the grass actually\
    \ consumed (see Table D-4, \nAppendix D.1). Although our estimate of the total\
    \ grazed grass consumed is comparable \nto the one by Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2012b)\
    \ (2,660x106 t dry matter/y in our study vs. \n2,768x106 t dry matter/y in theirs),\
    \ we estimated the WF per unit of grass grazed to be \nnearly three times larger\
    \ (857 m3/t in our study vs. 297 m3/t in theirs). Mekonnen & \nHoekstra (2012b)\
    \  probably underestimated the WF per unit of grass grazed, because \nthey used\
    \ an average evaporation rate per country for pasture area and assumed the \n\
    pasture yield to be 80% of the yield of fodder crops. De Fraiture et al. (2007)\
    \ assumed the \nWF per unit of grass consumed to be 750 m3/t dry matter (882 m3/t),\
    \ but seem to have \nestimated a much lower total grass consumption when derived\
    \ backwards from their \nglobal WFg of grazing (840 km3/y / 750 m3/t dry matter\
    \ * 1000 = 1,120x106 t dry matter/y). \nOur estimate of total grass consumption\
    \ seems to be more reasonable, since it not only \ncompares well to Mekonnen &\
    \ Hoekstra (2012b), but to Bouwman et al. (2005) for the \n211 \nyear 1995 as\
    \ well (2,445x106 t dry matter/y in our study vs. 2,400x106 t dry matter/y in\
    \ \ntheirs). Furthermore, our global estimate of WFg of grazing might be higher\
    \ than the \nestimates by De Fraiture et al. (2007) and Mekonnen & Hoekstra (2012b),\
    \ because our \nestimate of the total evaporation from grazing lands (12.5x103\
    \ km3/y for 1985-1999) is on \nthe high side of the spectrum, similar to that\

    \ \nThailand is known as a top producer of many essential agricultural commodities\
    \ including \ncanary seeds, cassava, mango, mangosteen, guava, and chili pepper.\
    \ Due to global warming \nand population growth, droughts are increasing and water\
    \ is becoming scarce, which have a \ndirect impact on agriculture. Farmers are\
    \ therefore facing difficulties in supplying their crops \nwith sufficient water\
    \ due to water scarcity and the increasing irrigation cost. This situation \n\
    calls for optimal use of irrigation water in agriculture, which is sufficient\
    \ to avoid crop water \nstress and at the same time help to sustain water and\
    \ reduce irrigation expenses.  \n \nMethodolgy/approach: With the number of smartphone\
    \ users in the world exceeding 3.5 \nbillion, this app uses geospatial data and\
    \ the Water Balance Approach to estimate the optimal \nirrigation cycle in the\
    \ current month in Thailand using Java.  \n \nResult: This app would result in\
    \ significant water savings and a less costly irrigation process \nfor both large\
    \ farms and private gardens in subsistence agriculture. \n \nConclusion: The proposed\
    \ smartphone app captures the unique characteristics of the weather \nand soil\
    \ conditions of any location in Thailand to determine the optimal average daily\
    \ amount \nof water required to prevent crop water stress in the current month.\
    \  \n \nKeywords: Evapotranspiration; irrigation planning; precision farming;\
    \ irrigation scheduling; \neffective rainfall \n1. Introduction  \nIn a world\
    \ facing water shortage and frequent drought events, providing the optimal amount\
    \ of \nwater sufficient for crop growth, robust irrigation scheduling is needed.\
    \ There are four \nirrigation scheduling approaches, which are soil water balance,\
    \ soil moisture status, plant water \nstatus, and models, which are established\
    \ considering soil water content (Gu, et al., 2020). The \nmost common approach\
    \ is the soil water balance, which is designed to monitor soil water \n \n16 \n\
    \ \ndeficit inside the root zone (Pereira, et al., 2020).  The following section\
    \ presents the reference \nconcepts of the soil water balance approach.   \n1.1.\
    \ Crop water requirements \n \nThe soil water balance approach determines the\
    \ crop water requirements (Equation 1). Daily \nEvapotranspiration (ETc) amounts\
    \ (i.e. crop water use) are withdrawals from the soil storage. \nPrecipitation\
    \ or Rainfall (P) and net Irrigation (I) are deposited to this storage. Water\
    \ \nrequirements for plants depend on water inputs, including rainfall (R) and\
    \ irrigation (I), and \noutputs, that is, losses due to runoff (RO) and deep percolation\
    \ (D). Due to deep percolation, \nthe plant roots can no longer extract water\
    \ because it is too deep into the ground (Kisekka et \nal. 2010; Dukes et al.\
    \ 2009), beyond the effective root zone of the crop corresponding to the \ndepth\
    \ of the surface soil that the plant uses for its physiological purpose. Some\
    \ of the water is \nalso lost due to the surface Run-Off (RO). The water above\
    \ field capacity that cannot be \nretained will drain off and is therefore no\
    \ longer useful to the plant. Run-Off is higher during \nor after heavy rainfall\
    \ or if cultivation occurs on a slope. In contrast, Run-Off is smaller, often\
    \ \nnegligible, in flat irrigated terrains and agricultural fields. Some of the\
    \ water is lost due to \nevapotranspiration, particularly under windy weather\
    \ conditions and a dry soil, as shown in \nFigure 1.  \n \nWater-based inputs\
    \ and outputs equation: \n \nΔS = P - ETc + I – D – RO \n  \n Equation 1 \nWhere,\
    \ \nΔS = Change in soil water storage (inches) / differences between inputs (water\
    \ gain) \nand outputs (water loss) \nP = Rainfall (inches) \nETc = Crop Evapotranspiration\
    \ (inches) \nI = Net Irrigation (inches) \nD = Deep Percolation (inches) \nRO\
    \ = Surface Runoff (inches) \n \nOnce we removed the water lost due to deep percolation\
    \ and water run-off, which \ncannot be used by the plant, we obtain the effective\
    \ rainfall, which will be used by the \nplant for its growth.  \n \nPe = P – D\
    \ – RO \n \n17 \n \nFigure 1. Water Cycle on a Field \n \nSource: Ghane, E. (2018).\
    \ Agricultural Drainage. Extension Bulletin E3370.  \n \nEquation (1) becomes\
    \ Equation (2), if we assume negligible storage. Storage from an \nannual water\
    \ balance may be omitted if changes in the volume of water are minor, as in \n\
    reservoirs, storage in the soil, or underground water reserves such as aquifers\
    \ (Brouwer et \nal., 2014, Dukes et al 2009). \nI = ETc - Pe \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \nEquation 2 \nWhere, \nI = Net Irrigation (inches) \nETc = Crop Evapotranspiration\
    \ (inches) \nPe = Effective rainfall (inches) \nField Capacity (FC) is the amount\
    \ of water a well-drained field will retain against after \nirrigation or rainfall.\
    \ Failing to provide water, the water volume in the root zone diminishes, as \n\
    the crop takes up more water. As water absorption increases, the residual water\
    \ is more firmly \nretained onto the soil particles, which makes it more difficult\
    \ for the plant to absorb it. Finally, \na point is reached where the crop can\
    \ no longer extract the remaining water and the plant \nbecomes wilted. Irrigation\
    \ must occur when the soil water content drops below a minimum \nlevel corresponding\
    \ to the Permanent Wilting Point (PWC), which is the water content at which \n\
    plants will permanently wilt (Figure 2).  \nThe Available Water Capacity (AWC)\
    \ (Table 1) is the quantity of water that can be used by \nthe plant to grow.\
    \ By definition, it is the measure of the quantity of the water, which is \naccessible\
    \ to the plant, stored between the Field Capacity (FC) (corresponding to the amount\
    \ \nof water remaining in the soil a few days after having been wetted) and the\
    \ Permanent Wilting \nPoint (PWP), beyond which the plant becomes wilted (Figure\
    \ 2). AWC depends on the soil \ntype. The soil type and corresponding AWC for\
    \ any location in Thailand were retrieved from \nthe \nWorld \nSoils \nHarmonized\
    \ \nWorld \nSoil \nDatabase \n(available \nat \nhttp://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-\n\

    \ of water stored in the plant’s \nroot zone (Nyvall, 2002; Blanco, et al., 2018)\
    \ that shall not exceed a certain limit to prevent \nwater stress. The water contained\
    \ in the root zone should remain above this allowable depletion \nlevel1. A Maximum\
    \ Allowable Depletion (MAD) factor will determine the Maximum \nAllowable Depletion\
    \ or Soil Water Deficit. The MAD factor typically ranges from 30% to 60% \nof\
    \ the Available Water Capacity depending on crop type. The MAD for a range of\
    \ Thai crops \nis provided in Table 2. We focused on crops for which we were able\
    \ to retrieve Root Zone \nDepth, MAD %, and Crop Coefficient (a total of 8 crops).\
    \  A higher MAD corresponds to a \nstress-tolerant plant, deep root zones, or\
    \ lighter soils (Callison, 2012). If data are not available, \na 50% MAD is usually\
    \ an accepted standard and soil moisture should be allowed to deplete up \nto\
    \ half of the available water before irrigation is required (Moore, 2009).  \n\

    0.65 \n \n1.2 Evapotranspiration (ET) \n \nEvapotranspiration (ET) is the rate\
    \ at which soil and plants release water into the atmosphere. \nET is the sum\
    \ of all water losses through the processes of soil evaporation and plant \ntranspiration\
    \ when water vapor moves out of leaf stomata (i.e. tiny pores on plant leaf surface)\
    \ \nafter being extracted by plant roots. Reference ET or ETo is the evapotranspiration\
    \ from a well-\nwatered, disease free, short, evenly cut grass of 8 to 15 cm tall,\
    \ shading the ground or for alfalfa. \nThe choice of alfalfa over grass depends\
    \ on the weather conditions. In humid and semi-humid \nareas, grass is more likely\
    \ to be used as reference ET while in arid or semi-arid areas, alfalfa is \npreferred.\
    \ Most of the evapotranspiration, which varies with temperature, wind, humidity,\
    \ and \nsunshine hours, occurs after a rainfall or an irrigation event. Agricultural\
    \ research institutions \noften have their own Agro-meteorology observatories\
    \ that record weather parameters to \ncompute evapotranspiration locally because\
    \ field equipment that measures evapotranspiration \ndirectly from the field are\
    \ expensive for local farmers. ET estimates use complex equations that \n    \
    \                                                       \n1 https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/agriculture/crop-water-use-and-growth-stages-4-715/\
    \ \n \n20 \n \nare constantly being refined. Some of these methods require relative\
    \ humidity, solar radiation, \nnumber of rainy days and sunshine hours or cloud\
    \ coverage, wind and air temperature while \nothers need only mean monthly air\
    \ temperature (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977).  \n \n1.2.1 Evapotranspiration Data\

    \ (ET0) for Thai \nprovinces from the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) (Table\
    \ 3) and stored these data into the \napp. The app retrieves ET0 for any location\
    \ selected by the user on a map of Thailand. The RID \ncomputed monthly potential\
    \ evapotranspiration using long-term average climatological data \nfrom 74 climatological\
    \ stations (30-year period) and 29 agro climatological stations (25-year \nperiod)\
    \ (Gheewala et, 2014). The monthly climatic data of 1981–2010 including Minimum\
    \ \nTemperature, Maximum Temperature, Humidity (%), Wind (km/day), Sun hours,\
    \ and \nRadiation (MJ/m2/day) reported by the Meteorological Department of Thailand\
    \ were used by \nthe RID to compute ET0 by the Penman method. However, ET0 was\
    \ unavailable for the \nfollowing provinces: Amnat charoen, Ang Thong, Bueng Kan,\
    \ Nakhon Nayok, Nong bua Lam \nPhu, Nonthaburi, Phangnga, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya,\
    \ Samut Sakhon, Samut songkhram, \nSing Buri, Uthai Thani, Yasothon. Therefore,\
    \ our app doesn’t work in these provinces. \n \nTable 3. Monthly Reference Evapotranspiration\

    \ \nAs the plant canopy cover increases in size over the soil surface, evaporation\
    \ from the wet \nsoil surface gradually decreases while plant transpiration increases.\
    \ The crop development \nstage is based on observations of crops in the field.\
    \ Therefore, reference Evapotranspiration \nneeds to be adjusted using a crop\
    \ coefficient (Kc). The value of Kc depends on the crop type, \nplanting date,\
    \ and development stage. When the plant reaches full cover, ETc will be at the\
    \ \nmaximum. The ETc value is estimated by multiplying ETo by Kc retrieved from\
    \ Table 4. \n \nTable 4. Crop Coefficients (Kc) for selected Thai Crops \n \n\

    \ Nilsalab & Gheewala, 2017 \n \n1.3.Effective Precipitation: \n \nTo estimate\
    \ the correct volume of irrigation required to satisfy the crop water needs, the\
    \ value \nof effective precipitation (Pe) is needed. While there are many definitions\
    \ of effective \nprecipitation, the most common is the portion of the rainfall\
    \ that enters the root zone and \ncontributes to the evapotranspiration requirements\
    \ of a crop. The portion of rainfall not lost \nfrom the farm, either as surface\
    \ runoff or as deep percolation, seepage, or evaporation, and can \nbe used for\
    \ crop development, directly or indirectly, is considered effective (Peace Corps,\
    \ \n1990). Effective precipitation is often calculated as a fraction of the rainfall\
    \ and depends on \nfactors such as the amount of water, the initial soil moisture,\
    \ rainfall duration, intensity, and \nfrequency in addition to soil and crop type\
    \ (USDA - SCS 1970).  \n \nThe uneven distribution of precipitation reduces its\
    \ effectiveness. Higher volumes of \nprecipitation and a more intense rainfall,\
    \ as exemplified by short and extreme downpours, \nusually decrease the amount\
    \ of effective water and increase the water run-off. In contrast, \nregular rainfall\
    \ is more beneficial to plant growth.  \n \nThe computation of effective rainfall\
    \ for different crops and locations will require different \nequations. Pe is\
    \ always equal to or larger than zero, but never negative, therefore it should\

    \ \nnullified if computation generates a negative Pe. This lead to three scenarios,\
    \ each having a \ndifferent Net Irrigation Requirements (IR). \n \na) Net Irrigation\
    \ Requirements is zero  \nThis is the case of sufficient rainfall that supplies\
    \ enough water for the crop to grow. The \nmonthly net Irrigation Requirement\
    \ (IR) is negative (Pe >ETc), and therefore irrigation is not \nrequired. This\
    \ is likely to occur in Thailand during the monsoon season. \n \nb) Net Irrigation\
    \ Requirement (IR) equals to ETc \nNegative rainfall is set to zero and crop water\
    \ needs (crop consumptive use) would need to be \nmet by irrigation.  \n \nc)\
    \ Net Irrigation Requirement (IR) equals to ‘ETc – Pe’ \nIn this case, irrigation\
    \ is needed to supplement rainfall when effective rainfall is not sufficient \n\
    to cover the crop needs.  \n \nLess rainfall is required for Thai Grassy land\
    \ because moisture is absorbed and held by the \ngrass while bare dry grounds\
    \ do not have that ability to retain water. In the computation of \neffective\
    \ precipitation, it is common to deduct small amounts of up to 4 or 5 mm (corresponding\
    \ \nto ineffective rain), sometimes more, for instance when ground cover is incomplete\
    \ and \nclimatic conditions (dry soils, strong winds) cause evaporation from the\
    \ soil surface to be \nhigher. With a dry soil surface with no vegetation cover,\
    \ rainfall of up to 8 mm/day may be \nentirely lost due to evaporation (Mavi &\
    \ Tupper, 20042). Frequent light rains intercepted by a \nplant canopy with full\
    \ ground cover are close to 100 percent effective (FAO, 1977). The three \nmajor\
    \ characteristics of effective rainfall are air temperature, duration, and intensity\
    \ of the \nrainfall.  \n \nTo compute effective rainfall (Pe) in the app, monthly\
    \ rainfall values are retrieved for the \nselected location via Advance Programming\
    \ Interface (API) from the following ESRI website: \n(https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?layers=e15bf6e4b74b4559a9a3e9ea902\n\
    a7a57). The retrieved value is then multiplied by a percentage that depends on\
    \ the month as \nshown in Table 6.  \nTable 6. Effective Precipitation as a %\

    \ 3 \n \nETc is given by multiplying ETo by Kc (Table 4) \nPe is the effective\
    \ rainfall in the current month \n \nNet Irrigation water requirement (I) is the\
    \ amount of water necessary for crop growth. The app \nuser needs to select the\
    \ location (Screenshot 3), enters the sprinkler precipitation rate and \nefficiency\
    \ (E), and average daily precipitation/rainfall (Screenshot 4) to determine the\
    \ Gross \nIrrigation water requirement (GI) (Equation 4), which is the quantity\
    \ of water to be applied, \nconsidering unavoidable water losses due to improper\
    \ design, maintenance, construction of the \nirrigation system, as well as evaporation.\

    \ run time (IR) measured in minutes per irrigation cycle/event depends on the\
    \ \nsprinkler Precipitation Rate (PR). The user provides the PR (Screenshot 4).\
    \ IR corresponds to \nthe volume of water applied over a given area in a given\
    \ time. The PR (flow rate per wetted \narea in inches per hour) will determine\
    \ IR in Equation 5 (Kisekka et al. 2010, 2016 and Broner, \n1989). \n \n\U0001D43C\

    \U0001D445\n   Equation 5 \n \nWhere, \nMAD is the Maximum Allowable Depletion\
    \ (MAD) (Table 2)Total Available Water (TAW) is \nthe amount of water that can\
    \ be extracted by the crop from its root zone. The magnitude of \nTAW depends\
    \ on the soil Available Water-holding Capacity (AWC) and the crop rooting depth\
    \ \nand is determined by multiplying AWC by the crop rooting depth (Drz) as shown\
    \ in Equation \n6 Below (Rai et al, 2017; Andales, 2011). Root Zone Depth of annual\
    \ field crops on deep well-\ndrained soil ranges from 0.30 to 2.0 m. The soil\
    \ depth from which the crop extracts most of the \nwater needed to meet its needs\
    \ is known as the effective root zone depth. The water available \nbeyond the\
    \ root zone depth cannot be extracted by the crop, and therefore cannot be used\
    \ for \nits growth. The depth of the root zone of selected Thai crops (Table 2)\
    \ is recorded in the app, \nso the user does not have to input it. \n\U0001D447\
    \U0001D434\U0001D44A = \U0001D434\U0001D44A\U0001D436 × \U0001D437\U0001D45F\U0001D467\
    \ Equation 6 \n \n26 \n \nWhere, \nAWC is the Available Water Capacity of the\
    \ root zone (in inches/inch) as shown in Table 1.  \nDrz is the root zone depth\
    \ in inch in, as shown in Table 2  \n \n2.2 Irrigation Frequency  \n \nThe Irrigation\
    \ Frequency (IF) (i.e., number of days between irrigation events) is calculated\
    \ as \nfollowing Kisekka et al. (2010) as shown in Equation 7 below. \n\U0001D43C\
    \U0001D439 =\n\U0001D440\U0001D434\U0001D437×\U0001D447\U0001D434\U0001D44A\n\U0001D43A\
    \U0001D43C\n  \nEquation 7 \nKnowing IR and IF, the app can compute the average\
    \ daily irrigation run time (average \nminutes of irrigation per day in the current\
    \ month) by dividing IR by the number of days \nbetween irrigation events (Screenshot\
    \ 5). \n \nConclusion \nDrought, water scarcity, and the increasing irrigation\
    \ cost require optimal use of the water \navailable for irrigation. Since the\
    \ majority of the world population uses smartphones, a \nsmartphone app that helps\
    \ farmers with optimal irrigation scheduling can be useful given the \ncomplexity\
    \ of its calculations for farmers. South and Southeast Asia regions are susceptible\
    \ to \nlong intense drought events and irrigation water shortages. In the region,\
    \ and although \nagriculture is a not major human activity in it, Thailand is\
    \ known as one of the top producers \nof many essential agricultural commodities.\
    \ This article presents a smartphone app for optimal \nirrigation scheduling for\
    \ Thai farmers. The app can be modified for use in countries where \ncritical\
    \ data such as average monthly evapotranspiration is accessible. Examples of these\
    \ \ncounties include Iran, Poland, Namibia, Spain, and Chile. Countries such as\
    \ Egypt that provides \naverage monthly ETo under current and future scenarios\
    \ (the 2050s and 2100s) can also help \nidentify future changes in irrigation\
    \ requirements (Abdrabbo et al, 2013). The authors plan to \ncreate a similar\
    \ app for these countries in the future to help optimize the use of irrigation\
    \ water \nto help sustain water resources.    \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \nAbdrabbo,\

    Introduction\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited\
    \ Nations (UN), the last four decades have witnessed \ndrought events that have\
    \ occurred almost everywhere on \nearth, with a direct impact on the agricultural\
    \ sector affect-\ning agricultural productivity, food security, and rural liveli-\n\
    hoods (FAO, 2020). South and Southeast Asia regions are no \nexception and are\
    \ susceptible to long, intense drought events \n(Zhai et al., 2020). Due to technology\
    \ and economic global-\nization, Thai agriculture is an international and powerful\
    \ ac-\ntor of the food industry (Piesse, 2017). Thailand is a top pro-\nducer\
    \ of many essential agricultural commodities, including \nrice, cassava, mango,\
    \ mangosteen, guava, and chili pepper \n(Poapongsakorn et al., 2017). Although\
    \ agriculture’s contri-\nbution to the country’s economic growth is small (9.9%\
    \ of \nthe Gross Domestic Product), the sector employs 49% of the \ntotal workforce,\
    \ and the average farm size exceeds 3.1 ha, \nGerman Society for \nHorticultural\
    \ Science\nwhich is considerable in comparison to other countries in \nEast and\
    \ Southeast Asia region (Rigg et al., 2019). To support \nthe agribusiness sector,\
    \ Thai policymakers and politicians \nhave made the development of water resources\
    \ a top priori-\nty (Sneddon, 2000; Piesse, 2017). The government released \n\

    \ channel net-\nwork due to drainage and seepage, leakage and evaporation \n(Wongtragoon\
    \ et al., 2012). Therefore, the optimization of \nirrigation cycles is especially\
    \ critical during the dry season. \nIn the northeast of Thailand, rain is divided\
    \ seasonally, with \napproximately 85% occurring from May to October, making \n\
    irrigation a requirement for cultivation throughout the year. \nMoreover, soils\
    \ for agricultural production are usually con-\nsidered of poor quality, and yields\
    \ are below the national av-\nerage (Floche and Molle, 2009). Therefore, the optimization\
    \ \nof irrigation cycles is especially critical during the dry sea-\nson. The\

    ed monthly potential evapotranspiration using long-term \naverage climatological\
    \ data from 74 climatological stations \n(30-year period) and 29 agroclimatological\
    \ stations (25-year \nperiod) (Gheewala et al., 2014). The monthly climatic data\

    \ (%), Wind (km day-1), Sun hours, \nand Radiation (MJ m-2 day-1), reported by\
    \ the Meteorological \nDepartment of Thailand, were used by the RID to compute\
    \ \nET0 by the Penman method. However, ET0 was unavailable \nfor the following\
    \ provinces: Amnat Charoen, Ang Thong, \nBueng Kan, Nakhon Nayok, Nong Bua Lam\
    \ Phu, Nonthaburi, \nPhangnga, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Samut Sakhon, Sam-\n\

    \ if service URLs are disconnected, or \ndata were moved to another service URL,\
    \ the app will ask the \nuser to provide ET0.\nThe use of climatological means\
    \ for reference evapotrans-\npiration creates some issues. During a drought, transpiration\
    \ \nby plants may decrease as plants attempt to conserve water. \nNonetheless,\
    \ the decrease in transpiration will be lower for \ndeep-rooted crops (Meinzer,\
    \ 1927) since they obtain their \nwater from larger and deeper areas than the\
    \ soil layers near \nthe surface. Changes in evapotranspiration during a drought\
    \ \nare primarily determined by the amount of moisture avail-\nable at the beginning\
    \ of the drought and its duration (Hanson, \n1991). If ET0 is likely to depart\
    \ from climatological means, for \ninstance, if a severe drought is expected,\

    \ \nMalaysia, 81310 Johor Bahru, Malaysia \n \nAbstract  Rice is a special crop\
    \ that requires a thin layer of water to produce, and is produced \ndifferently\
    \ from other crops. The rice sectors in Malaysia continue to be developed in a\
    \ proactive and \nprogressive manner. Due to its growth process, rice has a different\
    \ water footprint (WF) compared to \nother crops. This study improved the calculation\
    \ of the blue and green WF of rice production and \nexamined the variations of\
    \ these footprints under the primary granary area of Malaysia. The effects of\
    \ \nclimate change will, however, make it more difficult to achieve food security\
    \ and increase rice yields in \nthe future. Therefore, this paper aims to discuss\
    \ climate change impacts on rice production and food \nsecurity in Malaysia. Many\
    \ countries worldwide are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural \ndisasters\
    \ due to climate change. Many climate models predict a decline in agricultural\
    \ productivity due \nto excessive heat in tropical and subtropical regions, especially\
    \ in Southeast Asia. Malaysia is no \nexception. Therefore, the present study\
    \ examined the impact of climate change on rice yields in Muda \nGranary, Malaysia.\
    \ Utilizing literature reviews, we assessed the value of evapotranspiration (ET)\
    \ in \norder to calculate the green WF for the area. Climate variables (such as\
    \ ET), yield, and variance of \nimpact during the main season and off-season were\
    \ the primary objectives of the study. Precipitation \ndid not show a statistically\
    \ significant difference between the main and off-seasons from 2011-2015. \nDuring\
    \ the main crop season, the maximum ET was negatively associated with yield, but\
    \ the minimum \nET showed a positive association. In the off-season, green WF\
    \ levels were higher than those in the \nmain season.  These findings indicate\
    \ that climate change poses a serious threat to rice production, \nwhich will\
    \ in turn affect food security as they are highly interconnected. Thus, it is\
    \ high time for \nMalaysia to revamp its paddy and rice intervention strategies\
    \ by giving due attention to enhancing the \nadaptive capacity of rice farmers\
    \ to cope with climate change. \nKeywords: Water Footprint, Evapotranspiration,\
    \ climate change, yield.  \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nWater withdrawals for agriculture\
    \ account for approximately 70% of total withdrawals. Along with \npopulation\
    \ growth and economic growth, climate change may further reduce the amount of\
    \ water \navailable for food production. Therefore, it is imperative that crop\
    \ producers evaluate and manage water \nresources efficiently. As a result of\
    \ the introduction of the WF concept and its mathematical models, \nagricultural\
    \ producers now have a new tool for assessing water resource use and management\
    \ (Li et al., \n2018; Hoekstra, 2015; Yoo et al., 2014; Gheewala et al., 2018;\
    \ Mungkung et al., 2019; A. Chapagain \nand Hoekstra, 2010). WF measures not only\
    \ irrigation water consumption, but also precipitation \n*For correspondence:\

    \ differs from the traditional method of \nagricultural water accounting. According\
    \ to Li et al. (2017), green WF refers to the volume of precipitation \nconsumed,\
    \ which is usually expressed as effective precipitation; blue WF refers to the\
    \ volume of surface \nand groundwater consumed, which is usually expressed as\
    \ irrigation water; and grey WF is a measure \nof pollution, which is expressed\
    \ as the volume of fresh water required to assimilate the load of pollutants.\
    \ \nRice is one of the most important crops in the world. The rice growth process\
    \ differs from that of other \ncrops since rice needs a thin layer of water coverage\
    \ for a long period of time. Steeping of the field, \nirrigation, evapotranspiration,\
    \ drainage, and infiltration are also to be considered. The management of \nrice\
    \ fields involves considerably more water, and calculating water demand is more\
    \ complicated than it \nis for other crops. Therefore, there are fewer evapotranspiration\
    \ studies that calculate rice water needs.   \n \nThe main water sources for rice\
    \ production are rainfall and irrigation (Li et al., 2018). Rice is a major crop\
    \ \nand also a crucial part of the Malaysian people’s diet. A report from (Omar\
    \ et al., 2019) stated that 1.66 \nmillion metric tons of rice had been produced\
    \ in Malaysia, while statistics showed a worldwide production \nof 36.3 million\
    \ metric tons. This shows that the country’s production of rice is only about\
    \ 0.4% of the total \nworld rice production. Up until today, Malaysia only requires\
    \ 80% of the produce, and exports the rest to \nneighboring countries such as\
    \ Vietnam and Thailand. Due to declining trends in accessible fresh water \nfor\
    \ agriculture and a rising global population, rice water use needs to be examined\
    \ under climate change \nsettings (Djaman et al., 2019). As various sectors are\
    \ competing for land and water for both industry and \nrural development, increasing\
    \ rice areas will become even more challenging in the future (Mekonnen \nand Hoekstra,\
    \ 2012). Agriculture is likely to be affected by climate change through increased\
    \ demands \nfor water, a decrease in crop productivity, and reduced water availability.\
    \ Water is essential for rice \nfarming and its supply in adequate quantity is\
    \ one of the most important factors in rice production. Most \nstudies on the\
    \ constraints of high rice yield showed that water is the main factor for yield\
    \ gaps and yield \nvariability from experiment stations to farm. As fresh water\
    \ becomes increasingly scarce, the demand for \navailable water from urban and\
    \ industrial sectors is likely to receive priority over irrigation. In irrigation\
    \ \nschemes where the hydrologic cycle is affected by human activities such as\
    \ irrigation and drainage, it is \nvital to establish a reasonable framework for\
    \ evaluating productivity and managing water resources. The \nmajor problem of\
    \ improving irrigation efficiency in most irrigation schemes is poor and uneven\
    \ water \ndistribution. Rice is the only agronomic crop in Malaysia that is grown\
    \ under flooded conditions and that \nis maintained at a constant depth of about\
    \ 5–10 cm throughout the entire growing season (Abdullahi et \nal., 2013). A rice\
    \ plantation in Muda Granary area was based on the standard cultivation practice\
    \ (SCP) \nsystem, in which the depth of the water is maintained continuously for\
    \ 105 days. Maintaining a ponding \nenvironment, however, requires a higher amount\
    \ of irrigation in rice compared to other crops (Rowshon \net al., 2014). Proper\
    \ irrigation scheduling and water supply is therefore very important to improve\
    \ rice \nyield and quality (Yan et al., 2017). \n \nWater scarcity is a critical\
    \ issue in many communities throughout the world. It is inextricably tied to the\
    \ \nfood sector, since over 80% of withdrawn water worldwide is used to meet the\
    \ demands of an ever-\nincreasing population and unending development (Shrestha\
    \ et al., 2013). To meet their food demands \nand compensate for water constraint,\
    \ many countries import food from other countries. As a result, WF, \nwhich can\
    \ measure the strain on water resources, is evaluated as a tool to manage global,\
    \ regional, \nnational, and local water scarcities. WF refers to the amount of\
    \ fresh water consumed and used for \ndiluting pollutants during crop production\
    \ (Li et al., 2018). Crop production generally involves fertilizers \n(nitrogen,\
    \ phosphorus, etc.), pesticides, and insecticides. WF can be described as the\
    \ stage of \nproduction or consumption of a product (goods/services) consumed\
    \ by an individual or a community \n(Hoekstra and Hùng, 2005). The study of WF\
    \ is defined as the volume of freshwater used to produce a \nparticular product,\
    \ measured at the point of production (Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2011; Hoekstra,\
    \ 2011). \nWF analysis connects a diverse set of sectors and concerns, resulting\
    \ in a multidisciplinary framework \nfor better water resource management (Aldaya\
    \ et al., 2010).  The combination of WF and VW flows might \nreveal a country's\
    \ or river basin's actual water scarcity (Hoekstra and Chapagain, 2008). The WF\
    \ idea \nwas established by Hoekstra and Hung (2005) as a tool for measuring water\
    \ usage in the product supply \nchain in terms of time and location. There have\
    \ been a few WF studies in Malaysia to date, but on a \nnationwide scale. This\
    \ study fills in the gap by looking at the WF of rice production in the Muda Area\
    \ and \nanalyzing the trend in WF which look into blue water stress. \n \nFor\
    \ the past few years, several studies have been conducted on WF of rice cultivation\
    \ in many regions \n(Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010; A.K. Chapagain and Hoekstra,\
    \ 2010; Bulsink et al., 2009; Yoo et al., \n2014; Gheewala et al., 2014; Yusoff\
    \ and Panchakaran, 2015; Lee et al., 2018; Hanafiah et al., 2019). \nThe majority\
    \ of earlier research concentrated on determining the blue and green WFs. The\
    \ WF recorded \nduring the wet season (main season) was higher than the WF recorded\
    \ during the dry season (off-\nseason). The WF for rice farming was also measured\
    \ in this study for two separate seasons. Throughout \nthe year, Malaysia is classified\
    \ as equatorial, hot, and humid, with average daily temperatures ranging \nfrom\
    \ 21 to 32 degrees Celsius (Tan et al., 2021). Average annual rainfall in Malaysia\
    \ is approximately \n \n \n499 \nRusli et al. | Malaysian Journal of Fundamental\
    \ and Applied Sciences, Vol. 18 (2022) 497-510 \n2500 mm (Mo’allim et al., 2018).\
    \ Rice is cultivated twice a year in major granary areas, during the off-\nseason\
    \ (March to July) and the main season (August to February). Due to the northeast\
    \ monsoon's \nconsiderable rainfall, the main season has high air humidity, while\
    \ the off-season has low air humidity \nand less rainfall (Firdaus et al., 2020a).\
    \ Due to location-specific factors such as weather conditions, \ncultivation areas,\
    \ and agricultural practises, the average yield per hectare differs among different\
    \ granary \nareas (Firdaus et al., 2020b).  \n \nRice WF accounting can clearly\
    \ estimate overall water demand, water location, and the water \nconsumption process\
    \ during rice growing. It is vital to make optimal use of water resources in \n\
    circumstances when the distribution of water resources is uneven among rice-growing\
    \ areas. To reduce \nirrigation water use, it is preferable to use rainwater as\
    \ much as possible. Precipitation, on the other \nhand, has not only a skewed\
    \ regional distribution, but also yearly and inter-annual variability. Hence,\
    \ \nirrigation should be adjusted based on the year's rainfall. Irrigation water\
    \ may be saved during the rice \ngrowing season if there was more rain in a given\
    \ year. Less rainfall, on the other hand, would necessitate \nmore water for irrigation.\
    \ Research into the differences in rice WF throughout different evapotranspiration\
    \ \ncould pave the way for more efficient irrigation and water use. The majority\
    \ of previous studies used \nmonthly meteorological data to calculate the WF of\
    \ rice production at global, national, and regional levels \n(A. Chapagain and\
    \ Hoekstra, 2010; Gheewala et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2013; A K Chapagain\
    \ and \nHoekstra, 2010; Lee et al., 2018). However, evapotranspiration and effective\
    \ precipitation were not \ncalculated accurately. Most of the time, effective\
    \ precipitation was greater than actual precipitation, and \ntherefore, rice production's\
    \ green WF was greater than actual rice production. In addition, the CROPWAT \n\
    method does not account for irrigation water loss in its calculation of rice evapotranspiration.\
    \ \nConsequently, it misrepresents the actual consumption of water resources by\
    \ estimating the water \ndemand and the blue WF lower than their actual values.\
    \ A study conducted in China by Li et al. (2018) \nshowed that the water demand\
    \ of rice varied greatly in different rainfall years. The study was conducted\
    \ \nto analyze the correlation between water demand and evapotranspiration (ET)\
    \ of rice over several  years. \nThe type of rainfall in a year has a large influence\
    \ on the water requirements of rice (Li et al., 2018). The \nutilization of irrigation\
    \ water and the amount of water required for rice cultivation are clearly incompatible.\
    \ \nIn several Asian countries and other parts of the world, rice water utilization\
    \ under flooded irrigation is \nwidely recorded. The WFs of rice production in\
    \ various ET values might be used to check the precipitation \nand irrigation\
    \ consumption ratios and improve irrigation use. The value of ET was evaluated\
    \ using various \napproaches in different regions. Furthermore, rice WFs in dry,\
    \ normal, and humid years were calculated \nusing an improved approach that took\
    \ evapotranspiration into account.  \n \nConsequently, the purpose of this paper\
    \ is to review the interplay of climate change on rice production. \nIt will do\
    \ so by reviewing existing literature related to climate change impacts on rice\
    \ productions and \nfood security. In particular, it aims to understand the relationships\
    \ between the above- mentioned themes \nand their pragmatic implications. To substantiate\
    \ the review and discussion, we analyzed the \neffectiveness of precipitation\
    \ and temperature in the main granary areas in Malaysia using the \nevapotranspiration\
    \ method in green WF. To synthesize the current understanding and identify future\
    \ \nresearch priorities in East Asia, particularly Malaysia, we also compared\
    \ other methods used in the \ncountry. These methods interrelate with total rainfall\
    \ in the area to maintain rice production and food \nsecurity. This will help\
    \ to understand the possible areas of integration in concepts and the effectiveness\
    \ \nof crop yield. Hence, adaptation at the farm level remains crucial, specifically\
    \ during the off-season, since \nclimate change could widen the gaps in rice yields\
    \ between cropping seasons in the Muda granary area. \nRice cultivation in the\
    \ Muda area will benefit from this information, particularly in the state of Alor\
    \ Setar. \nFor example, ET is useful in determining the period of water deficit,\
    \ crop water requirements, and \nirrigation needs. Additionally, this study could\
    \ inform water management decisions in this specific area \nfor more efficient\
    \ water use, which will help to understand the possible areas of integration in\
    \ concepts, \nfuture researches, strategic interventions, and policy reforms.\
    \ \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nStudy Area Description \nThis study will focus\
    \ on rice production in Kuala Muda, Malaysia (Figure 1). In this research, the\
    \ Muda \nIrrigation Scheme is the largest rice granary in Malaysia. Covering some\
    \ 100,685 ha of rice land, it is \nsituated along the coastal plain in the northern\
    \ states of Kedah and Perlis in Peninsular Malaysia. One \nof Malaysia's eight\
    \ designated rice granary areas is the Muda Irrigation Scheme, which is under\
    \ the \nmanagement of Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA). As mentioned\
    \ by officer in MADA, \ndespite a lower national average of 3.74 tons/ha, the\
    \ seasonal net yield in the region is 5.0 tons/ha. Muda \nrepresents 23% of the\
    \ nation's rice production area, but accounts for almost 40% of the area's rice\
    \ \ncultivation. Peninsular Malaysia is predominantly covered by tropical rainforests.\
    \ However, only the Muda \n \n \n500 \nRusli et al. | Malaysian Journal of Fundamental\

    \ because they are protected by the rain-bearing northeast and southeast monsoons\

    \ Plan of Muda Area \n \nGranary locations in Peninsular Malaysia are frequently\
    \ hotter during the main season than during the \noff-season, (Boon Teck et al.,\
    \ 2021). Furthermore, throughout the main season, temperatures (both \nminimum\
    \ and maximum) were lower than during the off-season. In contrast, during the\
    \ main season, the \naverage rice output per hectare was higher than the off-season.\
    \ These findings suggest that while \ntemperature had a detrimental impact on\
    \ rice output, precipitation had a favourable impact. The purpose \nof this study\
    \ was to evaluate potential evaporation (ET) to increase crop production, particularly\
    \ rice \nproduction. Higher temperatures cause more evapotranspiration, affecting\
    \ the hydrological cycle and \nwater resources (Shahid, 2011). Thus, quantifying\
    \ the changes in ET due to climate change is very \nimportant for the management\
    \ of long term water resources (Tukimat et al., 2012). Rice yields, on the \n\
    other hand, are harmed by excessive or insufficient water availability. Water\
    \ should be delivered in \nsufficient quantities and at regular intervals to improve\
    \ crop productivity. While the study area's water \nsupplies are currently sufficient\
    \ on an annual scale, there are seasonal issues. In fact, during the dry \nseason,\
    \ water resources are scarce and of diminishing quality. Estimating rice's water\
    \ requirements is \ncritical for agricultural planning and irrigation project\
    \ design. The whole regional water demand is \ndominated by evaporation and evapotranspiration\
    \ processes (ET). Accurate estimation of \nevapotranspiration is important in\
    \ efficient water management for improving water use efficiency. \nBecause of\
    \ the significance of ET, hydrologists have devised a variety of ways to calculate\
    \ it. Each \nmethod has its own point of view and concept as well as being tailored\
    \ to a given climate. Some of these \ntechniques are essentially tweaked versions\
    \ of others. However, the method's dependability and \naccuracy are the primary\
    \ concerns for estimating ET (Tukimat et al., 2012).  \n \nHistorical Weather\
    \ Data \nThe climate of the region, like that of the rest of Malaysia, is divided\
    \ into four seasons: south-west \nmonsoon (May–September), north-east monsoon\
    \ (November–March), and two inter-monsoon seasons. \nWarm seasons in the area\
    \ are December–February and June–July, whereas humid seasons are April–\nMay and\
    \ September–November. The soil in the study area is heavy clayey. The average\
    \ temperature \nranges from 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity ranges\
    \ from 54 to 94 percent. Due to year-\nround rainfall, Malaysia has significant\
    \ water resources. Rice is the most important crop in the country, \naccounting\
    \ for 85 percent of all farmland. It accounts for over 90% of the water used in\
    \ the country's \n \n \n501 \nRusli et al. | Malaysian Journal of Fundamental\
    \ and Applied Sciences, Vol. 18 (2022) 497-510 \nagricultural industry (Pour et\
    \ al., 2020). Rice is cultivated in two seasons: primary (June–December) and \n\
    secondary (March–July). In years with average or above-average rainfall, it doesn't\
    \ require irrigation. \nOnly in years of below-average rainfall is supplemental\
    \ irrigation necessary. In the second rice-growing \nseason, additional irrigation\
    \ is usually required. \n \nIn the Muda area, the water requirement for the first\
    \ (off) season crop is 1,300 mm and 1,100 mm for the \nsecond (main) season crop\
    \ (Mohamed Rusli et al., 2018). Hence, the total water requirement for double\
    \ \ncropping is 2,400 mm. the water requirement is met from four sources: rainfall\
    \ (52%), the run of the river \n(10%), dam release (30%), and recycled pump water\
    \ (8%). Increase in water productivity, therefore, has \na great impact in ensuring\
    \ the sustainability of sufficient water supply for all sectors. The Muda Irrigation\
    \ \nScheme is the largest rice field in Malaysia. An accurate estimation of ET\
    \ and its possible variations due \nto climate change are therefore extremely\
    \ crucial for water resources planning and management in the \nscheme. Therefore,\
    \ this paper is primarily based on reviewing the literature, which is limited\
    \ to articles \npublished on ET in rice production. The literature search mainly\
    \ focused on themes such as the method \ncalculation of ET, climate change, rice,\
    \ and sustainability of rice farming within the Malaysian context as \nwell as\
    \ other Asian perspectives to some extent. The literature review is accompanied\
    \ by an analysis of \nthe yield production during both seasons in the Muda Granary\
    \ area to determine whether the ET values \nare correlated with yields of rice.\
    \ In this research, data were compiled from various secondary data \nsources such\
    \ as books, publications, reports, and government agencies including the Department\
    \ of \nIrrigation and Drainage, the Malaysian Meteorological Department, the Department\
    \ of Agriculture for \nPeninsular Malaysia, the Department of Statistics, MADA,\
    \ and the National Water Services Commission.   \n \nPotential Evapotranspiration,\
    \ ET \nEvapotranspiration (ET) is the only link between the water and energy cycles,\
    \ and is the main source of \nwater vapor in the atmosphere. It plays a similar\
    \ role to precipitation in determining the moisture balance \nin the atmosphere.\
    \ It is crucial to manage irrigation, catchment water equilibrium, water resource\
    \ \nplanning, ecosystem health, and reservoir operation according to reference\
    \ ET (ETo). Moreover, it is \nconsidered to be one of the most crucial factors\
    \ in any hydrological and climatic study (Pour et al., 2020). \nManaging water\
    \ resources and designing adaptation strategies to climate change require understanding\
    \ \nchange in evapotranspiration (Wang et al., 2016). There are a few methods\
    \ to calculate the value of ET \n(Tukimat et al., 2012). Evaporative processes\
    \ are highly complex, and they are affected by many factors \nthat are dependent\
    \ on local conditions. In addition to precipitation and meteorology, soil moisture,\
    \ plant \nwater requirements, and type of land cover all contribute to these conditions\
    \ (Mo’allim et al., 2018). To \nconserve water resources for sustainable food\
    \ and fibre production, there are challenges in developing \nand evaluating optimal\
    \ water management strategies. The availability of rice for rice production has\
    \ \nrecently become critical in the country, especially during the dry season\
    \ (Mar- May) (Rowshon et al., \n2014). The rainfall is, however, distributed irregularly\
    \ both temporally and spatially, and the distribution \nis not ideal for rice\
    \ growing seasons. Research on rice water requirements for rice fields is crucial\
    \ to \nutilizing the available water resources efficiently. Evapotranspiration,\
    \ on the other hand, contributes \nsignificantly to the water balance in rice\
    \ fields. It includes the loss of water from both soil and plant \nsurfaces, playing\
    \ an influential role in both rain-fed and irrigated fields. It depends upon the\
    \ evaporative \ndemand of the atmosphere.  \nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is\
    \ the main component of water consumption in rice fields; accurate \nestimation\
    \ of ETc is important in efficient water management and improving water use efficiency\
    \ ( Shui, \n2003; Abdullahi et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2017; Ikawa et al., 2017;\
    \ Ahmad et al., 2017; Djaman et al., 2019; \nPour et al., 2020;). Because of its\
    \ simplicity, practicability, and acceptable accuracy, the crop coefficient \n\
    (Kc), which is the ratio of ETc to reference evapotranspiration (ET0), is frequently\
    \ employed to determine \nETc. Several researches on evapotranspiration and the\
    \ crop coefficient in rice fields have been presented \nin various parts of the\
    \ world to date. In the present research, the performance of these simple ET methods\
    \ \nwas evaluated by comparing them as per Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n502\

    \ to the effects of climate change because to its openness to the whims \nof nature.\
    \ The term \"weather\" refers to the \"atmosphere's state at a given time and\
    \ location with respect \nto variables, such as temperature, moisture, wind speed,\
    \ and barometric pressure”. Based to Table 1, it \ncan be concluded that crops\
    \ are sensitive to climate change, including changes in temperature and \n \n\

    \ precipitation. An area's climate affects the types of \nplants that can grow\
    \ there. Plant growth is dependent on precipitation and temperature. Since crop\
    \ output \nis one of the major elements influencing food security. To assist decision-makers,\
    \ a seasonal ETc \nevaluation was done to determine the best times of year to\
    \ check on the vegetation in drought-prone and \nfood-insecure areas. Due to Malaysia's\
    \ high yearly rainfall, irrigation is only necessary during the dry \nseason to\
    \ supply the water needs of rice farming. Farmers should use an appropriate fertiliser\
    \ application \ntechnique for rice plantations to ensure full crop recovery. \n\
    \ \nWater Footprint Calculation \nThe water footprint (WF) is a method used in\
    \ agriculture to determine how much water is used in the \nproduction of a crop.\
    \ Annual and perennial crops can also benefit from the WF approach of crop \n\
    cultivation (Haruna and M. Hanafiah, 2017). The following general formula was\
    \ used to calculate the \noverall WF of the crop growing process (WFcrop). The\
    \ WF of rice was based on Hoekstra et al. (2003). \nThe total WF of growing rice\
    \ (WFrice) is the sum of the green, blue, and grey components as follows:  \n\
    \ \nWFrice = WF blue + WF green + WF grey (m3/ton)  \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) \n \n\
    For this study, the water for rice cultivated from precipitation is used for (WFgreen)\
    \ calculation. Blue and \ngreen CWU is crop water used, expressed in unit of m3/ha,\
    \ and was calculated by summation of daily \nET (mm/d) over the complete rice-growing\
    \ period. The factor 10 was used to convert water depths in \nmillimeters into\
    \ volumes of water per land surface (m3/ha). The total length (lgp) of growing\
    \ period (days) \nwas considered starting from the first day of planting to harvesting\
    \ day. \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2)  \n \n \nETc = Kc * ETo  \n\

    \ evapotranspiration (ETo), and crop evapotranspiration (ETc). In the \nWF study,\
    \ water requirement is the amount of water needed to normally grow a crop, either\
    \ by irrigation, \nby precipitation, or both. Because the water used for metabolic\
    \ activities of plants only accounts for 1% \nof the total quantity of water used,\
    \ this is considered directly as consumptive use in the \ncalculation. Effective\
    \ rainfall is defined as the fraction of rain which is effectively absorbed by\
    \ the crop \nafter surface runoff and deep percolation losses have been accounted\
    \ for. Irrigation requirements and \ngroundwater levels were also included. Typically,\
    \ irrigation requirements refer to the amount of water \nthat must be used to\
    \ supplement the water supplied by rainfall. The CWU was also calculated using\
    \ \nother parameters including crop, soil, and irrigation. In this study, value\
    \ of ETc was assumed to be equal \n1823.76 mm/year (Ahmad et al., 2017). \n \n\
    Results and Discussion \n \nAs a result of this assessment, we will now discuss\
    \ the potential and limitations of evapotranspiration \nrate-based WF calculation.\
    \ Using this method, we will be able to estimate crop WFs for possible water \n\
    planning in water-scarce areas. Grey WFs were not taken into account when comparing\
    \ green and blue \nWFs. \n \nWater Footprint \nRice cultivation has different\
    \ irrigation requirements, yields, cropping patterns, and environmental \nimpacts,\
    \ depending on the region. Figure 2 illustrates the estimated WF for cultivating\
    \ rice during the \nmain season and the off-season. Off season refers to the rice\
    \ grown in March-July, considered as dry \nmonths in Malaysia, while the main\
    \ season refers to the rice grown in August to February, known as the \nrainy\
    \ or wet season. According to this study, the total WFs for cultivating rice for\
    \ both main and off-\nseasons range between 4,100 and 4,500 m3/t and 4,100 and\
    \ 4,900 m3/t, respectively. Fig. 4 shows that \nthe green WF in the main season\
    \ ranges between 2,700 and 3,000 m3/t, whereas the blue WF ranges \nbetween 1,200\
    \ and 1,480 m3/t. According to our analysis, the blue and green WFs in the off\
    \ range are \n2,800 to 3,550 m3/t and 1,100 to 1,400 m3/t respectively. Table\
    \ 2 shows detailed results of the WF for \nthe Muda Irrigation Scheme from 2011-2015.\
    \ It is mostly the amount of precipitation received and the \ncrop yield that\
    \ determines the variation in WFs across different years.  \n \n   \U0001D44A\U0001D439\

    \ main and off-seasons in MADA (2011-2015) \n    \nIn the Muda region, the largest\
    \ total WF for rice cultivation during the main season was 4,473 m3/t in \n2011,\
    \ while the largest total WFs during the off-season was 4,917.50 m3/t in 2014.\
    \ The present study \nfound that the green WF for the Muda area was 2.1 and 2.6\
    \ times greater than the blue WF of rice \nproduction in both the main and off-seasons.\
    \ Rice is one of the most important crops in the Malaysian \ndiet, hence a large\
    \ amount of rice is produced each year. The ratio of green to blue water varies\
    \ greatly, \nboth over time and space. In countries like India, Indonesia, Vietnam,\
    \ Thailand, Myanmar, and the \nPhilippines, the green water fraction is substantially\
    \ larger than the blue water fraction (Chapagain and \nHoekstra, 2011). According\
    \ to Hanafiah et al. (2019), Malaysia's annual rainfall rate is sufficient to\
    \ \nprovide the water requirements for rice agriculture, and irrigation is only\
    \ required during the dry season. \nThe topography and climate of Malaysia ensure\
    \ that water is available in sufficient quantities to meet \ncrop production needs,\
    \ particularly rice farming (Hanafiah et al., 2019).  \n \nHowever, in this study,\
    \ the result was the opposite. Figure 2 shows that water is most needed for rice\
    \ \ncultivation in the off-season compared to the main season. Effective rainfall\
    \ and yield are the two main \nfactors affecting irrigation water requirements.\
    \ In this study, the amount of blue WF was essential \nbecause blue water withdrawal\
    \ was used to determine water deprivation potential during rice cultivation \n\
    in the Muda Scheme Irrigation. In our study, we found that rice cultivation had\
    \ a significantly different WF \nthroughout the years. The higher the yield, the\
    \ smaller the WF per ton, which implies that the higher the \nyield, the smaller\
    \ the WF. A study was conducted by Boon Teck et al. (2021) to assess the impact\
    \ of \nclimate change on rice yield in Malaysia, which compared eight granary\
    \ areas in Peninsular Malaysia. \nThe main objective of the study was to assess\
    \ the impact of climate change on rice yield and the variance \nof the impact\
    \ during the main and off-season. Regarding climate variables, the Integrated\
    \ Agricultural \nDevelopment Area (KETARA) had the highest total precipitation\
    \ (2680.55 mm) compared to MADA, \nwhich had the lowest (2046.7 mm). The results\
    \ strongly support that fact that granary areas in Peninsular \nMalaysia are usually\
    \ hotter during the main season when compared to the off-season (Boon Teck et\
    \ al., \n2021). Furthermore, the average rice yield per hectare during the main\
    \ season was higher than that in \nthe off-season. Precipitation had a positive\
    \ impact on rice yield (Boon Teck et al., 2021). According to \nVaghefi et al.\
    \ (2016), an increase in precipitation might not be enough to offset the negative\
    \ impact of \ntemperature increases on rice yield predicted for the year 2030\
    \ in Peninsular Malaysia. However, despite \nthe results of this study showing\
    \ that the average WF for rice cultivation in Muda Granary may be larger \nfor\
    \ regions with lower yield, the results may differ for other granaries due to\
    \ climate variations. \nAdditionally, another aspect of the WF assessment is interference\
    \ by farming practices, such as poor \ndrainage systems, conventional or organic\
    \ farming approaches, etc. By the year 2030, MADA’s yield is \nalso predicted\
    \ to decline by -3.81% and followed by -0.02% over the following decade (Boon\
    \ Teck et al., \n2021). Another seven granary districts are also likely to experience\
    \ a drop. \n \nComparison with Previous Study \nIn Thailand, rice has higher water\
    \ requirement because the rice field cultivation is under flood conditions. \n\
    A research reported that rice is one of the largest water consumers in the world\
    \ and requires large areas \nto irrigate the rice fields (Chapagain and Hoekstra,\

    \ is shown (Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2011). Table 2 summaries previous research\
    \ on the \nWF of several crops that have been published in Southeast Asian countries.\
    \ In the Muda area, the WF \nof rice was determined to be 4,454 m3/ton, which\
    \ is the highest WF. In some cases, there is a difference \nbetween the ratios\
    \ of the studies, which may be due to differences in effective rainfall calculations\
    \ among \nthe various component calculation methods. In the study, the rice WF\
    \ was 2,135 m3/ton more than the \nworld average (2,319 m3/ton) as well as the\
    \ WF for major rice-producing countries. WFs differ between \ncountries because\
    \ of differences in crop yield, growing season, rainfall, and fertilizer consumption.\
    \ In \nKorea, where WF is the lowest, average yields are high, and crop water\
    \ needs are low. The green and \nblue water levels in Muda area were higher, even\
    \ though Thailand is a major rice exporter. A difference \nin climate and agricultural\
    \ practices led to slight regional differences in the WFs of crops (Bulsink et\
    \ al., \n2009). Thus, agricultural practices determine yield, thereby affecting\
    \ the WF of the product. Crop water \nrequirements vary across countries depending\
    \ on the availability of modelling parameters, assumptions, \nlimitations, and\

    \ rice farms, there is great concern about measuring the amount of water \nconsumed.\
    \ Rainfall determines how much water is in a flooded system. Additionally, farmers\
    \ do not \nalways measure the level of water within the rice fields in order to\
    \ prevent pathogens and grass from \ngrowing. When it comes to irrigated areas,\
    \ the amount of water depends on the irrigation efficiency and \nthe location\
    \ of farms where irrigation is adequate or not (Mungkung et al., 2019). The value\
    \ of the WF \nvaries according to the way water resources are managed in a particular\
    \ area. Hence, when used to \nindicate actual water use impact, the total WF (blue\
    \ and green) needs to be considered for better \nunderstanding of water scarcity\
    \ impacts. The majority of crops in Malaysia are grown using rainwater. \nMalaysia\
    \ receives an average rainfall of 2500 mm per year, which helps to grow crops.\
    \ Generally, \nconsumption of blue water, i.e. groundwater or surface water, has\
    \ a larger impact on the environment \nthan consumption of green water (Falkenmark,\
    \ 2008). Consequently, increasing reliance on surface \nwater will contribute\
    \ to water scarcity, and some arid areas are particularly vulnerable to drought\
    \ and \ndeficiency of precipitation induced by climate variability. \n \nAdaptation\
    \ of the production layout based on rice WF \nThe analysis of WFs can clarify\
    \ the source and structure of the water demand for crop production and \nallow\
    \ for the rational use of water resources. Rainfall and irrigation are the two\
    \ main sources of water for \ncrop growth. Rainfall affects the amount of irrigation\
    \ required and has both annual and interannual \nvariations. More rainfall resulted\
    \ in decreased irrigation when the rice water demand was calculated. As \na result,\
    \ if the rainfall could be fully utilised, irrigation should be reduced, saving\
    \ water from rivers, lakes, \nand groundwater. Each year's rainfall and infiltration\
    \ varied during the rice growing season. The rice WFs \nin the Muda region were\
    \ greater, with high green WF and poor yields in the rice production area, \n\
    according to the findings of this study. The high WF in the region, on the other\
    \ hand, was caused by the \nlower yield. Because rice farming in certain areas\
    \ will be maintained, crops that use less water should \nbe cultivated. Because\
    \ the Muda region is Peninsular Malaysia's largest granary area, water-saving\
    \ \nirrigation techniques should be implemented in the region to improve the utilization\
    \ rate of water \n \n \n506 \nRusli et al. | Malaysian Journal of Fundamental\

    \ It is advised that agricultural structures should be adjusted in \naccordance\
    \ with the state of local water supplies and rainfall forecasts, particularly\
    \ during the main \nseason when crop yields can meet the water demand. \n \n \
    \ \n                                        Figure 3. Rice yield from 1995 to\
    \ 2016 in Muda Area \n \nFlooding would be exacerbated by such an increase in\
    \ precipitation. Floods have caused significant \nlosses to rice farmers over\
    \ the years, particularly in MADA Kedah, Malaysia's largest granary. There are\
    \ \nmany factors that influence rice land productivity. Some of the more significant\
    \ factors are: soil types; \nseeds; agronomic practices; harvesting loss; good\
    \ water management and cropping intensity. Crop \nproduction of rice in the Muda\
    \ area for 1995-2016 is presented in Figure 3. The exceptionally low yield \n\
    production in the Muda region was due to severe floods which occurred in December\
    \ 2014. As shown in \nFigure 3, the rice yield in the subsequent year was impaired\
    \ by several flood events in 2003 and 2006. \nFlooding in Kedah and its neighboring\
    \ state of Pulau Pinang resulted in a considerable drop in rice \nproduction in\
    \ the country in 2015 compared to the previous year. These have had a significant\
    \ impact \non not only farmers' output, livelihoods, and income, but also the\
    \ country's food security. Floods in the \nMADA area affected 18,250 acres of\
    \ rice fields and 10,580 farmers during the main cropping season of \n2005/06.\
    \ (MADA, 2010). As a result, rice imports increased by 45 percent in 2006 (Firdaus\
    \ et al., 2020b).  \n \nIt is not necessary to irrigate rice during the dry season\
    \ in Malaysia because the annual rainfall rate is \nsufficient. Malaysia's topography\
    \ and climate make water readily available for rice cultivation. The \namount\
    \ of rainfall and yield determine the amount of irrigation water required. In\
    \ the river basin, water \nwithdrawal was used to assess potential water deprivation\
    \ associated with rice cultivation, so WF was \ncrucial to the study. In Malaysia,\
    \ water is readily available due to its topography and climate, which is \nespecially\
    \ suitable for rice farming. Climate and agricultural practices have the greatest\
    \ impact on \nirrigation water requirements. The amount of blue water withdrawal\
    \ was critical for this study since blue \nwater withdrawal was used to estimate\
    \ water shortages during rice production in Muda Scheme Irrigation. \nResearch\
    \ has shown that rice farming's WF changes significantly over time as a result\
    \ of our study. Rice \nproduction consumes an enormous amount of water. Rice plantation\
    \ used a large amount of fresh water \nbased on the assessment between rice plantation\
    \ and rice milling. Therefore, it is ideal to increase the \nefficiency of water\
    \ use in rice fields since water is less available to stressed river systems.\
    \ Consumptive \n(evaporative) use is to be targeted for efficiency gains rather\
    \ than total usage. Based on yield production \nlevels, rice cultivation WF varies\
    \ significantly. Higher yielding crops have a lower WF per kg than those \nwith\
    \ lower yields, which means higher yielding crops have a lower WF. In Malaysia,\
    \ the average WF for \nrice cultivation was higher in states with lower yields,\
    \ but results may vary by region due to climate \nchange. It is also important\
    \ to consider the impact of farming practices on the field, such as improper \n\
    drainage systems, conventional farming methods, etc. (Hanafiah et al., 2019a).\

    \ rice producing regions across the world, rice is grown during the wet \n(monsoon)\
    \ season, which reduces the irrigation demand by effectively using rainwater.\
    \ This study of rice \nproduction took into consideration rainfall for the two\
    \ main seasons. For one, the WF was studied to \nevaluate rainfall water used\
    \ in the green WF, to raise awareness in the use of resources and the \nenvironment\
    \ that affects the ecosystems as well as management to achieve the most effective\
    \ solution. \nIn the Muda area, the WF for the first (off) season crop is higher\
    \ than second (main) season because \nduring the main season, the rice usually\
    \ receives heavy rainfall, which is in August to February. Although \ngreen WF\
    \ had a higher value than blue WF, rice production did not correlate significantly\
    \ between 2011 \nand 2015 (Figure 2). Therefore, rice production was not correlated\
    \ with the planted area. According to \nBoon Teck et al. (2021), the average WF\
    \ of rice differs significantly for non-granary and granary areas \nacross certain\
    \ states. In general, the WF of rice in granary areas is better than WF in non-granary\
    \ areas. \nFor granary areas, the highest yield was recorded for KETARA, where\
    \ the annual yield was the same as \nMADA, although the total planted area in\
    \ MADA is larger than KETARA. Meanwhile, IADA Kemasin had \nthe lowest yield for\
    \ a small planted area compared to the eight other granaries.  \n \nSince, rice\
    \ is a staple food crop that provides more calories to the global population than\
    \ any other crop. \nFreshwater supplies are also extensively used in the rice\
    \ producing process. Therefore, adjustments to \nrice evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ due to anticipated warming patterns are now required in any management \nof\
    \ water resources and food security assessments \n \nConclusion \n \nUnderstanding\
    \ the statistical features of historical data of main climatic parameters such\
    \ as rainfall and \nevapotranspiration will help to create an effective water\
    \ management planning system. This study \nexamined rice production's WF and how\
    \ yield potential is affected by climate change. Methodologies, \ntechniques,\
    \ and indicators for analysing the implications of freshwater use are currently\
    \ being developed. \nThe concept of a WF, on the other hand, is an essential step\
    \ in the right direction. WF study on rice fields \nwill be critical not only\
    \ for research but also for Malaysia's agricultural growth. As a result, it will\
    \ serve as \na benchmark for other agricultural activities in Malaysia. The WF\
    \ reflects the interaction between water \nconsumption and yield, and lowering\
    \ the WF is a primary goal that would indicate the effective utilisation \nof\
    \ water resources. The sensible arrangement of agricultural production regions\
    \ was one of the strategies \nto achieve lower WFs and lower water use while maintaining\
    \ good yields. As a result, regions with less \nWF and higher economic and environmental\
    \ benefits should be identified. \n \nEvapotranspiration is a key role in governing\
    \ hydrological processes. Climate change will have a major \nimpact on hydrological\
    \ systems, particularly evapotranspiration. As a result, assessing ET, particularly\
    \ \nin the context of climate change, is critical. The study is expected to benefit\
    \ a variety of stakeholders, \nincluding \nwater \nmanagers, \nhydrologists, \n\
    agricultural \norganisations, \nwater \nresources \ndevelopment/planning authorities,\
    \ and environmental agencies, by improving their understanding of \npreferred\
    \ methods for estimating ET in Malaysia's irrigated areas. There are many factors\
    \ that influence \nrice land productivity. Some of the more significant factors\
    \ are: soil types; seeds; agronomic practices; \nharvesting loss; good water management;\
    \ and cropping intensity. Climate change would have a \nsignificant influence\
    \ on Malaysia's rice crop. As a result, research into the influence of climate\
    \ change \non rice productivity is critical, as rice is a staple diet for Malaysians.\
    \ Using evapotranspiration in \nPeninsular Malaysia, this study looked at the\
    \ influence of climate change on rice output. Climate factors \nhave a considerable\
    \ impact on rice output, according to the primary findings. Precipitation has\
    \ only a \nnegative impact on rice output during the main season, which is also\
    \ known as the wet season. Increased \nprecipitation would result in floods, which\
    \ is common around this time of year. The minimum \ntemperatures in the main season\
    \ and off-season, on the other hand, may have inverse consequences.  \n \nSince\
    \ the Muda irrigation Scheme is the country’s leading rice granary area as far\
    \ as rice production and \nefficient water management practices are concerned,\
    \ its WF of rice should be adopted as the benchmark \nfor other irrigation schemes\
    \ to emulate. Besides, the water use efficiency (90%) in the scheme is among \n\
    the highest in the regions. Therefore, the target for WF for the granary areas\
    \ can be reasonably set after \nthe analysis and result of this research. Besides\
    \ the amount of WF, there are a few other factors that \nmight affect the yield\
    \ of rice plantation. From the results, we can conclude that for rice cultivation,\
    \ which \nneeds relatively high-water inputs, especially irrigation water in the\
    \ dry season, several factors which \naffect productivity are: \n \nI. \nIrrigation\
    \ efficiency and agricultural production technologies; \nII. \nWater management\
    \ and land preparation; \nIII. \nField conditions such as drainage, field road,\
    \ water retaining boundaries and field dryness \nbefore harvesting (Yusop et al.,\
    \ 2021); \n \n \n508 \nRusli et al. | Malaysian Journal of Fundamental and Applied\
    \ Sciences, Vol. 18 (2022) 497-510 \nIV. \nClimate factors such as temperature,\
    \ sunshine duration and intensity, humidity and wind \nspeed \n \nClimate change\
    \ makes it more difficult to meet the increasing demands for water, energy, and\
    \ food, \nparticularly in developing countries. Nevertheless, the water-energy-food\
    \ nexus is a very relevant \nconcept and strongly related to climate change. All\
    \ levels of society and stakeholders must recognize \nthe link between climate\
    \ change and the nexus to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We must \n\
    optimize the efficient use of water, land, energy, and other natural resources\
    \ so that water, energy, and \nfood-related challenges can be addressed harmoniously\
    \ across the various stakeholder groups for \nsustainable development. For human\
    \ health, it is vital that water resources are available and conserved, \nas well\
    \ as wise use of this resource. Global approaches involving water withdrawals,\
    \ supply, and \nconsumption need knowledge, wisdom, and behaviors that work well.\
    \ In addition, as a rice bowl, climatic \nconditions will enhance rice yield variability\
    \ between granaries and cropping seasons in the future \ndecade. Smaller Southeast\
    \ Asian countries such as Malaysia are projected to acquire an increasing \npercentage\
    \ of their future cereal consumption (for example, rice) from the international\
    \ market. 30 \npercent of Malaysia's rice is imported at the moment. Even if Malaysia\
    \ is not a net importer of rice, \nsustaining a long-term upward trend in output\
    \ is critical for reducing reliance on imports. This effort is \ncrucial not just\
    \ for small-scale farmers' livelihoods, but also for food security. \n \nAccording\
    \ to the findings of the study, the government needs an adequate measurement to\
    \ manage the \nsustainable use of water resources to avoid water shortages as\
    \ a result of increased demand on \nagricultural activities, particularly rice\
    \ cultivation. Agriculture-related authorities and departments must \nimprove\
    \ the efficiency of water usage by amending the agriculture production policy\
    \ that has been \ncreated for farmers as a guidance in cultivating crops. There\
    \ are many parties involved in the \nmanagement of the water resources in the\
    \ catchment, including Department of Irrigation Department \n(DID) Kedah, MADA,\
    \ Syarikat Air Darul Aman (SADA), Perbadanan Bekalan Air (PBA)  and others. To\
    \ \nguarantee the equitable distribution of water to all users during times of\
    \ surplus as well as water stress, \nit is crucial to take into account both the\
    \ long-term sustainability of the basin's water resources and short-\nterm operational\
    \ factors. Despite the fact that the basin's crucial hydraulic infrastructure\
    \ is overseen by \nvarious agencies, their activities must be coordinated. In\
    \ future, it is recommended that a comprehensive \nstudy is conducted to assess\
    \ the impacts of nutrient enrichment on freshwater resources by including \ngrey\
    \ water in the WF assessment. Since this study only applied to the Muda Irrigation\
    \ Scheme, other \ngranary areas could be included as well in future studies. \

    \ root zone can impair crop yields and profitability. This study utilized a \n\
    16 \nbiophysical model to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of groundwater\
    \ salinity \n17 \non the yields and profits for four crops (alfalfa, almonds,\
    \ table grapes, and processing tomatoes) \n18 \nacross California's Central Valley.\
    \ The model analyzed five different levels of \n19 \ngroundwater/irrigation water\
    \ salinity, which ranged from 0.5 to 5.5 dS/m, with up to 12 mm/day \n20 \nof\
    \ irrigation water for simulation. The results showed that the model's relative\
    \ yield prediction \n21 \nwas best for alfalfa, while the profits prediction was\
    \ best for almonds. The study also found that \n22 \nan irrigation water salinity\
    \ level of 5.5 dS/m could cause a decrease in the relative yield of \n23 \nalmonds\
    \ by up to 40%. The spatial component developed for the model indicated that yield\
    \ and \n24 \nprofits would vary based on soil type and water salinity across the\
    \ Valley. At a daily irrigation \n25 \nrate of 3 mm, no profits were predicted.\
    \ When the daily irrigation was increased to 6 mm/day, \n26 \nprofits of up to\
    \ $1000/ha were possible for alfalfa and processing tomatoes. Profits for almonds\
    \ \n27 \nand grapes reached up to $15000/ha at 9 mm of daily irrigation. The study\
    \ emphasized the \n28 \nimportance of considering irrigation water quality in\
    \ water allocation and trading decisions, as it \n29 \nsignificantly impacts crop\
    \ profitability. The methodology developed in this study can be applied \n30 \n\
    to other regions facing similar challenges of water scarcity and salinity. \n\
    31 \n \n32 \n \n2 \n \nHighlights \n33 \n• Salt accumulation in the root zone\
    \ can impair crop yields and profitability. \n34 \n• High irrigation water salinity\
    \ diminishes the relative yield and profits. \n35 \n• Water, salinity, and crop\
    \ prices all impacted profits from crop production. \n36 \n• Higher market values\
    \ rather than salinity tolerance influence crop profitability. \n37 \n \n38 \n\

    43 \nHigh concentrations of soluble salts such as sodium chloride, sulfates, calcium,\
    \ magnesium, and \n44 \nbicarbonates in soil and water threaten irrigated and\
    \ rainfed agriculture worldwide (Hopmans et \n45 \nal., 2021). More than 954 million\
    \ hectares (ha) of land worldwide are salt-affected, and between \n46 \n25% and\
    \ 30% of irrigated lands are rendered unproductive due to salinity (Shahid et\
    \ al., 2018). \n47 \nThe increase in the world population is expected to expand\
    \ salinization further through an array \n48 \nof processes, including an increase\
    \ in treated wastewater reuse for irrigation (Farid et al., 2020; \n49 \nOgunmokun\
    \ & Wallach, 2021; Pedrero et al., 2020; Tanji, 1997), groundwater contamination\
    \ \n50 \ndue to percolated salts from irrigated lands (Foster et al., 2018; Merchán\
    \ et al., 2020; Quinn, \n51 \n2020), and an increase in the use of brackish or\
    \ saline water for irrigation (Baath et al., 2020; \n52 \nWang et al., 2020; Yuan\
    \ et al., 2019). Climate change might also exacerbate salinity problems \n53 \n\
    (Kramer et al., 2021). The consolidative nature of these processes suggests that\
    \ salinity issues are \n54 \ninherent to crop production and agricultural water\
    \ management strategies in many water-\n55 \nconstrained regions. Methods to quantify\
    \ and reduce economic losses due to salinity should be \n56 \nincorporated into\
    \ policies at regional and local scales. \n57 \nIn semi-arid and arid regions\
    \ like California, where rainfall is insufficient to meet crop water \n58 \nneeds,\
    \ irrigation is necessary. About 40% of global irrigated land is located in arid/semi-arid\
    \ \n59 \nzones, and irrigation is often associated with salinization (Hopmans\
    \ et al., 2021; Smedema and \n60 \nShiati, 2002). Intensive irrigation has allowed\
    \ the Central Valley of California to become one of \n61 \nthe world’s most productive\
    \ farming regions (Olmstead and Rhode, 2017). Long-term \n62 \nsustainability\
    \ of irrigated agriculture is threatened due to decreased irrigation water quality\
    \ and \n63 \nincreased salt build-up in the soil and groundwater, particularly\
    \ in the southern part of the Valley \n64 \n(Schoups et al., 2005; Welle and Mauter,\
    \ 2017). Various factors, such as drought, climate \n65 \nchange, water shortages,\
    \ and land-use changes, exacerbate salinity problems and severely affect \n66\
    \ \nthe Central Valley’s agricultural productivity and sustainability. \n67 \n\
    In the San Joaquin Valley (Southern part of the Central Valley), more than 2 million\
    \ ha of \n68 \nirrigated cropland are salt-affected through saline irrigation\
    \ water or saline soils, and tens of \n69 \nthousands of ha of arable land were\
    \ reported to be at high-risk (Letey, 2000). Over 30% of the \n70 \nagricultural\
    \ salt-affected land is highly saline (Scudiero et al., 2017). Salt build-up caused\
    \ about \n71 \n100,000 ha to be taken out of agricultural production, and another\
    \ 600,000 ha were considered \n72 \n \n4 \n \ndamaged by salinity. In contrast,\
    \ only 15% of the annual salt load is being addressed by current \n73 \nmanagement\
    \ activities (CV-SALTS, 2019). The high levels of salt concentrations in the Central\
    \ \n74 \nValley can be directly correlated with irrigation with a combination\
    \ of agricultural, industrial, \n75 \nand municipal water. The amount of salt\
    \ brought into the Valley has been increased through \n76 \ndams and imported\
    \ water supplies. More than six million tons of salt are imported and \n77 \n\
    accumulated yearly in the San Joaquin Valley (CV-SALTS, 2019; Quinn, 2020). Using\
    \ remote \n78 \nsensing methods, Welle and Mauter (2017) reported that salinity\
    \ reduced California’s \n79 \nagricultural revenues by $3.7 billion. Long-term\
    \ management strategies are needed to address the \n80 \nremaining 85% of salt\
    \ load. Under current conditions, informed predictions about future salt \n81\
    \ \nbuild-up are required to optimize agronomic practices to reduce economic loss\
    \ due to salinity \n82 \nand improve irrigation sustainability. \n83 \nCalifornia’s\
    \ Central Valley agricultural production relies on surface water imports from\
    \ a \n84 \nmassive network of reservoirs, waterways, and groundwater over-drafted\
    \ due to irrigation \n85 \n(Quinn, 2020). In recent decades, the Valley has turned\
    \ to perennial (tree and vine) crops, which \n86 \nhas triggered increased water\
    \ demand amidst a cycle of multiple-year droughts and new \n87 \nregulations on\
    \ groundwater pumping (Mall and Herman, 2019). Moreover, the Central Valley \n\
    88 \nfaces the challenge of protecting water quality due to inadequate dilution\
    \ from rainfall. Such \n89 \nconditions, inherent to semi-arid agricultural regions,\
    \ have led to alternative solutions, including \n90 \nusing marginal-quality water\
    \ such as recycled wastewater and brackish groundwater for \n91 \nirrigation (Gile\
    \ et al., 2020; Kisekka et al., 2023; Qin & Horvath, 2020). However, such non-\n\
    92 \nconventional irrigation water sources are likely to contain dissolved salts\
    \ that can accumulate in \n93 \nthe root zone, affecting crop productivity and\
    \ leaching to groundwater and surface water \n94 \nresulting in severe environmental\
    \ degradation (Chittick & Srebotnjak, 2017; Foster et al., 2018). \n95 \nThe use\
    \ of water high in salts requires best management practices that entail screening\
    \ \n96 \nbiological-physical system concerns and the production’s economics (Kaner\
    \ et al., 2019). Under \n97 \nconstrained soil and water systems protection measures,\
    \ water management strategies are \n98 \nchallenged to maximize productivity.\
    \ In addition to the evaluation of adverse effects of water \n99 \ncontaining\
    \ excess salts on crop yield (relative to crop salt tolerance) and the ecosystems,\
    \ \n100 \ndecisions related to the use of marginal quality irrigation water for\
    \ crop production can further \n101 \nconsider the assessment of economic parameters\
    \ such as production inputs and potential benefits. \n102 \n \n5 \n \nNumerical\
    \ and analytical modeling approaches to estimate crop yield for a specific soil\
    \ as a \n103 \nfunction of saline water and irrigation amounts have been widely\
    \ described and compared in \n104 \nprevious research (Oster et al., 2012; Shani\
    \ et al., 2009; Skaggs et al., 2014). Integrated models \n105 \ncoupling agronomic,\
    \ hydrological, and environmental aspects of irrigation-salinity water systems\
    \ \n106 \nto economic models have also been developed and assessed in literature\
    \ (Booker et al., 2012; \n107 \nSlater et al., 2020). However, coupling robust\
    \ economic information with biophysical models \n108 \nand their spatial correlation\
    \ has been limited. Shani et al. (2007, 2009) evaluated the impact of \n109 \n\
    water stress and irrigation water salinity on crop yield and discussed the potential\
    \ use of the \n110 \nmodel as an economic decision decision-support tool. Kaner\
    \ et al. (2019) later integrated the \n111 \nmodel with economic information and\
    \ implemented it as an agronomic-economic coupled \n112 \ndecision support system\
    \ for irrigation water salinity. However, these model applications were \n113\
    \ \nimplemented considering one or two soil types without considering the spatial\
    \ distribution of \n114 \ncrop yield and profitability in terms of irrigation\
    \ water salinity and quantity. This study aimed to \n115 \ndevelop a framework\
    \ that integrates the analytical biophysical model with economic and \n116 \n\
    geospatial data and to assess the impact of irrigation water quality and quantity\
    \ on cop \n117 \nproductivity and economic outcomes for selected crops in the\
    \ Central Valley of California. \n118 \n2 Materials and methods \n119 \n2.1 Biophysical\
    \ model description  \n120 \nThe ANalytical Salt-WatER (ANSWER) model contains\
    \ crop parameters, hydraulic properties, \n121 \nand a meteorological variable\
    \ (Shani et al., 2007, 2009). Four assumptions underlie the model. \n122 \nFirst,\
    \ ambient conditions in the root zone affecting crop root water uptake and growth\
    \ are \n123 \nrepresented by parameters, including electrical conductivity (EC),\
    \ defined by water content (θ) \n124 \nand soil solution salinity (Schoups and\
    \ Hopmans, 2002). Second, steady-state conditions of \n125 \nwater and salt status\
    \ (Tripler et al., 2012) are assumed. Third, the environmental conditions, \n\
    126 \nincluding weather, are considered static, so the average seasonal transpiration\
    \ (Tp) value is \n127 \nconsidered as potential transpiration for the growth period.\
    \ Fourth, there is a proportional \n128 \nrelationship between the ratio of given\
    \ yield to the potential yield and the ratio of transpiration to \n129 \npotential\
    \ transpiration (Ben-Gal et al., 2003; Ben-Gal et al., 2008; Shani et al., 1987).\
    \ The \n130 \nrelative yield is expressed as follows:  \n131 \n \n6 \n \n \n\U0001D44C\
    \U0001D45F = \U0001D44C\n\U0001D44C\U0001D45D\n= \U0001D447\n\U0001D447\U0001D45D\
    \n= \U0001D447\U0001D45F \n(1) \nwhere Y is yield or biomass production and T\
    \ is transpiration. Yr and Yp are the relative yield and \n132 \npotential yield,\
    \ respectively. Tr and Tp represent the relative transpiration and potential \n\
    133 \ntranspiration, respectively.  \n134 \nThe model combines salt and water\
    \ balance by calculating the soil moisture of the root-zone and \n135 \nsoil hydraulic\
    \ conductivity according to the soil hydraulic model of Brooks-Corey (Brooks and\
    \ \n136 \nCorey, 1966): \n137 \n \n\U0001D43E(\U0001D713) = \U0001D45A\U0001D456\

    \ hydraulic conductivity, KS is the saturated hydraulic conductivity, θS is the\
    \ \n138 \nsaturated volumetric soil moisture content, and θr represents residual\
    \ volumetric soil moisture \n139 \ncontent; ψ is the soil matric head, ψw is the\
    \ air-entry head, and \U0001D702 and \U0001D6FD are empirical soil \n140 \ncharacteristic\
    \ parameters.  \n141 \nMaas and Hoffman (1977) modeled a piece-wise linear model\
    \ (Mass-Hoffman model) in which \n142 \ncrop salt tolerance is described by a\
    \ salinity threshold and a slope describing yield loss beyond \n143 \nthat threshold.\
    \ The \U0001D438\U0001D436\U0001D45250 designates the ECe for which the relative\
    \ yield decreases by 50%, and \n144 \np is a crop parameter describing the function’s\
    \ steepness. The \U0001D438\U0001D436\U0001D45250 values were estimated \n145\
    \ \nthrough a rearranged equation (3) from Maas and Hoffman (1977). \n146 \n \n\
    ECe50 = (1 − Y)\nS + ECeT\n \n(3) \nwhere EC\U0001D452\U0001D447 is the salinity\
    \ threshold (dS/m), \U0001D44C is the yield (set to 50%), and \U0001D446 is the\
    \ slope (% \n147 \nyield decline per dS/m). \n148 \nDebate about a real threshold\
    \ value has led to S-shape models or logistic curves (Van Genuchten \n149 \nand\
    \ Gupta, 1993; Van Genuchten and Hoffman, 1984). The logistic curve characterizes\
    \ the plant-\n150 \nspecific reduction function with an initial plateau followed\
    \ by a decreasing section. The plant-\n151 \nspecific reduction function is expressed\
    \ in Equation 4.  \n152 \n \n7 \n \n \nfEC =\n1\n1 + ( ECe\nECe50)\np \n(4) \n\
    where \U0001D453\U0001D438\U0001D436 is the relative yield reduction function\
    \ due to increase salt concentration levels and \n153 \n\U0001D438\U0001D436\U0001D452\
    \ is the average saturated soil extract of the root zone. The parameter \U0001D45D\
    \ is responsible for the \n154 \nsteepness of the S-shape function. The piece-wise\
    \ and the S-shape models were plotted together \n155 \nto observe how well the\
    \ s-shaped model fits the threshold model. The values (Grieve et al., 2012; \n\
    156 \nMaas and Grattan, 1999; Maas and Hoffman, 1977) were used to estimate the\
    \ ECe50. Recent \n157 \nexperiments Benes et al. (2018) in alfalfa have allowed\
    \ the update of the threshold and slope for \n158 \na more accurate ECe50. \n\

    \ \n189 \n2.2 Assessing biophysical model performance  \n190 \nA systematic review\
    \ was conducted to collect experimental yield data from previous research to \n\
    191 \nassess the model’s performance. The criteria for selecting the studies were\
    \ irrigation water \n192 \nsalinity, crop yield, soil type, and weather data.\
    \ The framework Protocol, Search, Appraisal, \n193 \nSynthesis, Analysis, and\
    \ Reporting (PSALSAR) was applied to select the articles that fit the \n194 \n\
    criteria related to the model. Details related to the PSALSAR framework are provided\
    \ by \n195 \nMengist et al. (2020). The searching string was “((Salinity OR saline\
    \ water) AND (crop yield \n196 \nOR yield)) AND (almonds OR alfalfa OR tomatoes\
    \ OR grapes).” The search was done for each \n197 \ncrop separately. Databases\
    \ Web of Science and CAB-Abstracts were the primary search engines \n198 \nconsidered\
    \ in this study. \n199 \nThe R package “metagear”(Lajeunesse, 2016) was used to\
    \ screen the abstracts, retrieve the \n200 \narticles, and delegate tasks. The\
    \ package, coupled with a GUI, was also used to extract data from \n201 \nthe\
    \ figures of the selected papers. A total of 996 articles were downloaded from\
    \ the databases, \n202 \nand 15 were selected after screening and full-text assessment\
    \ (Figure 1). R2 and RMSE (Eq. 6 \n203 \nand 7) were calculated to assess the\

    \ were \n219 \nassumed to encompass all costs of owning a field or establishing\
    \ a farm (alfalfa, almond, grape, \n220 \nand tomato), including production, harvesting,\
    \ and packaging costs. The fixed costs include \n221 \noperating, cash, and non-cash\
    \ overhead. The irrigation water cost (water price) was considered \n222 \nan\

    \ from crop yield (influenced by soil salinity and irrigation \n225 \nwater quality)\
    \ and crop prices ($/ton) (Eq. 8). The actual revenue ($/ha) is based on the relative\

    \ Expenses of non-cash overhead for an alfalfa farm include costs for \n233 \n\
    establishing the field, amortized over the three-year stand life (Clark et al.,\

    \ the remaining 20 years of the orchard’s productive lifespan. An almond \n236\
    \ \norchard’s yield usually varies every year before reaching 8 years (Duncan\
    \ et al., 2019). For \n237 \ngrapes, establishment costs reflect three years of\
    \ investment in planting and maintaining the crop \n238 \nbefore the start of\
    \ production. The total cost from the 3 years is divided into an equal cost over\

    \ \n287 \nAll four crops were affected by increasing salinity levels in the root\
    \ zone. Increasing irrigation \n288 \nsalinity of 1.5 to 5.6 dS/m decreased almonds,\
    \ alfalfa, processing tomatoes, and grapes yield by \n289 \n1.5, 2.2, 14.4, and\
    \ 5 tons/ha, respectively. Considering water available, the model predicted that\
    \ \n290 \n \n15 \n \nan ECiw level of 5.5 dS/m could decrease yield by up to 40%,\
    \ 9%, 10%, and 16% of the relative \n291 \nyield of almonds, alfalfa, almond,\
    \ and grapes, respectively (Figure 4). In sandy loam soil, the \n292 \nmodel predicted\
    \ 92%, 94%, 93%, and 94% of the relative yield for almond, alfalfa, processing\
    \ \n293 \ntomato and grape using 8, 6.5, 5.5, and 6.5 mm/day (ECiw = 0.5 dS/m),\
    \ respectively. However, \n294 \nthe same daily irrigation amount with ECiw =\
    \ 5.5 dS/m   showed just 72%, 51%, 66%, and 69% of \n295 \nthe relative yield\
    \ is attainable for alfalfa, almond, grape, and processing tomato, respectively.\
    \ \n296 \nOverall, application of 12 mm/day increased the relative yield for all\
    \ crops (Figure 4). \n297 \n \n298 \nFigure 4. Relative yield as a function of\

    302 \nConsidering the model's simplicity and the associated estimated parameters\
    \ (soil properties and \n303 \nECiw), the model predictions for yield were excellent\
    \ and within acceptable limits (Figure 5). \n304 \nComparison of experimental\
    \ data from different studies conducted under different conditions \n305 \nagainst\
    \ the model’s prediction, the model’s prediction still had an R2 of 0.82, 0.77,\
    \ 0.78, and \n306 \n \n16 \n \n0.64, with an RMSE of the relative yield of about\
    \ 9, 8, 23, and 11% for alfalfa, almonds, grapes, \n307 \nand tomatoes, respectively.\
    \ This is a good indication of the robustness of the model.  \n308 \n \n309 \n\

    \ \n3.3 Salinity impacts on expected profits from crop production \n314 \nDecreasing\
    \ yield due to salinity affects expected economic returns. In arid and semi-arid\
    \ \n315 \nclimates, where agricultural production relies heavily on irrigation,\
    \ water cost is critical to \n316 \nprofitable crop production. At the current\
    \ water price of $0.57 per ha-mm, daily irrigation with 7 \n317 \nmm of water\
    \ ensured profit with Alfalfa, irrespective of the irrigation water salinity.\
    \ For almond \n318 \n \n17 \n \nproduction, profit is only obtained with at least\
    \ 9 mm/day of irrigation with water that has \n319 \nsalinity not greater than\
    \ 2.5 dS/m (Figure 6). Similarly, grapes production was still profitable \n320\
    \ \nwith at least 8.6 mm/day and ECiw not greater than 2.5 dS/m. For both almonds\
    \ and grapes, as \n321 \nthe ECiw increased from 0.5 dS/m, more irrigation amount\
    \ is required to maintain profitability. \n322 \nHowever, above the salinity level\
    \ of 2.5 dS/m, irrigation with additional water does not generate \n323 \nprofit\
    \ even though it increases yield (Figure 4). Processing tomatoes produced $186\
    \ per ha using \n324 \n6.4 mm/day of water with ECiw not greater than 0.5 dS/m,\
    \ and losses occurred beyond ECiw of \n325 \n1.5 dS/m (Figure 6). \n326 \n \n\
    327 \nFigure 6. Potential profits regarding irrigation water applied and irrigation\
    \ water salinity (ECiw). \n328 \nThe colors represent the salinity levels from\
    \ 0.5 to 5.5 dS/m. An assumed average water cost in \n329 \nCalifornia ($70 per\
    \ ac-ft $0.57 per ha-mm) was considered for computing the profits in the \n330\
    \ \ngraphic. \n331 \n \n18 \n \nFurthermore, water quality and water prices influence\
    \ profits from crop production. As the cost \n332 \nof water goes up profit tends\
    \ to go down. Figure 7 depicts the effects of rising water costs on \n333 \nprofit\
    \ margin of alfalfa, almonds, grapes, and processing tomatoes. Irrespective of\
    \ crop, as the \n334 \ncost of water goes up, the profit margin decline with lower\
    \ market value crop like alfalfa and \n335 \ntomatoes production becoming almost\
    \ entirely unprofitable at a water price of $1.22 per ha-mm. \n336 \nAlfalfa production\
    \ generated profits ($1,297-$356 per ha) irrespective of ECiw values, with the\
    \ \n337 \nprice of water at $0.41 per ha-mm. However, profits were possible only\
    \ with ECiw of 0.5 dS/m, \n338 \nat $1.22 per ha-mm of water (Figure 7a). Processing\
    \ tomato production was only profitable when \n339 \nthe ECiw was not above 1.5\
    \ dS/m and water price of $0.41 per ha-mm. Above $0.41 per ha-mm, \n340 \ntomato\
    \ production was barely profitable only when irrigated with ECiw of 0.5 dS/m.\
    \ At water \n341 \nprice of $1.22 per ha-mm, it becomes unprofitable regardless\
    \ of the water quality (Figure 7d). On \n342 \nthe other hand, high market value\
    \ crops like grapes and almonds were still profitable at higher \n343 \nwater\
    \ prices. Provided that the ECiw was not greater than 2.5 dS/m, almond production\
    \ was still \n344 \nprofitable even at $0.81 per ha-mm water. However, at $1.22\
    \ per ha-mm water, profits were \n345 \npossible only with ECiw not greater than\
    \ 1.5 dS/m (Figure 7b). Similarly, Grape’s production was \n346 \nprofitable when\
    \ ECiw levels were not greater than 2.5 dS/m and water prices of not more than\
    \ \n347 \n$0.41 per ha-mm. At higher water prices, profit was only possible with\

    \ \nalfalfa, almonds, grapes, and processing tomatoes from 2013 to 2017 and the\
    \ 1.5 times projection \n368 \nfrom the 2017 market price at various ECiw. Alfalfa\
    \ market value showed a declining trend with \n369 \nlosses recorded from 2015\
    \ irrespective of the water ECiw. As water prices increased, losses were \n370\
    \ \nrecorded even with high quality irrigation water. For almonds, production\
    \ was profitable \n371 \nirrespective of water price, except in 2016 and 2017\
    \ when the market value of almonds was low. \n372 \nEven then, almond cultivation\
    \ was still profitable, provided that ECiw was not higher than 3.5 \n373 \ndS/m.\
    \ Profits were possible for grapes with the market price reported in 2015 when\
    \ the ECiw was \n374 \n \n21 \n \nnot greater than 2.5 dS/m.  Regardless of water\
    \ quality and cost, all other years resulted in net \n375 \nloss, except for the\
    \ projected market value of 1.5 times the 2017 price. Lastly, the model \n376\
    \ \nindicated profit for processing tomatoes when the market value was above $80/tons\
    \ (2014, 2015 \n377 \nand 1.5*2017) for salinity levels between 0.5 – 5.5 dS/m,\
    \ regardless of the water price per ha-\n378 \nmm. Other years with poor crop\
    \ market values (2013, 2016 & 2017) resulted in losses, especially \n379 \nif\
    \ irrigated with ECiw greater than 1.5 dS/m. Market prices reported in 2013 and\
    \ 2017 triggered \n380 \nprofitability losses with high saline water and water\
    \ prices. \n381 \n \n382 \nFigure 9. Expected profits ($/ha) as a function of\

    \  \n387 \nConsidering groundwater salinity, the model estimated adequate yields\
    \ in the Central Valley. \n388 \nThe relative yields were less impacted in the\
    \ northern and eastern portions of the Valley \n389 \ncompared to the western\
    \ and southern parts.  The relative yield for alfalfa, almonds, grapes, and \n\
    390 \nprocessing tomatoes with 3 mm of daily irrigation range from 0.20 to 0.54,\
    \ 0.00 to 0.42, 0.18 to \n391 \n0.54, and 0.17 to 0.65, respectively. However,\
    \ with 6 mm/day of irrigation water, the relative \n392 \nyield ranged from 0.24\
    \ to 0.99, 0.00 to 0.82, 0.23 to 0.99, and 0.22 to 0.99 for alfalfa, almonds,\
    \ \n393 \ngrapes, and processing tomatoes, respectively. Simulations with daily\
    \ irrigation amount of 6 mm \n394 \nallowed alfalfa and processing tomatoes to\
    \ reach up to 99% of their relative yield, while almonds \n395 \nand grapes required\
    \ at least 9 mm/day to reach that same yield level (Figure 10). \n396 \n \n23\

    \ indicated that no profit was possible from all four crops with 3 mm/day \n402\
    \ \nirrigation. At 6 mm/day of irrigation, maximum profits was obtained for alfalfa\
    \ and processing \n403 \ntomatoes. However, at higher irrigation amounts, such\
    \ as 9 and 12 mm/day, the profits decreased \n404 \ndue to the cost of the extra\
    \ water and the relative yield obtained per mm of water used. \n405 \nMaximum\
    \ profits with almonds and grapes cultivation were obtained with 9 mm/day irrigation.\
    \ \n406 \nSimilarly, application of higher amounts of water resulted in a decline\
    \ in the profit margin \n407 \n(Figure 11).  \n408 \n \n25 \n \n \n409 \nFigure\

    \ \n412 \n \n26 \n \nAccording to the model's predictions, increasing salinity\
    \ levels are expected to have a negative \n413 \nimpact on crop production in\
    \ the Valley. Precisely, the model forecasts a decrease in relative \n414 \nyield\
    \ and a reduction in the areas that can generate profits. However, 9 mm/day irrigation\
    \ is \n415 \nprojected to result in sufficient profits across the Valley, although\
    \ some areas may still \n416 \nexperience losses. Figures 12 and 13 present the\
    \ stacked data on relative yield and profits for the \n417 \nfour crops to better\
    \ visualize the distribution of salinity impacts on crop production. This allows\
    \ \n418 \nfor a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of salinity on\
    \ crop production across the \n419 \nValley. It is important to note that while\
    \ some areas may still suffer losses, the overall \n420 \nprofitability is expected\
    \ to be satisfactory with 9 mm/day irrigation. This information can be \n421 \n\
    highly valuable for farmers and decision-makers in making informed choices regarding\
    \ irrigation \n422 \npractices and crop selection. By considering the potential\
    \ salinity impacts on crop production and \n423 \nthe corresponding profit margins,\
    \ farmers can optimize their yields and minimize losses. \n424 \n \n27 \n \n \n\

    \ \n439 \n \n29 \n \n4 Discussion \n440 \n4.1 Crop yield response to irrigation\
    \ water salinity \n441 \nCrops are tolerant to different salinity levels, and\
    \ simplistic models have been developed to \n442 \ncharacterize crop salt response\
    \ and predict their relative yield as a function of the root zone’s \n443 \naverage\
    \ saturated soil extract (ECe). Woody and vine crops such as almonds and grapes\
    \ are less \n444 \ntolerant and demonstrate stronger response functions to salinity\
    \ than agronomic crops such as \n445 \nalfalfa and tomatoes (Grieve et al., 2012).\
    \ Crop response to salt can be effectively measured \n446 \nusing a threshold\
    \ value, denoting the maximum tolerable root zone ECe above which yields \n447\
    \ \ndecline and with a slope describing the rate of yield decline due to increased\
    \ soil salinity beyond \n448 \nthe threshold (Maas and Hoffman, 1977). The list\
    \ of crop-specific parameters for the threshold \n449 \nand slopes was updated\
    \ by Grieve et al. (2012). Steppuhn et al. (2005) assessed six non-\n450 \nempirical\
    \ models, including both piece-wise and the discount (S-shape) models, and concluded\
    \ \n451 \nwith similar ECe50 values for alfalfa. Some alfalfa varieties are more\
    \ tolerant, responding less to \n452 \nsalinity, and recent experiments showed\
    \ that a relative yield reduction of 50% can be reached at \n453 \nECe  from 11\
    \ – 14 dS/m (Benes et al., 2018). With this model, we predicted the ECe50 to be\
    \ 12 \n454 \ndS/m by modifying the slope and the threshold. Low salinity tolerance\
    \ of almonds and grapes \n455 \nhas been reported to adversely affect their productivity\
    \ (Sandhu and Acharya, 2019; Suarez et \n456 \nal., 2019; Zhou-Tsang et al., 2021;\
    \ Zrig et al., 2011) which is in agreement with the modeling \n457 \nresults of\
    \ this study. Tree crop salinity response can be complicated because of the influence\
    \ of \n458 \nspecific salt constituents (Christie,1987), and woody perennials\
    \ can accumulate specific ions in \n459 \ntheir tissues leading to specific ion\
    \ toxicity, e.g., sodium and boron. Semiz and Suarez (2019) \n460 \nfound tomato\
    \ yield loss of up to 50% at 5.7 dS/m, which is very similar to the one calculated\
    \ by \n461 \nthe model in this study (ECe50 = 5.5 dS/m). \n462 \nThe standard\
    \ errors pertained to the threshold (ECe50) range from 50 to over 100%, denoting\
    \ the \n463 \nenormous uncertainty of these values primarily due to a lack of\
    \ physiological justification \n464 \n(Grieve et al., 2012). The debate about\
    \ a real threshold value has led to the development of s-\n465 \nshape models\
    \ (Van Genuchten and Gupta, 1993; van Genuchten and Hoffman, 1984) that are \n\
    466 \nmore agronomically plausible, although they have found less extensive application\
    \ as the \n467 \nthreshold model due to less intuitive appeal of the s-shape model\
    \ parameters (van Straten et al., \n468 \n2019). A more robust and agronomically\
    \ sound threshold crop salt-tolerance parameter (ECe90: \n469 \n \n30 \n \nsoil\
    \ salinity that decreases the relative yield up to 90%) was suggested as an alternative\
    \ to the \n470 \nthreshold ECe (van Straten et al., 2019, 2021). \n471 \nAlfalfa\
    \ is classified as moderately sensitive to salinity beyond an ECe of 2.0 dS/m.\
    \ A unit \n472 \nincrease in salinity beyond this threshold would reduce alfalfa\
    \ yield by 9.6% (Grieve et al., 2012; \n473 \nMaas and Grattan, 1999; Maas and\
    \ Hoffman, 1977). Recent studies such as Cornacchione and \n474 \nSuarez (2017)\
    \ found that alfalfa could produce high biomass (up to 77%) in high saline \n\
    475 \nconditions (ECe = 5.8 dS/m). However, this salinity tolerance might be due\
    \ to a specific gene, as \n476 \nsalinity response varies greatly among alfalfa\
    \ genotypes (Sandhu et al., 2017). Alfalfa yields \n477 \nusing irrigation water\
    \ with high salinity levels (ECiw of 8-11 dS/m) were found to be \n478 \neconomically\
    \ viable in the Southern part of the Central Valley (21.5 tons/ha) (Putnam et\
    \ al., \n479 \n2019). Such findings refute literature values estimating alfalfa\
    \ yield decline at low root zone \n480 \nsalinity (ECe = 2 dS/m).  \n481 \nAlmonds\
    \ are sensitive to salinity, which is reflected by their low threshold EC of the\
    \ soil \n482 \nsaturation extract (ECe) of 1.5 dS/m and a growth reduction rate\
    \ of 19% per unit increase in \n483 \nsalinity beyond the threshold (Maas and\
    \ Hoffman, 1977). Several almond orchards are damaged \n484 \nunder conditions\
    \ caused by salinity, even under the published threshold value (Sanden et al.,\
    \ \n485 \n2014). Irrigation with high saline water (4.6 dS/m) was reported to\
    \ decrease almond kernel yield \n486 \nby 46% compared to low saline water (0.8)\
    \ dS/m) (Franco et al., 2000). Although almonds are \n487 \ndrought-resistant,\
    \ their peak performance is extremely sensitive to irrigation water quality \n\
    488 \n(Prgomet et al., 2020).  \n489 \nGrape is considered moderately sensitive\
    \ to salinity beyond an EC threshold of 1.5 dS/m and \n490 \n9.9% of the yield\
    \ decline rate with 1 dS/m EC increase (Grieve et al., 2012; Maas and Grattan,\
    \ \n491 \n1999; Maas and Hoffman, 1977). Paranychianakis et al. (2004) reported\
    \ 50% grape yield loss \n492 \nwhen irrigated with salty water (ECiw 1.9/m) as\
    \ compared to freshwater (ECiw 0.6 dS/m). \n493 \nHowever, long-term studies of\
    \ grape yield-salinity relationships have shown the pre-eminence of \n494 \nparticular\
    \ rootstocks that allow salinity tolerance (Zhang et al., 2002). A confounding\
    \ issue arises \n495 \nbecause grapevines can have a catastrophic response to\
    \ long-term salt exposure as salts build up \n496 \nto threshold levels in woody\
    \ tissues of the plants resulting in physiological damages, including \n497 \n\
    vine mortality (Dag et al., 2015; Shani & Ben-Gal, 2005; Simhayov et al., 2023).\
    \ \n498 \nProcessing tomatoes are considered moderately sensitive to salinity,\
    \ with a 9.6 % yield decline \n499 \nwith one unit of increased salinity beyond\
    \ the threshold EC of 2.5 dS/m (Grieve et al., 2012; \n500 \nMaas and Grattan,\
    \ 1999; Maas and Hoffman, 1977). Salinity can significantly affect tomato yield\
    \ \n501 \n \n31 \n \nby reducing vegetative growth (Tzortzakis et al., 2022).\
    \ Tomato yield is reduced at ECe of 2.5 \n502 \ndS/m or higher, and an increase\
    \ of 1 dS/m would trigger a yield reduction of up to 10% \n503 \n(Cuartero and\
    \ Fernández-Muñoz, 1998), similar to our results. However, a salinity level (ECe)\
    \ of \n504 \n4.8 dS/m was found to have no significant impact on tomatoes’ fruit\
    \ yield and improved the \n505 \nquality of the nutrients contained in the fruit\
    \ (Stamatakis et al., 2003).  \n506 \n4.2 Combined impacts of salinity, crop market\
    \ prices, and water prices on economic \n507 \nreturns  \n508 \nWater scarcity\
    \ in California has led to the adoption of high-value crops such as fruits and\
    \ nuts \n509 \n(Ayars et al., 2015). Under irrigation water with higher salinity\
    \ values, the model predicted \n510 \nhigher profits from crops with high market\
    \ value, such as almonds and grapes. In contrast, both \n511 \nalfalfa and tomatoes\
    \ were likely more affected by increased water prices than salinity due to their\
    \ \n512 \nrelatively low market value. The slope of the profits from alfalfa and\
    \ processing tomatoes \n513 \ndecreased slowly with the salinity increase. However,\
    \ processing tomatoes profits were much \n514 \nmore affected than alfalfa at\
    \ higher salinity levels, such as 5.5 dS/m. The profits from almonds \n515 \n\
    and grapes decreased substantially with the salinity levels. However, water prices\
    \ and salinity \n516 \nlevels affected almond profits less than grapes (Figures\
    \ 9 and 10). This might be due to the \n517 \nalmond sale prices. Almond’s revenue\
    \ overtook processing tomatoes by providing much more \n518 \nprofits in many\
    \ Counties of the State of California (Smith, 2018). Gebremichael et al. (2021)\
    \ \n519 \ninvestigated cropping patterns in California’s Central Valley in response\
    \ to droughts. They \n520 \nconcluded that the shift in cropping patterns was\
    \ probably due to increasing crop prices and \n521 \nchanges in pumping costs.\
    \ These findings agree with our study results predicting higher profits \n522\
    \ \nfrom crops with high market value while predicting lower economic returns\
    \ from crops with low \n523 \nmarket values, although with a relatively mild response\
    \ to salinity. \n524 \nSimilar findings were generated by the same model for a\
    \ case study evaluating the feasibility of \n525 \nbrackish groundwater desalination\
    \ for irrigation in southern Israel (Kaner et al., 2017). In that \n526 \nstudy,\
    \ high-value, salinity-sensitive crops (date palms and table grapes) were found\
    \ to justify the \n527 \ncosts of desalination as an alternative to irrigation\
    \ with local water high in salts.  \n528 \nThe model predicted a decrease in revenues,\
    \ similar to other studies assessing salinity impacts on \n529 \neconomic outcomes\
    \ in the Central Valley (Medellín-Azuara et al., 2014; Montazar et al., 2017;\
    \ \n530 \nWichelns and Oster, 2006). Integrated biophysical models with soil and\
    \ irrigation water salinity \n531 \n \n32 \n \nand economic data can be used as\
    \ decision-support tools for salinity management. Kaner et al. \n532 \n(2019)\
    \ implemented a web-based decision support system that returns yield and economic\
    \ gains \n533 \nfrom crops considering irrigation water salinity and market price\
    \ scenarios with environmental \n534 \nconsiderations. Increases in water prices\
    \ or salinity were predicted to significantly negatively \n535 \naffect farmers’\
    \ incomes. Welle and Mauter (2017) estimated that salinity reduced agricultural\
    \ \n536 \nrevenues by $3.7 billion (in 2014) using a generalizable approach to\
    \ estimate the agricultural \n537 \nyield losses due to soil salinization. When\
    \ the Delta water is more saline during dry years, dual \n538 \nexport conveyance\
    \ gives the highest revenue losses, roughly $4.5 billion annually. Under the \n\
    539 \nfuture groundwater pumping regulations in the Central Valley, water supplies\
    \ may not be \n540 \nsufficient to meet water demands and trigger losses by up\
    \ to 30% of total annual revenues in the \n541 \nValley (Mall and Herman, 2019).\
    \ Major crops such as almonds, alfalfa, and grapevine have a \n542 \nsignificant\
    \ water footprint in the Central Valley (Fulton et al., 2019), and their economic\
    \ returns \n543 \ncan be severely affected by high water prices in drought periods.\
    \ The paradox projected declines \n544 \nin water supplies for irrigation in the\
    \ Central Valley of California would exacerbate salinity \n545 \nproblems because\
    \ there will be less water leaching salts out of the root zone. \n546 \n4.4 Significance\
    \ and limitations of the model \n547 \nThe success of the model is remarkable,\
    \ considering its simplicity and dependence on major \n548 \nassumptions. The\
    \ assumption of steady-state conditions may limit its validity to environments\
    \ \n549 \nwhere much of the irrigation season is without significant precipitation\
    \ and where advanced \n550 \nirrigation scheduling and water is supplied regularly\
    \ as a constant function of potential \n551 \nevapotranspiration. Pseudo-steady\
    \ state conditions were found to be the case for date palms \n552 \ngrown in lysimeters\
    \ in Israel (Tripler et al., 2012).  The assumption that economic return can be\
    \ \n553 \npredicted by simulation of vegetative growth (transpiration) is also\
    \ questionable, obviously crop-\n554 \nspecific, and not always validated in cases\
    \ where vegetative and reproductive growth are not \n555 \nlinearly related. While\
    \ these may necessitate caution in using the model, its success under \n556 \n\
    advanced irrigated agriculture conditions in Israel and California boosts confidence\
    \ in its \n557 \npotential as a planning and analysis tool.   \n558 \n \n33 \n\
    \ \n5 Conclusion and future research \n559 \nIrrigation water salinity has a detrimental\
    \ effect on crop productivity and the environment. This \n560 \nstudy investigated\
    \ the negative impacts of irrigation water salinity and water price on yield and\
    \ \n561 \nprofits generated for four selected crops (alfalfa, almonds, grapes,\
    \ and processing tomatoes) \n562 \ngrown in the Central Valley of California.\
    \ The integration of simple economic equations with \n563 \nsoil and crop biophysical\
    \ conditions showed the capability of the model to predict relative yield \n564\
    \ \nand profit as a function of irrigation water quality. The study provides insights\
    \ into the expected \n565 \nreduction in crop revenue with increasing salinity\
    \ levels and water prices. Our model highlights \n566 \nthe importance of high-value\
    \ crops such as almonds and grapes, which could provide good \n567 \nprofits,\
    \ although their yields will be reduced with increasing salinity. \n568 \nFurther\
    \ research can improve larger scale economic predictions with the spatial component\
    \ \n569 \nintegrated into the model. Considering the possibilities for using the\
    \ model in a decision support \n570 \nsystem, this could assist farmers and other\
    \ stakeholders in predicting the implication of salinity \n571 \nand the fluctuation\
    \ of water and crop market prices on food systems and economic outcomes. \n572\
    \ \nFurthermore, it could help manage farmland use and mitigate the adverse effects\
    \ of salinity by \n573 \nfarming different crops in different locations. In extreme\
    \ cases where salinity levels are very \n574 \nhigh, the modeling framework developed\
    \ in this study can serve as a tool for policy makers to \n575 \nidentify parts\
    \ of the Central Valley that are no longer viable for sustainable and profitable\
    \ \n576 \nirrigated agriculture and prioritize them for multi-benefit land repurposing\
    \ to reduce agricultural \n577 \nwater demand and achieve groundwater sustainability\
    \ under SGMA. Many other regions of the \n578 \nworld dealing with salinity and\
    \ sustainability of irrigated agriculture can adapt the analytical \n579 \nframework\
    \ proposed in this study to better manage the salinity challenge. \n580 \nAcknowledgments\

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\

    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    is a key determinant of plant photosynthesis and water relations, influencing
    plant survival, adaptation, and growth. Stomata sense the surrounding environment
    and respond rapidly to abiotic and biotic stresses. Stomatal conductance to water
    vapour (gs) and/or transpiration (E) are therefore valuable physiological parameters
    to be monitored in plant and agricultural sciences. However, leaf gas exchange
    measurements involve contact with leaves and often interfere with leaf functioning.
    Besides, they are time consuming and are limited by the sampling characteristics
    (e.g. sample size and/or the high number of samples required). Remote and rapid
    means to assess gs or E are thus particularly valuable for physiologists, agronomists,
    and ecologists. Transpiration influences the leaf energy balance and, consequently,
    leaf temperature (Tleaf). As a result, thermal imaging makes it possible to estimate
    or quantify gs and E. Thermal imaging has been successfully used in a wide range
    of conditions and with diverse plant species. The technique can be applied at
    different scales (e.g. from single seedlings/leaves through whole trees or field
    crops to regions), providing great potential to study plant–environment interactions
    and specific phenomena such as abnormal stomatal closure, genotypic variation
    in stress tolerance, and the impact of different management strategies on crop
    water status. Nevertheless, environmental variability (e.g. in light intensity,
    temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) affects the accuracy of thermal imaging
    measurements. This review presents and discusses the advantages of thermal imaging
    applications to plant science, agriculture, and ecology, as well as its limitations
    and possible approaches to minimize them, by highlighting examples from previous
    and ongoing research. Crop stress, genetic improvement, remote sensing, screening

    Plant–environment interactions and stomata The physical environment is often adverse
    to plant growth and survival as well as to crop yield and quality. Factors such
    as insufficient water or nutrients, high or low temperature, salinity, diseases,
    and insect damage are likely to restrict plant growth at some stage. The predicted
    global climate change will increase the incidence of extreme climate events (drought
    spells and heat waves) and related stress, leading to changes in plant biodiversity
    and reduced crop yields (Fedoroff et al., 2010). Increased sensitivity of crops
    to pests and diseases and the spread of novel pests and diseases are also likely
    to occur (Gregory et al., 2009). Plants interact with the surrounding environment
    namely through carbon, water- and energy-exchange processes, maintaining an equilibrium
    that permits them to grow and adapt to variable growing conditions. Stomatal regulation
    of leaf gas exchange (CO2 and H2O fluxes) in response to the environment plays
    a key role in this adaptation, allowing a compromise between photosynthetic gains
    and water loss as well as allowing regulation of canopy temperature (Tcanopy)
    (Jones, 1992; Chaves et al., 2003). Heat loss by plants occurs mainly via evaporative
    cooling, resulting from leaf transpiration (E) (Jones, 1992). Reduced transpiration
    under water deficits and high irradiance raises the risk of leaf temperature (Tleaf)
    increasing above the optimum for metabolic activity or above the threshold that
    leads to irreversible leaf tissue oxidative stress. The control of stomatal aperture
    results from coordinated alterations of guard cell turgor dependent on ionic fluxes,
    cytoskeleton changes, membrane transport, and gene expression. This regulation
    involves the concurrence of different signals in a complex and coordinated network,
    resulting in a tight and fast modulation of stomatal aperture in response to a
    fluctuating environment (Hetherington and Woodward, 2003). If we consider the
    linear relationship between stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) and E under
    a constant air vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and the non-linear relationship
    between gs and photosynthetic rate, decreased stomatal aperture under the first
    stages of stress development may improve intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi)
    with a positive impact on plant growth and adaptation to the environment. However,
    when stress becomes severe, a strong decline in carbon assimilation leads to decreased
    WUEi, with photosynthesis being restricted not only by stomatal closure but also
    by biochemical and photochemical limitations (Chaves et al., 2003). Regulation
    of water loss by an efficient control of the opening/closing of stomata also minimizes
    the risks of xylem embolism by reducing xylem cavitation, and by regulating water
    fluxes in the plant, indirectly influences water and nutrient uptake. Stomata
    also influence plant response to biotic stresses. In general, plants respond to
    surface-inoculated pathogens by reducing stomatal aperture as part of the innate
    immune response to restrict bacterial invasion (Melotto et al., 2008). Improved
    understanding of stomatal regulation of leaf gas exchange is needed to better
    predict and model key factors influencing crop growth and yield as well as ecosystem
    sustainability under increasing environmental stress. However, leaf gas exchange
    measurements involve contact with leaves and often interfere with leaf functioning.
    Besides, they are time consuming and can be limited by the reduced dimension of
    the leaf samples and/or the large number of measurements to be done. Therefore,
    faster, remote and non-invasive high-throughput analysis based on imaging are
    mandatory. Remote sensing and functional imaging for plant science Remote sensing
    of vegetation is a non-invasive methodology to monitor physical and physiological
    characteristics of plants and to evaluate the effects of environmental stresses
    on plant performance (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). Functional imaging permits observations
    at different scales (from single leaves/seedlings to entire branches/plants or
    trees or fields) and the assessment of dynamic and spatial variability of processes.
    The basis of nearly all remote sensing is electromagnetic radiation. Remote sensing
    involves the measurement of the amount of reflected and emitted radiation at different
    spectral wavelengths (e.g. ultraviolet, visible, infrared (IR), and microwave).
    It includes several imaging techniques such as visible imaging, near-IR and thermal
    IR imaging, chlorophyll a fluorescence imaging, and multispectral imaging and
    luminescence imaging (Chaerle and Van der Straeten, 2001; Baker and Rosenqvist,
    2004; Havaux et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2010; Jiménez-Bello et al., 2011; Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). Among those, thermal imaging (thermography) is one of the most
    used in agronomic and environmental sciences and also in the agri-food industry
    (Jones and Vaughan, 2010; Maes and Steppe, 2012). Remote sensing is the basis
    of precision agri-horticulture, which aims to use more efficiently the inputs
    (e.g. water, biocides, fertilizers), optimize yield, and minimize environmental
    impact (Lee et al., 2010). This is in line with the need to increase food production
    under increasingly unfavourable climate, scarcer natural resources (water, arable
    land) (Wilkinson and Hartung, 2009; Fedoroff et al., 2010), stricter environmental
    legislation, and increased consumer demands (Lubin and Esty, 2010). Remote sensing
    is also applied in phenomics, an innovative approach towards high-throughput plant
    phenotyping (Furbank and Tester, 2011), to aid breeding of more productive and
    stress-resistant cultivars. IR thermal imaging and stomatal conductance IR radiation
    and imaging Heat transfer by radiation occurs in the IR region of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, between 0.75 and 1000 μm (Kaplan, 2007). According to Planck’s radiation
    law, every object at a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin) emits electromagnetic
    radiation in the IR region of the spectrum. The amount of IR radiation emitted
    by an object depends on its emissivity (ε) and absolute temperature, in accordance
    with the Stefan–Boltzmann law (Equation 1): W = ε σ Ts4 (1) where W is spectral
    radiant excitance (total radiation emitted) (W m−2), ε is emissivity (dimensionless),
    σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant (5.67×10−8 W m−2 K−4), and Ts is the surface
    temperature (K). The emissivity, at a particular wavelength, represents the amount
    of radiation emitted by a theoretical object as a fraction of the radiation emitted
    by a perfect emitter, named blackbody, with ε = 1. ‘Real-world’ objects (grey
    bodies) absorb a certain fraction of the incident radiation and reflect and transmit
    the remaining part, resulting in ε < 1. Plant material has high ε, varying between
    0.91 and 0.97. Soils have slightly lower ε (0.94–0.95) and sand can have ε as
    low as 0.89 (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). When determining the temperature of an
    object with thermal imaging, we must consider that the total radiation (W) detected
    by camera’s sensor is the sum of three major IR radiation streams: (1) the radiation
    leaving the object’s surface; (2) the radiation emitted by the object’s surroundings
    and further reflected by the object’s surface, commonly named background radiation
    (Wbackground) (both stream 1 and 2 are modified by transmission through the atmosphere);
    and (3) any radiation emitted by the atmosphere (Watm) (Equation 2). Therefore,
    the total radiation is given by: W = τ [εσ (Ts)4 + (1 – ε) Wbackground)] + Watm
    (2) where τ is atmospheric transmissivity (dimensionless), Wbackground is background
    radiation (W m−2), and Watm is the radiance emitted by the atmosphere (W m−2).
    The contribution of the atmosphere is relevant for airborne and satellite measurements
    (Jones and Vaughan, 2010) but it can be neglected for ground-based measurements
    and laboratory experiments and when IR radiation is sensed at appropriate wavelengths
    (e.g. 3–5 and 7–14 µm), in which the atmospheric transmission for IR radiation
    is close to a maximum (Kaplan, 2007). In this case the total radiation leaving
    the surface of the object is calculated as follows: W = εσ (Ts)4 + (1 – ε) Wbackground
    (3) To discard the effect of the Wbackground, it can be estimated by measuring
    the temperature of a crumpled sheet of aluminium foil (high reflectivity and ε
    = 0.03), placed in the same location as the target object and setting the camera
    with ε = 1 (Jones et al., 2002). Most thermal cameras will automatically provide
    Ts, once the ε and Wbackground have been input. Relationship between gs and Tleaf
    As thoroughly reviewed by Maes and Steppe (2012), leaf and plant temperature depends
    on the radiation and atmospheric conditions (time of day, clear or cloudy sky,
    air temperature, wind speed), soil conditions (soil type, soil water content,
    etc.), and canopy properties (morphology, density, height) that all together influence
    the size and ratios of the radiant, sensible and latent heat fluxes. The relationship
    between gs, the inverse of stomatal resistance (rs, leaf resistance to water vapour
    loss, assumed to be dominated by the stomatal resistance component), and Tleaf
    is summarized by the leaf energy balance equation (Jones, 1992, 1999) given by:
    Tleaf – Tair = [rHR (raw + rs) γRni − ρ cprHR VPD] ÷ [ρ cp {γ (raw + rs) + srHR}]
    (4) where Tleaf is leaf temperature (K), Tair is air temperature (K), rHR is parallel
    resistance to heat and radiative transfer (s m–1), raw is boundary layer resistance
    to water vapour (s m–1), γ is the psychrometric constant (Pa K–1), Rni is net
    isothermal radiation (the net radiation for a leaf at air temperature) (W m–2),
    ρ is density of the air (kg m–3), cp is specific heat capacity of air (J kg–1
    K–1), s is the slope of curve relating saturating water vapour pressure to temperature
    (Pa K–1), and VPD is air vapour pressure deficit (Pa). Fluctuating environmental
    conditions and thermal indices It is clear from Equation 4 that Tleaf depends
    not only on gs, but also on Tair, Rni, VPD, and wind speed (Jones, 1999). If comparing,
    for example, the impact of different management practices on crop physiology while
    the weather is stable, Tleaf alone can provide the required information about
    relative stress in the different treatments. If the aim is to determine the development
    of stress in a crop over time, on the other hand, it is necessary to normalize
    Tleaf in relation to references to account for changing meteorology (Jones et
    al., 2009). A wide range of different types of stress index have been used to
    address this issue. Here an overview is provided to allow the reader to determine
    what technique might suit a particular experiment. For more detailed assessment
    of the pros and cons of each, including analysis of the impact of such factors
    as leaf size and albedo, Tair and VPD, and Rni, see Maes and Steppe (2012). That
    Tleaf increases as a result of stress was first exploited by Jackson et al. (1977),
    who developed the stress degree day to detect stress by using thermometers in
    field conditions. The stress degree day is the accumulated difference in temperature
    between the leaf (or crop canopy) and the air along a certain period. According
    to this index, if Tcanopy is lower than Tair, then plants are assumed to be well
    watered. If Tcanopy is greater than the Tair, then plants are assumed to be drought
    stressed. While this index represents an improvement over the use of Tcanopy alone,
    since it allows for fluctuating Tair, it does not take into account changes in
    VPD, solar radiation, or wind speed. Based on energy balance considerations, Jackson
    et al. (1981) appreciated that the canopy to air temperature difference (Tcanopy
    – Tair) depends on VPD: under non-limiting soil water conditions, a crop transpires
    at the potential rate (i.e. evapotranspiration is the maximum it can be, but maximum
    evapotranspiration increases with increasing VPD). Thus for several crops, when
    water availability is not limiting and when measured under clear sky conditions,
    there is a linear relationship between Tcanopy – Tair and VPD. Jackson et al.
    (1981) called this linear relationship the theoretical non-water-stressed baseline.
    For a given crop, at a given VPD, this theoretical baseline provides the minimum
    possible value of Tcanopy – Tair. The Tcanopy – Tair for a non-transpiring crop
    is insensitive to VPD, and can be estimated if wind speed and net solar radiation
    are known. This sets the ‘upper limit’ to Tcanopy – Tair. Jackson et al. (1981)
    used the idea of ‘upper and lower’ baselines, to create a crop water stress index
    (CWSI): (5) where Tcanopy – Tair is the measured difference in temperature, (Tcanopy
    – Tair)nwsb is the estimated difference at the same VPD under non-limiting soil
    water conditions (non-water-stressed baseline), and (Tcanopy – Tair)ul is the
    non-transpiring upper limit. This CWSI allows to relate crop’s temperature to
    the maximum and minimum values possible under similar environmental conditions.
    The higher the CWSI, the greater the crop stress is assumed to be. Yuan et al.
    (2004) and Testi et al. (2008) for example, found CWSI to be inversely correlated
    with leaf water potential. A disadvantage of the above form of CWSI is the need
    to determine the non-water-stressed baseline by plotting Tcanopy − Tair against
    VPD. This requires substantial time to be spent determining the baseline for a
    well-watered crop, and the VPD needs to be known when measuring Tcanopy of the
    crop of interest. Also, this index does not account for changes in Tcanopy due
    to irradiance and wind speed, and the non-water-stressed baseline is not necessarily
    the same under different radiation conditions. Finally, the non-transpiring upper
    limit also varies, with a wide range of values being reported (Ben-Gal et al.,
    2009). Use of artificial references An alternative approach is to replace the
    non-water-stressed baseline and the non-transpiring upper limit, respectively,
    with the Tleaf or Tcanopy from which there is maximum transpiration and the Tleaf
    and Tcanopy from which there is no transpiration, measured in the same environment
    and at the same time as the crop of interest. The fact that these ‘references’
    are in the same environment as Tcanopy means that there is no need for theoretical
    estimations of baselines, as they will be exposed to the same VPD, Rni, and wind
    speed as the canopy of interest. The temperatures of the references are referred
    to as Twet and Tdry, respectively. Jones (1999) adapted the crop water stress
    index to include these reference temperatures, giving the following form: (6)
    This version of CWSI (referred to as CWSId in the review by Maes and Steppe, 2012)
    has been shown to inversely correlate with leaf water potential (e.g. Cohen et
    al., 2005; Grant et al., 2007). To ensure that there are suitable references in
    each thermal image, leaves can be sprayed with water (Twet) and covered in Vaseline
    to artificially close stomata (Tdry) (Fig. 1A–C). Other approaches include the
    use of wet and dry filter paper (Jones et al., 2002; Loveys et al., 2008), wet
    and dry cotton (Fig. 1D, E), and wet and dry tensiometers (Fig. 1F, G). Metal
    artificial leaves can be used as well (Fig. 1H, I). To prevent the wet reference
    from drying out, sometimes a reservoir of water is provided, with material acting
    as a wick (Alchanatis et al., 2010). Fig. 1. Open in new tabDownload slide Different

    IR cameras; all others are RGB digital images; images relate to various projects,
    with participation of U Srikasetsarakul, W Spreer, S Zia (A, D–G), and H Ochagavía
    (H, I), and funding from sources including Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (A,
    D–G) and the UK Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (B, C).
    An alternative index, based on a rearrangement of the energy balance equation,
    is thermal index of relative stomatal conductance (IG) (Jones, 1999): (7) For
    most values of gs, IG is linearly proportional to gs, as has now been demonstrated
    under a wide range of conditions (as reviewed by Maes and Steppe, 2012). This
    index uses the same references as the second form of CWSI (Equation 6), but gives
    low values in stressed crops and higher values with increasing gs. As the inclusion
    of wet and dry reference surfaces in every image can sometimes be logistically
    difficult, an alternative to the above indices is to use an actual non-water-stressed
    plant/crop and a stressed plant/crop as extremes and relate the temperature of
    the crop of interest to these (Grant et al., 2007). This is appropriate for example
    where the crop of interest is deficit irrigated and hence expected to have a Tcanopy
    intermediate between those extremes. Since the reference crops, however, cannot
    usually be included in every image, there is the problem that meteorological conditions
    can change between imaging the reference crop and the crop of interest. Grant
    et al. (2007) therefore interpolated the temperatures of the reference crops between
    a series of images to estimate their temperature at the precise time at which
    the crops of interest were imaged. Separating canopy from soil temperature The
    above indices are appropriate where only leaves are being analysed (i.e. either
    the crop completely covers the soil, or only leaves are selected to acquire Tcanopy).
    An alternative index called the water deficit index (WDI) was developed for applications
    where soil and crop temperatures could not be separated (Moran, 1994). This index
    uses the difference between the temperature of the surface (which includes vegetation
    and bare soil) and the temperature of the air – (Ts – Tair) – along with an index
    of vegetation cover. At 100% vegetation cover, the values of WDI will fall within
    the same limits of the CWSI. For more details on the estimation and the pros and
    cons of the WDI, see Maes and Steppe (2012). Alternatives to the stress indices
    An alternative to the use of stress indices is to estimate gs (Leinonen et al.,
    2006; Guilioni et al., 2008) from Tleaf. This requires that Tair and VPD, net
    radiation, and wind speed are measured at the same time as Tleaf. Berni et al.
    (2009) used this approach to estimate canopy conductance of olive trees under
    different irrigation regimes, with Tleaf being derived from an image obtained
    from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). They also estimated CWSI using meteorological
    data rather than references to obtain Twet and Tdry, and found that the estimated
    CWSI was strongly inversely correlated with leaf water potential. Ben-Gal et al.
    (2009) compared estimation of CWSI using meteorological data with estimation using
    Tdry = Tair + 5°C (which is rather arbitrary) and Twet being the temperature of
    a wet cloth. The two methods gave similar results, and the authors suggest using
    meteorological data is preferable, to avoid the need of a wet reference in every
    image. This approach, however, does mean that the reference temperatures are not
    obtained at the same environmental conditions as Tleaf, since a full set of meteorological
    data cannot be collected at each plant of interest. A compromise is to use one
    reference: if Tdry is measured, then the need to measure net radiation is removed
    – an approach that gave consistent results in both field (Leinonen et al., 2006)
    and greenhouse (Grant et al., 2012) conditions. If Twet is also measured, Tair
    and the boundary layer resistance are the only additional information required
    to estimate gs. Some authors have empirically determined the relationship between
    CWSI and leaf water potential, or between Tcanopy and stem water potential or
    gs, and then used this relationship to map variation in water potential or gs
    (Cohen et al., 2005; Alchanatis et al., 2010; Baluja et al., 2012). The step of
    determining the empirical relationship for a subsample is not necessary because
    gs can be mapped from Tleaf based simply on Equation 4. A different approach is
    to focus on variability of temperature, rather than absolute temperature. Given
    the large influence of gs on the energy budget of a canopy, a greater range of
    temperatures will be found in a canopy as stomata close, due to the relatively
    greater influence of variation in leaf exposure as compared to a non-stressed,
    fully transpiring canopy (Fuchs, 1990). This, however, will not apply to canopies
    with a non-random distribution of leaf exposure (Grant et al., 2007). There has
    been little experimental assessment of this approach with canopies that do show
    a random distribution of leaf angle and orientation, with the exception of a study
    by Bryant and Moran (1999), which showed that crop temperatures deviate from a
    normal distribution as plant water stress increases. González-Dugo et al. (2006)
    considered that variation in temperature in a crop will increase with stress not
    because of increased variation in leaf exposure when transpiration is low, but
    because variability in rooting depth or soil structure, for example, will increase
    as soil dries. They therefore compared the standard deviation of Tcanopy to that
    of CWSI and found that the standard deviation of Tcanopy correlates with CWSI
    for moderate but not for severe water stress. Thermal imaging: applications in
    plant and agricultural sciences Forward genetics screens and characterization
    of mutants and transgenics Forward genetics and selection of stomatal mutants
    has been providing new biological tools to study and better understand the genetic,
    physical, and physiological basis of stomatal responses to environment (Papdi
    et al., 2009; Dodd, 2013). Forward genetics involves induction of artificial genetic
    variation by chemical, physical, or biological mutagenesis and the screening of
    mutants for a certain phenotype of interest (Papdi et al., 2009). Mutants identified
    in novel screens are useful to identify signalling pathway components and potential
    genes that can be used to improve plant performance under stress (e.g. drought)
    (Plessis et al., 2011). The use of thermal imaging in forward genetics and related
    large-scale screens and mutant characterization is rather recent (Merlot et al.,
    2002) and accompanied rapid developments in plant molecular physiology and functional
    genomics. In the context of studies on stomatal regulation, the aim of forward
    genetics is to dissect different signalling pathways (e.g. abscisic acid) at the
    genetic level involved in regulation of guard cell response to internal and environmental
    signals. With thermal imaging it is possible to screen several thousands of young
    seedlings and isolate those presenting a temperature difference relative to the
    respective wild type, as a result of different stomatal regulation (example in
    Fig. 2A). The model species Arabidopsis thaliana has been used to identify and
    characterize molecular regulators of transpiration using forward genetics (Nilson
    and Assmann, 2007). Mutants with abnormal stomatal response to drought (Merlot
    et al., 2002; Plessis et al., 2011), light (Merlot et al., 2007), air CO2 concentration
    (Hashimoto et al., 2006), air VPD (Xie et al., 2006) and ozone (Saji et al., 2008)
    have been isolated to date. Genetic characterization of these mutants led to the
    identification of new genes encoding proteins such as an abscisic acid-activated
    protein kinase (Merlot et al., 2002) and a plasma membrane H+-ATPase (Merlot et
    al., 2007), as well as other key mediators involved in signalling networks regulating
    stomatal aperture/closure in response to the environment (Papdi et al., 2009;
    Sirichandra et al., 2009). For example, Merlot et al. (2002) isolated mutations
    at two novel loci designated as OST1 (OPEN STOMATA 1, At4g33950) and OST2. ost1
    and ost2 were the first mutations altering abscisic acid responsiveness in stomata
    and not in seeds (Merlot et al., 2002). More recently, Negi et al. (2008) isolated
    another Arabidopsis gene, SLAC1 (SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1, At1g12480),
    encoding the S-type anion channel, which was shown to mediate sensitivity of stomata
    to CO2. SLAC1 was found essential for stomatal closure in response to CO2, and
    SLAC1-deficient mutants showed constitutively higher gs as result of larger stomatal
    aperture. Fig. 2. Open in new tabDownload slide Examples of thermal imaging in
    forward genetics and plant phenotyping. A: Visible (upper) and false-coloured
    thermal (lower) images at two growth stages (young seedlings and mature stage),
    for wild type (WT, ecotype Columbia) (left) and mutant ost2 (Merlot et al., 2007)
    (right) Arabidopsis thaliana after plants were dark adapted. The WT close their
    stomata in the dark whereas the ost2 plants do not. Therefore, the WT show higher
    leaf temperatures than mutants. (B) Visible and false coloured IR images of 4-week-old
    rice plants subjected to drought and overexpressing (right) and silencing (left)
    a bHLH transcription factor (Chander S, Almeida D, Serra T, Barros P, Costa JM,
    Santos T, Oliveira MM, Saibo N, unpublished, with permission). In rice, thermography
    helped to isolate and characterize SLAC1-deficient mutants with a constitutive
    low Tleaf phenotype and consequently higher gs (Kusumi et al., 2012). These mutants
    had higher photosynthetic rates than the wild type, which could improve growth
    and yield. Transgenic lines of rice overexpressing a transcription factor (bHLH
    family) were characterized for their response to drought stress. The overexpressing
    line showed lower Tleaf (and consequently higher gs) than the silencing line (Chander
    et al., unpublished) (Fig. 2B). Thermal imaging is also useful to support preliminary
    physiological characterization of novel mutants with abnormal leaf growth (small
    and curled leaves), which limit leaf gas exchange measurements. Characterization
    of ESK1, which results in reduced growth and deficient vascular water transport,
    was based on measurements of Tleaf in detached leaves (Lefebvre et al., 2011).
    Stress detection and management Water stress monitoring and irrigation management
    Given the relationship between Tleaf and crop stress, the potential of thermal
    imaging to monitor crop water status is clear. In fact, thermal imaging can show
    differences between irrigated and non-irrigated plants and between different intensities
    of irrigation (Cohen et al., 2005; Grant et al., 2007; Möller et al., 2007; Berni
    et al., 2009; Padhi et al., 2012; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). In some cases, a
    single thermal image is sufficient to reveal spatial variation in plant water
    status. On a larger scale, aerial thermal imaging is used to detect variation
    in crop water status at a single point in time. In this case, resolution is critical:
    Berni et al. (2009) were able to determine the temperature of individual trees
    from a thermal image taken from an UAV, providing a resolution of 40cm; this was
    not possible when thermal images were taken from a higher-flying aeroplane that
    provided a resolution of only 2 m. The greatest temperature differences between
    stressed and non-stressed canopies are found in hot, dry environments. There are
    limitations concerning measurements in more humid areas with low leaf-to-air vapour
    pressure differences (Thomson et al., 2012). Nevertheless, detectable differences
    were measured under relatively humid, cool, and low radiation conditions, as noted
    by Maes and Steppe (2012). The capacity of thermal imaging to detect variation
    in crop water status depends on the plant’s stomatal response. In species with
    more marked anisohydric behaviour (e.g. sunflower, wheat, soybean, almond tree),
    leaf water potential falls with increasing evaporative demand (Tardieu and Simonneau,
    1998), due to poor stomatal control over tissue water loss. For this reason, in
    these species leaf water potential is a better indicator of soil moisture than
    gs. Isohydric species (e.g. maize, lupin, pea, poplar), on the other hand, close
    their stomata in response to a decrease in soil water and/or an increase in VPD,
    controlling plant water potential. Under such conditions, gs is a better indicator
    of soil moisture than water potential. Therefore, drought detection using thermal
    imaging is more suited to species or varieties exhibiting isohydric behaviour
    (Jones et al., 2009). A logical step forward for the use of this methodology is
    to use thermal imaging to decide where, when, and how much to irrigate. This,
    however, requires that a threshold for crop temperature, a stress index, or a
    value of gs is established beforehand. Irrigation would be applied when this threshold
    is reached. Threshold values may vary according to the environment and species
    or variety/cultivar (Cohen et al., 2005; Möller et al., 2007; Costa et al., 2012;
    Fuentes et al., 2012). Further progress is still required before thermal imaging
    is routinely used for irrigation scheduling. There is the need for monitoring
    crops over the whole season and ultimately compare thermography with other scheduling
    methods. Where the costs involved in frequent thermal imaging are prohibitive,
    infrequent thermal imaging (e.g. aerial or satellite) that will provide information
    on spatial variation may be combined with frequent (or continuous) alternative
    means of monitoring water stress. The latter would provide poor spatial resolution,
    but high temporal resolution. For example, a single aerial or satellite image
    may be sufficient to pinpoint areas of a crop with different water demands, and
    representative plants within each zone could then be continuously monitored (e.g.
    by measuring stem diameter fluctuations or sap flow) in order to schedule irrigation
    over a season. Garciá-Tejero et al. (2011) suggested that the combined monitoring
    of maximum daily trunk shrinkage (to obtain information regarding individual plants)
    and Tcanopy – Tair (to obtain information regarding plots) would help to determine
    irrigation requirements in orchards with spatial variation in plant water status.
    Aerial and ground thermal imaging can also support detection of malfunctioning
    (e.g. leaks) of irrigation canals and delivery systems, which result in large
    water losses (Thomson et al., 2012). Crop protection Pests and diseases limit
    the genetic potential of crops regarding their growth and yield. Pests and diseases
    can change the amount and direction of radiation reflected and emitted by plants
    (Jackson, 1986) or can modify plant temperature due to stomatal deregulation and/or
    changes in plant water relations (Nilsson, 1995; Allègre et al., 2007). Thermal
    imaging can thus be used to monitor infection patterns of diseases or infestation
    by pests, which assume typical patchy distributions (Mahlein et al., 2012), or
    even to detect the stress before symptoms are visible (Jackson, 1986; Nilsson,
    1995; Oerke et al., 2006; Stoll et al., 2008; Chaerle et al., 2009). Increase
    in plant temperature can co-occur with senescence due to biotic stress, resulting
    from modified plant–water relationships due to the interruption of normal function
    of the root system or/and blockage of water and nutrient transport in the stem
    or leaves (Nilsson, 1995). Foliar pathogens can disrupt cuticular and/or stomatal
    regulation of transpiration and influence plant water relations and WUEi (Grimmer
    et al., 2012). Thermal imaging also supports studies of the action of herbivorous
    insects: for example, transpirational water loss in soybean (Glycine max) leaflets
    occurred mostly from injuries on cuticle and cut edges of the attacked leaves
    (Aldea et al., 2005). Combined thermal imaging and gas exchange studies under
    laboratory conditions showed that the accumulation of salicylic acid (a hormone
    produced in plant defence against infections) in response to tobacco mosaic virus
    infection in tobacco leaves was paralleled by stomatal closure: Tleaf increased
    after virus inoculation prior to cell death (Chaerle et al., 1999). However, if
    the infection has only a minor effect on transpiration, detection using thermography
    may not be possible, particularly in field conditions. Moreover, combination of
    stresses can also pose limitations when monitoring infection with thermal imaging.
    For example, in grapevine, the maximum temperature difference between infected
    and non-infected areas reached 0.9 °C in irrigated plots, but only 0.3 °C for
    non-irrigated plots (Stoll et al., 2008). Although there are limitations in the
    identification of the causal agent of biotic stress (disease, pest) (Jackson,
    1986), thermal imaging can be used in field conditions to localize spots where
    the crop is more affected and demanding more urgent intervention (Sankaran et
    al., 2010). Other stresses Shimshi (1967) observed that, under conditions favouring
    stomatal opening (non-limiting soil moisture content) nitrogen and iron deficiency
    would induce stomatal closure in different crop species (e.g. beans, wheat, sugar
    beets, maize, groundnuts). Under controlled conditions, Chaerle et al. (2007)
    using thermal imaging showed that bean plants growing on magnesium deficient solution
    had a higher temperature (by about 0.5 °C) compared to control plants. Preliminary
    thermal imaging of spring barley also indicated higher canopy temperature in crops
    that did not receive any nitrogen fertilizer compared to those that were well
    fertilized (165kg N ha−1; Fig. 3). This suggests stomatal closure in the nutrient-starved
    crops. On the contrary, wheat plants growing under higher nitrogen conditions
    for two consecutive years exhibited lower Tcanopy (Tilling et al. 2007). In field
    measurements, combining thermal and spectral properties of canopies may help to
    identify more precisely nutrient deficiency and distinguish between water and
    nutrient stress (Christensen et al., 2005). Fig. 3. Open in new tabDownload slide
    Spring barley crops subjected to a high nitrogen fertilizer input (165kg N ha−1;
    left) and no nitrogen fertilizer (right), and imaged with an IR Snapshot 525 (Infrared
    Solutions, Minneapolis, USA) 120×120 pixel line scan imager, 8–12 μm (top) and
    a digital camera (bottom) from a ladder, showing higher crop temperature in the
    nitrogen-deprived crop. In Trifolium subterraneum, ozone exposure resulted in
    higher Tleaf in long-day plants as compared to short-day plants, suggesting that
    ozone reduces E in long-day plants (Vollsnes et al., 2009). Energy released during
    freezing results in an increase of temperature, which can be recorded by thermal
    imaging (Wisniewski et al., 2008), with the advantage over contact thermometry
    of detecting the actual site of ice initiation and the number of ice nucleation
    events. The technique has been applied to study frost resistance in woody plants
    (Pramsohler et al., 2012). Crop phenotyping and breeding The ultimate goal of
    phenotyping in plant breeding is to quantify and rank the success of a range of
    genotypes in certain environments (Walter et al., 2012). It involves comparison
    of large numbers of genotypes, which requires fast and robust measurement procedures,
    with a high degree of automation (Roy et al., 2011; Walter et al., 2012). Novel
    crop genotypes are often characterized on the basis of leaf gas exchange traits
    (e.g. photosynthetic assimilation, gs, WUEi). Thermal imaging emerged as a faster
    method to carry out high-throughput field phenotyping compared to point measurements
    of Tleaf, porometry, or leaf gas exchange (Furbank and Tester, 2011; Walter et
    al., 2012). Besides, it allows phenotyping of different sized plants (small seedlings
    to entire plants/canopies) in controlled or field conditions (Jones et al., 2009;
    Walter et al., 2012). Genotypes of different crops have been characterized in
    their response to different environmental stresses using thermal imaging (Munns
    et al., 2010; Walter et al., 2012). High-yielding rice cultivars have been selected
    on the basis of their lower Tleaf and higher canopy diffusive conductance to water
    vapour (Jones et al., 2009; Berger et al., 2010), and several quantitative trait
    loci for Tleaf differences have been mapped in relation to stomatal behaviour
    traits (Pelleschi et al., 2006). In maize, lower Tleaf was positively correlated
    with biomass accumulation under water stress, supporting the use of thermal imaging
    in breeding and selection of drought tolerant maize genotypes (Liu et al., 2011).
    The low Tcanopy of resistant lines observed under drought stress is an indicator
    of plant water status and of drought-avoidance mechanisms and may be related to
    deep root growth that allow plants to continue water uptake and transpiration
    that cools the leaves (Jones et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2011). In strawberry,
    thermal imaging indicated that some cultivars display low gs whereas others show
    high gs under similar well-watered conditions (Grant et al., 2012). In grapevine,
    thermal imaging can also be used in breeding programmes for WUEi since both gs
    and photosynthetic assimilation are genetically dependent traits in this species
    (Flexas et al., 2010). Recently, Costa et al. (2012) observed different Tleaf
    and gs phenotypes between grapevine varieties with similar water status, suggesting
    different types of stomatal regulation. High-resolution thermal imaging can also
    help to characterize morphology and plant architecture traits that are important
    for selecting superior varieties for different environmental conditions (Chéné
    et al., 2012). Ecological studies and environmental monitoring Remote sensing
    has been used by ecologists and conservation biologists in larger scale studies
    to better understand environmental changes and their consequences in plant ecosystems
    (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). Thermal remote sensing allows monitoring of physiological
    activity of vegetation (Jacob et al., 2008), and satellite thermal sensing has
    been used to support modelling of regional fluxes of water and mapping of evapotranspiration
    and moisture availability (Anderson et al., 2008; Chávez et al., 2008; Sobrino
    et al., 2009), as well as in monitoring drought and water use, administering irrigation
    projects, predicting local and regional water demand, and supporting hydrological
    and weather forecast models (Anderson and Kustas, 2008). Scherrer and Körner (2010)
    have used thermal imaging to monitor alpine landscapes over time with very high
    spatial resolution. They quantified variation between microhabitats by the deviation
    of vegetation surface temperature from Tair. This is an advance compared to previous
    approaches based on conventional climate station data that only enabled monitoring
    of individual plants or soil plots. More recently, Scherrer and Körner (2011)
    used high-resolution IR thermal imaging to assess the spatial and temporal variation
    of plant surface and ground temperatures for hundreds of plots distributed across
    three alpine slopes of contrasting exposure. The results emphasize the need to
    take microhabitat temperature variation into account when predicting climate change
    impacts on vegetation: meter-scale thermal contrasts were far greater than the
    average increase in temperature predicted for the next 100 years. Scherrer et
    al. (2011) established a drought-sensitivity ranking of deciduous tree species
    based on thermal imaging and found that in drier sites and at higher temperatures
    some species could be less competitive than others. Pronounced drought might change
    the competitive abilities of tree species in favour of those that are able to
    maintain transpirational fluxes and cooler canopies, such as Fraxinus excelsior
    and Quercus petraea. Complementary ground thermal imaging at key locations could
    enhance the usefulness of satellite sensing (Qiu and Zhao, 2010), namely in ecology
    (Kerr and Ostrovsky, 2003), by providing the fine local resolution that satellite
    imaging cannot. Other applications in agro-food industries Thermal imaging can
    be used to monitor quality of horticultural products, namely seed viability (Kranner
    et al., 2010), health of transplants (Kim and Lee, 2004), and graft union quality
    (Torii et al., 1992). In orchards and groves, thermal imaging can help to assess
    fruit number (Bulanon et al., 2008). Additionally, thermal imaging of fruits under
    field conditions could assist in understanding the impact of extreme temperatures
    on fruit quality, namely on the incidence/resistance to sunscald (yellowing/browning
    of a fruit’s skin and softened flesh from exposure to high temperatures) (Prohens
    et al., 2004). Thermal imaging can also support optimized climate control in greenhouse
    horticulture. Greenhouse climate control could be based on continuous measurements
    of Tleaf instead of Tair because Tleaf is more closely linked to plant performance
    (Ehret et al., 2001). Future prospects As advances in detector technology and
    progress in image processing increase the diagnostic power of thermal imaging,
    the main challenge may shift from such technical aspects to the optimization of
    data collection. Physiologically, there is still a need to establish leaf/canopy
    thresholds (thresholds of relevant thermal indexes) for different biotic or abiotic
    stress effects and for different species and varieties. Studies that deal with
    a longer time scale are required as well, rather than mere correlations between
    temperature variables and standard indicators of stress based on measurements
    on single dates. Technologically, future developments will include the combination
    of thermal imaging with imaging in other spectral wavelengths (visible and red/infrared
    reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence) (Bulanon et al., 2008; Jiménez-Bello et
    al., 2011). The use of UAVs for civil applications opened up a new era of remote
    sensing, aiding assessment of plant–environment interactions at a larger scale
    (e.g. crop fields and forest plots) (Berni et al., 2009), although there exists
    legal restrictions in its use in many countries. Coupling of ground and airborne
    measurements must be improved, in order to increase the accuracy of retrieved
    data. Thermal imaging in parallel with wireless sensor networks and geographical
    information systems will allow a more precise mapping and monitoring of, for example,
    irrigation and fertilizer requirements (Lee et al., 2010). Coupling of thermal
    imaging with modelling approaches is expected (Maes and Steppe, 2012), which should
    be supported by improved software tools to optimize automation and speed up robust
    image analysis (Fuentes et al., 2012). With respect to routine application in
    the land-based industry sector, as opposed to scientific research, enhanced benefits
    will arise from reduction in costs of thermal imaging devices that will permit
    extending the use of the technique in agronomy to a wider range of crops and situations
    than only the most advanced and intensive agricultural/horticultural systems.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Technology to acquire thermal images using
    UAVs has progressed very much lately. • Thermal imaging was used to estimate within-vineyard
    variations in water status. • The technique showed a great potential to monitor
    instantaneous variations. • At seasonal scale, it was related to relevant agronomic
    variables. • Multiple dates of thermal images are required to monitor seasonal
    water status. Abstract Thermal imaging can become a readily usable tool for crop
    agricultural water management, since it allows a quick determination of canopy
    surface temperature that, as linked to transpiration, can give an idea of crop
    water status. In the last years, the resolution of thermal imaging systems has
    increased and its weight decreased, fostering their implementation on Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for civil and agricultural engineering purposes. This approach
    would overcome most of the limitations of on site thermal imaging, allowing mapping
    plant water status at either field or farm scale, taking thus into account the
    naturally existing or artificially induced variability at those scales. The aim
    of this work was to evaluate to which extent high-resolution thermal imaging allows
    evaluating the instantaneous and seasonal variability of water status within a
    vineyard. The novelty and significance of our approach is that the specifically
    designed and build unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provided very high-resolution
    imaging (pixel <9 cm), and that it was used at a commercially relevant acreage
    (7.5 ha). This set-up was used to obtain Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) from thermal
    images in a clear-sky day. CWSI values were and compared to stem water potential
    (Ψs) and stomatal conductance (gs) measured at 14 sampling sites across the vineyard
    at the moment when images where acquired. In order to evaluate the potential of
    CWSI acquired in a single day to estimate within-vineyard patterns of variation
    in water status, a spatial modeling approach was used. CWSI correlated well with
    Ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition, showing to have a great potential
    to monitor instantaneous variations in water status within a vineyard. The information
    provided by thermal images proved to be relevant at a seasonal scale as well,
    although it did not match seasonal trends in water status but mimicked other physiological
    processes occurring during ripening. Therefore, if a picture of variations in
    water status is required, it would be necessary to acquire thermal images at several
    dates along the summer. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction In the last two-decades, Precision Agriculture techniques have
    been progressively implemented in viticulture, giving birth to what is called
    Precision Viticulture (PV). Along those years, PV has focused on delineating management
    zones, i.e.: on defining within-vineyard areas that are relatively homogeneous,
    and different to other areas in the same vineyard (Arno et al., 2011, Arnó et
    al., 2009, Urretavizcaya et al., 2014). This approach is very appropriate for
    high-value crops such as grapevine and, when transferred to grape-growing companies,
    it usually implies adopting site-specific cultural practices for each zone defined
    (Bramley et al., 2011b, Santesteban et al., 2013, Serrano et al., 2015). In those
    companies, where new generation grape harvesters are available, the zones delineated
    can also be used to automatically segregate grapes from the same field into two
    batches to improve global wine quality (Bramley et al., 2011a, Santos et al.,
    2012). The most common sources of information on field spatial variability for
    zone delineation are (i) vegetation indices obtained from airborne multispectral
    cameras, (ii) soil apparent conductivity or resistivity, and (iii) data gathered
    in situ following a sampling grid (Arnó et al., 2009). However, those approaches
    are not considering any variable directly related to plant water status, which,
    in semi-arid areas, is usually regarded to be the major factor determining grape
    yield and berry composition (Medrano et al., 2014). Besides, in a context of climate
    change, water status is also expected to play an increasingly relevant role in
    cooler areas, as water deficit periods along the growing season are expected to
    occur more likely in the near future (Ashenfelter and Storchmann, 2016, Fraga
    et al., 2012, Viguié et al., 2014), so PV approaches should pay much greater attention
    to water availability. Whole field imaging using thermal cameras is a source of
    useful information in this regard, as it allows estimating canopy temperature,
    known to be related to plant transpiration and, therefore, to plant water status
    (Jackson et al., 1988, Jackson et al., 1981). High resolution thermal cameras
    have been successfully mounted on aircraft platforms (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006)
    and on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasingly using higher performance sensors
    in terms of lower size and weight, and of greater spectral and spatial resolutions.
    Last generation thermal cameras can reach centimeter ground resolution, providing
    enough accuracy for canopy extraction in discontinuous crops in rows such as grapevines
    and fruit trees, and are a promising tool for field and irrigation management
    applications (Berni et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). In viticulture,
    proximal thermal sensing has been shown to be a good tool to estimate plant water
    status (Fuentes et al., 2012, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Pou et al.,
    2014). In those approaches, a thermal camera is directly used to get a lateral
    view, or mounted on a shaft or a crane, to get a zenithal view; and relatively
    good agreement is observed between canopy-temperature derived indices and plant
    water potential or stomatal conductance. On the contrary, the implementation of
    UAV-based thermal imaging solutions has not been well explored yet in viticulture,
    since the resolution obtained must be sufficient to enable targeting pure canopy
    pixels, avoiding mixed soil/vegetation pixels (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2015), which
    is particularly complicated in most vineyards due to the structure of the crop,
    trellised in narrow rows. In one of those works, Baluja et al. (2012a) evaluated
    the water status variability of a commercial rainfed Tempranillo vineyard using
    a UAV platform, and observed that some vegetation indices, not derived from thermal
    images but from multispectral ones, were better correlated to stomatal conductance
    and leaf water potential, probably as they reflected a longer term response. Another
    research team also working in Spain, evaluated the correlation between Crop Water
    Stress Index (CWSI, a canopy-temperature derived index) and leaf water potential,
    reporting that correlation improved at noon (Bellvert et al., 2014), and exploring
    the potentiality of the technique for setting thresholds useful for irrigation
    scheduling (Bellvert et al., 2015a, Bellvert et al., 2015b). Gonzalez-Dugo et
    al. (2013) recently suggested that the requirements to achieve the water stress
    monitoring using aerial platforms are: (a) establish a strong correlation between
    stress indices and actual water stress in the field; (ii) the spatial resolution
    must be sufficient to enable targeting pure canopy pixels, avoiding mixed soil/vegetation
    pixel; (iii) the ability to evaluate entire fields in individual flight; (iv)
    faster turn-around acquisition times and processing in order to provide quasi-real
    time water status maps helping the farmer decision-making process. The aim of
    this study is to evaluate the interest of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging
    to estimate the instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within
    a vineyard. The significance of our approach is that we worked at a commercially
    realistic scale (7.5 ha), the high resolution of the thermal images acquired (9
    cm pixel−1), and that we tested to which extent the information provided by one
    flight campaign can be used to evaluate spatial variability in water availability
    across the season. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Vineyard characterization The
    experimental work was performed in a 7.5 ha vineyard located in Traibuenas, Navarra,
    Spain (42°22′20.1″N 1°37′34.2″W, WGS84, Altitude: 328 m), in a region characterized
    by a semiarid climate (Bs type in Koppen’s classification; P < 350 mm; ETPPenman
    >1150 mm). The vineyard is trained as a vertical shoot positioned bilateral cordon,
    bud number fixed at 12 buds per m of row line, plant spacing being 3 m between
    rows and 1 m within the row. The vineyard was 18 years-old at the beginning of
    the experiment, it was managed according to standard practices in the area, and
    vines were not affected in a significant way by pests or diseases, with the sole
    exception of approx. 2% of the vines showing slight to moderate esca symptoms.
    Spatial variability within the vineyard was characterized setting up two sampling
    grids. The first one (Fig. 1a), dedicated to the agronomical characterization
    of the vineyard, was comprised of 92 sampling points (SP), and followed a relatively
    regular rectangular pattern with a mean distance of 25 × 25 m between SP. The
    second grid was dedicated to vine water status characterization, followed an irregular
    pattern (Fig. 1b) conformed by 14 water status measurement points (WSP). On every
    SP and WSP, 10 vines located at two adjacent rows were marked, and all of them
    used for the experimental measurements and sampling procedures detailed below.

    Fig. 1. Aerial view of the vineyard indicating the location of (a) Sampling Points
    (SP) and (b) Water status Sampling Points (WSP). The agronomical characterization
    of the 92 SP included the following measurements: - Vegetative growth, estimated
    as the total shoot cross sectional area (SCSA) per vine. The basal diameter of
    all the shoots in the 10 vines in the SP was measured with a hand-held caliper
    at the end of July, once apical growth had stopped. At winter rest, trunk cross
    sectional area (TCSA) was determined measuring trunk diameter 30 cm above-ground.
    - Yield, determined at harvest by counting and weighting all the clusters produced
    in the 10 vines at each SP. - Grape composition at harvest: one 300-berry sample
    was taken at each SP was taken to determine berry weight (BW) as well as the main
    composition parameters. After crushing, total soluble solids concentration (TSS)
    was measured with a temperature compensating refractometer RFM840 (Bellingham-Stanley
    Ltd., Kent, UK), pH and titratable acidity (TA) using a pH-Burette 24 auto-titrator
    (Crison, Barcelona, Spain), malic (MalA) and tartaric acid (TarA) concentration
    was measured enzymatically using an autoanalyzer (Easychem, Systea s.p.a., Italy),
    whereas yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) was estimated following the procedure
    described by Aerny (1996) with the modifications detailed in Garcia et al. (2011).
    Total anthocyanins (TAnt) content was evaluated after 4 h extraction at pH = 1.0
    following the methodology described in Glories and Augustin (1993). - Berry carbon
    isotope ratio (δ13C), measured in 50-berry samples gathered at harvest, then oven-dried
    and ground into a fine homogeneous powder, and analysed as using an Elemental
    analyzer (NC2500, Carlo Erba Reagents, Rodano, Italy) coupled to Isotopic Mass
    Spectrometer (Thermoquest Delta Plus, ThermoFinnigan, Bremen, Germany) as detailed
    in Santesteban et al. (2012). This measurement was done in 2014 and in 2015. The
    characterization of the 14 WSP included, in addition to the agronomic measurements
    described for the SP, weekly measurements of stem water potential at mid-morning
    (Ψs-m) and at noon (Ψs-n). Measurements were taken from 15 days after fruit set,
    until harvest time in 2014 and 2015. At each WSP, five healthy leaves were bagged
    1.5 h prior to measurement using zip-bags covered with a metalized high-density
    polyethylene reflective film (SonocoRF, Sonoco Products Co., Hartsville, SC, USA).
    Stem water potential was determined using a Scholander pressure bomb (P3000, Soil
    Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Last, we also had information available
    on soil apparent electric conductivity (ECa) and on Plant Cell Density (PCD) vegetation
    index. ECa was estimated in December 2014, when soil was at field capacity, at
    every SP using a handheld EM38 conductivity meter (Geonics Ltd, Ontario, Canada).
    PCD was calculated as the ratio between RED/NIR bands from images acquired by
    an airborne RGB-NIR sensor, gathered in a commercial mission performed by a private
    company (Agropixel SA) on August 10th of 2015. PCD values were normalized to a
    8-bit scale (0–255). 2.2. UAV platform and payload The UAV platform (Fig. 2a)
    was a modified multi-rotor MikrokopterOktoXL (HiSystems GmbH, Moomerland, Germany),
    an open-source project described in detail in Matese et al. (2015), which included
    a pre-assembled hardware and a GPS V3.0 module as positioning system, able to
    carry a 2 kg payload for 15 min flight time. Flight parameters communication to
    the ground operator were provided by a radio link at 2.4 GHz, while another channel
    at 5.8 GHz was used for remote sensing data transmission. The core of the UAV
    system is a Flight Control board (FlightCtrl), based on an ATMega1284P microcontroller
    (Atmel Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), which communicates with the eight brushless
    controllers by a two-wire bi-directional serial bus (I2C). It integrates a pressure
    sensor and 3-axis accelerometers to calculate and align the UAV with gravity.
    The FlightCtrl is linked to a navigation control board (NaviCtrl), equipped with
    an ARM9 microcontroller (Atmel Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA) and a MicroSD slot
    card for waypoint data storage. An integrated navigation sensor system based on
    a 3D digital compass to monitor the z (yaw) axis rotation and a LEA-6 GPS module
    (U-blox AG, Thalwil, Switzerland) with a circular error of about 2 m, allow various
    levels of autonomous flight. The UAV mounts eight ATMEGA8 control cards (Atmel
    Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), dedicated to the management of each brushless
    motor with a very quick time response (less than 0.5 ms). The flight planning
    was conducted with Mikrokopter Tools software, which allows the user to generate
    a route of waypoints as a function of the sensor Field Of View (FOV), the degree
    of overlap between images and the ground resolution needed. A universal camera
    mount equipped with three servomotors allows a correct image acquisition by correcting
    the tilt and rolling effects. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    acquisition (a) and detailed view of multispectral (b) and thermal (c) cameras
    mounted on it. A FLIR TAU II 320 (FLIR Systems, Inc., USA) was used for thermal
    data acquisition. This sensor, optimized for UAV application, is of minimal size
    (44.5 × 44.5 × 30.0 mm) and weight (72 g). Imaging sensor characteristics, i.e.
    324 × 256 pixels and 24° × 18° FOV with fixed focal length of 19 mm, allows obtaining
    images of about 40 × 30 m at the ground, with a resolution of 0.13 m/pixel at
    100 m flight altitude. The camera is equipped with an uncooled sensor able to
    measure longwave radiation in the spectral range 7.5–13 μm. Radiometric calibration
    was conducted in the laboratory, using blackbodies under varying target and ambient
    temperatures to develop radiometric calibration algorithms following the procedure
    described in Berni et al. (2009). 2.3. Flight campaign At early veraison (28th
    July 2015), the site was monitored with a single flight survey at 70 m above ground
    level at solar noon, providing 9 cm pixel−1 ground image resolution. Camera settings
    were set to a fixed exposure with automatic trigger at 2 s frequency. The waypoint
    route was generated to obtain 80% overlap both between photos (forward overlap)
    and between flight lines (lateral overlap), in order to achieve the highest accuracy
    in mosaicking elaboration step. The images were recorded during homogeneous and
    stable radiation conditions, under clear sky conditions and with no wind. The
    thermal acquisition by the UAV was made between 13:00 to 14:30 h by means of five
    consecutive flights of 15 min each. Shortly after thermal image acquisition by
    the UAV (5–10 min later), stem water potential (Ψs) and leaf stomatal conductance
    (gs) were measured in all the WSP. Ψs was measured following the same protocol
    and sample size used in the weekly measurements of Ψs-m and Ψs-n, wheras gs was
    determined in three sunlit leaves per WSP using a hand-held porometer (SC-1, Decagon
    Devices Inc., Pullman, Washington). 2.4. Image data processing Leaf emissivity
    acquired in the thermal infrared spectral region allowed the computation of water
    stress related to leaf temperature, through the estimation of CWSI (Crop Water
    Stress Index) using the modified Eq. (1) derived by (Jackson et al., 1988): (1)
    CWSI = (Tleaf − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet) where Tdry and Twet are, respectively, the
    dry leaf reference temperature representing a stressed leaf temperature and wet
    leaf temperature reference in total absence of stress, while Tleaf indicates the
    leaf surface temperature. Respect to the original equation defined by Jackson,
    the modified one uses the canopy temperature (Tleaf) instead of the differences
    between canopy and air temperature (Tc − Ta), moreover identify Tdry and Twet
    as the upper limit (Tc − Ta)UL and the lower limit (Tc − Ta)LL respectively. Tleaf
    data in absolute temperature (°C) were calculated from thermal camera’s digital
    number (DN) using an empirical line correction. The DN-values in the thermal imagery
    represent at-sensor radiance. Conversion was carried out in field conditions,
    by means of three different colour panels (1 × 1 m) at known temperature as reference.
    Those measurements were achieved at the beginning and the end of each flight and
    replicated three times with a 10 s delay. The reference target temperature was
    calculated taking into account the emissivity coefficient of panel material (0.95).
    The average temperature of the reference targets was 33 °C, 54 °C and 66 °C for
    the white, blue and black respectively during the entire flight acquisitions.
    The temperature range of the three panels (black, blue and white) had a variation
    of 6.6 °C, 3.4 °C and 1.5 °C respectively during the five flights. The averaged
    values derived from 6 measures for each target and for each flight. The reference
    temperature (Tdry and Twet) estimation procedure is a step that requires utmost
    care and precision, as it represents a key factor in the stress map computation.
    CWSI reference measurements were achieved at the end of each flight and replicated
    three times with a 10 s delay. The emissivity coefficient applied to leaf measurements
    was 0.98. The average temperature of the Tdry reference was 36.1 °C and for Twet
    23.6 °C. The temperature range of the Tdry and Twet had a variation of about 1.3
    °C and 2.4 °C respectively during the five flights. Many studies reported different
    methods to measure and calculate these references (Alchanatis et al., 2010, Cohen
    et al., 2005, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Testi et al., 2008, Yuan
    et al., 2004). In this work, we preferred the approach suggested by Jones et al.
    (2002). In detail, leaves of two sampling vines were coated on both sides with
    petroleum jelly, in order to prevent the leaf transpiration and interrupt the
    transpiration cooling phenomenon, simulating the leaf physiological response to
    water stress conditions. At the same time, the wet reference was obtained wetting
    both sides of other two sampling vines. Temperature monitoring was carried out
    with a handheld thermal sensor FLIR I7, Tdry was measured 30 min after applying
    petroleum jelly, while Twet 20 s after wetting leaves with water. Thermal images
    acquired by UAV were mosaicked using Agisoft Photoscan Professional Edition 1.1.6
    (Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia), a commercial computer vision software package.
    This software provides a completely automated computer vision SfM procedure, taking
    a set of images as input and automatically going through the steps of feature
    identification, matching and bundle adjustment. The procedure aligns images captured
    by the thermal camera. A polygon mesh was computed from the dense 3D point, and
    the pixel values of each image were then projected onto the mesh to create an
    orthomosaic. When combined with the GPS positions, this process allows the creation
    of a high-resolution orthophoto and a digital elevation model (DEM) of the research
    site. 2.5. Row extraction and spatial analysis The DEM output from Agisoft software
    allowed developing a filtering procedure of the pure row pixels, since they have
    greater heights from the ground, and can be easily discriminated by global thresholding
    algorithms. The first step was to applicate the Top-Hat morphological operation
    (Gonzalez and Wintz, 2002) directly on the DEM image. Through this technique,
    usually used for non-uniform illumination correction, we made “flat” the terrain
    that may in fact be pending. Then, using a global thresholding method (Otsu et
    al., 1979), two different zones were obtained: rows and ground. The Otsu method
    discriminates the two classes automatically determining a threshold that maximizes
    the interclass variance. The purpose of this procedure is to split the image f
    (x, y) in two parts (row and inter-row), imposing a threshold on the histogram
    image intensity that, in this case, coincides with the height. DEM rows in the
    image have a height, then intensity, almost constant, consistent with each other
    and always more than the ground. Data extraction for single plants was made averaging
    values in 0.8 × 0.3 m polygons along rows (Fig. 3), polygon size being chosen
    to properly identify each plant from the adjacent ones. Download : Download high-res

    of the vineyard after the soil removing procedure. 2.6. Evaluation of the relationship
    between CWSI and plant water status In order to evaluate the instantaneous correspondence
    between water status characterization through standard proxy techniques and thermal
    imagery, the Ψs and gs values measured at the WSP in the flight campaign day were
    compared to their CWSI through regression analysis. At the seasonal scale, the
    evaluation of the appropriateness of thermal images acquired at one date to estimate
    seasonal variability in water status along the field was done through a spatial
    modeling approach. Spatial modeling of leaf water potential along the vineyard
    was done according to the approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010a, Acevedo-Opazo
    et al., 2010b, Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2008. In this approach, one (or more) ancillary
    variable(s), whose spatial distribution is well known, is combined with plant
    water status information at a reference site to elaborate a model that estimates
    plant water status. In our paper, we used the same procedure considered by Herrero-Langreo
    et al. (2013), where more details on the methodology can be found. Following that
    procedure, we considered carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) measured at the 92 SP in
    the previous season as the ancillary variable, and the most stressed WSP as the
    reference site. The model was calibrated and tested using the measurements of
    Ψs at all the WSP, considering the measurements made weekly in 2014 and 2015.
    Seasonal average leaf water potential at each SP could then be estimated from
    the model. Independent models were calculated for Ψs-m and Ψs-n. Following the
    empirical approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al. (2008), the spatial model
    tested in this study, is shown in Eq. (2). (2) Where corresponds to any of the
    92 locations where a δ13C value was measured corresponds to the reference site,
    where was measured throughout 18 dates. corresponds to any of the 18 dates when
    was measured at the reference site, is the estimated at each site, , and date,
    . is the auxiliary variable, , at each site, . is measured at the reference site,
    , for each date . and are the coefficients of the model For each date, tj, the
    model extrapolates Ψ measured at the reference site, Ψ (Sre, tj), to any of the
    locations, si, where a δ13C value was measured. Hence, δ13C (s), accounts for
    the spatial variability of Ψ, while temporal variation is indicated by . The model
    was adapted to the case study following the same procedure considered by Herrero-Langreo
    et al. (2013) where a more extensive explanation on the methodology can be found.
    The comparison between CWSI and average seasonal Ψs-m and Ψs-n values was done
    using two different procedures. First, we interpolated maps for those variables
    onto a 3 × 3 m grid using block kriging performed with VESPER software (Minasny
    and McBratney, 2002), and compared them visually. Kriging is an interpolation
    procedure in which estimates of values at unsampled sites are interpolated on
    the basis of known values at georeferenced locations, weighted according to the
    parameters of the variogram – a model that describes variation within a dataset
    as a function of the distance or lag separating the samples comprising it (Bramley
    et al., 2011b). In our work, all variables were fitted to exponential models,
    taking as kriging parameters maximum distance = 100 m, 30 lags and 50% of lag
    tolerance. The second procedure for comparison was classifying CWSI in 3 and 5
    classes through fuzzy k-means cluster analysis, and then calculating mean Ψs-m
    and Ψs-n values for pixels belonging to each class with P > 0.8. Fuzzy k-means
    analyses and boxplots were obtained using R software. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Within-vineyard variability of agronomic variables The vineyard considered
    showed a relatively wide range of within-vineyard variability concerning vegetative
    growth, yield, berry weight and grape composition (Table 1a). In general terms,
    the range of variability embraced was high for all variables and the coefficients
    of variation were twice those reported in previous studies for the same variety
    in a neighbouring region (Baluja et al., 2012b, Urretavizcaya et al., 2016). That
    variability makes the field suitable for a precision viticulture based management
    (Urretavizcaya et al., 2014), aimed at decreasing variability or at segregating
    grape batches according to their composition. Although within-vineyard average
    values can be considered as adequate for quality wine making – according to regional
    standards for the variety-, the presence of less-ripen or “greener” grapes would
    impact negatively in wine organoleptic quality (Kontoudakis et al., 2011). Table

    Within-field variability in vine water status was also remarkable, δ13C ranging
    from −24.1‰ to −27.9‰ (Table 1a). These values, according to the scale proposed
    in (Santesteban et al., 2015), correspond to conditions ranging from nearly severe
    water stress to weak deficit. This variability in water status probably explains
    the variability in other agronomical variables, since water availability is known
    to be the major factor determining growth, yield and grape composition in semiarid
    areas (Medrano et al., 2014). The range of variability embraced by the WSP grid
    was smaller (Table 1b), but represented well the range of conditions observed
    in the denser SP grid. In fact, in most cases, WSP maximum and minimum values
    were similar to percentiles 5–95 in the SP grid, indicating that, in general terms,
    90% of within-vineyard variability is covered by the WSP grid. 3.2. Evaluation
    of the instantaneous variability in water status through thermal images Thermal
    image processing led to a map of CWSI distribution along the field (Fig. 4). A
    wide range of CWSI values was found (0.28–0.69), confirming the relevance of within-field
    variability observed with agronomic variables, and the pertinence of taking into
    account this variability. When CWSI values obtained from thermal images for the
    WSP were compared to instantaneous measurements in the field, they showed a relatively
    good correspondence with both Ψs and gs (Fig. 5, R2 > 0.65, P < 0.01), presenting
    lower values of Ψs and gs at the WSP with higher CWSI. The coefficients of determination
    are relatively high partly as one of the points monitored was clearly more stressed
    than the remaining ones, so when little variation in within-field water status
    exists correlation can be expected to be lower. Download : Download high-res image

    Stress Index values calculated from UAV-acquired thermal images and (a) stem water
    potential and (b) stomatal conductance measured at the WSP at the same time. The
    results obtained agree with those observed for thermal imaging in vineyards, either
    using a proxy (Fuentes et al., 2012, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Pou
    et al., 2014) or a remote (Baluja et al., 2012a, Bellvert et al., 2015a, Bellvert
    et al., 2015b, Bellvert et al., 2014) sensing approach. According to the principles
    established in early research regarding temperature sensing as an estimator of
    plant water status, plants having a greater water availability usually show increased
    transpiration, which leads to certain evaporative cooling and, as a consequence,
    to lower leaf temperature (Jackson et al., 1988, Jackson et al., 1981). Therefore,
    from this point of view, our results add further evidence on the suitability of
    this approach, and reinforce the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as
    an instantaneous water-stress mapping tool. 3.3. Evaluation of the seasonal variability
    in water status through thermal images Spatial modeling of stem water potential
    applied following the approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010a, Acevedo-Opazo
    et al., 2010b, Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2008) proved to be successful. The model
    allowed a good estimation of Ψs-m and Ψs-n at the WSP using the most stressed
    WSP as the reference site, and carbon isotope ratio measured the previous season
    (δ13C) in the SP as ancillary information (Fig. 6). Thus, it could then be used
    to estimate Ψs-m and Ψs-n values at the SP, subsequently represented as maps in
    Fig. 7(c, d), which displays how water status varied within the field. Download

    of spatial patterns From the visual comparison of the maps showed in Fig. 7, a
    recurrent spatial pattern, roughly agreeing to the topography of the field, can
    be observed for PCD, δ13C2014 and δ13C2015 datasets, which had been obtained independently.
    This pattern had also clear resemblances to ECa map, where a horizontal strip
    of higher ECa values matched areas of higher PCD and δ13C values. This coherence
    was not detected for the bottom-left part of the map, where ECa showed intermediate
    or even low values, whereas relatively high values of PCD, δ13C2014 and δ13C2015
    were observed. ECa measurements are probably integrating several soil characteristics
    of different relevance for plant performance, which explain those differences
    in behaviour (Brevik et al., 2006). The spatial distribution of Ψs-m and Ψs-n
    also followed the general pattern described above, although differences were attenuated
    at the right-top of the map, and exacerbated at the right-bottom. Last, the distribution
    pattern of classic agronomic variables followed a very different structure, the
    eastern (right) part of the field showing higher values of plant trunk section
    (TCSA), yield and berry weight (BW), and lower berry sugar content (TSS). CWSI
    estimated from thermal imaging followed a pattern that could be interpreted as
    a combination of the two major patterns described above (Fig. 4). On one side,
    a horizontal strip of higher CWSI appeared in the middle of the field, though
    much milder levels of water stress were detected at the lower part of the map.
    On the other side, certain degree of differentiation between the left and the
    right part of the map can also be appreciated. It is interesting to highlight
    that the highest CWSI values were found at the right-top of the map, corresponding
    exactly with the biggest and most productive vines. This behaviour, can be regarded
    as anomalous at first sight, but matches the water dynamics in this vineyard.
    According to the expert knowledge of the technical staff in the owning winery,
    that area has a deep soil, but much more gravely than the rest of the field and,
    as a consequence, lower water holding capacity. According to owners experience,
    that part of the field usually shows a very active growth in spring and early
    summer, and usually a high crop. However, when deficit conditions occur – from
    July on – soil water depletion happens faster, and plants end the season with
    greater water stress than other parts in the field. This behaviour can be explained
    as higher leaf area (Reynolds and Heuvel, 2009) and higher crop load (Miller et
    al., 1997, Naschitz and Naor, 2005) enhance water consumption and, as a consequence,
    can result in decreased water reservoirs from mid-season on. Thus, although at
    some fields information provided by CWSI could be redundant to that provided by
    vegetation indices, such as NDVI or PCD, it was not the case in this vineyard.
    It is common to assume that higher vigour areas will experience milder water stress,
    but under some circumstances such as those described here (deeper soils with lower
    water holding capacity), some parts of the field having greater leaf area (estimated
    through PCD), could experience higher water deficit at the end of the season.
    b. Correspondence between CWSI classes and other variables CWSI pixel values were
    classified in three and five classes using fuzzy k-means. For each class, the
    values of the remaining variables calculated for each pixel were examined through
    boxplots (Fig. 8, Fig. 9). When three classes were defined (Fig. 8), the correspondence
    between CWSI classes and seasonal water status related parameters was very low.
    Only a certain trend to lower δ13C2015 for increasing values of CWSI was observed,
    and no correspondence at all for Ψs-m and Ψs-n. However, there was a much higher
    degree of agreement between CWSI and other variables. PCD was observed to be higher
    at lower CWSI and, specially, very neat correspondence was found between CWSI
    and agronomical variables, higher CWSI plants showing higher values of TCSA, higher
    yields, bigger berries and a decreased sugar content (TSS). When cluster analysis
    was used to define five CWSI classes (Fig. 9), a very similar pattern was found,
    CWSI holding a clearer relationship with yield, berry weight and sugar content
    than water status related variables. Download : Download high-res image (412KB)

    (a) CWSI; (b) carbon isotope ratio – 2015 (δ13C2014, ‰); (c) mid-morning (Ψs-m)

    area (TCSA, cm2 vine−1); (h) yield (kg vine−1); (i) berry weight (BW, g); (j)
    total soluble solids (TSS, °Baume). Therefore, CWSI measured at early veraison
    estimated very well what was happening from an agronomic point of view between
    the onset of ripening (occurring at the time of measurement) and harvest. High
    CWSI classes were precisely those that had greater yield and bigger berries (Fig.
    8h, i; Fig. 9h, i), and showed a delayed sugar accumulation (lower TSS, Figs.
    8j and 9j). Variations in crop (sink size) have already been shown to play a major
    role to explain within-vineyard variations in grape composition in semi-arid areas
    (Urretavizcaya et al., 2016), as it constitutes one of the two components of source-to-sink
    balance, critical for grape quality (Howell, 2001). As mentioned above, higher
    yields enhance water consumption (Miller et al., 1997, Naschitz and Naor, 2005),
    and also cause lower sugar contents (Edson et al., 1995, Naor et al., 1997), especially
    under deficit conditions (Santesteban et al., 2011). On the contrary, CWSI measured
    at a single day did not provide a good estimation of variations of plant water
    status. The vineyard considered in the study showed a stable structure of variation
    in seasonal water status, as there was a big resemblance between berry δ13C measured
    in 2014 and 2015 (Fig. 7a, b). This stability agrees with that observed for water
    status in other vineyards when several years were compared (Acevedo-Opazo et al.,
    2010b, Herrero-Langreo et al., 2013, Taylor et al., 2010). The relationship between
    berry δ13C and water status has been widely proved for cv. ‘Tempranillo’ (Santesteban
    et al., 2012), and it is sensible to consider this spatial structure mirrors stem
    water potential pattern, estimated here through modeling. The fact CWSI measured
    in a single – but representative – day did not follow this seasonal pattern cannot
    be regarded to be indicative of a bad performance for this index (or for this
    data acquisition platform). In fact, high CWSI pixels corresponded to high yielding
    parts of the field where sugar accumulation was observed to be limited, possibly
    as during the last weeks before harvest available water was not enough for such
    a leaf area and crop load. Thus, CWSI calculated from high-resolution UAV-based
    thermal imaging has shown a high potentiality for precision vineyard management
    applications, and could be a complementary tool for the implementation of precision
    irrigation systems that, in the near future, would help grape growers to manage
    water resources in a sounder and more sustainable way. 4. Conclusions UAV-based
    thermal imagery has a great potential to map instantaneous variations in water
    status within a vineyard. The information provided by thermal images proved to
    be relevant at a seasonal scale as well, although it did not match seasonal trends
    in water status, but mimicked other physiological processes occurring during ripening.
    Therefore, if a picture of variations in water status is required, it would be
    necessary to acquire thermal images at several dates along the summer. Conflict

    all metrics Abstract Variable-rate irrigation by machines or solid set systems
    has become technically feasible, however mapping crop water status is necessary
    to match irrigation quantities to site-specific crop water demands. Remote thermal
    sensing can provide such maps in sufficient detail and in a timely way. In a set
    of aerial and ground scans at the Hula Valley, Israel, digital crop water stress
    maps were generated using geo-referenced high-resolution thermal imagery and artificial
    reference surfaces. Canopy-related pixels were separated from those of the soil
    by upper and lower thresholds related to air temperature, and canopy temperatures
    were calculated from the coldest 33% of the pixel histogram. Artificial surfaces
    that had been wetted provided reference temperatures for the crop water stress
    index (CWSI) normalized to ambient conditions. Leaf water potentials of cotton
    were related linearly to CWSI values with R 2 = 0.816. Maps of crop stress level
    generated from aerial scans of cotton, process tomatoes and peanut fields corresponded
    well with both ground-based observations by the farm operators and irrigation
    history. Numeric quantification of stress levels was provided to support decisions
    to divide fields into sections for spatially variable irrigation scheduling. Similar

    Site-specific irrigation may be defined as matching water application in time
    and quantity to actual crop needs at the smallest manageable scale to achieve
    the desired crop responses. As variable-rate water application technology is already
    available, field scale application will depend on the ability to map the variation
    in crop water status (Camp et al. 2006). Devices for point sensing of soil or
    crop water status that use wireless communication are abundant and can be connected
    to the irrigation machines for real time control (e.g. Peters and Evett 2004;
    Kim et al. 2007). Applying enough of them to match the spatial variability, however
    will be prohibitive in terms of cost with current technology (Or 1995; Schmitz
    and Kuyper 1998; Schmitz and Sourell 2000). Remote thermal imagery is a viable
    alternative to point measurements, since the canopy temperature of the whole field
    can be measured at once, and a map of the distribution of plant water status in
    the field can be produced. Evaluation of relevant crop temperatures by pattern
    recognition of sunlit leaves (Leinonen and Jones 2004; Cohen et al. 2005) may
    approximate the theoretical ‘big leaf’ temperature for heat balance calculations.
    However, this method is limited to very fine pixel resolutions and it requires
    exact co-registration of the thermal image with the visible one, which limits
    the practicality of aerial surveys. Histogram processing of image frames, taken
    at a pixel size of less than half the width of the cropped fraction in a partially
    covered canopy, enables separation of canopy from soil temperatures as they correspond
    to different portions of the histogram (Meron 1987). The coldest 33% of the remaining
    canopy related pixels after separating soil can be used as the representative
    ‘cold’ crop temperature for water stress evaluation, as demonstrated in Meron
    and Charitt (2003). More detailed evidence to support this procedure is in preparation.
    The widely accepted concept of the crop water stress index (CWSI) (Jackson et
    al. 1981) is defined as a fraction of the canopy temperature between an upper
    (dry) and a lower (wet) reference under ambient conditions. The relation between
    ambient conditions and a variety of baselines and references have been investigated
    over the years. Empirical well watered base lines introduced initially with CWSI
    were found later to be strongly related to specific conditions (Idso 1982). Temperatures
    of natural surfaces such as a well watered crop (Gardner et al. 1992a, b) are
    good indicators, but such surfaces need dedicated maintenance, which impedes the
    implementation of this approach at the production scale. Reference temperatures
    derived from foliage that has been wetted or greased are mainly useful for micro-scale
    methods (Jones, 1999). Wetted reference surfaces constructed of manmade materials
    are well-defined and reproducible indicators of ambient conditions, with some
    limitations at non-turbulent wind velocities (Meron and Charitt 2003). The area
    covered by a thermal survey system is defined by swath width (sensor array width
    multiplied with the pixel size on the ground) and velocity. Pixel size is limited
    to the largest size that will enable the separation of soil temperatures and detection
    of fractions of canopy temperature; this is usually smaller than half of the width
    covered by the crop row. Flight velocity is limited by shutter speed, which determines
    pixel sharpness. Cooled imagers are fast and sharp, but expensive. Bolometric
    thermal imagers are more widely used because they are more affordable. However,
    their acquisition speeds of 1/140 to 1/200 s are too slow to freeze motion. Aerial
    or ground surveys with bolometric cameras must slow down to eliminate blur, or
    the processing must be able to handle blurred images and enlargement of the pixel
    size because of pixel ‘smear’ in the direction of movement. Economic thermal mapping
    depends on the system’s capacity to cover the area in a given time. One of the
    options to enhance the capacity is to skip swaths and frames, and then interpolate
    CWSI values to generate maps. The objective of this work was to establish the
    relation of crop stress properties to a remotely measured thermal index, and to
    explore the feasibility of mapping crop stress by remote thermography for site-specific
    irrigation. Materials and methods High resolution ground surveys on a single field
    Location Ground-based measurements were obtained during the summer of 2007 at
    a commercial cotton (Gossypium hirsutum x barbadense hybrid c.v. Acalpi) field
    in the Hula Valley of Israel (N33.11, E35.35). The soil at the site is a brown
    alluvial hydromorphic gromosol, and the climate is Mediterranean. The field was
    selected as an experimental site from previous observations of variable crop development,
    apparently related to very variable soil water-holding characteristics caused
    by the spatially variable alluvial deposits. The cotton was planted in 0.96 m
    spaced rows, cultivated by conventional methods, and was free of pests and diseases.
    The crop was irrigated uniformly with a lateral moving sprinkler system. Irrigation
    was scheduled by the grower, based on recommendations from the extension service
    and available water supply. Potential evapo-transpiration (ETp) was evaluated
    from a nearby weather station by a modified Penman formula, similar to the CIMIS
    grass reference (Craddock 1994) method. Watering dates and amounts related to
    ETp are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Evaporative demand (70 and 100% ETp), irrigation
    amounts and survey events (arrows) in the monitored field at the Hula Valley 2007
    Full size image Thermography A FLIR (Bilerica, MA) model SC2000 radiometric infrared
    (IR) camera, equipped with a 45º FOV lens, was mounted about 5 m above crop level,
    3 m left of the boom center and pointing straight down 180° to zenith on the spraying
    boom of a TECNOMA model “Laser 4000” self propelled, high pass sprayer (Epernay,
    France) (Fig. 2). The camera was remotely controlled by FLIR ThermaCam™ software
    on an IBM ThinkPad laptop. A GPS receiver (MID-TECH model RX 400p) with 1–3 m
    spatial accuracy was mounted on the sprayer and connected to the same computer.
    Images were captured and locations were measured every second. The IR images were
    matched to location by the computer’s clock. Fig. 2 Infrared scanner mounted on
    a high pass sprayer Full size image Sampling Ten sampling sites were selected
    along a crop row that displayed very variable soil water holding capacity and
    were marked with a 2 m high fiberglass pole for repeated examinations (Fig. 3).
    The sites were selected by a visual examination of crop development before the
    start of irrigation. Two young, sunlit, fully expanded leaves within 0.5 m of
    each marking pole were sampled for leaf water potential (LWP) using a pressure
    chamber (Ari-Mad, Israel). The LWP was determined on every scanning day within
    15 min of the field scan. Leaves to be used for LWP analysis were wrapped with
    aluminum foil at cutting and pressurized while wrapped as described by Meron et
    al. (1987). Plant height from ground level to the main stem tip was recorded weekly
    on the marking pole for each sampled plant until the cessation of growth. Fig.

    and reference surfaces The artificial reference surface (ARS) was placed at the
    edge of the field, together with the weather station. It consisted of a wet, white,
    non-woven viscose-polyester fabric in a double layer covering a polystyrene float.
    The float was placed in a 0.4 × 0.3 m water-filled plastic box, and the fabric
    was kept constantly wet via a wick from the water. An Apogee (Logan UT) IR thermal
    sensor mounted 0.1 m above the surface recorded ARS temperatures. The sensor was
    connected to a Campbell Scientific (Logan UT) system comprising a CR10X data logger,
    an air temperature and relative humidity sensor (Vaisala model HMP50), a global
    radiation sensor (Li-Cor model 200X) and a rotating cup anemometer (RM Young model
    3101) at 2 m elevation. Values were measured at intervals of 6 s and averages
    were recorded every minute. Image processing Images were processed in Visual Basic
    5 using OLE automation functions provided in the FLIR Researcher™ package. First,
    the histogram of the image was constructed with 256 bins in the 19–45.5°C range
    and an interval of 0.1°C. Next, only pixels within the temperature limit described
    by Eq. 1 were retained, assuming that temperatures outside this range are not
    canopy-related. $$ \left( {T{\text{air}}- 10} \right) < T{\text{pixel}} < \left(
    {T{\text{air}} + 7} \right), $$ (1) where Tair (°C) is air temperature and Tpixel
    (°C) is the calibrated pixel temperature The cumulative average weights of the
    coldest 33% pixels were calculated by Eq. 2. $$ T{\text{canopy}} = {\frac{{\sum\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{0.33N} {T_{i} *f_{i} } }}{{\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{0.33N} {f_{i} } }}}, $$
    (2) where T i (°C) is the temperature, f i is the number of pixels in each ith
    class of the histogram and 0.33 N is 33% of the pixels retained at the first step
    after the non crop related pixels were discarded.The CWSI was subsequently calculated
    by Eq. 3: $$ CWSI = {\frac{{T_{\text{canopy}} - T_{\text{ARS}} }}{{T_{\text{air}}
    + 5^{^\circ } - T_{\text{ARS}} }}}, $$ (3) where Tcanopy is the mean temperature
    of the 33% coldest pixels after discarding pixels hotter than 7°C from the air,
    TARS is the wet ARS temperature and Tair is air temperature (°C) at the time of
    image acquisition. Crop cover was determined by dividing the number of plant related
    pixels by the total number of pixels per square meter in the frame. Survey and
    mapping Six ground surveys were performed throughout the season. Swath widths
    were 4.5 m, except for the first survey which had 1.5 m swath widths. Frames were
    recorded every 3 m along the row, and the resulting frame area covered was 4.5–13.5
    m2 corresponding to the swath width. Distance between swaths ranged from 12 to
    24 m. Survey dates and the relevant details are given in Table 1. Table 1 Survey
    dates, times (GMT + 2), field cover and ambient conditions Full size table The
    center point of each CWSI frame was assigned to the corresponding GPS location
    as a point feature in an ArcView 9.2 GIS map (ESRI, Redland CA). The resulting
    grid densities of the CWSI points ranged from 3 × 24 m to 3 × 12 m (Table 1).
    Maps were generated by inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation of the CWSI
    points using inbuilt functions of ArcView 9.2 Spatial Analyst extension. Aerial
    survey To test the feasibility of the proposed method at a larger scale, an aerial
    survey was conducted over several field crops in the Hula Valley, Israel, on August
    20 2007; see ambient conditions over the area in Table 1. Thermography The radiometric
    imager (FLIR SC2000), equipped with a 45º FOV lens was mounted looking straight
    down over an opening in the aircraft floor, and the GPS antenna was mounted under
    the front windshield. Given the 0.20 s GPS acquisition interval at 40 m s−1 ground
    speed, location accuracy in the flight direction was ±8 m. Image acquisition was
    recorded at 2 frames s−1 with 0.01 s accuracy. Flights were directed along the
    rows by visible wheel paths of the lateral irrigation system in the sprinkler
    fields, and by flag bearers on the ground in the drip irrigated fields. The flight
    altitude was 45–50 m above ground, adhering to Israeli ceilings for agricultural
    aerial applications, which resulted in swath widths of 45–50 m. The ground pixel
    sizes obtained were about 0.15 m across the flight direction, but due to ‘smear’
    caused by the slow shutter speed pixel size increased to 0.3 m along the path.
    Image processing and map generation Original images of 45 × 33 m in size were
    subdivided during processing into six equal sub-frames of two rows and three columns
    covering a crop area of about 250 m2. The CWSI was evaluated for each sub-frame
    as described by Eqs. 1–3. The center location of each sub-frame was calculated
    from the frame’s GPS center point, elevation and azimuth data using basic trigonometry
    (Fig. 4). Each CWSI value was assigned to the center point of the sub-frame. Maps
    of water stress were generated in ArcView by IDW interpolation as described in
    the ground surveys. Fig. 4 Ground referenced thermal image showing image division

    the commencement of irrigation. An overview of the test area showing LWP sampling
    point locations overlaid on the June 18 CWSI map is shown in Fig. 5a. The extents
    of stress levels at the ten sampling points are illustrated in Fig. 6 where crop
    height, crop cover and LWP are closely correlated. Main stem elongation rates
    and LWP are established crop stress indicators in cotton (Grimes and Yamada 1982;
    Howell and Meron 2007). In the absence of watering before the first irrigation,
    the cotton consumed the water stored in the soil, and water stress developed as
    a function of the different water holding capacities of the soil in various sections
    of the field (Fig. 5). Plants growing in more sandy soil with low water holding
    capacity consumed all the available water, and remained small and deeply stressed.
    Conversely, plants growing in soil with higher water capacity flourished. Fig.

    days by ground survey in 2007. The LWP sampling points for 18 June are shown in

    cover, crop height and LWP on 18 June 2007, before the first irrigation in the
    monitored field Full size image Crop stress monitoring during the season The maps
    in Fig. 5 show the results from six ground surveys. Stress levels on the survey
    dates are the outcomes of irrigation timing and the amounts of water applied (Fig.
    1). The second survey (Fig. 5b) was done after the second irrigation, and the
    third survey (Fig. 5c) was immediately before the third irrigation was applied.
    The soil water deficit is evident from the ETp and water applied during the first
    two irrigations (Fig. 1, arrows 1 and 2). Corresponding plant stress levels in
    Fig. 5b and c show the deficit clearly, mainly in the soil with low water holding
    capacity. The amount of water applied was increased at the third irrigation to
    reach 100% ETp (Fig. 1, arrows 3–5). The fourth survey (Fig. 5d), immediately
    before the fourth irrigation, shows the moderate stress levels that were expected.
    In the fifth survey (Fig. 5e), before the fifth irrigation, the plants on the
    more sandy soil appear to be less stressed than those on soil with a higher water
    holding capacity. This contradiction can be explained, by the fact that plants
    grown in soil with a low water holding capacity were smaller, with reduced crop
    cover and less surface exposed to transpiration. Their estimated water consumption
    was closer to 70% ETp, therefore, with the amount of water applied to replace
    full ETp they were over irrigated. The last ground survey (Fig. 5f) was done after
    considerable stress was developed by reducing irrigation before defoliation. The
    stress is evident in the entire field, and it became more enhanced in the rapidly
    drying sandy soil. Relation of CWSI to leaf water potential Leaf water potentials
    (Fig. 7) correlated linearly (R 2 = 0.816) with CWSI over the full range of crop
    stress recorded during the season. The scatter is considerable in the part of
    the graph representing the well-watered range, from the origin to a CWSI of 0.4
    (~−1 to −1.5 MPa LWP). This scatter makes it difficult to fine-tune stress detection
    within this range. However, the stressed range above CWSI 0.4 is clearly discernible
    from the well-watered range. According to this result, CWSI can replace LWP for
    cotton water-stress evaluation, at least as an indicator of stress or no-stress.
    The importance of this finding is that it enables aerial thermography, which is
    a fast and efficient tool for monitoring and mapping crop stress over wide areas,
    to be used for managing irrigation Fig. 7 Relation of cotton CWSI to leaf water

    Full size image Aerial survey The aerial surveys of August 20, 2007 included two
    lateral moves, one center pivot and one drip irrigated field. The peanut field
    (Fig. 8) was scanned while irrigation water was being applied; the lateral move
    position is indicated by the arrow. Mean CWSI levels and CWSI histograms, calculated
    from the interpolated values on the mapping grid, are shown on the figure. Stress
    levels are 0.2 CWSI units less after irrigation, and are less scattered on the
    histogram. In the drip-irrigated process tomato field (Fig. 9) stress levels are
    quite moderate, but less uniform than expected from such an even water distribution
    system. Factors other than water distribution uniformity appear to have contributed
    to the variation in crop stress in this field. Fig. 8 Water stress map of a peanut
    field during irrigation on 20 August 2007. Mean CWSI values are indicated ahead
    and behind the lateral move position (arrow) Full size image Fig. 9 Water stress

    The cotton field where the ground monitoring took place was scanned by the aerial
    survey 1 day before the final irrigation, and the stress map is shown in Fig.
    10. The western part of the field, where the irrigation cycle begins, is more
    stressed with CWSI values about 0.2 units higher than in the eastern part. Variation
    in stress levels evident in the field is the result of incremental outcomes of
    previous irrigations and soil water holding capacities; they are increasingly
    discernible with time after the previous irrigation. The polygon marked on the
    stress map in Fig 10 is less detailed compared to the ground stress maps of the
    same section (Fig. 5f) as the resolution of the aerial scan was much coarser than
    that of the ground scan. After the final irrigation in the center-pivot cotton
    field (Fig. 11), overall stress levels were high, but a difference of 0.14 CWSI
    units is still discernable between the earlier and more recent irrigation dates.

    management Moving irrigation machines Irrigation machines based on a center pivot
    or that move laterally can be sub-sectioned, and the sections can then be controlled
    separately with technology that already exists and with relatively little additional
    investment. The potential for variable-rate, site-specific water application is
    shown by Fig. 12, which was surveyed from the ground on June 18 (Fig. 5a) before
    the first irrigation. Once such maps are available there are several choices;
    for example, pre-irrigation of the stressed sections only or application of different
    amounts of water according to the stress levels. Other related spatial information
    derived from the same scan, such as crop cover and plant height, or other sources
    such as yield maps or soil information, could refine site-specific irrigation
    management further. Fig. 12 Management zones in a per-section controlled variable-rate
    lateral move irrigator. Scattered lines are wheel paths Full size image Solid
    set irrigation Maps provide valuable visual information, but they need additional
    processing to quantify the information for management. Digital map information
    on crop stress enables spatial statistics to be computed from the CWSI data on
    a grid, and numeric reporting of crop stress levels for each management zone (Fig.
    13). The grower can assess mean values of crop water status, the distribution
    of stress levels around the mean and the extent of water stress extremes in the
    field at a glance on the graph, without studying the maps. This is particularly
    important in solid set systems where irrigation is managed in whole units controlled
    by a single valve. When crop water stress is monitored routinely, short-term changes
    in stress levels from previous scans can be related directly to changes made in
    the management of irrigation. The CWSI mean and dispersal statistics also enable
    the scheduling of irrigation to suit drier, wetter or average stress levels. In
    the long term, stress maps enable reorganization of irrigation zones according
    to uniformity criteria. Fig. 13 Mean crop stress levels (CWSI) and their distribution

    Conclusions A set of thermal remote sensing surveys were conducted from ground
    and low flying aerial platforms in the Hula Valley of Israel to provide crop stress
    maps, a prerequisite of site-specific irrigation management. Leaf water potentials
    of cotton measured at 10 fixed sampling points during the season related linearly
    (R 2 = 0.816, n = 56) to CWSI at the same position, processed by the reported
    procedure. The range of values indicating stress was clearly separated from the
    well-watered range. This finding opens the door to simplification of thermal image
    evaluation by histogram analysis, eliminating the need for much more complex visible
    image co-registration and sunlit foliage pattern recognition processing. The CWSI
    maps generated from the ground surveys of the cotton field corresponded well to
    irrigation history and to the calculated soil water balance. Spatial variability
    in the aerial stress maps of peanuts, process tomato and cotton fields could have
    been related to distinct irrigation events on the ground. These results suggest
    that this method could be extended to other crops after crop specific calibration
    of the imagery. According to the methods tested and developed, aerial thermography
    can provide the maps needed for site-specific irrigation management. Post processing
    of the maps to indicate particular levels of stress in irrigation machine sections
    of the field can provide a template for the machine to deliver spatially variable
    rates of irrigation. Beyond direct visual evaluation, stress statistics in management
    zones derived from the map database, enables the grower to make quantitative scheduling
    decisions for both mobile or static irrigation. References Camp, C., Sadler, E.

    Get rights and content Highlights • An empirical CWSI determined from mini RPAS
    is assessed in a SHD olive orchard. • The Non-Water-Stressed Baselines were not
    constant along the irrigation season. • CWSI derived from aerial thermal imagery
    was sensitive to tree water status. • Stomatal conductance exhibited the tightest
    relationship with CWSI. Abstract Characterization of the spatio-temporal variability
    of tree water status is a prerequisite to conducting precise irrigation management
    in fruit tree orchards. This study assessed the suitability of a crop water stress
    index (CWSI) derived from high-resolution aerial thermal imagery for estimating
    tree water status variability in super high density (SHD) olive orchards. The
    experiment was conducted at a commercial SHD olive orchard near Seville (southwestern
    Spain), with drip irrigated trees under three irrigation treatments (four plots
    per treatment in a randomized block design): a full irrigation treatment to replace
    the crop water needs (ETc) and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments to
    replace ca. 45% of ETc. Meteorological variables, soil moisture content, leaf
    water potential, stem water potential and leaf gas exchange measurements were
    performed along the irrigation season. Infrared temperature sensors (IRTs) installed
    approximately 1 m above the canopies were used to derive the required Non-Water-Stressed
    Baselines (NWSBs) for CWSI calculation. NWSBs were not common during the growing
    season, although the seasonal effect could be partly explained with solar angle
    variations. A thermal camera installed on a mini Remotely Piloted Aircraft System
    (RPAS) allowed for the recording of high-resolution thermal images on 5 representative
    dates during the irrigation season. The CWSI values derived from aerial thermal
    imagery were sensitive to the imposed variations in tree water status within the
    SHD olive orchard. Among the recorded variables, maximum stomatal conductance
    showed the tightest correlation with CWSI. We concluded that high-resolution thermal
    imagery captured from a mini RPAS is a suitable tool for defining tree water status
    variability within SHD olive orchards. Previous article in issue Next article

    1. Introduction Hedgerow olive orchards with high plant densities (>1500 trees
    ha−1), or super high density (SHD) olive orchards, have expanded dramatically
    since the early 1990s. Over 100,000 ha are currently under this management system,
    half of them in Spain (Rius and Lacarte, 2010). Most SHD olive orchards are under
    irrigation, requiring ca. 5000 m3 ha−1 to replace maximum crop evapotranspiration
    in semi-arid areas such as SW Spain (Fernández et al., 2013). This explains the
    increasing interest in developing precision irrigation techniques to increase
    water productivity (Cuevas et al., 2013, Egea et al., 2016, Fernández et al.,
    2013, Gómez Del Campo and García, 2013, Padilla-Díaz et al., 2016). The spatial
    variability in crop water needs caused by soil heterogeneity and differences in
    canopy cover may be an important limitation for efficient irrigation when water
    is applied uniformly across the orchard (Couvreur et al., 2016). Characterization
    of the spatial variability of crop water needs is therefore a prerequisite to
    apply precise irrigation management within SHD olive orchards. It will allow to
    supply different irrigation amounts to zones within the orchard with different
    water requirements. Mapping the spatio-temporal variability of tree water needs
    with conventional methods such as the pressure chamber (Scholander et al., 1965)
    is time and labor consuming (Jiménez-Bello et al., 2011). In addition, the reliability
    of the information provided by the pressure chamber decreases when the species
    shows an isohydric behavior, characterized by a strong stomatal regulation that
    avoids marked decreases in leaf water potentials under conditions of low soil
    water and high evaporative demand (Fernández, 2014). There are other conventional
    although reliable indicators of water stress, such as the stomatal conductance
    but, once again, measurements must be made manually (Jones, 2007). Remote sensing
    techniques offer a promising alternative to traditional tree water status measurements,
    as they provide a snapshot of the whole orchard over a reduced period of time.
    The advent of Remote Piloted Aerial Systems (RPAS) has offered an opportunity
    to develop remote sensing-based methodologies for precision irrigation more affordably
    than the costly airborne campaigns with manned aircrafts and with higher spatial
    and temporal resolutions than those normally offered by satellites. Various sources
    of remotely sensed imagery, with differences in spectral, spatial, radioactive
    and temporal characteristics, are known to be suitable for different purposes
    of vegetation mapping (Xie et al., 2008). Among these sources, thermal imagery
    of vegetation is becoming popular for water stress detection and for irrigation
    management purposes (Bellvert et al., 2016b, Berni et al., 2009). This is due
    to the existing relationship between crop transpiration rate and canopy temperature
    through a cooling effect that the former exerts on vegetation temperature (Maes
    and Steppe, 2012). Since the refinement of the technique for measuring crop surface
    temperature with infrared thermometers in the 1960s (Fuchs and Tanner, 1966),
    thermal remote sensing has been extensively used to diagnose plant water stress
    in multiple crop species (Hatfield et al., 1985, Nielsen and Anderson, 1989, Sepulcre-Cantó
    et al., 2006, Testi et al., 2008). Variations in crop temperature are due to water
    stress, but are also affected by various meteorological and morphological factors
    (Maes and Steppe, 2012). Therefore crop temperature must be normalized before
    being used as water stress indicator. In the early 1980s, Idso et al. (1981) and
    Jackson et al. (1981) developed the concept of CWSI, a normalized index that overcomes
    the influence that other environmental variables play on the relationship between
    crop temperature and water stress. Since then, CWSI has been successfully used
    in a variety of crops, in which temperature readings were often made with hand-held
    infrared thermometers (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001, Hatfield et al., 1985). Currently,
    the combined used of modern high-resolution thermal infrared cameras and RPAS
    offer the possibility to map spatial variability in tree water status from thermal
    imaging and temperature-derived indicators (Bellvert et al., 2016a). As reviewed
    in Maes and Steppe (2012), CWSI can be determined by at least three different
    methodologies. Among them, the empirical CWSI has attained much more popularity
    and become more successful among scientists and non-scientists mainly due to the
    limited data requirements and straightforward calculation as compared to the analytical
    and direct methodologies (Agam et al., 2013, Maes and Steppe, 2012). Idso et al.
    (1981) calculated the empirical CWSI as follows: (1) where Tc-Ta denotes the measured
    canopy-air temperature difference; (Tc-Ta)LL is the lower limit of (Tc-Ta) for
    a given vapor pressure deficit (VPD) which is equivalent to a canopy transpiring
    at the potential rate; and (Tc-Ta)UL is the maximum (Tc-Ta), which corresponds
    to a non-transpiring canopy. (Tc-Ta)LL is a linear function of VPD (non-water-stressed
    baseline, NWSB) that, once empirically obtained, (Tc-Ta)LL is calculated by solving
    the baseline equation for the actual VPD. To our knowledge, there are two reports
    in the literature that provide empirical NWSBs for olive trees (Bellvert et al.,
    2016a, Berni et al., 2009). However, both equations are reasonably different as
    denoted by the very small (expressed as absolute value) slope (−0.35 °C kPa−1)
    obtained by Berni et al. (2009) as compared to that (−2.05 °C kPa−1) reported
    in Bellvert et al. (2016a). These differences in the sensitivity of Tc-Ta to VPD
    in olive are so important that more research is needed to reduce the degree of
    uncertainty in the appropriate NWSB to be used in SHD olive orchards. Moreover,
    these studies provided a single NWSB obtained with measurements collected at a
    certain daytime (e.g. 12:30 GMT in Berni et al. (2009)), but a comprehensive study
    on how NWSB varies both along the day and the season is lacking in olive trees.
    To reduce the lack of information mentioned above on the use of CWSI and NWSB
    in olive, we design this study according to the following objectives: (i) to determine
    the NWSB for olive in a commercial SHD olive orchard as well as its diurnal and
    seasonal (throughout the irrigation season) time courses, (ii) to compute CWSI
    throughout the irrigation season in trees under three irrigation treatments from
    the obtained NWSB and high resolution aerial thermal imagery taken from a mini
    RPAS, and (iii) to assess the suitability of the derived CWSI values to estimate
    the variation of tree water status within SHD olive orchards. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Experimental site The experiment was conducted in 2015 at a commercial
    SHD olive orchard near Seville, in southwestern Spain (37.248979, −5.796538).
    Nine year-old olive trees (Olea europaea L., cv. Arbequina) were planted with
    4 m x 1.5 m tree spacing (1667 trees ha−1). The drip irrigation system consisted
    of one drip line per tree row and three 2 L h−1 pressure compensating drippers
    (0.5 m apart) per tree. One flow meter per irrigation treatment recorded the amount
    of water applied during each irrigation event. An irrigation controller (Agronic
    2000, Sistemes Electrònics PROGRÉS, S.A., Lleida, Spain) was used for irrigation
    scheduling. Trees were fertilized to cover the crop needs and no weeds were allowed
    to grow in the inter-row spacing over the spring-summer seasons. The climate of
    the study area is Mediterranean, with rainfall occurring normally from late September
    to May. The average annual value of potential reference evapotranspiration (ET0)
    and precipitation calculated for the 2002–2014 period from data recorded by a
    standard weather station belonging to the Andalusian government and located near
    the orchard, were 1528 mm and 540 mm, respectively. Table 1 shows the weather
    data (monthly averages) recorded over the experimental year. The orchard soil
    has a sandy loam top layer (0.0–0.4 m) and a sandy clay layer (0.4–1.0 m) underneath.
    The electrical conductivity of the saturated soil-paste (ECe), pH and organic
    matter content determined in the 0.0-0.4 m soil layer were 2.5 dS m−1, 6.34 and
    0.28%, respectively. Table 1. Weather variables measured during 2015 at a nearby

    treatments Three irrigation treatments were established in the orchard, as described
    in Padilla-Díaz et al. (2016): a full irrigation treatment (FI) in which the trees
    were irrigated daily for the whole irrigation season to supply 100% of the irrigation
    needs (IN), and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments (45RDI) for which
    the total water supplied during the season was aimed to replace 45% of IN. One
    of the 45RDI treatments was scheduled on the basis of the crop coefficient method
    (45RDICC), whereas the other 45RDI treatment was scheduled from leaf turgor related
    measurements (45RDITP) made with ZIM probes (Zimmermann et al., 2008). The 45RDI
    trees were irrigated with enough water to replace IN in three periods of the year
    when olive is most sensitive to water stress (Fernández, 2014): from the last
    stages of floral development to full bloom (period 1, mid-April), at 6–10 weeks
    after full bloom (period 2, June) and some 3 weeks prior to ripening (period 3,
    from late August to mid-September). For the rest of the year just one or two irrigation
    events per week are applied. The crop coefficient method was applied for scheduling
    irrigation in both the FI and 45RDICC treatments, with crop coefficients adjusted
    for the orchard conditions by Fernández et al. (2013). For the 45RDITP treatment
    irrigation was scheduled from the outputs of the ZIM probes, which are related
    to the leaf turgor pressure. We used the approach described by Padilla-Díaz et
    al. (2016). Basically, the shape of the daily curves provided by the ZIM probes
    and the 3-day weather forecast were used to adjust irrigation in the three periods
    mentioned above, such that the irrigation amounts were close or equal to IN in
    those periods. In between the periods and after period 3, all treatments were
    irrigated with the crop coefficient approach and according to the 45RDI strategy
    described by Fernández (2014). We used four 16 m x 12 m plots per treatment, in
    a randomized block design. Each plot contained 32 trees, of which measurements
    were made on the central 8 trees to avoid border effects. 2.3. Thermal imagery
    acquisition A thermal infrared (TIR) camera (Tau 2 324, FLIR Systems, Inc., Oregon,
    USA) was mounted on a multirotor RPAS (Remote Piloted Aerial System) model Phantom
    2 (SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). The RPAS is equipped with a
    GNSS receptor, has flight autonomy of 25 min and a remote control range of 1000
    m in open spaces. The TIR camera was installed to aim vertically downward (nadir
    view) at the bottom of the RPAS. The camera spectral range is 7.5–13.5 μm with
    a resolution of 324 × 256 pixels, a focal length of 9 mm, and a field of view
    of 49° (H) x 39° (V). The RPAS was flown across the experimental orchard on five
    clear sky days, at 20 m above the ground level and at solar noon, delivering thermal
    images with a ground spatial resolution of 5 cm. The thermal images were stored
    on board in a raw format with 14-bit radiometric resolution. At the time of each
    flight, surface temperature measurements of ground targets were used for indirect
    calibration of the thermal imagery (Bellvert et al., 2014, Dupin et al., 2011).
    In particular, a cold (wet cotton sheet) and hot references (40 cm x 50 cm black
    plastic panels) located in the center of each experimental plot along with four
    monitored trees with infrared thermometers (IRTS) (Section 2.4) were used as ground
    targets. The cold and hot references were measured with a hand-held infrared thermometer
    model FLUKE 62 Max (FLUKE, Washington, DC, USA). 2.4. Measurements at ground level
    Volumetric soil water content (θ) was measured in all plots (n = 4) with a PR2-type
    Profile Probe (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK). In each location, measurements
    were made at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0 m depth, once every 7–10 days throughout
    the irrigation season. The θ measurements were always performed after an irrigation
    event, between 10:00 and 12:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e. close to solar
    noon at the longitude of our experimental site. The probe was calibrated in situ
    by Fernández et al. (2011). The θ values were used to calculate changes in the
    relative extractable water (REW) for all treatments, as described elsewhere (Fernández
    et al., 2013). The midday stem water potential (Ψst) was measured with a Scholander-type
    pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, Oregon, USA) on the same days
    that the RPAS was flown. One leaf per tree, from the inner part of the canopy,
    was wrapped in aluminum foil ca. 2 h before sampling, in two representative trees
    per plot (n = 8). Measurements of Ψst were made at 11:30–12:30 GMT when minimum
    daily values are usually recorded in olive. Stomatal conductance (gsm) was measured
    on the same days and on the same trees where Ψst was measured, but between 09:00–10:00
    GMT, the time of maximum daily stomatal conductance in this species (Fernández
    et al., 1997). A Licor LI-6400 portable photosynthesis system (Li-cor, Lincoln
    Nebraska, USA) with a 2 cm × 3 cm standard chamber was used to measure gsm and
    leaf transpiration rate (Em) in sunny leaves of current-year shoots from the outer
    part of the canopy facing SE and in ambient light (≈1500 μmol m−2 s−1) and CO2
    (370–400 μmol mol−1) conditions. Four Infrared Remote Temperature Sensors (IRTs)
    (model IR120, Campbell Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK) were mounted over two representative
    trees of one out of four plots in FI and 45RDITP treatments. The sensors had an
    angular field of view of 20° (half angle), and the accuracy over the calibrated
    range was ± 0.2 °C. The IRTs were mounted on galvanized steel masts with a horizontal
    mounting arm (model IR1 × 0, Campbell Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK) ending with
    a white PVC solar shield (model IR-SS, Campbell Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK)
    to protect the sensor. The IRTs were mounted to aim vertically downward (nadir
    view), targeting the center of the canopy from a distance of approximately 1 m.
    The dense canopies typical of hedgerow olive orchards allowed the IRTs to view
    mostly foliage in a circular area of approximately 0.7 m diameter at the top of
    the canopy. The IRTs were connected to two dataloggers (model CR1000, Campbell
    Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK), which recorded the canopy temperatures (Tc) every
    minute and stored the 15-min averages. The canopy temperature measurements began
    on June 16th, 2015 (DOY 167) and continued with a sole interruption of 12 days
    due to power outage until November 5th (DOY 275). Values of Tc measured with the
    IRTs above the FI trees were used to derive the Non-Water-Stressed Baselines (NWSB)
    for CWSI calculation. Only clear-sky days were used for NWSB determination. Clear-sky
    days following a rainfall event were also discarded to avoid errors associated
    with wet foliage. Air temperature (Ta) along with VPD data were recorded in the
    orchard every 30 min with a Campbell weather station (Campbell Scientific Ltd.,
    Shepshed, UK) at the same time that Tc were used to derive the NWSB of the SHD
    olive orchard. 2.5. Image processing and CWSI calculation The thermal images taken
    with the RPAS (Fig. 1) were used to calculate the mean canopy temperature (Tc)
    of each experimental plot. Only the central 8 trees of each plot were used to
    calculate the mean Tc to avoid border effects. An image segmentation algorithm
    written in R (R Core Team, 2015) was used to extract pure vegetation pixels from
    the thermal image. At solar noon, the effects of tree shadow are minimized, and
    the thermal images are composed mainly of canopy, soil and mixed plant-soil pixels.
    Firstly, vegetation pixels from a bi-modal histogram (i.e. a histogram with two
    clearly differentiated peaks ascribed to soil and vegetation pixels in the point
    cloud) (Fig. 2) were selected with the mentioned algorithm. Then, the ‘full width
    at one-eighth maximum (FWEM)’ rule was used to distinguish the pixels with high
    probability of being pure vegetation from pixels that were likely to be mixed
    vegetation with soil and/or shadow effects. The FWEM rule is similar to the ‘full
    width at half maximum’ (FWHM) rule that has been previously used to extract pure
    vegetation pixels from olive canopies (Rud et al., 2015), but differed in the
    amplitude of the selected histogram (one-eighth of the maximum in FWEM versus
    half the maximum in FWHM). FWHM demonstrated a lack of suitability for segmenting
    thermal images with multiple trees that differ greatly in their Tc, since vegetation
    pixels from trees with severe water stress can be erroneously discarded by the
    FWHM rule (Fig. 3). The selected segment resulting from the FWEM rule was then
    used to compute the mean Tc for each experimental plot. Download : Download high-res

    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) Mean Tc was used to calculate the CWSI for each experimental plot
    using Eq. (1). For each day of flight, (Tc-Ta)LL was calculated from the NWSB
    that was determined with the IRTs, as described in Section 2.4 and with the actual
    air VPD. The value of (Tc-Ta)UL was determined as Ta + 5 °C based on previous
    studies conducted in different crop species (Irmak et al., 2000, Möller et al.,
    2007), including olive trees (Agam et al., 2014, Agam et al., 2013, Ben-Gal et
    al., 2009, Rud et al., 2015). 2.6. Statistical analyses The relationships between
    Tc-Ta and VPD (NWSBs) as well as between CWSI and the physiological measurements
    were analyzed through linear regression analyses. The diurnal time-course of slopes
    and intercepts of the derived NWSBs was modeled through non-linear regression
    analysis. In all cases, the coefficient of determination (R2) was used to assess
    the goodness of fit of the associations among variables. Significant differences
    between slopes and non-zero intercepts of the NWSBs obtained diurnally and seasonally
    were evaluated with the Comparison of Regression Lines tool included in the statistical
    package Statgraphics (Statgraphics Centurion XV). 3. Results 3.1. Non-Water-Stressed
    baselines The relationship between hourly ΔT (Tc − Ta) and VPD values derived
    for FI olive trees in clear-sky days throughout the study period, did not yield
    any significant relationship when all hours and days were pooled together (data
    not shown). The relationships became significant when ΔT and VPD were regressed
    for a given time of the day, as shown in Table 2. The coefficients of determination
    (R2) were notably affected by the daytime. The highest R2 were observed early
    in the morning (R2 = 0.74 at 8.00 GMT). These values decreased progressively down
    to 0.28 (14:00 GMT), recovering partially afterwards (R2 = 0.51 at 18.00 GMT).
    The intercepts and slopes of the fitted NWSBs also varied throughout the day.
    The intercepts were higher at midday (2.50 at 12:00 GMT) and lower in the morning
    and afternoon whereas the slopes showed an increasing trend throughout the day
    (from −0.77 °C kPa−1 at 8.00 GMT to around −0.3 °C kPa−1in the evening). Table

    17:00 0.31 −0.31 0.42 18:00 −0.09 −0.32 0.51 In addition to the diurnal effect
    on the NWSBs, a marked seasonal effect in the ΔT vs VPD relationship was also
    observed (Fig. 4), as the NWSB shifted in August (Period B) and September (Period
    C), compared to the values derived in June-July (Period A). When ΔT and VPD of
    a given time of the day and for a given period were regressed, the level of agreement
    of the NWSBs increased significantly, and the diurnal effect of R2 observed using
    pooled data (Table 2) was not noticed (Table 3). Seasonal variations in the NWSBs
    were mainly due to significant variations in the NWSB-intercepts, as the NWSB-slopes
    remained almost invariant throughout the irrigation season (Table 3). As observed
    for the NWSBs obtained with pooled data (Table 2), the NWSBs derived during the
    three periods of study (A, B and C) also exhibited a strong diurnal variation
    (Fig. 5). The diurnal time-course of the NWSB-intercepts was successfully modeled
    with fourth-order polynomial equations during the three periods of study (A, B
    and C) (Fig. 6), whereas that of the NWSB-slopes was successfully modeled with
    second-order polynomial equations (Fig. 7). In order to reduce the empiricism
    and site specificity of these models, the parameters of the NWSBs obtained were
    regressed against the zenith solar angle (Testi et al., 2008). While the relation
    between the NWSB-slopes and zenith solar angle was not significant (data not shown),
    the NWSB-intercepts showed a tight relationship with solar angle (Fig. 8). As
    depicted in Fig. 8a, this relationship showed a marked hysteresis during periods
    A and B but not in period C. When the dataset was split into morning and afternoon
    data, it was observed that the relationship NWSB-intercept vs solar angle was
    season-dependent during the morning hours only (period C differed from A and B)
    (Fig. 8b), whereas no seasonal effect on NWSB-intercept was observed during the
    afternoon (Fig. 8c). Download : Download high-res image (207KB) Download : Download

    stress index derived from IRTs and RPAS The canopy temperature measurements obtained
    with the IRTs and with the thermal camera mounted on the RPAS were used to derive
    the seasonal dynamics of CWSI in the irrigation treatments (Figs. 9a, b). The
    CWSI obtained from the IRT readings was markedly influenced by the irrigation
    regime (Fig. 9a). In FI, CWSI values ranged within the interval −0.17 to 0.15
    throughout the irrigation season, with a mean value of 0.00. During the first
    water stress period depicted in Fig. 9 (DOY 174–236), the deficit irrigation treatment
    monitored with the IRTs (45RDITP) exhibited values of CWSI that were much higher
    than those found in FI trees, up to approximately 0.7 (Fig. 9a). During the last
    water stress period (DOY 258 onwards), the differences in CWSI between FI and
    45RDITP were lower, with values close to 0 and 0.2, respectively. Download : Download

    values of CWSI that ranged from −0.07 to 0.17, with mean seasonal values of 0.04.
    The 45RDITP and 45RDICC treatments showed similar trends, with maximum values
    close to 0.8 observed during the first water stress period. The differences in
    CWSI between FI and 45RDI treatments for DOY 239 and 281 were much smaller and
    not statistically significant, with mean values close to 0.3-0.4 in 45RDITP and
    45RDICC and close to 0 in FI. The seasonal trend of CWSI derived from aerial thermal
    imaging was similar to that of REW (Fig. 9c), which also revealed significant
    differences between FI and the 45RDI treatments during the first water stress
    period but not afterwards. 3.3. Relationship between CWSI and other plant-based
    water status indicators The CWSI values derived from aerial thermal imaging for
    the five days of flight and the three irrigation treatments were plotted against
    stem water potential (Ψst), leaf water potential (Ψl), stomatal conductance (gsm)
    and leaf transpiration rate (Em) (Fig. 10). In all cases, significant (P < 0.01)
    linear regressions were observed. The goodness of fit of the relationship between
    Ψst and Ψl with CWSI were similar, with coefficients of determination close to
    0.7 (Figs. 9a, 9b). The relationship between leaf transpiration rate (Em) and
    CWSI was somewhat weaker than that previously described for Ψst and Ψl, with a
    coefficient of determination of 0.6 (Fig. 10d). Stomatal conductance (gsm) was
    the physiological variable that exhibited the tightest linear relationship with
    CWSI, with a coefficient of determination of 0.91 (Fig. 10c). Download : Download

    The diurnal variation observed in the non-water-stressed baselines (NWSBs) derived
    for olive trees (Fig. 5) has already been described in other woody species, such
    as pistachio (Testi et al., 2008) and grapevine (Bellvert et al., 2014). Both
    of these studies found that diurnal shifts in the NWSBs were mainly due to variations
    in the NWSB-intercept, as the slope of the baselines was rather stable. As explained
    theoretically by Jackson et al. (1981), the intercept of the NWSB is expected
    to increase with solar radiation and to decrease with wind speed. In our case
    study, diurnal variations of the NWSB-intercept due to wind speed are unlikely
    since the experimental area is not particularly windy (diurnal wind speed was
    below 2 m s−1 most of the days) and the effect of low to moderate wind speed on
    NWSB has been reported to be negligible (Testi et al., 2008), although it has
    to be noted that was in a different species with different aerodynamic conductance
    for sensible heat flux. Therefore, the observed diurnal variation in the NWSB-intercept
    (Table 2, Table 3) was likely driven by solar radiation, as evidenced by the tight
    relationship found with zenith solar angle (Fig. 8). As compared to previous findings
    in which NWSB-intercept and solar angle were linearly related (Testi et al., 2008),
    in our olive trees the relationship showed a marked hysteresis during periods
    A and B (Fig. 8a). This behaviour indicates that, for similar radiation and VPD
    levels, the cooling effect of transpiration in the summer (periods A and B) is
    higher during the morning hours. This can be due to the fact that, in olive, stomata
    opening is greater in the morning than in the afternoon (Fernández et al., 1997).
    Therefore, transpiration and its cooling effect is also greater in morning than
    in afternoon hours. Unlike what has been observed in previous studies on woody
    crops (Bellvert et al., 2014, Testi et al., 2008), the diurnal evolution of the
    NWSB-slope in olives was stable only from 12:00 GMT onwards, whereas an increasing
    trend that was more pronounced as the season progressed was observed between 8:00
    to 12:00 GMT Compared to other crop species, the NWSB-intercept derived for olives
    (the maximum was approximately 3.5 °C for period A and close to 3 °C in periods
    B and C; Fig. 6) was within the order of magnitude of those found in the literature
    for other herbaceous (Idso, 1982) and woody crop species (Bellvert et al., 2015,
    Testi et al., 2008). However, the NWSB-slope (maximum values around −0.5 °C kPa−1
    for periods A and B and close to −0.7 °C kPa−1 in period C; Fig. 7) derived for
    olives was substantially lower (expressed as an absolute value) than the slopes
    derived for other crop species, with the sole exception of the values derived
    for citrus trees (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014). In herbaceous crops, Idso (1982)
    found NWSB-slope values within the interval −3.25 °C kPa−1 to −1.23 °C kPa−1,
    whereas in other fruit tree species the corresponding midday values were around
    −1.35 °C kPa−1 (pistachio), −1.7 °C kPa−1 (peach) and −1.9 °C kPa−1 (vineyard)
    (Bellvert et al., 2016a, Bellvert et al., 2014, Testi et al., 2008). In olive
    trees, two previous studies provide controversial NWSB-slope values, as denoted
    by the very small slope (−0.35 °C kPa−1) obtained by Berni et al. (2009) compared
    to that (−2.05 °C kPa−1) reported by Bellvert et al. (2016a). Our findings are
    in agreement with the small slope value found by Berni et al. (2009), who argued
    that this value was a consequence of the small size of olive leaves, which makes
    them to be highly coupled to the atmosphere, causing a marked stomatal closure
    when the evaporative demand increases, even in trees under non-limiting soil water
    conditions (Fernández et al., 1997). Seasonal differences in the NWSBs were already
    reported early in the 1980s for two herbaceous crops, wheat and barley (Idso,
    1982), but little is known about the seasonal stability of the NWSBs derived for
    many others herbaceous and woody crop species. In peach trees, within season differences
    in the NWSB were small (Bellvert et al., 2016a); thus, a unique NWSB for the whole
    growing season was recommended by the authors. In olive trees, Berni et al. (2009)
    obtained their NWSB (Tc− Ta = −0.35·VPD + 2.08, R2 = 0.67) by computing the values
    from clear days (12:30 GMT) from April to September. They did not report any seasonal
    effect on such a relationship, but stressed the high scatter and the low slope
    as compared to those reported by other authors. By comparing their NWSB with the
    one obtained in this study (Tc− Ta = −0.36·VPD + 2.50, R2 = 0.49) for the period
    June-September at a similar time (12:00 GMT, Table 2), it can be observed that
    there are no differences in the slopes and the intercepts are very similar. Therefore,
    a plausible explanation for the high scatter reported by Berni et al. (2009) is
    a within-season shift in the NWSB, like the one shown by our results. Recently,
    Bellvert et al. (2015) found that some vineyard cultivars exhibited seasonal NWSB
    shifts, which were associated to variations in the energy balance of the canopy,
    zenith solar angle or leaf orientation. In our case study, the seasonal shift
    of the NWSBs (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) was partly explained by variations in zenith solar
    angle (Fig. 8). In fact, the seasonal variation of NWSB-intercept derived for
    afternoon hours could be explained by zenith solar angle variations (Fig. 8c).
    However, this could not be done for the morning NWSB-intercept values, since NWSB-intercept
    of period C was higher than that of periods A and B for similar solar angles (Fig.
    8b). In any case, the robustness of the derived NWSB to be used for irrigation
    scheduling, as well as its daily and seasonal dynamics, should be assessed in
    different locations and cultivars similarly to what has been performed for other
    olive water status indicators (Corell et al., 2016). Although the CWSI values
    calculated from IRTs and RPAS are not fully comparable, since the former was calculated
    from measurements collected at one out of the four plots used to compute CWSI
    from RPAS measurements, both indicators followed the same seasonal trend and depicted
    values within the same order of magnitude, both for the FI and 45RDITP treatments
    (Fig. 9). Although CWSI is supposed to vary within 0 and 1, slightly negative
    values of CWSI may also be found in well-watered plants, as in our FI trees (Fig.
    9a, b), due to the data scatter of the NWSBs (Bellvert et al., 2015, Testi et
    al., 2008). Values of CWSI derived from the FI trees with both sensing platforms
    throughout the irrigation season were close to zero. The deficit treatment that
    was monitored with IRTs and RPAS exhibited the highest values during the first
    water stress period depicted in Fig. 9 (end of June-end of August), reaching ca.
    0.7 and 0.8 respectively for REW values ca. 0.2 (Fig. 9c). The close matching
    in CWSI trends among proximal (IRTs) and remote (RPAS) thermal sensing indicates
    that the Tc measurements derived from the mini RPAS using a segmentation method
    based on a bi-modal histogram analysis and the FWEM rule are suitable for monitoring
    the CWSI in SHD olive orchards. The suitability of CWSI as a water stress index
    for SHD olive orchards was also demonstrated through the sound relationships found
    between CWSI and the reference plant water stress indicators, such as Ψst, Ψl,
    gsm and Em (Fig. 10). Interestingly, the CWSI explained 91% of the variability
    observed in gsm across treatments and periods (Fig. 10c), whereas the variability
    of Ψst, Ψl and Em that could be explained with CWSI was only 60%–73% (Fig. 10a,
    b and d). These results are in agreement with the theoretical basis of CWSI (Maes
    and Steppe, 2012) which denotes that, under water stress, variations in CWSI are
    driven by variations in Tc and gsm is a main driving physiological variable. However,
    and due to the near-isohydric behavior of the olive tree (Cuevas et al., 2010),
    decreases in leaf and stem water potential under conditions of water stress are
    minimized by stomatal regulation, thus explaining the poorer relationships found
    between CWSI and these variables. In a previous work conducted in an olive orchard
    with less tree density than ours, Berni et al. (2009) also found that CWSI was
    linearly related to both gsm and Ψl and that CWSI was better correlated with gsm
    than with Ψl. However, gsm is not always better correlated with CWSI than Ψl,
    as recently found in nectarines (Bellvert et al., 2016a). Despite that leaf transpiration
    (Em) and gsm are strongly related (Jones, 1992), the relationship between CWSI
    and Em was weaker than that with gsm (Fig. 10), likely because Em depends not
    only on gsm but also on the boundary layer conductance (gb) (Jones, 1992), whose
    value within the leaf cuvette of the gas analyzer set by the user may greatly
    differ from the prevailing gb values in the orchard. In the majority of studies
    performed to assess CWSI performance on fruit tree species, the variable used
    to validate the suitability of CWSI as a water status indicator was Ψst (Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2014, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013, Testi et al., 2008) or Ψl (Bellvert
    et al., 2016a, Bellvert et al., 2015, Bellvert et al., 2014). However, reported
    relationships between CWSI and these variables are not always linear, as it has
    also been observed in this study (Figs. 10a, b). For mandarin and orange trees,
    for instance, curvilinear relationships have been reported (Gonzalez-Dugo et al.,
    2014). In other species, such as grapevine (Bellvert et al., 2015, Bellvert et
    al., 2014) or peach (Bellvert et al., 2016a, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013) both
    linear and curvilinear relationships have been reported. 5. Conclusions The Non-Water-Stressed
    Baseline (NWSB) for CWSI calculation in SHD olive orchards was not constant throughout
    the growing season, but its seasonal shift could be partly explained by variations
    in zenith solar angle. Both NWSB-intercepts and NWSB-slopes exhibited diurnal
    variation, but these trends were successfully modeled with polynomial equations
    to ease CWSI calculation at any time of the day. In order to reduce the empiricism
    and site specificity of these models, a sound relationship between NWSB-intercept
    and solar angle was found. The CWSI values derived from high-resolution thermal
    imagery captured from a mini RPAS demonstrated to be a suitable indicator for
    both monitoring water stress and assessing water status variability in SHD olive
    orchards. Stomatal conductance had the tightest relationship with CWSI, over performing
    other widely used plant water status indicators such as leaf or stem water potential.

    Decision support tool for the efficient irrigation management of sugar beet. The
    use of reliable information and data that are rapidly and easily acquired is essential
    for farm water management and appropriate irrigation strategies. Over the past
    decade, new advances have been made in irrigation technology, such as platforms
    that continuously transmit data between irrigation controllers and field sensors,
    mobile apps, and equipment for variable rate irrigation. In this study, images
    captured with a thermal imaging camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
    were used to evaluate the water status of sugar beet plants in a plot with large
    spatial variability in terms of soil properties. The results were compared with
    those of soil moisture measurements. No direct relationship was observed between
    the water status of the soil and that of the crops. However, the fresh root mass
    and sugar content tended to decrease when higher levels of water stress were detected
    in the crop using thermal imaging, with coefficients of determination of 0.28
    and 0.94 for fresh root mass and sugar content, respectively. Differences were
    observed between different soil types, and therefore different irrigation strategies
    are needed in highly heterogeneous plots. Previous article in issue Next article

    agricultural consultants are facing radical changes regarding the methods employed
    to collect, analyse, and use information to add value to their production outputs.
    Over the past 20 years, we have observed increasing interest in farm- and block-level
    precision agriculture (Blackmore et al., 2003, Zude-Sasse et al., 2016); however,
    the next 20 years will give rise to canopy-, branch-, and even fruit-level production
    practices that will demand a new farming mentality (Krishna, 2016, chap. 5). Field
    sensors will provide terabytes of quantitative and qualitative information about
    crops, such as nutrients levels and plant and soil moisture status, and about
    orchards, such as the three-dimensional canopy shape, the mass and size of each
    fruit, as well as the number of fruits per plant. Amassing this information into
    a coherent database that can be rapidly and easily used to make informed decisions
    on what, when, where, and how to plant, irrigate, prune, thin, treat and harvest
    each crop will soon be one of the fundamental challenges for farmers to address
    (Cox, 1996). This scenario allows farmers to move from intuitive decision making
    to analytical decision making. Irrigation accounts for 70% of the freshwater (watercourses
    and groundwater) used worldwide, which is three times more than 50 years ago.
    During recent droughts, such as those in California (from 2013 to 2015) or Spain,
    continuous water deficits have increased from 15 to 60 months (Lopéz-Moreno et
    al., 2009); these droughts highlight the need for precision irrigation techniques
    to improve water use efficiency so that the resource is applied exactly at the
    right location, time and rate. The possibilities introduced by the use of remote
    sensing include precise water management within a plot. Therefore, different irrigation
    strategies can be followed based on the spatial variability of the soil and crop
    conditions. Because of this variability, the actual water requirements of crops
    may change within the same plot. In this case, the challenge for precision irrigation
    is the development of methodologies to acquire the required information that will
    allow uniform management within demarcated areas in the plots and the validation
    of protocols that enable precise irrigation in various sub-units. Soil moisture
    monitoring through instruments placed in a few locations in a field has been argued
    to have important disadvantages that are primarily related to representativeness
    and the fact that crop water status depends on other factors in addition to soil
    moisture content (Jones, 2004). The water status of plant tissues, which is commonly
    measured in terms of water potential (Jones, 1992), can be used as a precise indicator
    for irrigation scheduling (Jones, 2004). Pressure chambers (Scholander, Hammel,
    Bradstreet, & Hemmingsen, 1965) have been widely employed to measure leaf water
    potential for water deficit determination and irrigation scheduling. Although
    this method is a reliable measure of plant water status, it is highly time consuming
    and labour intensive, which results in inadequate sampling (Cohen, Alchanatis,
    Meron, Saranga, & Tsipris, 2005). Moreover, this method is not feasible for measuring
    the water potential of certain leaf types, such as those of sugar beet. Measurement
    of canopy temperature has been proposed as an alternative method of determining
    water potential (Bellvert et al., 2016). As water stress is induced, the stomata
    close, transpiration rates decrease and evapotranspirative cooling is reduced,
    causing leaf temperatures to increase (Maes & Steppe, 2012). Idso, Jackson, Pinter,
    Reginato, and Hatfield (1981) and Jackson, Idso, Reginato, and Pinter (1981) suggested
    the use of the crop water stress index (CWSI) as an indicator of plant water stress.
    Sensing the canopy temperature using infrared sensors or imaging has shown good
    potential for calculating the CWSI and estimating the plant water status for irrigation
    scheduling in cotton, corn, sunflower, grapevine, and pistachios (Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2006, Payero et al., 2006, Möller et al., 2007, Testi et al., 2008, Taghvaeian
    et al., 2014). Although a non-water-stressed baseline, i.e., a wet reference,
    to calculate the CWSI was reported for sugar beet (Idso, 1982), the upper baseline,
    i.e., a water-stressed baseline or dry reference, contains some uncertainty, with
    most studies assuming a rather arbitrary fixed temperature increment above air
    temperature to represent the temperature of non-transpiring leaves; values approximately
    5 °C above air temperature are often used. Alternatively, the degrees above non-stressed
    (DANS) index, which is a simplified version of the CWSI that is based only on
    the difference between the stressed and non-stressed canopy temperatures, can
    be used (Taghvaeian et al., 2014, DeJonge et al., 2015). However, to the best
    of our knowledge, thermal sensing has not been applied to optimise sugar beet
    irrigation. Sugar beet is considered a highly water-consuming crop (Fabeiro, Martin
    de Santa Olalla, Lopez, & Dominguez, 2003), and its future in drought-prone areas
    with limited water resources could be compromised if crop productivity is not
    maintained under expected reductions in available irrigation water. To attain
    this objective, farmers are obliged to implement precision irrigation tools, such
    as thermal-based crop stress sensing, which may overcome the drawbacks of soil
    moisture and leaf water status monitoring, especially when remotely monitoring
    large areas of crops. The earth-emitted thermal energy is a function of the surface
    temperature (Ts) and the surface emissivity, where emissivity is a material property
    that ranges in value from 0 to 1 (Snyder & Zhengming, 1998). Since remote sensors
    can detect and quantify the heat emitted from the earth, the surface temperature
    can be easily determined. Thermal images captured using micro-unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) have considerable advantages over manual infrared thermometers,
    which require considerable effort and provide limited representation of the whole
    field, and thermal imaging satellite data in which the spatial and temporal resolution
    is not sufficient for most irrigation applications. For small- and medium-sized
    plots, UAVs have a competitive advantage over large, autonomous aerial platforms,
    such as manned aircraft carrying considerable amounts of remote sensing equipment.
    The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of thermal images captured using
    a micro-UAV to predict variations in crop water use due to soil variability and
    irrigation management. This method can subsequently be used as a decision support
    tool for the efficient irrigation management of sugar beet. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Field description and experimental conditions Field tests were conducted
    in a commercial sugar beet field (Beta vulgaris L., ssp. vulgaris var. altissima)
    during the 2014/2015 growing cycle (i.e., from October to July). The field was
    located in Cadiz, SW Spain (Latitude, 36.6965397° N; Longitude, 6.3184375° W).
    The experimental field covered an area of approximately 12 ha and was irrigated
    with a sprinkler system consisting of a triangular arrangement of emitters spaced
    12 m apart along the laterals; the laterals were also spaced 12 m apart. The sprinkler
    wetting radius was approximately 12 m at a working pressure head of 30 m. In southern
    Spain, sugar beet is sown in autumn. In the experimental field, the crop was planted
    in mid-November at a depth of 25 mm with 120 mm between plants and 500 mm between
    plant rows. The climate of the study area is Mediterranean, with rainfall occurring
    normally from late September to May. The average annual reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) and precipitation values calculated for the 2012–2015 period from data recorded
    at a nearby weather station belonging to the Agroclimatic Information Network
    of the Andalusia government (36° 43′ 08″ N, 06° 19′ 48″ W) were 1273 mm and 471
    mm, respectively. Table 1 shows the weather data recorded over the experimental
    growth season (2014–2015). Table 1. Monthly meteorological variables measured

    was characterised by conducting two complementary tests. Soil texture was measured
    based on thirty soil samples collected to a depth of 300 mm using a soil auger.
    Soil analyses were performed in the Centre for Research, Technology and Innovation
    (CITIUS Laboratory) at the University of Seville. Systematic sampling was performed
    by maintaining a fixed distance between two sampling points (using a net or mesh).
    All samples were georeferenced using a differential-global navigation satellite
    system (DGNSS) receiver and geographic information system (FarmWorks, Trimble
    Navigation Ltd., Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and distribution maps of different soil
    properties were compiled using a kriging technique (Goovaerts, 1997). Apparent
    electrical conductivity (ECa) was measured using an EMI Dualem-21S sensor (DUALEM,
    Milton, Canada) operated at a height of 75 mm above the soil surface and sheltered
    in a customised polyvinyl chloride case. The equipment was pulled by an all-terrain
    vehicle (Fig. 1a) and was coupled to a real-time kinematic differential global
    positioning system (Trimble, Sunnyvale, CA) to collect samples over a 12-ha swath
    of the field site. Measurements were collected in parallel swaths from NE to SW
    separated by 10 m with the aid of a guidance system; points within a swath were
    separated by 1–2 m. We also collected samples along 23 NW to SE swaths to increase
    the sample density. The sensor was operated at a fixed frequency of 9 kHz and
    consisted of a transmitter coil at one end and four receiver coils that were separated
    from the transmitter coil by 1, 1.1, 2, and 2.1 m. The receiver coils were oriented
    in a perpendicular (PrP) or horizontal co-planar (HCP) configuration with respect
    to the transmitter coils. Each transmitter–receiver combination provided integrated
    ECa values for the corresponding explored soil volumes; these values depended
    on the exploration depth of each signal. The effective depth of exploration is
    the depth over which an array accumulates 70% of its total sensitivity, which
    also depends strongly on the ECa of the soil (Callegary, Ferre, & Groom, 2007).
    The theoretical exploration depths for the 1.1- and 2.1-m HCP and the 1- and 2-m
    PrP coil combinations were 0.5, 1.0 and 1.6 and 3.2 m, respectively. At high values
    of true conductivity, the sensor has a non-linear response, and ECa is increasingly
    underestimated for a given frequency and intercoil spacing (McNeill, 1980). Beamish
    (2011) proposed a correction procedure involving a least-squares polynomial fitted
    to the theoretical deviation of the linear relationship between LIN-approximated
    ECa and the true conductivity of the coil configurations to allow for the correction
    of the LIN approximation breakdown. This approach was adopted in the present study,
    and the corrected LIN-approximated ECa is used hereafter. The coefficients used
    for the polynomial fitting are available in Delefortrie et al. (2014). The final
    transformation applied to the raw ECa data accounted for the soil temperature
    effects. A reference temperature of 25 °C is typically used (Corwin & Lesch, 2005):
    (1) E C a 25 = E C a [ 0.447 + 1.4034 e − ( T 26.815 ) ] where ECa25 is the standardised
    ECa at a temperature of 25 °C, and T is the soil temperature in °C. To simplify
    the nomenclature, we use ECa as the temperature-corrected ECa (ECa25) reading.
    The average soil temperature at a depth of 0–0.30 m, obtained from 30 samples
    collected across the field, was used. Given the high correlations between signals
    observed in the field (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9 to 0.94), we
    used the 1.1 HCP signal that best represented the rooting depth of the sugar beet
    crop. The FAO has established a range of maximum effective rooting depths for
    sugar beet, i.e., 0.7–1.2 m (Allen, Pereira, Raes, & Smith, 1998). The ECa data
    were filtered to remove spurious errors and were interpolated by means of ordinary
    block kriging on a 2 × 2-m grid to create maps for the four ECa signals using
    the geostatistical analyst in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) (Fig. 1b). We used an
    anisotropic spherical model to fit the variogram with a lag size of 1.5 m, range
    of 75 m, sill of 1663 (mS m−1)2 and 115° as its main direction. A cross validation
    of the interpolation yielded a root mean squared error of 6.5 mS m−1. Download

    and selection of experimental plots The soil texture maps generated using Farm
    Works (Trimble Navigation Ltd.) mapping software (Fig. 1c) showed strong soil
    variability. Two zones of extremely high soil texture variability were identified;
    one with prevailing clayey soil, and the other with sandy soil (Fig. 1c). Within
    each of the selected areas (clayey and sandy zones), two experimental plots (4
    in total) covering an area of approximately 72 m2 (i.e., the area within three
    adjacent sprinklers, with a triangular arrangement of sprinklers) were established.
    The visual confirmation of the ECa maps (Fig. 1b) with the soil texture maps confirmed
    that the selected clayey and sandy zones presented relatively uniform medium and
    low range ECa values, respectively. 2.4. Soil moisture measurement Soil moisture
    was measured in the 0–1000-mm soil profile during the study period using a multi-sensor
    PR-2 profile probe (Delta-T Devices, Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Two epoxy-fibreglass
    access tubes with a rubber-sealing plug were buried in each experimental plot.
    The PR-2 is a polycarbonate rod with six pairs of stainless steel rings at 100,
    200, 300, 400, 600 and 1000 mm, and soil moisture was measured at these depths.
    The PR-2 probe was calibrated for each soil zone (i.e., the selected clayey and
    sandy zones), and the manufacturer''s equation (Qi & Helmers, 2010) was applied
    to convert the permittivity into volumetric soil water content. For the calibration,
    undisturbed soil samples were collected near the access tubes at the end of the
    growing cycle over several days to ensure a broad range of soil moisture conditions.
    Bulk density and volumetric moisture content were determined for each sample.
    The moisture measurements collected using the PR-2 probe and those obtained in
    the laboratory were used to determine the calibration curves for each soil type.
    Once calibrated, the soil moisture measurements in the 0–1000-mm soil profile
    were used to calculate changes in the relative extractable water (REW) for all
    experimental plots using the following expression: (2) R E W = R − R m i n R m
    a x − R min where R is the soil moisture content, and Rmax and Rmin are the soil
    moisture contents at the field capacity and wilting point, respectively. The values
    for Rmax and Rmin were determined using the Rosetta model, which is based on the
    van Genuchten model (Van Genuchten, 1980), and the soil physical properties measured
    in each selected zone (i.e., sand, clay and silt fraction; bulk density). 2.5.
    Thermal imaging and Unmanned aerial vehicle description Thermal images of the
    sugar beet fields were acquired using an uncooled Tau 2324 thermal camera (FLIR
    Systems, Inc., Oregon, USA). The main characteristics of the camera are summarised
    in Table 2. The accuracy of thermal measurements performed using this type of
    camera mounted on a UAV has been reported to be approximately 1K (Berni, Zarco-tejada,
    Suárez, & Fereres, 2009). Table 2. Thermal camera technical data. Empty Cell Camera

    pitch 25 μm The camera was installed in a vertical orientation in the middle of
    the bottom of the UAV, which was a small Phantom 2 multi-rotor copter (SZ DJI
    Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) equipped with a GNSS receiver. The UAV,
    which had a flight duration of 25 min and a remote control range of 1000 m in
    open spaces, was controlled by the DJI iPad Ground Station application. The UAV
    was flown across the experimental field on six clear-sky days over the period
    from day of year (DOY) 86 to DOY 167. The flights, which were performed at solar
    noon, measured surface temperature over the four experimental plots at several
    heights (5 m, 10 m, 20 m, 30 m and 40 m) above the ground level. The flight time
    over the different experimental plots and at several heights did not exceed 30–40
    min in order to minimise the differences in weather conditions during the period
    of measurement. The thermal images were acquired at a rate of 9 frames per second
    and were stored on-board in a raw format with 14-bit radiometric resolution. A
    total number of 50 selected thermal images were analysed during the growth season.
    The thermal images captured by the UAV were used to calculate the mean sugar beet
    temperature of each experimental plot by averaging the temperature of the pure
    vegetation pixels. Pure vegetation pixels were extracted from the thermal image
    using a segmentation algorithm written in R (R Core Team, 2015) and based on a
    histogram analysis of pixels from each thermal image (Fig. 2) and the ‘full width
    at half maximum’ (FWHM) rule. The FWHM rule allows identification of pixels with
    high probability of being pure vegetation, as described elsewhere (Rud et al.,
    2015, Käthner et al., 2017). The assessment of crop water status was based on
    the difference between the average temperature of the vegetation cover and the
    prevailing air temperature at the time of flight (ΔT), measured using the air
    temperature sensor (model HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) installed at the
    nearby weather station (absolute precision of ±0.2 °C). Values of ΔT were also
    used to determine a cumulative integral of the degree of crop water stress throughout
    the irrigation season. The difference between ΔT and the corresponding value for
    a non-stressed canopy provides the difference in canopy temperature, or degree
    of stress, for a specific sampling date. This indicator, DANS, was adapted by
    DeJonge et al. (2015) to integrate the impact of water stress throughout a whole
    day. In this study, an expression analogous to the water stress integral (WSI),
    originally proposed by Myers (1988) for predawn leaf water potential measurements,
    was used to determine the cumulative integral of water stress over the entire
    irrigation season as measured by differences in canopy temperature: (3) W S I
    ( ° C d a y ) = ∑ i = 0 i = t ( Δ T i , i + 1 − c i , i + 1 ) n where t represents
    the number of ΔT measurements (t = 6), in agreement with the number of flights
    conducted; ΔTi,i+1 is the average ΔT for any interval i, i + 1; ci,i+1 is the
    average of the non-water-stressed ΔT values for any period i, i + 1; and n is
    the number of days in the interval. The c values were obtained from the non-water-stressed
    baseline (NWSB) derived by Idso (1982) to calculate the CWSI for sugar beet: (4)
    c i = a + b V P D i where VPDi represents the prevailing vapour pressure deficit
    (kPa) at the time of flight on the ith measurement day, and a and b are two parameters
    obtained empirically for each species under specific environmental conditions.
    The a and b values for sugar beet on sunny days are a 2.50 and −1.92, respectively
    (Idso, 1982). The VPD and air temperature data at a height of 2 m were obtained
    from a nearby weather station belonging to the Agroclimatic Information Network
    of the Andalusia government. Download : Download high-res image (722KB) Download

    W S I = Δ T i − c i Δ T d r y , i − c i where ΔTdry,i represents the maximum ΔT,
    which corresponds to a non-transpiring canopy. In this case study, it was found
    that the sugar beet leaf temperature could reach up to 8 °C above air temperature;
    consequently, a constant ΔTdry,i = 8 °C was used. Similar ΔTdry,i values have
    been found for other herbaceous crop species (Rud et al., 2014). 2.6. Irrigation
    strategy Two experimental plots were established in each of the selected soil
    zones, i.e., the clayey and sandy areas of the experiment. In each soil zone,
    one of the plots was irrigated following the criteria used by local farmers (WW,
    to indicate presumed well-watered conditions), and in the other experimental plot,
    two water stress cycles were imposed by withholding irrigation through nozzle
    blinding of adjacent sprinklers for approximately three weeks per cycle (WS, to
    indicate water-stressed conditions). A recovery period of 24 days was established
    between both water deficit cycles. The irrigation depths applied to the WW and
    WS plots over the entire growing season were 320 mm and 170 mm, respectively.
    The irrigation depth applied during each irrigation event was 30 mm, except for
    one where 20 mm was applied. Irrigation frequencies were determined from the cumulative
    crop water requirements calculated following the FAO-Penman-Monteith method (Allen
    et al., 1998). 2.7. Production Sugar beet yield was evaluated in the four experimental
    plots by manual harvesting six samples per experimental plot at the end of the
    growing season (early July). Fresh root mass (t ha−1), sugar recovery (%) and
    sugar content (t ha−1) were determined for each sample. 2.8. Statistical analyses
    Analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed with the statistical package Statgraphics
    (Statgraphics Centurion XV) was used to compare the components and yield and between
    treatments. The relationships between yield, components and the water stress integral
    were evaluated using linear regression analysis in Statgraphics software. 3. Results
    3.1. Soil moisture The soil moisture dynamics of the four selected plots are shown
    in Fig. 3. The WWSand plot maintained REW values close to one (field capacity)
    throughout the study period. However, the WWClay plot could not maintain field
    capacity conditions throughout the irrigation season, and REW decreased to approximately
    0.6 during the period from DOY 80 to 125, even though the irrigation scheduling
    in both the WWClay and WWSand plots was similar. Download : Download high-res

    REW dynamics in the WSSand and WSClay plots were similar throughout the study
    period, although WSClay exhibited REW values that were consistently 15–20% lower
    than those observed in WSSand (Fig. 3). The restarting of irrigation after the
    first water deficit cycle in the WS treatments did not allow soil moisture values
    to reach those of the WW treatments in any of the study plots. 3.2. Crop temperature
    The crop temperatures determined from thermal imaging for all experimental plots
    at various flight altitudes and on six sampling dates during the irrigation season
    were averaged for each flight altitude to analyse the effect of height (from 5
    to 40 m) on the estimated crop temperature. The mean crop temperatures of the
    four experimental plots averaged across the six flight dates were similar (P >
    0.05) within the 5–40-m height range (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image

    bars indicate the standard error of the mean. The mean crop temperatures at 30
    m were used to calculate the crop-air temperature differences (ΔT) and CWSI for
    each experimental plot throughout the study period (Fig. 5). A comparison of the
    ΔT dynamics derived for WWClay and WWSand showed that WWSand had lower ΔT values
    than WWClay at the beginning of the trial (DOY 85–115) and higher ΔT values from
    DOY 130 onwards (Fig. 5a). In the plots with irrigation deficits (WS), WSSand
    had lower ΔT values than those of WSClay at the beginning of the trial (DOY 85–115),
    but ΔT was consistently higher in WSSand than in WSClay from DOY 115 onwards (Fig.
    5b). A comparison of the WW and WS plots for each soil type revealed that for
    the clay soil, ΔT was only slightly affected by the soil moisture differences
    (Fig. 3) caused by irrigation management. However, in the sandy soil, the ΔT of
    WSSand was substantially higher than that of WWSand from approximately DOY 115
    (onset of the first water–stress cycle; Fig. 3). Similar seasonal trends to those
    described for ΔT were also observed for the CWSI (Fig. 5c and d). The CWSI values
    ranged from 0 to 1 across most of the experimental plots and sampling dates, but
    negative values observed in the sandy plots on one of the sampling days suggest
    that the NWSB from Idso (1982) may not be suitable for the prevailing environmental
    conditions of this study area. Download : Download high-res image (647KB) Download

    sugar beet yield components determined at harvest for all experimental plots.
    Irrigation management had a significant effect on sugar beet yield in both soil
    types, although a more negative impact of water stress was observed in the sandy
    soil. In the clay soil, WSClay showed a significant decrease in fresh root mass
    compared to WWClay, but this reduction was not translated into a sugar content
    reduction since the sugar recovery rate of WSClay was significantly higher than
    that of WWClay. In the sandy soil, both the fresh root mass and sugar content
    were significantly lower in WSSand than in WWSand, while no differences in sugar
    recovery rate were observed in this soil type. The soil type had also a significant
    impact on sugar beet fresh root mass, as indicated by the lower values observed
    in both WWClay and WSClay than in the corresponding sandy plots. The soil type
    had no effect on the sugar content, as similar sugar contents were measured in
    WWClay and WWSand as well as in WSClay and WSSand. Table 3. Sugar beet yield components

    to integrate the cumulative water stress in the experimental plots during the
    measurement period, a WSI was calculated for all plots based on the ΔT measurements
    and an adaptation of the expression originally developed by Myers (1988) to quantify
    the cumulative integral of leaf water potential over any chosen period of time.
    The derived WSI was related to sugar beet yield (both fresh root mass and sugar
    content), as shown in Fig. 6. The fresh root mass and sugar content tended to
    decrease linearly with increasing WSI. However, while the relationship between
    the fresh root mass and WSI was poor (R2 = 0.28), the WSI and sugar content were
    closely related, as shown by the high coefficient of determination of the linear
    regression (R2 = 0.94). Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download :

    evidence of the impact that soil variability may have on crop performance when
    it is not considered as an additional factor of the production system. A uniform
    water supply in a non-uniform sugar beet field with strong soil texture variability
    led to differences in the REW between the clayey and sandy zones that were irrigated
    to satisfy crop water requirements (WWClay and WWSand, respectively) (Fig. 3).
    The marked decrease in REW observed from DOY 80 to 125 in WWClay compared to that
    in WWSand (Fig. 3) indicates the importance of considering soil variability in
    irrigation supply decisions. Although clayey soils may retain more water than
    sandy soils, the soil moisture measured taken in the 0–1000-mm soil profile suggested
    that the plants grown in the WWClay plot extracted more soil water than those
    grown in the WWSand plot from DOY 80 to 125. Although crop growth measurements
    were not performed to support this hypothesis, the fraction of green vegetation
    or canopy cover (i.e., the fraction of ground covered by green vegetation) estimated
    on DOY 86 for both WW plots from the thermal images captured using the micro-UAV
    (Fig. 7) revealed that the plants grown in the WWClay plot had 10% more canopy
    cover than the plants grown in the WWSand plot (see the caption of Fig. 7 for
    details on how plant cover was estimated). The faster canopy development observed
    in the WWClay plants can therefore explain the higher root water uptake observed
    in these plants compared with the WWSand plants. Download : Download high-res

    algorithm based on the FWHM rule was applied. The IR thermal images were captured
    at a flight altitude of 20 m on day of year 86. Estimates of canopy cover were
    90.77% and 80.96% in the WWClay and WWSand plots, respectively. WW indicates well-watered
    conditions. Despite the valuable information provided by soil moisture sensors
    to support irrigation decisions, drawbacks of this technique in terms of acquiring
    accurate and representative soil moisture information have also been reported
    (Jones, 2004). The derivation of crop water stress indices from aerial thermal
    images represents a promising decision support tool to complement soil moisture
    information in irrigation programmes (Bellvert, Zarco-Tejada, Girona, & Fereres,
    2014). The results obtained in this study suggest that during some periods of
    the sugar beet irrigation season, the soil moisture content determined from two
    probes per plot could not reproduce the dynamics of the derived thermal index,
    a surrogate of crop transpiration. This was the case for the plants grown in the
    WSSand plots, which had higher REW values than the WSClay plants (Fig. 3). Moreover,
    the ΔT and CWSI values, which are used as proxies for the mean crop water stress
    (Maes & Steppe, 2012), were also higher in the WSSand than in the WSClay plots
    (Fig. 5) over the two cycles of imposed water stress. Furthermore, the WWClay
    and WWSand plots had similar REW values from DOY 150 onwards, while the corresponding
    mean ΔT and CWSI values were higher in the WWSand plants than in the WWClay plants.
    These findings highlight the differences in crop transpiration between the WW
    plots and suggest that soil moisture data measured in a small number of locations
    may not be reliable enough to represent the mean crop water status of zones with
    uniform soil properties. Poor relationships between canopy temperature-based indices
    and soil moisture deficits are frequently observed (DeJonge et al., 2015) and
    drive the search for remote sensing applications that use the crop as an intermediate
    sensor for quantifying soil water availability (Zhang, Clarke, Steven, & Jaggard,
    2011). Thermal indices derived from satellites and airborne observation platforms
    flying at high altitudes require complex post-processing to correct for parameters
    such as atmospheric transmissivity (Berni et al., 2009), which decreases with
    relative humidity, temperature and distance from the object (Sugiura, Noguchi,
    & Ishii, 2007). In arid and semi-arid regions, relatively stable atmospheric conditions
    prevail when thermal measurements are conducted at the same time of day under
    clear-sky conditions and during the months of high evaporative demand (irrigation
    season). This implies that thermal errors caused by variations in atmospheric
    transmissivity during low-altitude flights may be related to camera error. We
    assessed this possibility and found no significant differences in the mean crop
    temperature at flight altitudes of 0–40 m (P = 0.9773) (Fig. 4). WSI values calculated
    from other non-thermal plant-based water stress indicators (e.g., predawn leaf
    water potential or stem water potential) and for different crop species showed
    great potential to predict yield losses due to water stress (Ginestar and Castel,
    1996, Egea et al., 2013). The close relationship observed between sugar production
    and the temperature-based WSI (Fig. 6) indicates that T-based WSI was sensitive
    enough to capture the impacts of both soil heterogeneity and irrigation management
    on sugar production, thereby confirming the reliability of the method described
    in this work for monitoring the cumulative water stress in sugar beet fields.
    From an irrigation scheduling perspective, use of CWSI as a crop water stress
    indicator for sugar beet requires further experimentation. Although this index
    is a sensitive indicator that is able to capture the differences between plants
    grown in sandy or clay soils and between well-watered plants and those subjected
    to intentional water shortages, aspects such as the derivation of a wet reference
    baseline adapted to Mediterranean conditions and local cultivars and the definition
    of threshold values for irrigation management based on relationships with other
    plant physiological variables (e.g., leaf gas exchange variables) need to be determined.
    5. Conclusions The results of this study yielded two clear conclusions. First,
    the canopy-air temperature differences and the CWSI values determined from thermal
    images captured using a micro-UAV were sensitive enough to identify variations
    in crop water use resulting from different irrigation management strategies or
    the natural variability of soil properties. Second, the dynamics of the soil moisture
    content determined from a limited number of sampling points (two probes per plot
    in this study) failed to adequately represent the variation in crop water use,
    as estimated from the thermal indices derived. This study presents a reliable
    method to monitor the spatio-temporal variations of crop water use in sugar beet
    fields, although further research is required to transform this information into
    optimal recommendations for sugar beet irrigation requirements. A temperature-based
    WSI was demonstrated to be a good predictor of the sugar content at harvest under
    both soil variability and irrigation management. Acknowledgements Financial support

    \ applied to plant\nstress research in Europe.\nAbstract: In the last few years,\
    \ large efforts have been made to develop new methods to optimize\nstress detection\
    \ in crop ﬁelds. Thus, plant phenotyping based on imaging techniques has become\
    \ an\nessential tool in agriculture. In particular, leaf temperature is a valuable\
    \ indicator of the physiological\nstatus of plants, responding to both biotic\
    \ and abiotic stressors. Often combined with other imaging\nsensors and data-mining\
    \ techniques, thermography is crucial in the implementation of a more\nautomatized,\
    \ precise and sustainable agriculture. However, thermal data need some corrections\n\
    related to the environmental and measuring conditions in order to achieve a correct\
    \ interpretation of\nthe data. This review focuses on the state of the art of\
    \ thermography applied to the detection of biotic\nstress. The work will also\
    \ revise the most important abiotic stress factors affecting the measurements\n\
    as well as practical issues that need to be considered in order to implement this\
    \ technique, particularly\nat the ﬁeld scale.\nKeywords: Remote sensing; proximal\
    \ sensing; thermography; plant phenotyping\n1. Introduction\nEnvironmental conditions\
    \ driven by climate change and infections are great challenges\nthat need to be\
    \ overcome by modern agriculture. The economic loss in agriculture caused by\n\
    increasing environmental pressures could reach an annual 0.3% to 0.8% of projected\
    \ global\ngross domestic product by the end of the century [1]. Moreover, plant\
    \ diseases are the main\ncause of the drop in production and economic losses in\
    \ agriculture worldwide, reaching\nyield losses of 20 to 30% depending on the\
    \ crop [2]. Current practices and social activities\n-such as intensiﬁed monoculture\
    \ in large areas, the use of genetically uniform plant varieties\nand the development\
    \ of global supply chains and logistic activities- contribute largely to\nthe\
    \ widespread of plant disease epidemics and rapid pathogen evolution [3].\nPlant\
    \ phenotyping based on imaging techniques is a pertinent approach to quantify\n\
    the appearance and performance of crops under different environmental conditions\
    \ while\naddressing the spatial heterogeneity of crop ﬁelds. Therefore, plant\
    \ phenotyping, applied\nto precision agriculture, is a valuable tool for the diagnosis\
    \ and detection of plant stress,\neven in the absence of symptoms. Optical sensors\
    \ have been used to study (a) the response\nof plants to pathogens, pests and\
    \ abiotic stressors; (b) to identify primary disease foci; (c) to\nmonitor resistance\
    \ or susceptibility of different plant genotypes to speciﬁc stress factors;\n\
    (d) to evaluate the severity of symptoms; (e) and to assess plant biomass and\
    \ yield [4].\nStomatal activity is one of the most important physiological traits\
    \ for plant growth\nand development. It plays a crucial role in the carbon and\
    \ water balance by controlling\nphotosynthesis and transpiration [5]. Hence, stomatal\
    \ conductance to water (gs) is related\nto yield and to the tolerance of environmental\
    \ stresses [6] and correlates strongly with leaf\ntemperature [7–9]. Thermal long-wave\
    \ infrared (TIR) cameras (or simply thermal cameras)\nare calibrated sensors able\
    \ to record emitted radiation in the thermal range (8–14 µm)\nRemote Sens. 2021,\

    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n2 of 21\nand provide images representing temperature\
    \ values per pixel. Thus, conventional, time-\nconsuming ground-based gs measurements\
    \ can be feasibly replaced by thermal images\nevaluating plant physiological status\
    \ at different scales in short periods of time [10,11]. Ad-\nditionally, highly\
    \ sensitive thermal cameras with a relatively simple operational procedure\nhave\
    \ become more available to research groups, at a lower cost and at higher spatial\
    \ reso-\nlution [12,13]. Moreover, TIR imaging is a very valuable method of stress\
    \ detection prior to\nthe appearance of symptoms since it operates out of the\
    \ visual range of the spectrum [14].\nHowever, some considerations must be taken\
    \ when interpreting thermograms in terms\nof gs since plant surface temperature\
    \ is mainly driven by environmental factors such as\nair temperature and relative\
    \ humidity. Even though high-end thermal cameras carry out\ncorrections for these\
    \ two parameters, there are other factors affecting canopy temperatures,\nsuch\
    \ as wind speed and light intensity, as well as by plant features, ranging from\
    \ leaf size\nor angle to canopy structure. A number of corrections for these factors\
    \ can be found in\nthe literature as TIR stress indices (Table 1). Some of these\
    \ parameters have been found\nto correlate with physiological traits related to\
    \ the water balance status of plants (Table 2).\nThe most common TIR parameters\
    \ are:\n1.\nNormalized canopy or leaf temperature with reference to air temperature\
    \ (∆T), uti-\nlized as an index of crop water status. The applications of ∆T was\
    \ recently reviewed\nby Still et al. [15];\n2.\nCrop water stress index (CSWI),\
    \ which introduces two baselines: (Tcanopy − Tair)wet\nas the estimated difference\
    \ for a well-watered plant, and (Tcanopy − Tair)dry for a\ndry (non-transpiring)\
    \ plant. CWSI is one of the most commonly used normalization\nmethods for TIR\
    \ measurements, which overcomes the effects of other environmental\nparameters\
    \ affecting plant temperature [16,17];\n3.\nIndex of stomatal conductance (IG),\
    \ since it is directly proportional to this parame-\nter [18];\n4.\nMaximum temperature\
    \ difference (MTD), calculated for every leaf or sample [19].\nThis parameter\
    \ has only been correlated with the severity of symptoms for several\ndiseases,\
    \ as reviewed in [20,21];\n5.\nNormalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT),\
    \ based on the maximum and the\nminimum temperature measured in the whole ﬁeld\
    \ trial. This parameter has been\nfound to be a valid estimation of the crop water\
    \ status [22];\n6.\nAverage canopy temperature (Tav), based on maximum and minimum\
    \ values of\ntemperature, was one of the ﬁrst parameters used by the conventional\
    \ infrared\nthermography [23,24]. However, this parameter can excessively simplify\
    \ outcome\ndata, and some important thermal information can be lost. Estimated\
    \ shape factors\nderived by ﬁtting the whole temperature data of the thermal images\
    \ to the Weibull\ndistribution could solve this constraint [25].\nTable 1. Most\

    \ this technique per se\nhas a very limited capacity for diagnosis. Indeed, temperature\
    \ raises may be due to\nstomatal closure, which is on its own an unspeciﬁc mechanism\
    \ of plant defense against\nboth abiotic and biotic stressors. Even more, temperature\
    \ raises can also respond to a\ndecreased capacity for water evaporation or even\
    \ to the loss of vegetation [10]. In contrast,\nsome stresses can cause temporary\
    \ decreases in leaf temperature. That would be the case\nof some pathogens that\
    \ can interfere in the regulation of stomatal movements to favor\ntheir entry\
    \ to the mesophyll [68]. As a consequence, alterations in TIR parameters stand\n\
    as ambiguous clues for diagnosis. Moreover, abiotic stress factors (mostly drought,\
    \ soil\nsalinity or extreme ambient temperature) also cause increases in canopy\
    \ temperature.\nThis is most important under natural conditions, where abiotic\
    \ stressors are difﬁcult to\nassess and avoid. Keeping in mind that under such\
    \ conditions, several stress factors often\naffect the vegetation simultaneously,\
    \ possible misinterpretations of TIR data would lead to\ninaccurate determination\
    \ of the incidence and severity of a particular pathogen infection\nor even to\
    \ a wrong diagnosis.\nTo overcome the restraints of thermography as a diagnostic\
    \ technique, authors have\nincreasingly applied it in combination with other imaging\
    \ techniques. Roitsch et al. [69]\nand Sperschneider [70] reviewed the implementation\
    \ of TIR cameras with other sensors,\nsuch as RGB, multi- or hyperspectral cameras,\
    \ in phenotyping platforms. The identiﬁcation\nof spatial and temporal patterns\
    \ of TIR parameters in combination with other relevant\nvegetation indices (VIs)\
    \ could be of great help to establish robust methods for the early di-\nRemote\

    \ of a given plant-stressor interaction\nis desirable to obtain a stress-speciﬁc\
    \ signature [20].\nThe use of complementary imaging techniques provides valuable\
    \ and very complex\ninformation. This complexity is caused by the increasing number\
    \ of dimensions that can\nbe considered and the incessant improvements in their\
    \ spatial and temporal resolution.\nTo enhance our capacity for data analysis,\
    \ most recent works have included data-mining\nin their analysis. This multidisciplinary\
    \ approach, based on probability theory, statistics,\ndecision theory, visualization\
    \ and optimization, outperforms more conventional statistical\nanalysis in terms\
    \ of ﬁnding patterns in data [71,72]. Classiﬁers are algorithms able to learn\n\
    patterns from a database of known samples and, based on that knowledge, to identify\
    \ or\ncategorize new samples [73]. When applied to agriculture, this approach\
    \ facilitates the\ninterpretation of data and the decision-making process to such\
    \ an extent that no study\nappears to be complete without this type of analysis.\n\
    Thermography is extensively used for stress detection from lab to ﬁeld scale by\
    \ either\nproximal or remote sensing (Figure 1). On one hand, proximal sensing\

    \ plants. Attending to this need, this review will\nrevise the most relevant applications\

    \ with a collection of host plant–pathogen systems described in\nthe literature\
    \ in terms of thermal response and the mechanisms of plant defense involved.\n\
    Furthermore, a state-of-art review on the detection of abiotic stress by thermography\

    \ Different Scales\nStomata are the main natural entry of pathogens into the plant\
    \ tissues. Hence, the regu-\nlation of the stomatal movements plays a key role\
    \ in plant defense against microbes [86]. The\nrecognition of a potential pathogen\
    \ by plants usually triggers stomatal closure; to counteract\nthis defense response,\
    \ some pathogens are able to override the plant signaling pathways to\nactivate\
    \ stomatal aperture [87]. Other effects of pathogen infection include disturbances\
    \ on\nleaf development, cell wall and leaf cuticle composition or integrity, alterations\
    \ in the plant\nmetabolism or even necrosis of the tissues. These physical and\
    \ chemical disturbances affect\nthe plant water status, which can be monitored\
    \ by thermography [88–90].\n2.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    2.1.1. Viral Infections\nEven when some virosis cause alterations neither in gs\
    \ nor in leaf temperature [91],\nthermography is very often helpful in tracking\
    \ viral infections on plants. Most of those\nworks report temperature increases\
    \ between +0.5 and +1.5 K; on the contrary, some works\nreported decreases in\
    \ leaf temperature of −0.5 K relative to mock-controls. Hypersensi-\ntive response\
    \ (HR) to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) could be visualized as spots of elevated\n\
    temperature before any disease symptoms became visible on tobacco leaves. Those\
    \ spots\nwere conﬁned to the site of infection as a result of the HR triggered\
    \ by salicylic acid. On\nthe other hand, no thermal response was observed on susceptible\
    \ tobacco-TMV-infected\nplants [92]. In the case of Pepper middle mottle virus\
    \ (PMMoV)-Nicotiana benthamiana plants,\nvirus spreading through asymptomatic\
    \ leaves could be ﬁrst detected by an increase in\ntemperature on the tissues\
    \ around the main veins. This effect extended to adjacent tissues\nbefore the\
    \ spreading of the virus across the midrib of the leaf, as shown by immunolocaliza-\n\
    tion. Interestingly, the thermal symptoms caused by the most severe strain of\
    \ PMMoV were\ndetected before those caused by the less virulent one [93]. Among\
    \ other tobamoviruses,\nCucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Cucumber green mottle\
    \ mosaic virus (CGMMV) have a\nparticular impact on cucumber production. Plants\
    \ infected with CMV displayed homoge-\nneously higher temperature in the whole\
    \ inoculated leaf relative to the controls, whereas\nleaves of CGMMV-infected\
    \ cucumber plants showed a heterogeneous temperature pattern,\nconsisting of cold\
    \ spots at the infection sites. However, none of those changes was de-\ntectable\
    \ presymptomatically. Nevertheless, classiﬁcatory algorithms could early detect\
    \ the\ninfection caused by each pathogen when combining data obtained by TIR,\
    \ ﬂuorescence and\nhyperspectral imaging [94]. Another virus of agricultural interest\
    \ is the Sweet potato feathery\nmottle virus, which is the most widespread virus\
    \ that infects sweet potato plants, causing\ndevastating problems when co-infecting\
    \ with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus. Higher leaf\ntemperatures were associated\
    \ with more severe symptoms; thus, plants co-infected with\nboth viruses displayed\
    \ higher temperatures than single virus-infected plants [95].\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68\n6 of 21\n2.1.2. Bacterial Infections\nIn the case of bacterial-infected\
    \ plants, literature reports temperature changes relative\nto the controls ranging\
    \ between −3.3 K and +3 K. The tumor caused by Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens in the\
    \ hypocotyl of castor oil plant produces irreversible disruption of the plant\n\
    epidermis and hence, the tumor lacks a protective cuticle against water loss.\
    \ Moreover,\nstomata located at the tumor edge are hypertrophied and non-functional;\
    \ as a consequence,\nthe tumor surface was the coldest part of the plant [96].\
    \ Some works have studied the\nrole of plant defense elicitors produced by bacterial\
    \ pathogens. That is the case of the\nproteinaceous harpin synthesized by the\
    \ bacterium Erwinia amylovora. When inﬁltrated\nin the leaves of Nicotiana sylvestris\
    \ wild plants, harpin induced a marked presymptomatic\ncooling at the inoculation\
    \ sites, followed by an increase of temperature during the HR [97].\nThe same\
    \ trend was described for spots of bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae\n\
    pv. actinidiae on kiwifruit leaves [98]. The decrease in temperature localized\
    \ at the infection\nsites could be related to bacterial virulence factors that\
    \ actively open the stomata by\ninterfering with hormonal signaling pathways leading\
    \ to stomatal closure [99]. On the\nother hand, it is well known that recognition\
    \ of some pathogen-associated molecular\npatterns triggers stomatal closure to\
    \ impede bacterial entrance through these natural\napertures [68]. In bean plants,\
    \ P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 induces an HR, whereas\nP. syringae pv. phaseolicola\
    \ 1448A produces systemic infection. First symptoms are evident\nafter 10 h and\
    \ 2 days post-infection, respectively. Thermography could presymptomatically\n\
    reveal those bacterial challenges as an increase of temperature of the inoculated\
    \ areas at 1\nand 2 h post-infection in the case of HR and systemic infection,\
    \ respectively [100].\nSeveral works have addressed the effect of the Dickeya\
    \ dadantii infection on plant tran-\nspiration by thermography. This bacterium\
    \ usually produces soft-rot, a characteristic tissue\nmaceration, as in the case\
    \ of N. benthamiana infected at high inoculum dose. After mechani-\ncal inﬁltration,\
    \ the temperature of the affected areas raised presymptomatically, linked to\n\
    an increase in hormones controlling stomatal closure. In subsequent days, the\
    \ temperature\ncontinued rising, affecting the whole leaf. However, N. benthamiana\
    \ can activate an efﬁcient\ndefense response against D. dadantii when the plant\
    \ is inoculated at doses resembling the\nnatural infection. In this case, after\
    \ an initial increase in temperature of the inﬁltrated\narea, infected plants\
    \ could recover, and temperature subsequently decreased [101]. Inde-\npendently\
    \ of the inoculum dose, D. dadantii does not cause tissue maceration on melon\n\
    leaves. It produces brownish spots at the inoculation sites that evolve chlorosis\
    \ in the\nsurrounding tissues in successive days; those symptoms appeared earlier\
    \ when high dose\nconcentrations were applied. Only inﬁltrated areas shown increased\
    \ temperatures at the\nbeginning of the infection process when inoculated at a\
    \ low dose; the whole leaf ﬁnally\ndisplaying higher temperature respecting to\
    \ the controls. However, when a high inoculum\ndose was applied, the whole melon\
    \ leaf displayed a higher temperature [102]. The whole\nleaf of another cucurbit,\
    \ such as zucchini, displayed higher temperature relative to the\ncontrols when\
    \ inoculated with D. dadantii, whereas visual symptoms (different degrees\nof\
    \ chlorosis proportional to the inoculated dose) were circumscribed to the inﬁltrated\n\
    spots [103,104]. Features extracted from TIR and multicolor ﬂuorescence images\
    \ were used\nto feed algorithms, which provided a good performance of classiﬁcation\
    \ of plants into\ncategories of infected and controls in both melon and zucchini\
    \ plants [102–104].\n2.1.3. Interactions with Pathogenic Fungi and Oomycetes\n\
    Thermography has been widely used to assess the effect of fungi and oomycetes\
    \ on\nhost plant transpiration. Depending on how these pathogens interact with\
    \ host plants,\ninitial phases of pathogenesis can induce increases or decreases\
    \ in leaf temperatures\naffecting only the inoculation sites or wholes leaves.\
    \ Subsequent symptoms development\nmay cause transitory drops in temperature as\
    \ the affected cells die and lose water. Later\ninfection phases usually lead\
    \ to an increase in temperature due to the lack of natural\ncooling of the necrotic\
    \ tissues. Concerning healthy areas, it is possible to ﬁnd in the cited\nliterature\
    \ that biotrophic fungi and oomycetes can cause temperature decreases ranging\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n7 of 21\nfrom −0.1 to −2.5 K, whereas increases have\
    \ been registered from +0.6 to +2 K. For their\npart, hemibiotrophic pathogens\
    \ can decrease leaf temperature between −0.6 and −2.2 K, or\ncontrary, increase\
    \ it in +0.4 to +7.5 K. Finally, it is possible to register temperatures decreases\n\
    between −2 and −5 K and increases ranging from +0.3 to +9 K when necrotrophic\
    \ fungi\nare studied by TIR imaging.\nConcerning infections caused by biotrophic\
    \ fungi leaves from wheat plants infected\nwith Blumeria graminis or Puccinia\
    \ striiformis (fungi causing powdery mildew and stripe\nrust, respectively) displayed\
    \ low temperatures due to the very low resistance to water\nevaporation of growing\
    \ mycelia [105,106]. The phytopathogens Pseudoperonospora cubensis\nand Podosphaera\
    \ xanthii are the causal agents of cucumber downy mildew and cucurbits\npowdery\
    \ mildew, respectively. In cucumber leaves, these pathogens produce infective\n\
    spots with lower temperatures than the surrounding healthy areas due to an abnormal\n\
    stomatal opening. In the case of P. xanthii infection, the thermographic detection\
    \ was\nnot presymptomatic, whereas disease caused by P. cubensis could be revealed\
    \ one day\nbefore the appearance of symptoms. Under laboratory conditions, the\
    \ MTD increased\nduring both pathogenesis and was related to disease severity\
    \ [19,94,107,108]. Despite\nbeing a biotrophic oomycete, P. cubensis also produces\
    \ necrosis in the latest infection phase\nassociated with an increase in cucumber\
    \ leaf temperature [19,108]. Leaves of rose infected\nwith the fungus Podosphaera\
    \ pannosa var. rosae (causal agent of powdery mildew in roses)\nshowed a presymptomatic\
    \ decrease in temperature. Furthermore, two algorithms were\ntrained on features\
    \ extracted from TIR images, obtaining high accuracy in classifying\nhealthy and\
    \ infected plants [109]. Raza et al. [110] also used information extracted from\
    \ TIR\nand RGB pictures to automatically detect tomato plants infected with Oidium\
    \ neolycopersici\nin a presymptomatic way, but the work did not address the physiological\
    \ changes caused\nby the fungus.\nRegarding hemibiotrophic fungi, TIR imaging\
    \ could describe the severity of the\ninfection, which could be related to the\
    \ disease stages but also to the host plant resistance\nto the pathogen. Thus,\
    \ Oerke et al. [111] and Belin et al. [112] analyzed apple trees\nsuffering from\
    \ apple scab. In that case, the detection of infection, as well as differences\n\
    in the virulence of several Venturia inaequalis isolates infecting apple trees,\
    \ were detected\nmore accurately by thermography than by chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\
    \ imaging. The thermal\nresponse was presymptomatic and consisted of spots of\
    \ decreased temperature due to\nthe subcuticular growth of V. inaequalis. A soilborne\
    \ fungus, Rhizoctonia solani, induces\nnecrosis in lettuce plants, which could\
    \ be visualized as an increase in leaf temperature\nand MTD [113]. The damage\
    \ produced by another soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum,\nto whole cucumber\
    \ leaves could be detected as a presymptomatic raise in temperature\ninduced by\
    \ abscisic acid, followed by a slight decrease as wilt symptoms developed. Finally,\n\
    the temperature of whole leaves presenting necrosis increased again [114]. On\
    \ the contrary,\npea plants infected with this fungus showed an early and slight\
    \ reduction of temperature\ncompared to the control plants. At an advanced stage\
    \ of the infection, the leaf temperature\nincreased above control levels in the\
    \ case of susceptible plants, whereas the temperature of\nthose showing F. oxysporum-resistance\
    \ remained similar to the controls [115].\nIn the case of infections caused by\
    \ necrotrophic fungi, sugar beet plants inoculated\nwith Cercospora beticola (causal\
    \ agent of Cercospora leaf spot) displayed spots of presymp-\ntomatic low temperature\
    \ corresponding to the infection sites. Cold spots appeared pro-\ngressively until\
    \ covering the whole leaf surface, whereas lesions were hardly visible by\nthe\
    \ naked eye. Toxins inﬂuencing cell membrane permeability and produced by C. beticola\n\
    could account for this temperature decrease [92]. Aspergillus carbonarius is a\
    \ fungus causing\nsour rot of grape berries and produces ochratoxin-As, toxic\
    \ for humans. Mycelium growth\nareas showed low temperatures that identiﬁed affected\
    \ fruit sites at the very early-stages of\nA. carbonarius infection [25]. Thermography\
    \ also revealed that Alternaria alternata, A. bras-\nsicae and A. brassicicola\
    \ caused a decrease of temperature during the ﬁrst seven days of\ninfection on\
    \ oilseed rape leaves, followed by a temperature increase in successive days.\n\
    However, those plants inoculated with A. dauci only developed increases of mean\
    \ tem-\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n8 of 21\nperature at 21 days after inoculation\
    \ [116]. The infection with Botrytis cinerea (gray mold)\non bean plants caused\
    \ a presymptomatic increase of temperature at the infection sites. In\nsubsequent\
    \ days, leaves developed hot brownish necrotic lesions surrounded by a lower\n\
    temperature area [117]. Contrary, B. cinerea–infected roses ﬁrst showed a decrease\
    \ of tem-\nperature at regions where lesions were initially formed, followed by\
    \ a rise in temperature\nonce necrosis occurred [109]. Rosellinia necatrix (soilborne\
    \ fungus causing white root rot) is\none of the most important constraints to\
    \ production for a wide range of woody crops such\nas avocado. In the late phases\
    \ of R. necatrix infection, trees undergo a water deﬁcit in the\naerial part due\
    \ to failure of the root system [118]. As a result, infected plants experienced\
    \ a\nsigniﬁcant increase in leaf temperature from the early symptomatic stage\
    \ onwards [119].\nFurthermore, infected avocado trees in an orchard could be detected\
    \ by thermography (see\nSection 2.2) [120].\n2.1.4. Herbivory and Parasitic Plants\n\
    Herbivore insects disrupt the integrity of leaves, leading to uncontrolled water\
    \ loss\nfrom wounds and triggering intricate processes that affect gas exchange\
    \ also in the re-\nmaining leaf tissue. Thus, it is possible to ﬁnd temperature\
    \ drops from −0.3 to −3 K\nin the literature. TIR images of soybean leaﬂets affected\
    \ by corn earworm caterpillars\n(Helicoverpa zea) showed that leaf areas adjacent\
    \ to wounds were cooler than distant regions\nor sister leaﬂets [121]. The same\
    \ leaf temperature pattern was visible after injuries caused\nby cabbage looper\
    \ (Trichoplusia ni) instars on Arabidopsis [122], tobacco hornworm (Man-\nduca\
    \ sexta) on Nicotiana attenuata [123], or larval gypsy moth (Lymantria dyspar)\
    \ and gall\ndamage produced by midge ﬂies (Harmandia sp.) on aspen leaves [124].\
    \ When elevated\nCO2 was applied to the atmosphere, the cooling effect of gall\
    \ formation on remaining leaf\ntissue was reduced [124].\nThermography was also\
    \ useful in the detection of plants infested by parasites, reveal-\ning temperature\
    \ increases (from +0.4 to +0.9 K) due to a reduction in the plant water uptake\n\
    by affected roots. Examples of these interactions are the nematode Heterodera\
    \ schachtii\nwith susceptible sugar beet cultivars [125], as well as the obligatory\
    \ root parasitic plant\nOrobanche cumana (broomrape) and sunﬂower [126]. The early\
    \ detection of broomrape\nby nondestructive techniques was unprecedented since\
    \ natural infestation causes subtle\nalterations on host physiology and proceeds\
    \ unnoticed until the emergence of the ﬂoral\nshoots, by the time of sunﬂower\
    \ bloom.\n2.2. Remote Sensing on Crop Fields\nIn crop ﬁelds, thermography has\
    \ facilitated the detailed analysis of crop ﬁelds affected\nby pathogens, helping\
    \ in the localization of areas where plants are infected and requiring\nurgent\
    \ intervention [127]. In general, pathogen-infected plants show changes in their\n\
    temperature of -2 K to +3.1 K, relative to the temperature of healthy plants;\
    \ however, it is\nworth noticing that these values should be handled with care\
    \ depending on the sensitivity\nand the accuracy of the used TIR cameras. The\
    \ identiﬁcation of potentially infected plants\nusing classiﬁers provides accuracies\
    \ ranging between 59 and 89%, depending on the\napplied algorithm and parameters\
    \ used to feed it.\nIn sugar beet, canopy temperature correlated signiﬁcantly\
    \ with the density of the\nnematode parasite H. schachtii in the case of a susceptible\
    \ cultivar, whereas no correlation\ncould be found for the resistant one [128].\
    \ P. syringae pv. actinidiae infection in kiwifruit\norchards was assessed by\
    \ TIR maps based on canopy temperature. Images revealed\nthat infected trees were\
    \ signiﬁcantly warmer than the healthy ones, being localized in\nthe outer canes\
    \ of the canopy [98]. Temperature increases measured on pines infected\nwith Dothistroma\
    \ septosporum (causal agent of red band needle blight) and on winter wheat\ninfected\
    \ with Zymoseptoria tritici (causing septoria leaf blotch) could be positively\
    \ correlated\nto the damages caused by these hemibiotrophic fungi [90,129]. Necrotic\
    \ spots on leaves\nfrom three woody trees (oriental cherry, Japanese cornel and\
    \ sawtooth oak) caused by three\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n9 of 21\nfungi (Mycosphaerella\
    \ cerasella, Elsinoe corni and Tubakia dryina, respectively) can also be\ndetected\
    \ as dots with higher temperatures relative to healthy areas [130].\nThe fusion\
    \ of thermography with other imaging techniques such as multi- or hyper-\nspectral\
    \ reﬂectance or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging cameras is very often an adequate\n\
    approach for stress detection. The combination with chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging\
    \ al-\nlowed monitoring several constraints (fungal infection, galls and chewing\
    \ damages caused\nby arthropods) in understory hardwood saplings. Thus, changes\
    \ in transpiration could be\nrelated to photosynthesis impairment in affected\
    \ trees [131]. However, the combination\nof TIR imaging with multi- or hyper-spectroscopy\
    \ reﬂectance is more feasible since both\ntechniques are based on passive measurements.\
    \ Moreover, it is possible to obtain multi-\nple reﬂectance VIs that could correlate\
    \ with physiological parameters. Furthermore, VIs,\ntogether with temperature\
    \ derived parameters, could be implemented on algorithms to\nclassify plants into\
    \ categories of interest in the earliest stages of infection. That was the\ncase\
    \ of important bacterial diseases causing a high impact on both agriculture and\
    \ the envi-\nronment, such as citrus greening or Huanglongbing in citrus trees\
    \ [132], or Xylella fastidiosa,\na quarantine pathogen in olive orchards [133].\n\
    In the case of diseases caused by foliar fungal pathogens, the joint use of thermography\n\
    and reﬂectance made it possible to discriminate between severity levels. That\
    \ was the\ncase of red leaf blotch (caused by Polystigma amygdalinum) in almond\
    \ trees [134] and also\nearly and late leaf spot diseases (caused by Passalora\
    \ arachidicola S. Hori and Cercosporidium\npersonatum, respectively) on peanut\
    \ trees [135]. Minimum temperature corrected by air\ntemperature showed a negative\
    \ correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI) in opium\
    \ poppy orchards infected by the oomycete Peronospora arborescens (causal\nagent\
    \ of downy mildew) [136]. Furthermore, a strong relationship between yield, several\n\
    VIs and canopy temperature was observed in maize plants suffering tar spot complex\n\
    (caused by Phyllachora maydis and Monographella maydis) [137], as well as in chickpea\n\
    infected with Ascochyta rabiei (causing Ascochyta blight disease) [138].\n∆T correlated\
    \ with disease severity caused by soilborne fungal pathogens, such as\nVerticillium\
    \ dahliae (causal agent of Verticillium wilt) in olive trees or R. necatrix in\
    \ avocado\ntrees. Moreover, classifying algorithms applied to the data obtained\
    \ by spectral and TIR\nimaging could identify affected trees with high accuracy\
    \ [120,139,140].\n3. Assessing of Plant Abiotic Stress by Thermography\nIn natural\
    \ environments, abiotic stress conditions often concur with biotic stresses,\n\
    making their evaluation difﬁcult. For this reason, it is important to understand\
    \ how abiotic\nconditions can affect vegetation. The successive sections will\
    \ review how thermography\nhas been applied to monitor crop water stress, salinity,\
    \ nutrient availability, and application\nof herbicides, among others, at proximal\
    \ and remote scales.\n3.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    Drought, which importance emerges from the damage caused and its extent, is con-\n\
    sequently one of the main abiotic stresses monitored by TIR imaging to help farmers\
    \ to\nestablish precise water management and scheduling [141]. Most of the studies\
    \ related to\ndrought stress have been conducted in crop ﬁelds, but it is possible\
    \ to ﬁnd some works\ncarried out on plants grown under controlled conditions (Table\
    \ 2). Furthermore, salinity\nis essentially water stress that results from the\
    \ osmotic effect of ions in the soil solution,\nreducing the water availability\
    \ for plants. In addition, ions can accumulate in plant leaves\nup to toxic concentrations\
    \ [142]. Thus, TIR imaging provides an opportunity to screen\nfor salinity tolerance\
    \ traits in a reliable, quantitative and efﬁcient manner. The effects of\ndifferent\
    \ abiotic stress factors on leaf temperature at proximal sensing are summarized\
    \ in\nTable 3. The increase in temperature registered in these works for infected\
    \ plants ranges\nfrom +1.5 to +6 K.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n10 of 21\nTable\

    \ +0.7 to +7 K between healthy and stressed\nplants have been reported in the\
    \ literature at a remote sensing scale. These alterations in\ncanopy temperature\
    \ allowed stress detection with accuracies up to 75% using classiﬁcatory\nalgorithms\
    \ based on TIR stress indices.\nVineyards under different water regimes are proposed\
    \ as an exemplary study model\nthanks to the geometry of orchards. Moreover, climate\
    \ change threatens the most important\nwine-producer countries worldwide, which\
    \ will suffer increased frequency and severity\nof drought periods. On the contrary,\
    \ ﬁne-tuning irrigation management during the grow-\ning season leads to a slight-to-moderate\
    \ water deﬁcit, which stimulates optimal grape\nquality without signiﬁcantly compromising\
    \ yield [47]. Many authors have monitored\nphysiological parameters related to\
    \ water balance by handheld devices and correlated\nthem with stress indices extracted\
    \ from TIR images (Table 2). They found that TIR imaging\ncan distinguish between\
    \ irrigated and non-irrigated canopies and even between different\ndeﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments. However, the relationship between TIR stress indices and\nphysiological\
    \ parameters was found to be stable throughout the season in some cases [47]\n\
    or, on the contrary, affected by the phenological stage or the varieties [49,158].\
    \ All these\nworks have used TIR ground-based cameras positioned (lateral or nadir)\
    \ or implemented\non UAVs. However, it is also possible to use TIR images from\
    \ Landsat-5 for irrigation\nmanagement purposes [159].\nAs the water demand for\
    \ agriculture is steadily increasing, exploring indices obtained\nby thermography\
    \ to evaluate drought stress in other crops different from vineyards also\nhas\
    \ been extensively addressed (Table 2). The efﬁciency of the VI named photochemical\n\
    reﬂectance index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress was evaluated by TIR imaging\
    \ in\nolive and peach orchards under different water regimes. It was found that\
    \ PRI showed a\nhigher correlation with ∆T and gs than other vegetation indices\
    \ [30,160]. Regarding the\nmonitoring of water regimes in crops using satellite\
    \ images, thermal images taken with\nASTER could distinguish between rain-fed\
    \ and artiﬁcially irrigated olive tree orchards [161].\nBased on these works,\
    \ it can be concluded that thermal information remotely obtained by\nTIR cameras,\
    \ alone or in combination with other imaging techniques, is robust enough to\n\
    estimate the water status of crops and to help farmers to establish an appropriate\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling for plantations. However, this conclusion should be taken\
    \ with caution since\nthere are exceptions to the rule. As an example, canopy\
    \ temperature in maize ﬁelds under\ndrought stress only partially reﬂected gas\
    \ exchange rates and grain yield, presumably as a\nconsequence of other alterations\
    \ caused by this stress factor in plants, such as impairments\nin photosynthesis\
    \ and partitioning rates or alterations in plant leaves and canopy structures\n\
    (leading to ﬂuctuations in energy absorption and/or dissipation) [162]. Moreover,\
    \ the use\nof TIR imaging to ﬁgure out biologically relevant traits constitutes\
    \ a challenge under\nﬂuctuating conditions, as recently reviewed by Vialet-Chabrand\
    \ and Lawson [75].\nIn addition to physiological variables related to the water\
    \ status of plants, production\nparameters such as grain yield could be evaluated\
    \ by thermography in cereals. That was\nthe case of spring barley [163], maize\
    \ [162] and wheat [61,164,165], where grain yield under\ndifferent water regimes\
    \ showed good correlations with TIR stress indices. CWSI is a good\npredictor\
    \ of garlic bulb biomass under different water availability levels [166]. Another\n\
    production parameter, the average fruit weight of mandarins “clementina de Nules”\
    \ at\nharvest, could also be correlated signiﬁcantly with canopy temperature when\
    \ different\nirrigation regimes were tested [32].\nRegarding the nutrient availability\
    \ in soils, wheat crops growing under higher nitrogen\nsupplies exhibited lower\
    \ canopy temperature (and thus, lower CWSI) than those that were\nnot treated\
    \ [167]. Kefauver et al. [168] compared different nitrogen treatments in three\n\
    barley varieties and elaborated a detailed correlation network of physiological\
    \ traits, TIR\nand other imaging data. Another common stress in crop ﬁelds is\
    \ low temperatures. TIR\nimaging has been applied to study frost resistance in\
    \ apple orchards. When the soil was\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n12 of 21\ndefrosted,\
    \ the whole tree froze starting from peripheral twigs, whereas when the soil was\n\
    frosted, the tree started to freeze from the trunk at the tree base [169].\n4.\
    \ Future Perspectives\nFor more sustainable agriculture, the development of tools\
    \ providing real-time in-\nformation on the health status of plants is highly\
    \ demanded, as well as on their physical\nand physiological interactions with\
    \ their micro- and macro-environment, from soil to\natmosphere. In this sense,\
    \ the progressive implementation of high-throughput analysis\nbased on imaging\
    \ sensors and big data have represented an outstanding innovation [72].\nAutomation\
    \ allows rapid evaluations of plants and crops, avoiding subjectivity associ-\n\
    ated with visual assessments, reducing the cost of labor and permitting more frequent\n\
    assessments on the same plants over time [21]. Indeed, thermography implemented\
    \ in\nhigh-throughput facilities is contributing to the development of next-generation\
    \ crops by\ncrop breeders. However, before thermal sensing is adopted as a routine\
    \ tool in agriculture\nand integrated into decision-making for a wide range of\
    \ users, further research is necessary\nto address current challenges of the technology\
    \ and interpretation of thermal data [13,76].\n4.1. Future Technical Development\
    \ of Thermography\nTIR cameras suffer from challenges common to sensors for image\
    \ acquisition. At the\nproximal sensor scale, the volume of plants that can be\
    \ monitored at the same time is a\nlimitation. On the other hand, standardized\
    \ environments of measurements at a short\ndistance from the target may complicate\
    \ the scale up to the ﬁeld. Indeed, at a remote\nsensing scale, atmospheric conditions\
    \ are challenging. Wind makes the crops move around\nor may destabilize UAVs affecting\
    \ the quality of images. Rain, fog, and other atmospheric\nfactors could delay\
    \ scheduled measurements. Even more, satellites could not cover the\nentire desired\
    \ area or do it when atmospheric conditions are inadequate, reducing their\ntime\
    \ resolution or even limiting the measurements during long periods in the rainy\
    \ seasons.\nOperational conditions of TIR cameras must be observed, whereas technical\
    \ features,\nsuch as sensitivity and accuracy, should be taken into consideration\
    \ when handling thermal\ndata to avoid misinterpretation of the results. Thermography\
    \ also needs corrections\nto the accuracy of leaf or canopy measurements via the\
    \ development of more accurate\ncomplementary measurements of atmospheric conditions\
    \ disturbing the temperature of\nthe vegetation. That would include wind speed\
    \ and reﬂection of solar radiation on canopy\nsurfaces, dependent on the intensity\
    \ and quality of light affected by weather conditions\non day ﬂights, as reviewed\
    \ in [15,80]. Particular attention must be paid to the spatial\nand temporal variations\
    \ in these factors during the actual measurement. Even though\nthe last generation\
    \ of thermal cameras can make corrections for relative humidity and\ntemperature\
    \ of the air, these atmospheric parameters should be taken into account for other\n\
    TIR sensors. These complementary measurements are needed to improve the quality\
    \ of\nthe thermal data and to help in interpreting thermal information [15]. The\
    \ use of current\nUAVs minimizes the time-of-measurement effects [76]. On the\
    \ other hand, ﬂight altitude\naffects the measurements due to thermal infrared\
    \ radiation attenuation by the atmosphere,\nrequiring some corrections [65]. Focal\
    \ length, related to the ﬂying altitude, is another\ntechnical feature to take\
    \ into consideration in airborne thermography [170]. Nonetheless,\nnanosatellites\
    \ and new generation satellites with increasingly higher time and spatial\nresolution\
    \ could be the future of remote sensing applied to agriculture [84].\nPublic datasets\
    \ are progressively gaining relevance in plant phenotyping, as in many\nother\
    \ research ﬁelds since they offer great opportunities for networking and collaboration.\n\
    However, comparing data with other researchers is limited by technical features.\
    \ A possible\nsolution for this issue would be the development of a system of\
    \ standardization (similar to\nthose issued by the International Commission on\
    \ Illumination, CIE) that could be adopted\nby the international community.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n13 of 21\n4.2. Strategies to Overcome the Intrinsic\
    \ Non-Speciﬁcity of Thermal Patterns\nThermography is a sensitive tool for plant\
    \ stress detection. However, alterations in leaf\nor canopy temperature are intrinsically\
    \ unspeciﬁc for the stressor. Indeed, on crop ﬁelds\nunder natural conditions,\
    \ plant diseases are often found concurrent with abiotic stresses.\nConsequently,\
    \ in terms of diagnosis, thermography must be used in combination with other\n\
    phenomics techniques with the aim of ﬁnding distinctive patterns that better explain\
    \ the\netiology of the disorder, thus helping to cut down potential causes of\
    \ disease. Appropriate\nmanagement and control of abiotic stress factors considering\
    \ the heterogeneities of the\nfarmed land appear mandatory to avoid misinterpretations\
    \ of the thermal imagery. For\nexample, in orchards, water management can be improved\
    \ by precise measurements of\nsoil humidity by thermography, as reviewed by [171].\
    \ Thus, an accurate diagnosis and\nquantiﬁcation of the extent and severity of\
    \ disease-related symptoms can only be achieved\nbased on a collection of inputs\
    \ such as the geological features and history of the farmed\nland or weather conditions\
    \ at the time of image collection.\nDeep learning is key in the process of turning\
    \ data into knowledge, particularly when\nthermography is integrated with other\
    \ imaging techniques in a multidimensional analysis,\nas recently reviewed by\
    \ [72]. Public accessibility and interoperability of datasets, from\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping platforms and satellites, promoted by cooperative initiatives\n\
    such as those funded by the International Plant Phenotyping Network (https://www.plant-\n\
    phenotyping.org), are contributing to develop the potential of plant phenotyping\
    \ [172].\n4.3. Uses of Plant Thermography for Agriculture in the Near Future\n\
    In recent years, huge investments have been made in plant phenotyping facilities\
    \ to\nsupport basic and applied research. Further work is needed to widen our\
    \ knowledge on\nplant physiology upon stress as well as developing improved stress\
    \ detection methods.\nFuture research should also address the development of more\
    \ general stress detection\nmethods, valid for a range of plant species and growth\
    \ conditions, including location,\nor even independent from those factors. The\
    \ contribution of thermography to precision\nagriculture should not be limited\
    \ to the detection of stress.\nThermography also appears as a very convenient\
    \ tool to study other aspects of plants\nthat are out of the scope of this review,\
    \ such as seeds vigor [173], investigations on circadian\nrhythms [174,175], the\
    \ effects of microgravity on plant physiology [176], interactions with\nplant-symbiotic\
    \ microorganisms [177–180], the impact of climate change in ecology [15],\nor\
    \ food industry [181]. Thermography is also a very relevant tool for screening\
    \ for mu-\ntants [182,183] and cultivars [21] with desirable phenotypes such as\
    \ pathogen resistance\nor improved performance upon certain abiotic stress conditions.\
    \ In summary, thermog-\nraphy implemented in high-throughput facilities is contributing\
    \ to the development of\nnext-generation crops by crop breeders.\n5. Concluding\
    \ Remarks\nThe huge collection of works applying thermography to plants and crops\
    \ shows that\nthis technique is overcoming inherent constraints, being able to\
    \ determine plant water\nstatus and to detect plant stress in a robust, reliable,\
    \ low-cost way. On one hand, TIR stress\nindices are often more reliable than\
    \ actual temperature values as they counteract the effects\nof ambient conditions\
    \ on the measurement, providing good correlations with physiological\nparameters\
    \ related to the plant water status. On the other hand, the combined use of\n\
    thermography with other imaging sensors and the application of big data tools\
    \ are an\nadvantageous approach that allows identifying stressed plants and even\
    \ evaluating the\nseverity of symptoms. In spite of this, more detailed studies\
    \ are needed to build a solid\nbase of knowledge applicable to practitioners.\
    \ Additionally, platforms based on imaging\ntechnologies should be developed to\
    \ cover the needs of a wide range of end-users.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n14\

    Highlights • Thermal index NRCT successfully estimates water status and grain
    yield in wheat. • Thermal imaging and passive reflectance sensing to assess water
    stress in wheat. • Models of PLSR analysis improved prediction of grain yield
    of wheat. Abstract The water demand for agricultural purposes is steadily increasing.
    The use of contactless sensing techniques, such as passive reflectance sensors
    and thermal imaging cameras, is therefore becoming imperative and will be one
    of the major adaptation strategies to control the irrigation schedule under arid
    and semi-arid conditions. In this study, the performance of hyperspectral passive
    reflectance sensing and infrared thermal imaging was tested to assess their relationship
    with the water status and grain yield (GY) of wheat cultivars via simple linear
    regression and partial least square regression (PLSR) analyses. The models included
    data of the (i) normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT); (ii) PLSR based
    on selected spectral indices; (iii) data fusion model of PLSR based on selected
    spectral indices and the NRCT; and (iv) data fusion model of PLSR based on selected
    spectral indices, NRCT, relative water content (RWC), and canopy water content
    (CWC). The experimental treatments involved two wheat cultivars (Gmiza 11 and
    Sods 1) and three water regimes (irrigated with 100%, 75%, and 50% of estimated
    crop evapotranspiration). The results show that the NRCT was closely and significantly
    associated with RWC, CWC, and GY, with R2 = 0.84, 0.87 and 0.81, respectively.
    The data fusion model of PLSR based on selected spectral indices, NRCT, RWC, and
    CWC improved the yield prediction under three irrigation regimes (R2 = 0.97, slope
    = 0.99, root-mean-square error = 26.48 g/m2). In conclusion, improvements can
    be made in the yield prediction when traits that are physiologically related in
    different ways to the yield are combined with non-destructive data. Previous article

    reflectanceWater stress 1. Introduction The water shortage in arid and semi-arid
    regions worsens due to abrupt climatic changes and excessive water consumption
    in the agricultural sector using the available water supply (El-Hendawy et al.,
    2015). Therefore, the use of contactless sensing techniques, such as passive reflectance
    sensors and thermal imaging cameras, is becoming imperative and will be one of
    the major adaptation strategies to control the irrigation schedule under arid
    and semi-arid conditions. Traditional methods, such as pressure chambers or oven-drying,
    for the assessment of the water stress of plants by estimating their water status
    are time-consuming. In the field, frequent changes of environmental conditions
    might further influence the measurements; thus, fast measurements are needed (Peñuelas
    et al., 1997, Elsayed et al., 2011, Winterhalter et al., 2011). Therefore, it
    is very important to develop high-throughput sensing methods for the assessment
    of water stress in crops, which should be reliable, fast, simple, practical, and
    economic. The early detection of water stress factors, such as the canopy water
    content (CWC) and relative water content (RWC), which were measured in this study
    with remote sensing methods, is crucial because it could help to identify the
    water stress status on larger temporal and spatial scales before any damage is
    clearly visible. Thermal imaging is an important technique to detect the water
    stress based on the plant temperature. With the ability to point and shoot high-quality
    thermal images (Jerbi et al., 2015), it is possible to measure the temperature
    of plants in large-scale water regimes. Thermography allows the simultaneous monitoring
    of large groups of leaves, providing an overview of stomatal conductance variation
    and dynamics (Zia et al., 2011). It measures infrared radiation and uses it for
    the calculation of the spatial distribution of the temperature of the plant canopy.
    The use of plant temperature to assess the water stress depends on stomatal closure
    during plant water deficits, which leads to a decrease of the energy dissipation
    and an increase in plant temperature (Idso et al., 1981, Patel et al., 2001).
    The plant temperature reflects the combined effects of the soil moisture content
    and atmospheric conditions on the crop water status, which ultimately affects
    the grain yield (GY) of cultivars. Idso et al. (1981) developed a crop water stress
    index (CWSI) based on thermal measurements that ranges between zero (full transpiration)
    and one (minimum stomatal conductance). The CWSI is the most commonly used index
    to quantify the water stress based on the canopy temperature. In addition to the
    CWSI, it is also important the Ig (the conductance index or the Jones Index (Jones,
    1999)). It is a helpful tool to quantify the water stress and can be used for
    irrigation scheduling. The newly developed normalized relative canopy temperature
    (NRCT) index similar to the CWSI, which has been developed by Elsayed et al. (2015b),
    was tested in this study. The NRCT was calculated depending on the actual infrared
    temperature measured in the canopy, the lowest temperature measured in the whole
    field trial (lower baseline), and the highest temperature in the whole field trial
    (Tmax, upper baseline). The advantage of this index is that no additional measurements
    other than that of infrared temperatures are necessary compared with the CWS Jackson
    et al. (1981) used a wet bulb temperature as the lower baseline and a dry bulb
    temperature as the upper baseline to calculate the CWSI based on the air temperature
    and air vapor pressure deficit, whereas canopy measurements were used in this
    experiment. The NRCT allows the interpretation of the temperature measurements
    as reductions in the stomatal conductance and the comparison of water stress levels
    in different field trials under different environmental conditions. The NRCT has
    only been used by Elsayed et al. (2015b) as an indicator for drought-stressed
    barley cultivars and the ability of the spectral reflectance to assess the NRCT
    of drought-stressed barley cultivars. In this study, the NRCT was used to assess
    and predict the water status and GY of wheat cultivars in different irrigation
    regimes. Spectral reflectance measurements with passive sensors have been used
    to assess the canopy water status, aerial biomass, dry biomass, nitrogen status,
    and GY. Passive sensor systems depend on sunlight as a source of light. Several
    studies suggested that the water status and GY could be estimated using the vegetation
    spectral reflectance during different growth stages (Schmidhalter et al., 2001,
    El-Shikha et al., 2007, Gutierrez et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2016); for example,
    the normalized water stress indices 1 [NWI-1; (R970–R900)/(R970 + R900)], 2 [NWI-2;
    (R970–R850)/(R970 + R850)], 3 [NWI-3; (R970–R920)/(R970 + R920)], and 4 [NWI-4;
    (R970–R880)/(R970 + R880)] from passive reflectance sensor measurements demonstrated
    a great potential in differentiating high- and low-yielding genotypes in advanced
    lines of spring wheat under well-irrigated, water-stressed, and high-temperature
    conditions in diverse trials (Gutierrez et al., 2010). Lobos et al. (2014) found
    that the normalized NWI-3 and the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI;
    (R830–R660)/(R830 + R660)] were most closely related to the GY and the water status
    of wheat genotypes subjected to drought stress. El-Shikha et al. (2007) reported
    that the water index (WI) can explain variations in the plant water content of
    broccoli plants in different water regimes. Few studies developed sophisticated
    statistical approaches to link data gathered from sensors with agronomic or physiological
    traits. Thus, yield-model approaches are typically based on single spectral indices
    (Gutierrez-Rodriguez et al., 2004). Both linear and multiple linear regression
    models can also be derived from spectral indices. Royo et al. (2003) found that
    17.3% to 65.2% of durum wheat yield could be accounted for using multiple linear
    regression models based on varying spectral indices. An alternative approach is
    to use partial least square regression (PLSR), which was used in this study. Orthogonal
    components are unaffected by collinearity in PLSR and are derived from all variables.
    Rischbeck et al. (2016) reported that the combination of several spectral reflectance
    indices that were based on the differential reflectance of the canopy in the spectral
    range of 350–1000 nm with CWSI data and plant height of barley cultivars in PLSR
    models improved the prediction of the GY. The PLSR models of the hyperspectral
    reflectance have been used in maize (Zea mays L.) at anthesis and during the milk-grain
    stage by Weber et al. (2012). The models successfully explained between 49% and
    69% of the variation in the GY in the calibration model and 23% to 40% after model
    validation. The use of hyperspectral data has also been employed in yield models
    of PLSRs (Sharabian et al., 2014). The data that can be obtained from passive
    reflectance sensors is limited to the interactions of light with plants or soil
    material. The transpiration is not directly related to the spectral reflectance
    but related to the canopy temperature (Rischbeck et al., 2016). Therefore, sensors
    using other physical principles might add information to spectral assessments.
    Therefore, statistical data fusion of sensor measurements (thermal image camera
    and passive reflectance sensor) in PLSR models was used and tested in this study
    to improve yield models in different irrigation regimes at the flowering growth
    stage in two years. The use of the information from passive sensors, the thermal
    image camera, and information about the water status might also increase the flexibility
    of the yield prediction in different irrigation regimes. Thus, the statistical
    data fusion of sensor measurements, CWC, and RWC in PLSR models was used and tested
    to improve yield models. The purpose of this work was: (i) to compare the performance
    of the thermal image camera by using the NRCT index and selected spectral reflectance
    indices for the assessment of the water status and GY of wheat cultivars in three
    irrigation regimes, (ii) to evaluate two models (NRCT and PLSR models based on
    five spectral indices) to predict the water status and GY, and (iii) to assess
    the improvement of the yield prediction using the data fusion model of PLSR based
    on the NRCT and five spectral indices and to assess the improvement of the yield
    prediction using the data fusion model of PLSR based on the NRCT, five spectral
    indices, CWC, and RWC. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Field experiments and design
    Field experiments were carried out at the Research Station of the University of
    Sadat City in Egypt during 2014–2015 and 2015–2016. The research station of the
    University of Sadat City (Latitude: N30°2′ 41.185″, Longitude: E31°14′ 8.1625″)
    is characterized by a semi-arid climate with moderate cold winters and warm summers.
    The experimental treatments consisted of two wheat cultivars (Gmiza 11 and Sods
    1) and three water regimes [T1, irrigated with 100% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc); T2, irrigated with 75% ETc; and T3, irrigated with 50% of ETc]. The field
    experiments were designed as a randomized complete block split plot design with
    six replicates. The three water regimes were assigned to the main plots, while
    the two wheat cultivars were distributed randomly in subplots. All treatments
    received the recommended dose of superphosphate (15.5% P2O5) at a rate of 476
    kg ha−1 and potassium sulfate (48% K2O) at a rate of 119 kg ha−1. The two wheat
    cultivars were sown on November 10, 2014 and November 8, 2015 in sandy loam soil
    containing 69.8% sand, 22.3% silt, and 7.9% clay. The soil of the experimental
    site has a water field capacity of 0.192 m3 m−3, wilting point of 0.106 m3 m−3,
    and bulk density of 1.45 g cm−3. The soil is characterized by an electrical conductivity
    of 0.95 dS m−1, organic matter content of 0.36%, and calcium carbonate content
    of 5%. The experiment included 36 plots; each plot was 3 m long and 2 m wide.
    The plots consisted of 14 rows spaced 15 cm apart. A drip irrigation system was
    used with four lines per plot and the distance between each nozzle was 30 cm.
    The nozzle had a discharge rate of 4 L h−1. The two water regimes, 75% and 50%
    of ETc, were started at the stem elongation growth stage (BBCH 32) until harvest.
    2.2. Irrigation water requirement The food and agriculture organization (FAO)
    Penman–Monteith method (Allen et al., 1998) was used to calculate the reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) with the CROPWAT Program. The crop water requirements
    (ETc) of the growing season were determined using the following equation: (1)
    where ETc is the crop water requirement, Kc is the crop coefficient, and ETo is
    the reference evapotranspiration. The values of Kc suggested by FAO-56 were adjusted
    to adapt them to the studied area. The FAO Penman–Monteith equation was used to
    calculate the ETo according to Eq. (1). (2) where: Eto: reference evapotranspiration
    [mm day−1], Rn: net radiation at the crop surface [MJ m−2 day−1], G: soil heat
    flux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T: air temperature at 2-m height [°C], u2: wind speed
    at 2-m height [m s−1], es: saturation vapor pressure [kPa], ea: actual vapor pressure
    [kPa], es − ea: saturation vapor pressure deficit [kPa], Δ: slope of vapor pressure
    curve [kPa °C−1], g: psychrometric constant [kPa °C−1]. The CROPWAT model calculates
    the daily amount and daily deficit due to applying irrigation water and determines
    the next irrigation. The total amount of irrigation water applied (from sowing
    to harvest) during the studied seasons was 470, 377, and 285 mm in the first year
    and 490, 380, and 290 mm in the second year for T1, T2, and T3, respectively.
    2.3. Field measurements 2.3.1. Thermal measurements Thermal images of the plots
    were obtained with a handheld infrared thermal camera Ti-32 (Fluke Thermography,
    Germany) equipped with a 320 × 240-pixel microbolometer sensor. This thermal sensor
    has a spectral response in the range of 7.5–13 μm. The images were analyzed using
    Ti-32 Pro software (Infrared Solutions). The emissivity for the measurements of
    leaves and plant canopies was set to 0.96, while the transmission correction was
    85% (Bayoumi et al., 2015). The thermal camera was manually used, approximately
    0.8 m above canopy height. Thermal images were taken nadir from the middle of
    each plot under clear sky conditions. The images could then be analyzed to determine
    either average temperatures or the frequency distribution of the temperatures
    for each treatment (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    A passive bidirectional reflectance sensor (HandySpec Field®, tec5, Oberursel,
    Germany) measuring wavelengths between 302 nm and 1148 nm, with a bandwidth of
    2 nm and connected to a portable computer and geographical positioning system
    (GPS), was used. The handheld FieldSpec sensor consists of two units. One unit
    was linked to a diffuser and measured the light radiation as a reference signal.
    The second unit measured the canopy reflectance with a fiber optic (Elsayed et
    al., 2015; Rischbeck et al., 2016) with an aperture of 12° and a field of view
    of 0.2 m2 from a height of 1 m. The aperture of an optical system is the opening
    that determines the cone angle of a bundle of rays that enters the optics. The
    sensor outputs were co-recorded with the GPS coordinates when collecting information
    in the field. The actual sensor output was co-referenced and recorded for each
    position. Subsequently, the readings within one plot were averaged to a single
    value per plot. The canopy reflectance was calculated with the readings from the
    spectrometer unit and corrected with a calibration factor obtained from a grey
    reference standard. The spectral measurements were mostly carried out on sunny
    days in nadir direction approximately one meter above the canopy. The readings
    were performed during the flowering growth stage (BBCH 74–76) on March 5, 2015,
    and March 7, 2016. 2.4. Plant traits 2.4.1. Relative water content and canopy
    water content measurements The relative water content (RWC) and canopy water content
    (CWC) were determined to describe the water status of two wheat cultivars under
    the three water regimes. For RWC, the cut leaves were weighed (leaf fresh weight,
    LFW) and stored with the leaf base in water for four hours for saturation. Subsequently,
    their turgid weight (LTW) was calculated. The samples were then dried in an oven
    at 65 °C until the leaf dry weight (LDW) was constant and weighed again (dry weight,
    DW). The RWC was determined as the average obtained from three fully expanded
    leaves for each plot. The RWC (%) was calculated according to Eq. (3): (3) RWC
    (in%) = (LFW − LDW)/(LTW − LDW) In addition, biomass sampling of plants was performed.
    To determine the CWC, 0.25 m2 were harvested from each plot and weighed. Thereafter,
    samples of biomass fresh weight (BFW) were placed in an oven (65° C) until there
    was no change in the biomass dry weight (BDW). The CWC percentage was calculated
    according to Eq. (4). (4) CWC (in%) = (BFW − BDW)/BFW 2.4.2. Grain yield The plots
    were harvested by hand on April 25, 2015, and April 22, 2016. The total GY of
    each plot was weighed, the samples were oven-dried to determine the grain water
    content on a gravimetric basis, and the yield normalized to a water content of
    14% was expressed as g m−2. The plot yields were averaged for each cultivar and
    each treatment. 2.4.3. The normalized relative canopy temperature The NRCT was
    calculated based on Eq. (5) (Elsayed et al., 2015): (5) NRCT = (T − Tmin)/(Tmax
    − Tmin), where T is the actual infrared temperature measured in the canopy, and
    Tmin (lower baseline) and Tmax (upper baseline) are, respectively, the lowest
    and the highest temperature measured in the whole field trial. 2.5. Statistical
    analysis 2.5.1. Selection of spectral reflectance indices In this study, both
    known and novel spectral reflectance indices were calculated and tested. Five
    spectral indices from different sources were listed with their equations in Table
    1. A contour map analysis for all wavelengths of the spectral passive sensor (from
    302 to 1148 nm) was used to select the novel normalized difference indices. The
    selected indices generally presented more stable and strong relationships with
    CWC, RWC, and GY of the wheat cultivars. All possible dual wavelength combinations
    were evaluated depending on the contour map analysis for the spectral passive
    sensor. Contour maps are matrices of the coefficients of determination of all
    variable measurements with all possible combinations of binary, normalized spectral
    indices. The “lattice” package from the software R statistics version 3.0.2 (R
    foundation for statistical computing, 2013) was used to produce the contour maps
    for the spectral reflectance readings; six wavelengths (880, 900, 910, 920, 970,
    and 992 nm) were therefore used to calculate the reflectance indices given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Description of the spectral reflectance indices examined in

    plant traits All data of this study were analyzed using Sigmaplot for Windows
    v.12 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and SPSS 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
    IL, USA). Simple linear regressions were performed to investigate the relationships
    of spectral reflectance indices and the NRCT with RWC, CWC, and GY of the two
    wheat cultivars. The coefficients of determination and significance levels were
    determined; nominal alpha values and 0.001 were used. The validation approach
    using fully independent data was used. The models were calibrated using dataset
    of 36 data of the NRCT or PLSR models of the 1st year and were validated using
    dataset of 36 data 2nd year to predict the measured parameters. The PLSR creates
    orthogonal latent variables across the input variables and relates them to the
    target variables. This is a way to cope with redundancy of the input variables.
    The PLSR searches sensitive information of the input variables of each sensor.
    Two data fusion models of PLSR based on the NRCT and five spectral indices or
    based on the NRCT, five spectral indices, CWC, and RWC were used to improve the
    yield prediction of the two wheat cultivars. The quality of the validation models
    is presented through adjusted coefficients of determination, the slope and intercept
    of the linear regressions, and root-mean-squares errors (RMSEs) between the observed
    and predicted values. 3. Results and discussion The use of proximal remote sensing,
    such as thermal imaing and passive reflectance sensing, is particularly and practically
    suitable to assess the water status and implement appropriate management strategies
    because it presents unique advantages of repeatability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness
    over the ground-based surveys for water stress detection (El-Shikha et al., 2007,
    Zia et al., 2011). The improved irrigation management or agronomical traits by
    selecting tolerant genotypes of wheat are important to enhance the wheat performance
    during periods of drought stress and to conserve water. The determination of the
    water status and GY in response to different levels of water irrigation conditions
    is beneficial for site-specific wheat irrigation management, particularly for
    locations that show a large spatial and temporal variability of drought symptoms.
    Different models based on the NRCT and spectral indices were established in this
    study to assess and predict RWC, CWC, and GY. The spectral data that can be obtained
    from passive reflectance sensors are limited to the interactions of light with
    plants or soil material. The transpiration is not directly related to the spectral
    reflectance but related to the canopy temperature (Rischbeck et al., 2016). Therefore,
    the statistical data fusion of sensor measurements (thermal image camera and passive
    reflectance sensor) with plant traits was used and tested to improve the yield
    models of different irrigation regimes. 3.1. Influence of three irrigation regimes
    on the water status, grain yield, NRCT, and selected normalized spectral indices
    of wheat The assessment of plant water status provides information about the actual
    water stress level under water regimes or drought conditions. Measuring CWC and
    RWC is a well-proven, direct indicator of the plant water status (Chaves et al.,
    2003, Becker and Schmidhalter, 2017, Elsayed and Darwish, 2017). In this study,
    different irrigation levels led to varying degrees of plant water stress. These
    conditions were reflected in an extended range of the plant trait measurements.
    In the first and second year, the water status, grain yield, NRCT, and five normalized
    spectral indices were greatly affected by different irrigation regimes. Water
    regimes level led to a statistically significant impairment of all measured parameters
    of the wheat plants during both experimental years. A significant decrease in
    CWC, RWC and GY as well as a significant increase in NRCT and the spectral indices
    was observed compared with the control plants (Table 2). Generally, the highest
    mean values of all plant trait measurements were recorded at an ETc of 100% in
    two wheat cultivars; the lowest values of all plant trait measurements were recorded
    at an ETc of 50% (Table 2). The mean values for the first year ranged from 59%
    to 78% for RWC, from 66% to 77% for CWC, and from 520 g/m2 to 773.31 g/m2 for
    GY. These results agree with those of Bijanzadeh and Emam (2012) who reported
    that the GY of five wheat cultivars decreased in four water regimes (125% to 50%
    of field capacity) from 773.8 g/m2 to 401.2 g/m2. During wheat development, the
    water stress significantly reduced RWC values from 88% to 45% (Siddique et al.,
    2000). Gutierrez et al. (2010) found that the RWC values decreased when the drought
    stress levels of the wheat genotypes increased. These results also agree with
    Winterhalter et al. (2011) who reported that the water content of maize cultivars
    decreased more under drought stress at different growth stages compared with the
    plant water content under irrigation. Table 2. Minimum, maximum, and mean values

    The NRCT and five normalized spectral indices of two wheat cultivars increased
    with increasing water stress levels. For example, the mean values for the second
    year ranged from 0.42 to 0.73 for the NRCT and from −0.049 to −0.030 for the spectral
    index [(R970–R900)/(R970 + R900); Table 2]. The NRCT reacts to the cooling effect
    of the canopy transpiration similar to the CWSI. The direct impact of the plant
    water stress leads to reduced water uptake by roots, decreasing water status,
    and increased surface temperature and thus to an increase of the NRCT values.
    These results agree with Elsayed et al. (2015b) who reported that the NRCT values
    of barley cultivars increased with increasing plant water stress levels from mild
    to severe stress. Four of the five normalized spectral indices in this study react
    sensitively to changes in the water status. The spectral band at 970 nm is sensitive
    to the water status of the crop according to Peñuelas et al. (1997). These results
    agree with Gutierrez et al. (2010) who reported the following values: NWI-1, (R970–R900)/(R970
    + R900); NWI-2, (R970–R850)/(R970 + R850); NWI-3, (R970–R920)/(R970 + R920); and
    NWI-4, (R970–R880)/(R970 + R880) of the advanced lines of spring wheat cultivars
    were lowest under good irrigation compared with water-stressed conditions. 3.2.
    The relationship between the normalized relative canopy temperature, the water
    status and grain yield of two wheat cultivars A second approach for estimating
    the water status or grain yield of the wheat cultivars is based on the measurement
    of leaf temperature and calculating the newly developed index (NRCT). Measurements
    obtained using near infrared-sensors provide information on plant transpiration
    as the main contributor to reduce leaf temperature (Monneveux et al., 2012). This
    assumption was supported by significant negative relations between RWC, CWC and
    the NRCT (Fig. 2. and Table 3). Specifically, a low RWC and CWC indicate a reduced
    transpiration rate as a water-saving strategy, which results in higher leaf temperatures.
    A lower transpiration rate leads to warmer leaves and lower stomatal conductance;
    both of these factors decrease net photosynthesis and crop duration (Monneveux
    et al., 2012, Becker and Schmidhalter, 2017, Elsayed and Darwish, 2017). Fig.
    2 shows linear regression models of the newly developed index (NRCT) with RWC,
    CWC and GY of the two wheat cultivars. The results demonstrate that the NRCT is
    significantly related with the water status and grain yield for each cultivar,
    the individual year, and across all measurements for two years (R2 ≥ 0.76; p ≤
    0.001). The highest coefficient of determination could be observed between the
    NRCT and CWC of the second cultivar in the first year (R2 = 0.97; p ≤ 0.001).
    Although the NRCT is strongly related to the RWC, CWC, and GY of each cultivar,
    their relationships were affected by the measurement year (Fig. 2). This is likely
    due to changes in the environmental conditions. The NRCT indicates relative differences
    in the RWC, CWC, and GY under plant water stress levels. These results agree with
    Elsayed et al. (2015b) who found that the NRCT has a significant relationship
    with the GY of 16 barley cultivars under mild and severe stress conditions. Our
    results are also in agreement with Jiang et al. (2009) who reported that the canopy
    and ambient temperature differentials are negatively correlated with the leaf
    RWC of six cultivars of perennial ryegrass (r = −0.77 to −0.78). Download : Download

    a number of studies, the canopy temperature was found to be negatively related
    to the GY under either well-watered (Reynolds et al., 1998) or drought-stressed
    conditions (Saint Pierre et al., 2010). The results suggest that thermal sensing
    using the NRCT can be effectively utilized to quickly check the water status and
    GY of plants under different irrigation regimes. Thus, stress in plants can be
    detected before visible symptoms and GY loss occur. 3.3. Contour map analysis
    of the spectral reflectance data A contour map presenting a larger range of indices
    with similar wavelengths contains information relevant for the RWC, CWC, and GY.
    The contour map analysis provided the mean coefficients of determination (R2)
    of the measurement data for all dual wavelength combinations as a normalized difference
    spectral index. The contours of the matrices of the spectral passive sensor presented
    stronger relationships between the plant trait measurements, such as RWC, CWC,
    and GY, of the wheat cultivars with near-infrared wavelengths and the combination
    of visible and near-infrared wavelengths than visible wavelengths alone. The contour
    map analysis of the relationship between the normalized difference spectral indices
    with (a) CWC and (b) GY in the first year and (c) RWC in the second year of the
    two wheat cultivars are shown in Fig. 3. The averages of the correlation matrices
    resulting from the measurements, indicated by the coefficients of determination
    (R2) for all dual wavelengths combinations from 750 nm to 1000 nm as normalized
    difference indices for all plant trait measurements across two wheat cultivars,
    presented higher R2-values compared to all other two wavelength combinations (Fig.
    3). The reason for that is that the wavelengths from 850 nm to 100 nm are more
    affected by the water status and biomass of the plant. These findings agree with
    the results of Gutierrez et al. (2010) who reported that the dual near-infrared
    wavelength combinations as a normalized difference spectral index from 880 nm
    to 970 nm were strongly influenced by the water status of the plant such as the
    RWC and LWP of wheat cultivars. The spectral reflectance in the 680–730 nm range
    correlates with the leaf area index (Townsend et al., 2003). Therefore, wheat
    cultivars subjected to different irrigation levels create a significant variation
    in the spectral reflectance measurements from 750 nm to 1000 nm. Download : Download

    dual wavelength combinations in the 302–1148-nm range (as normalized difference
    index) of the hyperspectral passive reflectance sensing with (a) canopy water
    content (CWC) and (b) grain yield (GY) in the first year and (c) relative water
    content (RWC) in the second year across two wheat cultivars. 3.4. Relationship
    between normalized difference spectral indices with the water status and grain
    yield The selected spectral indices were closely related to RWC, CWC, and GY for
    each cultivar, season and across two wheat cultivars (Table 4, Table 5; Fig. 4).
    Four of the five normalized difference spectral indices are based on the hypothesis
    that the near-infrared wavelengths (970 nm) penetrate deeper into the canopy of
    the plant and therefore accurately estimate the water content. The water indices
    exhibited highly significant relationships with the RWC, CWC and GY of the two
    wheat cultivars. The NIR-based water indices compare the energy absorbed by water
    at 970 nm and different reference wavelengths of 880, 900, 910 and 920 nm, which
    do not indicate absorption by water (Penuelas et al., 1997; Prasad et al., 2007
    Prasad et al., 2007) and therefore are especially suited to detect the plant water
    status. In addition to the four water-based indices, the NI 992_900 exhibited
    a good relationship with the RWC, CWC and GY of the two wheat cultivars. The association
    between the normalized water indices and GY indicates that the CWC plays a vital
    role in estimating the GY of wheat (Babar et al., 2006, Prasad et al., 2007).

    shown in Table 4, Table 5 and Fig. 4. The statistically significant relationships
    between the selected spectral reflectance indices derived from the near-infrared
    region varied (R2 = 0.51 p ≤ 0.01 to 0.86; p ≤ 001) for RWC, CWC, and GY of the
    wheat cultivars. Generally, the normalized spectral index of (R970–R900)/(R970
    + R900) showed the highest coefficients of determination for the measured parameters
    across the measurements. The results demonstrate that the selected five spectral
    reflectance indices were useful in estimating the GY during the flowering growth
    stage. These results are in agreement with Lobos et al. (2014) who reported that
    the NWI-3 [(R970–R920)/(R970 + R920)] and NDVI [(R830–R660)/(R830 + R660)] present
    good relationships (R2 = 0.66 and 0.62, respectively; p ≤ 0.001) with the GY of
    the wheat cultivars under drought stress conditions. Gutierrez et al. (2010) found
    that the NWI-1 [(R970–R900)/(R970 + R900)] and NWI-3 [(R970–R920)/(R970 + R920)]
    of a spectral passive sensor showed significant relationships with the yield of
    wheat genotypes under drought stress. Closer relationships between three water
    stress indices (NWI-1, NWI-3, and NWI-4) and GY were obtained for the spectral
    passive sensor (Elsayed et al., 2015). Additionally, the five water indices (WI,
    NWI-1 to 4) consistently exhibited higher correlations with grain yield under
    drought conditions compared to the widely used indices (NDVI, R760/R730, R730/R760,
    etc) of wheat cultivars (Becker and Schmidhalter, 2017). As well as the genotypic
    variability in GY was better explained by spectral reflectance indices belonging
    to either the categories of normalized water (e.g., NWI3; 970, 920) or normalized
    difference moisture (e.g., NDMI2; 2200, 1100) indices which clearly performed
    better than vegetation indices such as the NDVI or indices related to the photosynthetic
    efficiency like PRI (Lobos et al., 2014). Moreover, the results demonstrate that
    the selected five spectral reflectance indices were useful in estimating the RWC
    and CWC. These results are in agreement with Zhang and Zhou (2015) found that
    WI (R900/R970) and NDWI [(R860–R1240)/(R860 + R1240)] of the CWC and RWC significantly
    correlate with the CWC of maize with R2 = 0.70 and 0.77, respectively (p ≤ 0.001).
    Elsayed and Darwish (2017) reported that spectral water indices (NWI-1, NWI-3,
    and NWI-4) showed close and highly significant associations with the canopy water
    content (CWC) and canopy water mass (CWM) under full irrigation, full irrigation
    with salinity levels, and the interaction between full irrigation with salinity
    levels and water stress treatments and coefficients of determination reached up
    to R2 = 0.73 (p ≤ 0.001). 3.5. Modeling of the water status and grain yield 3.5.1.
    Linear models to predict the relative water content, canopy water content, and
    grain yield of wheat cultivars The NRCT models as well as the PLSRs models using
    the five spectral indices were established to predict the RWC, CWC, and GY of
    two wheat cultivars (Fig. 5). Two models were calibrated based on the NRCT data
    or the PLSRs using the five spectral indices data of the first year of the two
    wheat cultivars. The PLSR technique allowed the identification of optimized models
    and is considered to be the state-of-the art technique enabling a high efficiency
    in searching for optimized relationships. Simple linear, polynomial, or exponential
    functions are used to model the relationship between the biophysical parameters
    and vegetation indices (Elsayed et al., 2015b, Rischbeck et al., 2016). The advantage
    of PLSR models is that the PLSR in this study used information from five spectral
    indices and selected the number of factors that best represent the calibration
    data without overfitting. The PLSR had no limitation in predicting the measured
    parameters and the relationship between the observed and predicted values was
    linear. Download : Download high-res image (795KB) Download : Download full-size

    to predict (a) RWC, (b) CWC, and (c) GY or partial least square regressions using
    five spectral indices to predict (d) RWC, (e) CWC, and (f) GY. The calibration
    functions were validated with independent data measured in the second year. The
    coefficients of determination (R2) and function of these linear validations between
    the observed and predicted values of all parameters are shown in the figures.
    ***Statistically significant at p ≤ 0.001. The two models were calibrated using
    a dataset of 36 samples obtained from one year for two cultivars, and were validated
    using a set of 36 samples from a different year. The calibration functions were
    validated with independent data measured in the second year. The coefficients
    of determination (R2) and function of these linear validations between the observed
    and predicted values of all parameters are shown in Fig. 5. The quality of the
    two models is represented in Fig. 5 by the adjusted coefficients of determination,
    the slope of the linear regressions between observed and predicted values, and
    RMSEs. The coefficient of determination of the NRCT model of RWC was 0.84 (p ≤
    0.001); the slope of the linear regressions was 0.96; and RMSE was 0.21%. For
    the PLSR based on the five spectral indices model for the GY, the coefficients
    of determination was 0.66 (p ≤ 0.001); the slope of the linear regressions was
    1.15 and the RMSE was 166.07 g/m2. The results show that the two models were useful
    in estimating the destructively measured parameters during the flowering stage.
    The NRCT has the highest coefficients of determination for all measured parameters,
    but the PLSR based on the five spectral indices data showed the lowest RMSE for
    CWC and GY. The use of the five spectral indices for the PLSR analysis increased
    the accuracy of the estimates of CWC and GY across the two wheat cultivars. These
    results agree with Sharabian et al. (2014) who reported that strong relationships
    exist between the predicted and observed values for a validation GY dataset (R2
    = 0.87, RMSE = 301) and SPAD values (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 1.94). Li et al. (2014)
    found that PLSR is a potentially useful method to derive the nitrogen content
    of winter wheat through growth stages compared with the spectral indices; the
    average R2 value for the PLSR model increased to 76.8% and 75.5% in the calibration
    and validation datasets, respectively. Elsayed et al. (2015a) reported that the
    PLSR models could improve the assessment of pod yield in peanut cultivars compared
    with the spectral reflectance indices collected from other studies. 3.6. Improvement
    in the yield prediction by using two PLSR data fusion models Two PLSR data fusion
    models based on the NRCT and five spectral indices or based on the NRCT, five
    spectral indices, CWC, and RWC were tested to evaluate the yield of two wheat
    cultivars (Fig. 6). The two models were calibrated using the dataset from the
    first year of the two wheat cultivars. The calibration functions were validated
    with the independent dataset from the second year. For the PLSR model based on
    the NRCT and five spectral indices to predict the GY, the coefficient of determination
    was 0.87 (p ≤ 0.001), the slope of the linear regression was 0.61, and the RMSE
    was 104.31 g/m2. For the PLSR model based on the NRCT, five spectral indices,
    CWC, and RWC, the coefficient of determination was 0.97 (p ≤ 0.001), the slope
    of the linear regression was 0.99, and the RMSE was 26.48 g/m2. Download : Download

    and predicted values of all parameters are shown in the figures. ***Statistically
    significant at p ≤ 0.001. The results demonstrate that the two models (Fig. 6)
    are useful to estimate the GY across two wheat cultivars. The PLSR model based
    on the NRCT, five spectral indices, CWC, and RWC increased the accuracy of the
    estimates of the GY across two cultivars (Fig. 6b) compared with the use of the
    other three models (Figs. 5 and 6 a). To the best of our knowledge, the data fusion
    from different sensors adopted in the yield model and prediction of field trials
    has only been used by Rischbeck et al. (2016). They reported that the data fusion
    models of spectral reflectance and thermal and distance information provided a
    better yield prediction of barley cultivars compared with models based on spectral
    data only. The data combination of different sources with spectral data, such
    as thermal data influenced by plant transpiration, CWC correlated with the biomass
    presenting the effect of water stress over long time, and RWC indicating the effect
    of water stress over short time, enables a broadly adapted yield model. Rischbeck
    et al. (2016) reported that additional improvements can be made under mild and
    severe drought stress for several barley cultivars when the traits that are physiologically
    and in different ways related to the yield are combined. 3.7. Benefits and practical
    implications of these results The use of remote or proximal sensing such as passive
    reflectance and thermal sensing may help to develop low-cost, efficient high throughput
    phenotyping platforms which allow to collect data at low cost on many phenotypes
    of large numbers of breeding individuals at different water regimes. In recent
    years unmanned aerial vehicles have been equipped with spectrometers (Agüera Vega
    et al., 2015) and stereo camera systems used for distance measurements (Honkavaara
    et al., 2013) for applications in precision agriculture. Combined PLSR models
    using NRCT and spectral information may allow optimizing site-specific wheat irrigation
    management, particularly for locations that show a large spatial and temporal
    variability of drought symptoms. Fusing data from different sources could be used
    for combining relevant spectral bands and non-spectral data based on empirical
    evaluations and identification of the physiological importance of the selected
    traits for yield. Data fusion can improve the quality and robustness of yield
    predictions compared to models that are only based on spectral data as shown by
    Sharabian et al. (2014) and Hansen and Schjoerring (2003). 4. Conclusions It can
    be concluded that the RWC, CWC, and GY of the wheat cultivars can reliably be
    detected using the NRCT and NWI in different irrigation regimes. The data fusion
    of two PLSR models based on five spectral indices and the NRCT and PLSR based
    on the five spectral indices, NRCT, RWC, and CWC improved the prediction of the
    GY of wheat cultivars as compared to the NRCT and PLSR models solely based on
    five spectral indices. Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge the financial support

    Abstract This study assessed the capability of several xanthophyll, chlorophyll
    and structure-sensitive spectral indices to detect water stress in a commercial
    farm consisting of five fruit tree crop species with contrasting phenology and
    canopy architecture. Plots irrigated and non-irrigated for eight days of each
    species were used to promote a range of plant water status. Multi-spectral and
    thermal images were acquired from an unmanned aerial system while concomitant
    measurements of stomatal conductance (gs), stem water potential (Ψs) and photosynthesis
    were taken. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), red-edge ratio
    (R700/R670), Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI), the Photochemical
    Reflectance Index using reflectance at 530 (PRI) and 515 nm [PRI(570–515)] and
    the normalized PRI (PRInorm) were obtained from the narrow-band multi-spectral
    images and the relationship with the in-field measurements explored. Results showed
    that within the Prunus species, Ψs yielded the best correlations with PRI and
    PRI(570–515) (r2 = 0.53) in almond trees, with TCARI/OSAVI (r2 = 0.88) in apricot
    trees and with PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI (r2 from 0.72 to 0.88) in peach trees.
    Weak or no correlations were found for the Citrus species due to the low level
    of water stress reached by the trees. Results from the sensitivity analysis pointed
    out the canopy temperature (Tc) and PRI(570–515) as the first and second most
    sensitive indicators to the imposed water conditions in all the crops with the
    exception of apricot trees, in which Ψs was the most sensitive indicator at midday.
    PRInorm was the least sensitive index among all the water stress indicators studied.
    When all the crops were analyzed together, PRI(570–515) and NDVI were the indices
    that better correlations yielded with Crop Water Stress Index, gs and, particularly,
    Ψs (r2 = 0.61 and 0.65, respectively). This work demonstrated the feasibility
    of using narrow-band multispectral-derived indices to retrieve water status for
    a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology and canopy architecture.

    Continuous advances in technology have promoted the use of unmanned aerial systems
    (UAS) for a large range of applications (Anderson and Gaston 2013). Precision
    agriculture is one of the most promising applications (Mulla 2013; Gago et al.
    2015) since low-cost UAS can be equipped with robust sensors providing very high
    resolution, such as miniaturized narrow-band and hyperspectral and thermal cameras
    used to remotely monitor vegetation (Bendig et al. 2012). Farm assessment by remote
    sensing using UAS enables crop monitoring from a closer range and a higher frequency
    than is currently possible with satellites. Inter- and intra-field variability
    of crops can then be assessed in detail providing farmers with crucial information
    to better optimize farm management and increase farmers’ profitability (Mulla
    2013). Water availability is becoming the most limiting factor for crop production
    in much of the world (Field 2014). This fact has increased the emphasis that policy-makers
    are placing on both demand and supply options to water management. Remote sensing
    takes on special significance within this context since it enables a better monitoring
    of large cultivated areas making it easier to assess the proper functioning of
    irrigation systems (for example, by identifying water-stressed areas or irrigation
    leaks with thermal images) and the precise management of plants water stress,
    which has been extensively pointed out in the literature (Taghvaeian and Neale
    2011) as a key factor to ensure the success of water-saving irrigation strategies
    based on irrigating plants below their full water requirements. High resolution
    thermal imagery has been successfully used in a variety of crops to assess the
    variability in plant water status at the field and farm scales (Bellvert et al.
    2013; Berni et al. 2009; Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2012). Bellvert et al. (2013) mapped
    the spatial variability in leaf water potential of different vineyards based on
    high resolution thermal imagery and then used that information for scheduling
    irrigation. Similarly, Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) identified water-stressed areas
    from thermal images in a farm composed of five fruit tree crops and based on the
    relationship between the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) and the stem water potential
    (Ψs) established a CWSI threshold for scheduling irrigation. Notwithstanding the
    suitability of thermal sensing for plant water stress assessment, alternative
    indices less sensitive to variations in the air vapor pressure deficit and more
    related to biophysical parameters such as the chlorophyll or xanthophylls pigment
    content are currently of interest (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2013). That is because
    in the field, in order to cope with drought, plants usually exhibit adaptive mechanisms
    at leaf level such as the dissipation of excitation energy (associated with an
    increase in the concentration of de-epoxidized xanthophyll cycle components),
    decrease in leaf chlorophyll concentration and down-regulation of photosynthesis
    (Chaves et al. 2002). Greenhouse experiments have shown that water stress periods
    of even eight days may have a significant effect on the content and organization
    of chlorophyll in the mesophyll (Albert and Thornber 1977). A variety of narrow-band
    optical indices obtained from remote sensing data have been related to leaf chlorophyll
    concentration (Haboudane et al. 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2004). Combination of
    indices such as the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI)
    and the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) to give the TCARI/OSAVI
    index (Table 1), have been shown as more robust indices to estimate chlorophyll
    concentration than simple indices because of a lower sensitivity to soil background
    and crop leaf area index variations (Haboudane et al. 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al.
    2004). Table 1 Formulations used to obtain the vegetation indices: Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band

    The narrow-band Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI, Table 1) proposed by Gamon
    et al. (1992), which is based on the xanthophylls cycle activation as a mechanism
    to dissipate the excess of energy when photosynthesis declines under conditions
    of stress, has been also successfully tested as a water stress indicator in several
    studies (Peguero-Pina et al. 2008; Suárez et al. 2010; Hernández-Clemente et al.
    2011). These authors, however, also pointed out that PRI is highly affected by
    factors such as canopy structure, viewing and illumination geometry effects, and
    background, which challenge its widespread use as a water stress indicator. Different
    formulations of PRI (based on different wavelength references) have been studied
    in this sense searching to overcome these limitations (Hernández-Clemente et al.
    2011). Recently, Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013) proposed a modified PRI-based index
    (PRInorm) to track the diurnal trends of water stress using a combination of a
    structural index (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI) and an index
    sensitive to the leaf chlorophyll content (the red edge ratio, R700/R670) to normalize
    PRI. The PRInorm index was tested in an experimental vineyard site in a diurnal
    setting, yielding higher correlations than PRI with the CWSI and the commonly
    used water stress indicators, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (gs).
    Spectral indices have been usually evaluated in orchards consisting of a single
    crop. It is not uncommon for farms to be made up of several crop species with
    different canopy architectures, nutrient status and even phenological stages.
    Under these circumstances, the possibility of using a single multi-spectral index
    that could provide reliable information regarding the plant water status of all
    the co-existing crops in the farm would considerably simplify the farm assessment.
    With that objective in mind, a study was performed in a commercial farm consisting
    of five fruit tree crop species in which the capability of xanthophyll, chlorophyll
    and structure-sensitive spectral indices to track the effects of water stress
    on trees was assessed. The sensitivity of these indices to the imposed drought
    conditions were assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis as other authors (Goldhamer
    et al. 1999; Moriana and Fereres 2002; Intrigliolo and Castel 2006) have reported
    for the evaluation of alternative indirect physiological indicators. Thus, the
    specific objectives of the present work were: (i) to assess the sensitivity of
    xanthophyll, chlorophyll and structure-sensitive spectral indices to water stress
    conditions; (ii) to explore the relationship between the spectral indices and
    Ψs, gs and CWSI for each of the fruit tree crop species studied, and; (iii) to
    identify which of the spectral indices could more accurately track the water stress
    effects on trees when the five fruit tree crop species were assessed together.
    Materials and methods Site characteristics and irrigation treatments The study
    was performed in July 2010 in the same 42-ha commercial farm described in Pérez-Sarmiento
    et al. (2010) and Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013), located in the Mula Valley (37°55′N,
    1°26′W), Murcia (Spain), where the climate is considered as semi-arid Mediterranean.
    The annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and rainfall for the experimental
    season were 1182 and 445 mm, respectively. The farm consisted of five orchards
    planted in 1999 with almond (Prunus dulcis cv. Garrigues and cv. Ramillete), apricot
    (Prunus armeniaca cv. Bulida), peach (Prunus persica cv. Catherine), orange (Citrus
    sinensis cv. Lane Late) and lemon (Citrus x limon cv. Fino 49) trees. Each orchard
    was divided into 2–4 irrigation units, which enabled different irrigation managements
    and the development of contrasting plant water status. The number of irrigation
    units and other characteristics such as tree spacing, canopy ground cover and
    number of emitters per tree used within each orchard are shown in Table 2. At
    the time of the study (July), almond, peach, lemon and orange trees were being
    irrigated daily. In order to generate different levels of tree water status in
    these orchards, irrigation was withheld for eight days prior to the measurements
    in one single irrigation unit in the almond, lemon and orange orchards, and in
    two irrigation units in the peach orchard. Apricot trees, on the other hand, had
    already been harvested and water had not been applied since 24 days before the
    measurements date. Thus, to generate different water status in the apricot orchard,
    irrigation was resumed in one single unit eight days prior to the measurements.

    tree for each of the orchards in the study. The number of irrigation units established
    per orchard is also shown Full size table Airborne imagery and image processing
    Multispectral images were acquired on July 7th at 13.00 h (local time; UTC + 1
    h) with a 6-band multispectral camera (MCA-6, Tetracam Inc., California, USA)
    installed on a two-meter wingspan fixed–wing UAS platform. The image resolution
    was 1280 × 1024 pixels with 10-bit radiometric resolution and optical focal length
    of 8.5 mm. The UAS (mX-SIGHT, UAV Services and Systems, Germany) was controlled
    by an autopilot for autonomous flying (AP04, UAV Navigation, Madrid, Spain) following
    a flight plan of around 1 h at 350 m above the ground and 5.8 kg take-off weight
    using waypoints to acquire imagery from the entire orchards under study. At this
    flight altitude, the camera delivered a ground resolution of 200 mm pixel-size.
    The autopilot had a dual CPU controlling an integrated attitude heading reference
    system (AHRS) based on a L1 GPS board, 3-axis accelerometers, gyros and a 3-axis
    magnetometer (Berni et al. 2009). The ground control station and the UAS were
    radio-linked, transmitting position, altitude and status data at 20 Hz frequency.
    The bandsets chosen for this study were centered at 515, 530, 570, 670, 700 and
    800 nm (10 nm bandwidths). The high-resolution of the multispectral imagery enabled
    the identification of every single crown within the orchard. A region of interest
    was established in the center of each crown to extract pure vegetation reflectance
    and to avoid soil background effect. Then, the different indices were calculated
    at the object level (crown). The average crown reflectance derived from the imagery
    of well-watered and deficit-irrigated trees for each of the five tree crop species
    studied is shown in Fig. 1. Reflectance values obtained for the six spectral bands
    enabled the calculation of vegetation indices sensitive to variations in canopy
    structure, chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigment content (Table 1). Fig. 1 Average
    crown reflectance derived from the imagery of well-watered (WW) and deficit irrigated
    (DI) trees for each of the five fruit tree crops studied Full size image The Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to track changes in canopy structure.
    Effect of treatments on the leaf chlorophyll concentration was assessed with the
    red edge index (R670/R700), which uses the reflectance at 670 and 700 nm wavelengths,
    and the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized by
    the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI). Finally, PRI, PRI
    using reflectance at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)] instead of 530 and PRInorm were also
    determined. The spectral indices were compared with Tc and CWSI, which were determined
    in a parallel study by Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) in the same trees. Thermal
    images were obtained from a thermal camera (MIRICLE 307, Thermoteknix Systems
    Ldt., Cambridge, UK) also installed on the UAS during the study. Field data collection
    Concomitant measurements of Ψs and gs were taken during the flight in selected
    irrigated and non-irrigated trees from each species. Measurements were carried
    out by five teams composed of 3–5 people each with experience taking in-field
    determinations. The Ψs determinations were carried out with five Scholander pressure
    chambers (Model 600 Pressure Chamber, PMS Instrument Company, Albany, USA) in
    two mature leaves per tree covered with aluminum foil for at least 90 min before
    measurements. The number of trees used for the Ψs and other in-field determinations
    within each irrigation unit are shown in Table 3. The gs was measured in 2-4 sunny
    leaves per tree using a diffusion porometer (SC-1 porometer, Decagon, WA, USA)
    in the lemon, orange and peach crops and a portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a LI-6400/40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer
    and a LICOR 6400-01 CO2 injector in the almond and apricot crops. Leaf gas exchange
    was measured on fully expanded leaves placed in a 200 mm2 leaf cuvette. The CO2
    concentration in the cuvette was maintained at 400 µmol·mol−1 (≈ambient CO2 concentration).
    Measurements were performed at saturating light intensity of 1800 µmol·m−2·s−1
    and at ambient temperature and relative humidity. The airflow was set to 300 μmol·s−1,
    which enabled also recording the leaf net CO2 assimilation. Additionally, three
    leaf samples were taken from selected irrigated and non-irrigated trees of all
    the species with the exception of peach to determine the leaf chlorophyll content
    (Table 3). For the leaf chlorophyll determination, approximately 30 mg leaves
    were sampled from the same, avoiding major veins. Chlorophyll was eluted from
    the leaf by submerging them in 3 ml of N, N-dymethylformamide in the dark for
    at least 72 h. The amount of absorbance was read at 647 nm and 664.5 nm with a
    Thermo Spectronic (model Helios alpha, UVA No. 092009, England) and used to calculate
    fresh mass-based chlorophyll content according to the equations of Inskeep and
    Bloom (1985). Table 3 Number of trees in which measurements of stem water potential
    (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf net CO2 assimilation (photosynthesis) and
    leaf chlorophyll content (Chl) were taken within each irrigation treatment Full
    size table Weather conditions at the time of flights were recorded with a portable
    weather station (Model WXT510, Vaisala, Finland) placed just outside the orchard.
    Mean values for the air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed at
    the time of flight were 31.9 °C, 3.76 kPa and 1.9 m s−1, respectively. Statistical
    analysis Sensitivity of the spectral indices related to the water stress conditions
    was assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis (sensitivity defined as signal
    to noise ratio) based on that proposed by Goldhamer and Fereres (2001) and comparison
    with traditional indicators of plant water status. When there were significant
    differences between treatments, the value “signal” for Ψs, Tc and the vegetation
    indices was calculated as the ratio between the average value for the water-stressed
    and control treatments while, for gs, it was obtained from the ratio between the
    average value for the control and water-stressed treatments. The “noise” was defined
    as the average coefficient of variation (CV) among trees from the same treatments
    as the signal value. The relationship between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs
    or CWSI for each of the crop species studied, as well as when data from all the
    crops were pooled together, was explored by correlation analyses. Results and
    discussion Sensitivity of the indicators to detect water-stressed areas Results
    obtained from the sensitivity analysis showed that Tc was the indicator with the
    lowest variability and highest sensitivity in three out of the four crop species
    included in the analysis (Table 4). Data from the orange orchard were not included
    in the analysis due to the non-significant differences in plant water status observed
    between treatments. Apricot was the only crop in which Ψs resulted in the most
    sensitive indicator to the imposed irrigation treatments, followed by PRI(570–515)
    and Tc. These results were mainly due to the low CV observed in Tc within trees
    from the same treatment in the almond, lemon and peach orchards, and the low tree
    to tree variability observed in Ψs in apricot trees at 13:00 h compared to the
    other indicators (Table 4). Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) determined Tc in trees
    of the same orchards used in this experiment at different times (09:00, 11:00
    and 13:00 h). Their results (Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2013) showed, in fact, that
    apricot was the species with the highest variability in Tc at any of the three
    measurement times and that CV within this crop was lowest at 11:00 h. Taking this
    information into account, the analysis was repeated for this species with Ψs,
    gs and Tc data obtained at 11:00 h (Table 4). For this time frame, results revealed
    that sensitivity of Tc was higher than that of Ψs and gs (no multispectral data
    were available at 11:00 h). Table 4 Sensitivity analysis of the stem water potential
    (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band
    at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) for each of the
    species assessed in the experiment Full size table Interestingly, PRI(570–515)
    was found to be the second most sensitive indicator to the imposed water-stressed
    conditions in all the cases. The results obtained for PRI(570–515) contrast with
    those obtained for PRInorm which, along with gs, was the indicator with the highest
    noise and least sensitivity. The multispectral indices NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI, R700/R670
    and PRI570 had, in general, intermediate values of sensitivity (Table 4). Relationships
    between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs or CWSI within each orchard Scaling up
    observations of plant water status from the leaf to the field, or even the farm
    level, requires validation of remote sensing data with ground-truth data. Here,
    data obtained from the multispectral imagery of selected trees within each orchard
    were compared with those of in-field measurements of Ψs and gs as well as CWSI,
    which had been already validated for this particular farm by Gonzalez-Dugo et
    al. (2013). Within the Citrus species, only indices sensitive to leaf chlorophyll
    content were significantly correlated with Ψs, gs or CWSI (Table 5). When R700/R670
    was plotted against gs, orange trees yielded a coefficient of determination (r2)
    of 0.62 (p < 0.05). In lemon trees, however, R700/R670 and TCARI/OSAVI were significantly
    correlated with Ψs (r2 = 0.41; p < 0.05) and CWSI (r2 = 0.64; p < 0.001), respectively.
    The structural and photochemical indices were not correlated with Ψs, gs or CWSI
    in any of the Citrus species, which could be related to the small range of plant
    water status reached in these two orchards compared to the others. The evaluation
    of structure, xanthophyll and chlorophyll sensitive indices in orange trees to
    detect plant water stress has been also studied by Zarco-Tejada et al. (2012).
    These authors found that in spite of the wide range of Ψs reached in that study
    (from −0.5 to −2.0 MPa) compared to the work presented here, PRI, TCARI/OSAVI
    and NDVI, although sensitive, were poorly correlated with Ψs. In that case, the
    PRI using the band 515 as a reference, proposed by Hernández-Clemente et al. (2011),
    and the structure-sensitive indicators RDVI, MTVI1 or TVI were shown as more robust
    water stress indicators for orange trees. Other recent studies (Romero-Trigueros
    et al. 2016), however, have reported significant changes in NDVI in grapefruit
    and mandarin trees as a consequence of short-term changes in Ψs. Table 5 Coefficients
    of determination obtained for the relationships between the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band at 515 nm
    [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) and the more classical
    water stress indicators: stem water potential (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs)
    and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) for each of the crops and cultivars studied
    Full size table Better correlations than in Citrus were obtained for the crops
    from the genus Prunus (Table 5). In almond trees, PRI(570–515), PRI, NDVI and
    TCARI/OSAVI indices were statistically correlated with Ψs, gs and CWSI with r2
    ranging from 0.32 to 0.79. The Ψs was better correlated with PRI(570–515) and
    PRI (r2 = 0.53 and 0.52, respectively; p < 0.001). The gs yielded the highest
    correlation with TCARI/OSAVI (r2 = 0.65; p < 0.001) while CWSI yielded the highest
    correlation with PRI(570–515) and NDVI (r2 = 0.79 and 0.70, respectively; p <
    0.001). Measurements of photosynthesis taken in almond trees were highly correlated
    with TCARI/OSAVI (Fig. 2). No correlations, however, were obtained with the other
    chlorophyll sensitive indicator, R700/R670. When comparing results from the two
    almond cultivars used in the study (cv. ‘Garrigues’ and cv. ‘Ramillete’), the
    relationships obtained between PRI(570–515) or TCARI/OSAVI and Ψs, gs and CWSI
    were similar. Nevertheless, PRI and NDVI relationships with Ψs, gs and CWSI were
    weaker for cv. ‘Ramillete’ (r2 ranging from 0.13 to 0.68) than for cv. ‘Garrigues’
    (r2 ranging from 0.46 to 0.89). Fig. 2 Relationships between photosynthesis (μmol
    m−2 s−1) and TCARI/OSAVI obtained in almond (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.001) and apricot
    (r2 = 0.75; p < 0.001) trees Full size image Apricot trees were in the stage of
    postharvest when the experiment was performed. In contrast to that obtained for
    almond trees, no correlations were found between Ψs, gs or CWSI and any of the
    PRI formulations studied. NDVI was significantly correlated with gs (r2 = 0.42;
    p < 0.05) and CWSI (r2 = 0.69; p < 0.01) but not with Ψs. Among the spectral indices,
    TCARI/OSAVI was the indicator that yielded the best correlations in apricot trees
    with Ψs, gs and CWSI (r2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.88; p < 0.001). TCARI/OSAVI is
    an index related to the chlorophyll content and not an index directly linked with
    the water status. Nevertheless, all the trees in this study were managed similarly
    before the beginning of the experiment. As aforementioned, apricot had already
    been harvested and water had not been applied for 24 days before the measurements
    date. In this case, and in order to increase the range of water status for this
    crop, irrigation was resumed in one single unit eight days prior to the measurements.
    Thus, the variation that is observed in the index might be related to the contrasted
    water status and the natural variability observed in the field. As also observed
    in almond trees, TCARI/OSAVI was highly correlated with photosynthesis (Fig. 2).
    Differences observed in the relationship between TCARI/OSAVI and photosynthesis
    between apricot and almond trees may be related to differences in the phenological
    stage between these two crops. Results obtained in the peach orchard were somewhat
    different from those reported for almond and apricot trees (Table 5). High correlations
    were obtained for all the spectral indices with the exception of PRI and TCARI/OSAVI.
    PRI(570–515), PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI yielded similar r2 compared with CWSI
    (0.61 to 0.68; p < 0.001). PRInorm and R700/R670, however, were the spectral indices
    with the highest correlations with Ψs and gs (r2 from 0.81 to 0.93; p < 0.001).
    The PRInorm has been reported as a more reliable water stress indicator (r2 =
    0.82 when compared against Ψs) than PRI (r2 = 0.53) in grapevines (Zarco-Tejada
    et al. 2013). Here, that was the case for peach trees but the opposite was observed
    for almond trees (Table 5). Most of the studies found in the literature assessing
    the use of spectral information to detect plant water stress have been conducted
    in one particular crop, generally crops of high economic interest such as olive
    (Berni et al. 2009; Suárez et al. 2008; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2004) and grapevines
    (Gago et al. 2015 and references therein). In the present study, multi-spectral
    indices were assessed in a farm composed of crops with different canopy architecture,
    nutrient status and phenology, which meant that a specific indicator performed
    better in some crops than in others. The use of a single multi-spectral indicator
    that would be sensitive enough to variations in the plant water status of several
    crops would facilitate the assessment of irrigation needs at the farm scale. Relationships
    between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs or CWSI at farm scale Pooling data from
    all the fruit tree crops species together, PRI(570–515), PRInorm, R700/R670 and
    NDVI showed a statistically significant correlation with Ψs with r2 ranging between
    0.15 and 0.65 (Table 6). Linear relationships were found for PRI(570–515), PRInorm
    and NDVI while R700/R670 was best-fitted by a polynomial curve (Fig. 3). Among
    these indicators, PRI(570–515) and NDVI were those which yielded the highest r2
    (0.61 and 0.65, respectively; p < 0.001). Table 6 Coefficients of determination

    Although weak, statistically significant correlations were also found between
    PRI(570–515), PRI and NDVI with gs (r2 of 0.16–0.18; p < 0.01), and between PRI(570–515),
    PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI with CWSI (r2 ranging from 0.19 to 0.33; p < 0.01)
    (Table 6). Mean chlorophyll content within the farm ranged from 0.10 µg mm−2 in
    lemon trees to 0.41 µg mm−2 in almond trees (Table 7). Both, the TCARI/OSAVI and
    the R700/R670 indices were statistically correlated with leaf chlorophyll concentration
    when data from all the species were pooled together (Fig. 4). The red edge ratio
    yielded higher r2 (0.67; p < 0.001) than TCARI/OSAVI (0.40; p < 0.001). Table

    for all the crop species together Full size image The PRInorm, which was originally
    formulated to deal with contrasting canopy architecture and pigment content, did
    not perform as was expected. The non-linear relationship observed between water
    potential and the red edge ratio (R700/R670) shown in Fig. 3 might be responsible
    for the low performance observed for this index. Results obtained for the NDVI
    were also surprising considering that water restrictions were just applied during
    eight days and considerable canopy structure effects were not expected. Instead
    of that, NDVI yielded the best correlations with Ψs. Recent studies, however,
    have also shown a response of NDVI to short-term changes in Ψs (Romero-Trigueros
    et al. 2016). Overall, NDVI and the PRI(570–515) were the indices able to retrieve
    water status when the five fruit tree crops species were assessed together. These
    results suggest that these indicators could be used to detect water-stressed areas
    in farms composed of a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology and
    canopy architecture. Conclusions The work presented here evaluated the capability
    of a series of narrow-band indices sensitive to biophysical parameters of different
    nature to track water stress effects on a farm composed of five fruit tree crop
    species. Structure, chlorophyll and xanthophyll sensitive indices were all able
    to detect differences between irrigation treatments. Nevertheless, not all the
    indices were correlated with Ψs in all the fruit tree crop species studied. Weak
    or no correlations were found for the Citrus species. While best correlations
    in almond trees were obtained with the PRI and PRI(570–515) indices, TCARI/OSAVI
    was the index that best correlated with Ψs in apricot trees. Both chlorophyll
    and xanthophyll sensitive indices, on the other hand, correlated well with Ψs
    in peach trees. Comparison of the sensitivity analysis performed for direct and
    indirect physiological water stress indicators measured in the study, pointed
    out Tc and PRI(570–515) as the first and second most sensitive indicators to the
    imposed water conditions in all the crops with the exception of apricot trees.
    In fact, PRI(570–515), along with NDVI, were the spectral indices that better
    tracked differences in plant water status (r2 = 0.61 and 0.65, with Ψs, respectively)
    between treatments when all the fruit tree crop species were assessed together.
    These results demonstrate the feasibility of using multi-spectral narrow-band
    indices (i.e. 10 nm bandwidths) acquired from miniature cameras on board a UAS
    to retrieve water status for a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology
    and canopy architecture. Abbreviations gs : Stomatal Conductance Ψs : Stem Water

    \ the literature on applications of remote sensing for monitoring soil- and\n\
    crop- water status for irrigation purposes. The review is organized into two main\
    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\
    \ sensing approaches for precision irrigation\nto estimate crop water status,\
    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\
    \ canopy structure (height and Leaf Area Index);\n(iv) crop status; (v) canopy\
    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\
    \ photo to grayscale image, and then conversion to false colors. The upper part\
    \ of the image\n(darker soil color) corresponds to the most drained part of the\
    \ ﬁeld during the winter season, which\nwas then excluded from measurements. Results\
    \ of the experiment are published by Alvino et al. [83],\nreporting the effect\
    \ of shallow water tables on peach trees grafted on three peach seedlings.\nThere\
    \ was was a pioneering attempt to achieve airborne RS, unfortunately not supported\

    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\

    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\

    Submitted: 19 October 2010  Accepted: 26 November 2010   Published: 1 February
    2011 Abstract The continuous monitoring of crop water status is key to the sustainable
    management of water stress situations. Two deficit irrigation (DI) treatments
    were studied during the maximum evapotranspirative demand period in an orange
    orchard (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. cv. Navelina): sustained deficit irrigation
    irrigated at 55% crop evapotranspiration (ETC), and low-frequency deficit irrigation
    treatment, in which the plants were irrigated according to stem water potential
    at midday (Ψstem). Additionally, a control treatment irrigated at 100% of ETC
    was established. The daily canopy temperature (TC) was measured with an infrared
    thermometer camera together with measurements of trunk diameter fluctuations (TDF),
    Ψstem and stomatal conductance (gS). The time course of all physiological parameters
    and their relationships were analysed, confirming that canopy air temperature
    differential (TC – Ta) variations and TDF are suitable approaches for determining
    the water stress. In addition, the maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and TC – Ta showed
    high sensitivity to water stress in comparison to Ψstem and gS. Significant relationships
    were found among MDS and TC – Ta with Ψstem and gS, for monitoring the crop water
    status by means of MDS vs Ψstem and TC – Ta vs Ψstem. Thus, the combination of
    these techniques would be useful for making scheduling decisions on irrigation
    in orchards with high variability in plant water stress. Additional keywords:

    Get rights and content Abstract In the Mediterranean arc, vines for wine production
    are mainly grown without the support of irrigation. Under such conditions, site
    variables affecting the extent and seasonal timing of water deficits are the dominant
    environmental constraints for grape production. Moreover, water availability and
    vine water status are the factors most comprehensively determining fruit composition
    and, thus, wine quality. Therefore, monitoring the extent of water stress in vines
    might be a valuable tool for the optimisation of grape yield and quality. The
    objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the reflectance
    based Water Index (WI) to estimate vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels.
    The study was conducted on Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay potted plants submitted
    to contrasting water availability and in ten commercial vineyards in the D.O.
    Penedès region (Catalonia, Spain) over two consecutive years (2007–2008). In potted
    plants, differences in water supply were translated into differences in net photosynthetic
    carbon assimilation, stomatal conductance (gs) and WI, despite similar predawn
    water potentials (Ψp). There was a negative close correlation between WI and gs,
    although the relationship was treatment dependent (r2 = 0.81 and r2 = 0.95, for
    control and deficit plants, respectively). Similarly the leaf to air temperature
    difference was inversely related to gs (r2 = 0.51). In the field study there were
    significant differences in Ψp among vineyards and between years and indicated
    that vines experienced moderate to severe water stress. Water availability determined
    vine canopy development as indicated by the close relationship between the Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index and in Ψp (r2 = 0.57). The canopy to air temperature
    difference (determined with an infrared thermometer at midday) was inversely correlated
    with WI with r2 = 0.45 and r2 = 0.56 in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Thus, the
    reflectance based Water Index effectively tracked variation in both leaf stomatal
    conductance and canopy transpiration under a range of moderate to severe water
    stress. The results are discussed in relation to the potential application of
    WI to irrigation scheduling and to monitoring vineyard performance. Research highlights
    ▶ Contrasting water supply promotes changes in both stomatal conductance and WI.
    ▶ WI closely follows diurnal changes in stomatal conductance at the leaf level.
    ▶ Predawn water potential indicates moderate to severe water stress in field grown
    vines. ▶ WI relates to the midday canopy to air temperature difference in field
    grown vines. ▶ WI tracks variation in canopy transpiration under moderate to severe
    water stress. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Vitis viniferaStomatal

    Water is the most limiting resource for crop growth in the Mediterranean region,
    rainfall is scarce and irregularly distributed along the year and climate change
    models predict even more arid conditions in the next decades (Bates et al., 2008,
    Jones et al., 2005, Schultz and Stoll, 2010). In many dry lands of the Mediterranean
    arc, vines for wine production are grown without the support of irrigation. Under
    such conditions, site variables affecting the extent and seasonal timing of water
    deficits are the dominant environmental constraints for grape production (Williams
    and Matthews, 1990). In the last decades, irrigation has been introduced in some
    areas in order to reduce drought impacts on yield. Concurrently, and due to increasing
    water scarcity, many efforts have been devoted to the development of appropriate
    irrigation strategies (e.g. deficit irrigation, partial root drying) that improve
    the productivity of water use while ensuring berry quality (Chaves et al., 2010,
    Cifré et al., 2005, Dry et al., 2001, Medrano et al., 2003). Therefore, monitoring
    the extent of water stress, both under irrigated and rain-fed conditions, might
    be a valuable tool for the optimisation of grape yield and quality. There is ample
    literature on the effects of water deficits on vegetative and reproductive growth
    and yield in grapevines (Chaves et al., 2010, Choné et al., 2001a, Matthews and
    Anderson, 1989, Medrano et al., 2003, Schultz and Matthews, 1988, Van Leeuwen
    and Seguin, 1994). Moreover, it has been recognized that the water supply to the
    vines and their concurrent water status are the factors most comprehensively determining
    berry ripening and composition and, thus, wine quality (Chaves et al., 2010, Choné
    et al., 2001a, Koundouras et al., 2006, Matthews and Anderson, 1988, Medrano et
    al., 2003, Seguin, 1983, Van Leeuwen and Seguin, 1994). In grapevines, as well
    as in other fruit crops, fruit quality benefits from a certain level of water
    deficit which facilitates to balance vegetative and reproductive growth and the
    flow of carbohydrates to reproductive structures. Since this balance relies on
    mechanisms that regulate carbon assimilation and partitioning, physiological indicators
    of grapevine water status has been proposed as better indicators for an effective
    crop management (Chaves et al., 2010, Cifré et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2002).
    Several physiological indicators are used to assess plant water status, or stress,
    with leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and transpiration being the most
    widely used in viticulture. Leaf water potential is a standard indicator of plant
    water status, but predawn and stem water potential are considered better indicators
    in vines (Choné et al., 2001b). Stomatal closure is one of the first responses
    of leaves to reduced soil water availability (Chaves et al., 2010, Flexas et al.,
    2002, Jones et al., 2002, Lovisolo et al., 2010). In grapevines, stomatal regulation
    is a complex phenomenon involving chemical (hormones), hydraulic (cavitation)
    and even electrical signals (Lovisolo et al., 2010). Indeed, grapevines were among
    the first plant species in which a direct role of ABA in stomatal closure was
    reported (Loveys and Kriedemann, 1974, Lovisolo et al., 2002). Grapevine stomata
    also strongly respond to plant water status: positive correlations between predawn
    water potential and gs have been generally found in grapevines subjected to water
    deficits (Correia et al., 1995). In addition, grapevines subjected to severe water
    stress have shown decreased hydraulic conductivity (Lovisolo et al., 2002, Schultz
    and Matthews, 1988) mainly as a result of drought-induced cavitation (Lovisolo
    et al., 2008, Schultz, 2003). Thus, it appears that stomatal conductance might
    be a good indicator of water status in grapevines (Cifré et al., 2005, Jones et
    al., 2002). While a decrease in stomatal conductance is a short term response
    to reduced water availability, reduced vegetative growth occurs under long standing
    water deficits (Chaves et al., 2010). In grapevine, shoot growth has been reported
    to decrease in response to water deficits (Dry and Loveys, 1999, Matthews et al.,
    1987, Pellegrino et al., 2005, Schultz and Matthews, 1988) and, in particular,
    decreases in leaf area and intercepted light have been used as indicators of grapevine
    water status (Pellegrino et al., 2005). Moreover, vineyard leaf area influences
    fruit ripening rate, fruit characteristics and, thus, wine quality (Downey et
    al., 2004, Smart et al., 1982). Therefore, measures of vine canopy structure might
    be used to estimate differences in berry yield and quality brought about by variation
    in water availability. The use of airborne remote sensing as a means of monitoring
    vine canopy characteristics is attracting interest because of opportunities for
    cost-effective generation of spatial data amenable to precision agriculture activities
    (Hall et al., 2002). According to the physiological and growth responses of grapevine
    to water deficits mentioned above, there are currently two types of remote sensing
    approaches that might assist in grapevine water stress detection, one based on
    radiometric surface temperature detection derived from thermal band imagery and
    a second approach that relies on the ability of indices derived from surface reflectance
    data to assess plant water status or their effects on growth. Current remote sensing
    methods in precision viticulture use multispectral airborne sensors to detect
    changes in grapevine canopy vigour through the use of vegetation indices derived
    from reflectance in the red and near-infrared regions of the spectrum (Hall et
    al., 2002, Johnson et al., 2001, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005). In particular, the
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), have proven useful to estimate
    vineyard leaf area index (m2 leaf area per m2 of ground) and leaf area per vine
    (m2 per vine) (Dobrowski et al., 2002, Johnson, 2003). These data, in conjunction
    with spatial determinations of yield, have been used to assist as management support
    for selective harvesting (Hall et al., 2002, Johnson et al., 2001, Lamb et al.,
    2004). Thus, so far, remote sensing techniques have been mainly used to target
    harvesting strategies according to canopy structure (vegetative growth). Reflectance
    indices such as the NDVI or the simple ratio (SR), are useful for characterizing
    canopy structure and pigment concentration, and, thus, potential photosynthetic
    activity, but have proven less useful for monitoring photosynthetic functioning
    under stress conditions (Gamon et al., 1995, Gamon et al., 1997). Thus, these
    indices have proven less useful for monitoring plant physiological status (e.g.
    photosynthesis and/or water status) under stress conditions. Leaf or canopy temperature
    is highly dependent on the rate of transpiration and can therefore be used as
    an indicator of stomatal opening. Several studies have assessed the potential
    of monitoring canopy temperature using thermal infrared radiation to assist in
    crop water stress detection (Berni et al., 2009, Jackson et al., 1981). In vineyards,
    this technique has been widely studied and developed mainly at ground level using
    thermal cameras: Jones et al. (2002) and Grant et al. (2007) have shown reasonable
    estimations of whole canopy gs based on thermometric determinations. At larger
    scales, Möller et al. (2007) have recently showed improved accuracy in estimates
    of vine water status and stomatal conductance by combining thermal and visible
    imagery. Besides the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the near
    and short wave infrared region present several water absorption features that
    might be useful for the detection of plant water status. The longer wavelengths,
    such as the 1450 and 1900 nm water absorption bands, make poor indicators for
    estimating plant water content due to the low incoming solar energy and high levels
    of interference by atmospheric water vapour (Sims and Gamon, 2003). Several studies
    suggest that the ideal wavelengths for predicting water content are wavelengths
    with weak absorption coefficients that allow the radiation to penetrate far into
    canopies, providing a suitable dynamic range (Peñuelas et al., 1993, Serrano et
    al., 2000, Sims and Gamon, 2003). In particular, the Water Index (WI) (Peñuelas
    et al., 1993, Peñuelas et al., 1997) derived from the near infrared water absorption
    band centered at 970 nm (WI = R900/R970) has been tested at the leaf, canopy and
    landscape levels. At the leaf level, the WI was reported to closely track changes
    in leaf water content and gs during drought (Peñuelas et al., 1993, Peñuelas et
    al., 1997). Subsequently, Serrano et al. (2000) and Sims and Gamon (2003) showed
    the usefulness of the WI to track variation in relative water content (RWC) at
    the canopy and landscape scales using airborne sensors. Moreover, recent studies
    have documented good relationships between the WI and water fluxes at the canopy/landscape
    level in Mediterranean vegetation (Claudio et al., 2006, Fuentes et al., 2006).
    The feasibility of the WI to assess water status in grapevines has not yet been
    fully addressed. Cifré et al. (2005) suggested that, because the development of
    the 970 nm signal entails substantial variation in water content (Peñuelas et
    al., 1993), its use for water stress assessment in near-isohydric grapevine cultivars,
    capable of maintaining RWC within narrow ranges, might be not suitable. Indeed,
    in irrigated vineyards, Rodríguez-Pérez et al. (2007) did not find consistent
    relationships between the WI and stem water potential or equivalent water thickness
    (ratio of mass of water to leaf area) at the canopy level. Nonetheless, in the
    Mediterranean arc, rain-fed vineyards usually experience periods of moderate to
    severe water stress and, thus, the use of the WI might be of potential interest.
    Moreover, because the WI has been reported to respond to both changes in water
    content and vegetation structure (Serrano et al., 2000) its use under rain-fed
    conditions might be of potential interest since, as mentioned above, water deficits
    affect both water status and canopy structure (vegetative growth). Thus, we tested
    the ability of the near infrared based WI derived from reflectance spectra to
    determine vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels. The study was conducted
    on potted plants and in commercial vineyards over two consecutive years under
    varying soil water availability. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Leaf level study
    The study was conducted on two-year-old plants Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay
    grafted on R-110. Plants were planted in mid March in 10 L pots with a mixture
    of sand and peat turf (1:1, V:V) and placed in a greenhouse. During the growing
    period, minimum and maximum temperatures within the greenhouse were 18.3 °C and
    27.7 °C, respectively, and relative humidity varied between 86% and 20%. Plants
    were daily irrigated at field capacity with tap water. Additionally, twice a week
    all potted plants received 0.3 L of a full Hoagland solution (Hoagland and Arnon,
    1950) to promote growth. Lateral shoots, buds, and young flowers were removed,
    leaving only winter buds and leaves. On May 15, irrigation treatments were initiated
    by applying different amounts of water per plant and day: irrigation was provided
    twice a day during 10 min using 4 L h−1 (control plants) 2 L h−1 (deficit plants)
    drippers (i.e. approximately 1300 and 650 ml per plant and day). There were 6
    plants per treatment. Measurements were carried out two months after initiating
    the irrigation treatments when plants were about 1.2 m high. Three plants per
    treatment were placed outside the greenhouse and diurnal cycles of gas exchange
    and reflectance measurements were carried out on July 7. Predawn water potential
    (Ψp) was determined using a Scholander pressure chamber (Soilmoisture 3005, Soil
    Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) on 3 leaves (1 leaf plant−1) similar to
    those where gas exchange and leaf reflectance were determined. Six fully expanded
    leaves (2 leaves per plant; 6 leaves per treatment) were measured approximately
    every 2 h under current ambient photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air
    temperature (Tair) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) conditions. Leaves had a
    similar appearance although different orientations (light exposure). Net CO2 assimilation
    rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E) and leaf temperature (Tleaf),
    as well as environmental conditions (PPFD, Tair and VPD), were measured with a
    portable gas exchange system CIRAS-2 (PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA) at
    a CO2 concentration in the cuvette of 360 ppm. Afterwards, leaf reflectance was
    determined using a spectroradiometer UNISPEC (PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA,
    USA) with a 2.3 mm diameter bifurcated fibre optic (model UNI410, PP Systems,
    Havervill, MA, USA). The detector samples 256 bands at roughly even intervals
    (average band-to-band spacing 3.3 nm) within a 400–1100 nm effective spectral
    range. The Water Index was derived from reflectance measurements as: (1) where,
    R indicates spectral reflectance and subindices are the respective wavelengths
    in nanometres. Above ground biomass and leaf area were determined on each plant
    at the end of the experiment (i.e., after conducting the diurnal cycles). Analyses
    of variance were carried out using the statistical package SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
    Chicago, IL, USA). Water availability (control or deficit) and time of day were
    considered as sources of variation. Means were compared using the Bonferroni''s
    test and correlation and regression analyses were used to study the relationships
    among several variables. 2.2. Field canopy study A field study was conducted during
    two consecutive years (2007–2008) in ten commercial vineyards in the D.O. Penedès
    region (Catalonia, Spain, 1°48′22″W; 41°28′54″N). The region has a Mediterranean
    climate with average annual temperatures ranging from 11 to 15 °C, average annual
    precipitation ranging from 600 to 900 mm. In the last ten year series (1998–2007)
    cumulative rainfall and evapotranspiration were 431 mm and 900 mm, respectively.
    Weather data during the study period were obtained in a nearby weather station
    located at Hostalets de Pierola (1°48′31″W; 41°31′59″N). The study was conducted
    on V. vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay plants of K5V1 clone. Vines were trained to Double
    Royat. Vine age and rootstocks differed among vineyards (see Table 1). Plantation
    density ranged from 2083 to 3704 vines ha−1 with variable vine spacing between
    and within rows. The main characteristics of the vineyards are reported in Table
    1. In each plot, 3 vines with contrasting vigour were chosen to carry out measurements
    at the stage of veraison, when vines attained full canopy expansion. Thus, measurements
    were carried out in 30 plants (3 per plot). Table 1. Characteristics of the vineyards

    water potential (Ψp) was determined between 3 h prior to sunrise using a Scholander
    pressure chamber (Soilmoisture 3005, Soil Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA).
    On each vine a Ψp measurement was taken from one mature non senescing leaf from
    the central third of the outer part of the canopy. Additionally, canopy temperature
    of field vines was determined at midday (solar noon) using a hand-held infrared
    thermometer (Scheduler, SN 870401 in 2007 and ST Pro Plus, Raytek Corp., Santa
    Cruz, CA, USA in 2008) positioned at 20 cm of the canopy and held at an angle
    of 60° so that the field of view was approximately 0.25 m2. Canopy temperature
    in 2008 was measured on both the sun exposed and the shaded side of each vine
    while in 2007 measurements of canopy temperature were taken on the sun exposed
    surface. Canopy radiance was measured over each vine using the spectroradiometer
    and the fibre optic previously described fitted with a 12° field of view foreoptics
    (UNI-710, PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA). Measurements were expressed as
    apparent reflectance after standardizing by the irradiance determined using a
    cosine corrected detector lens (UNI-685 PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA) positioned
    above the canopy. Data were collected on cloudless days between 11:00 h and 13:00
    h (i.e., solar noon) in order to minimize disturbances from the atmosphere and
    changes in solar elevation. The radiometer was mounted on a tripod and held in
    a nadir orientation 0.75 m above the canopy. Four scans were averaged for each
    vine. Besides the WI, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated
    using narrow-band reflectance values as follows: (2) where R indicates reflectance
    and the subindices indicate the wavelength in nm. Analyses of variance, correlation
    and regression were carried out using the statistical package SPSS 14.0 and SPSS
    17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Plots were considered as sources of variation
    in ANOVAs. Means were compared using the Bonferroni''s test and correlation and
    regression analyses were used to study the relationships among several variables.
    3. Results 3.1. Leaf level study There were no significant differences between
    treatments in Ψp, although Ψp was slightly higher in control (−0.37 ± 0.07 MPa;
    mean ± sem) than in deficit plants (−0.42 ± 0.09 MPa; mean ± sem). Similarly,
    there were no significant changes in above ground biomass in response to changes
    in water availability, although leaf area per plant was slightly (p < 0.10) higher
    in control than in deficit plants (data not shown). Environmental conditions during
    the diurnal cycle of measurements, particularly air temperature and water vapor
    pressure deficit, were typical of Mediterranean conditions (Fig. 1). Decrease
    in air temperature at midday was due to the effects of sea breeze, since the experiment
    was carried out in a coastal zone. On the other hand, the unusual temperature
    peaks experienced late in the afternoon were due to the rearrangement of plants
    on a sea-breeze sheltered location in order to avoid shade from a nearby building.
    Air vapour pressure deficits (VPD) reached high values at midday (3 kPa) and were
    even higher when plants were relocated to the wind-sheltered location (∼3.5 kPa).

    and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on July 7, 2007 for the experiment on potted
    plants. Values are mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 6). There were large
    changes in incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at the leaf surface
    along the day with significant decreases at the central hours of the day in deficit
    plants (Fig. 2A). Leaf incident PPFD was maximum at midday in control plants (1915
    ± 365 μmol m−2 s−1) while in stressed plants leaf incident PPFD reached its peak
    at midmorning (1666 ± 129 μmol m−2 s−1) and started to decline afterwards, indicating
    substantial changes in leaf angle. Leaf incident PPFD was ∼25% lower in deficit
    than in control plants from midday to the early afternoon. Thus, in deficit plants,
    leaves tended to reduce light interception during midday. As expected, diurnal
    patterns of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) followed changes in leaf incident PPFD
    (Fig. 2B). There was a significant variation (p < 0.01) in A along the day in
    both treatments. In control plants, A increased along the morning, reached its
    peak at midday (3.70 ± 0.375 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and declined in the afternoon.
    Contrastingly, in deficit plants, A reached its peak at midmorning (3.32 ± 0.361
    μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and started to decline afterwards which might be attributed
    to significant decreases in gs as well as to changes in leaf orientation, as indicated
    by decreases in PPFD. In addition, there were significant differences (p < 0.05)
    between treatments in A with higher values in control than in deficit plants at
    noon (Fig. 2B). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Diurnal time course

    in control (open symbols) and deficit (filled symbols) plants. Values are mean
    ± standard error of the mean (n = 6). Stomatal conductance (gs) showed significant
    variation along the day (p < 0.01) in both control and deficit plants (Fig. 2C).
    Moreover, there were significant differences (p < 0.01) in gs between treatments
    with higher values in control than in deficit plants (daily averaged gs values
    were 72.6 ± 8.51 and 55.2 ± 10.34 mol H2O m−2 s−1 for control and deficit plants,
    respectively). The leaf-to-air temperature difference (Tleaf − Tair) followed
    changes in gs and transpiration rate, so that decreases in gs were accompanied
    by increases in Tleaf − Tair (Fig. 2D). However, Tleaf − Tair, although varying
    significantly along the day (p < 0.001), did not show significant differences
    between treatments except at midday when Tleaf − Tair was significantly lower
    in deficit than in control plants (p < 0.01). Transpiration rate (E) showed a
    similar response to that of gs with significant variation along the day (p < 0.01)
    in both control and deficit plants (Fig. 2E). In addition there were significant
    differences between treatments (p < 0.01) in E with higher values in control than
    in deficit plants from midmorning to the early afternoon (Fig. 2E). On the other
    hand, the WI showed significant variation along the day (p < 0.01) as well as
    between treatments (p < 0.01). In both, control and deficit plants, WI increased
    along the diurnal time course (Fig. 2F). To further explore the feasibility of
    using reflectance indices to assess vine water status we conducted a series of
    correlation analyses using data averaged for each treatment and sampling time.
    We chose those data corresponding to measurements carried out from midmorning
    to early afternoon. At this time, photosynthetic activity was not light-limited
    (i.e. light saturated measurements) and we expected to detect larger differences
    between treatments in response to water availability. There was no significant
    correlation between Tleaf − Tair and gs when the whole data set was considered
    (Fig. 3A, continuous line). However, when a single data corresponding to midday
    values in control treatment (encircled in Fig. 3A) was disregarded, a close correlation
    was found between Tleaf − Tair and gs (Fig. 3A, dashed line). On the other hand,
    the WI was significantly correlated to gs although different relationships emerged
    for each treatment (Fig. 3B). Thus, decreases in gs were associated to increases
    in both WI and Tleaf − Tair. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Relationship

    canopy study Air temperatures over the study period (2007 and 2008) were within
    the last 10-year mean data while annual rainfall was higher than the last 10-year-mean
    precipitation (i.e., 439 mm) (Fig. 4). The pattern of rainfall events also differed
    for these two periods. In both years, rain conditions were characterized by a
    dry winter preceding each growth period. However, in 2007, spring rainfall was
    abundant and afterwards precipitation was reduced until late August when a heavy
    storm took place (125 mm). Thus, in 2007, cumulative rainfall was 548 mm close
    to the average last 10-year-mean precipitation (i.e., 439 mm) if the above mentioned
    summer storm were disregarded. In 2008, rains extended from spring to early summer
    and cumulative rainfall was more than twice the 10-year-average precipitation
    (i.e., 874 mm compared to 431 mm). Indeed, this was the first time for the registered
    data that cumulative rainfall was similar to the cumulative reference evapotranspiration.
    Thus, while 2007 was a typical dry year, 2008 was an exceptionally wet year. Download

    Data from Estació meteorològica dels Hostalets de Pierola. Coordinates UTM (x,y,z):
    400,630, 4,598,640, 312 a.s.l. Vine phenology was contrasted between the two studied
    years. Veraison (i.e., when field data collection took place) occurred from 16
    to 22 July in 2007 while in 2008 veraison commenced on 4 August and was completed
    on 11 August. There were significant differences in Ψp among vineyards (p < 0.01)
    and between years (p < 0.01). Average Ψp values were −0.88 ± 0.053 MPa (average
    ± SEM) and −0.69 ± 0.032 MPa (average ± SEM) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In
    2007, Ψp ranged from −0.40 ± 0.074 MPa to −1.36 ± 0.041 MPa among vineyards while
    in 2008 minimum and maximum Ψp were −0.917 ± 0.020 MPa and −0.450 MPa ± 0.035,
    respectively. Vine canopy development showed significant differences among vineyards
    (p < 0.01) within a year as well as between years (p < 0.01) as indicated by NDVI
    values. In 2007, NDVI values ranged from 0.771 ± 0.044 to 0.852 ± 0.048 among
    vineyards, and mean value was 0.806 ± 0.007 for all the studied plots. In 2008,
    NDVI values ranged from 0.793 ± 0.019 to 0.868 ± 0.022, and average NDVI was 0.835
    ± 0.006 for all the studied plots. In contrast WI values did not show significant
    differences between years. Average WI was 1.080 ± 0.005 and 1.070 ± 0.013 for
    years 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, there were significant differences
    (p < 0.001) in WI among vineyards. In 2007, WI values ranged from 1.03 ± 0.013
    to 1.11 ± 0.013 while in 2008 WI values ranged from 1.012 ± 0.008 to 1.146 ± 0.005.
    On the other hand, there were significant differences in ΔT among vineyards (p
    < 0.001) and between years (p < 0.001). Average ΔT values were 0.92 ± 0.449 and
    −2.17 ± 0.399 (average ± SEM) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2007 ΔT ranged
    from −3.3 to 5.0 among vineyards while in 2008 ΔT ranged from −6.6 °C to 1.4 °C.
    Canopy development was closely related to water availability as indicated by the
    significant relationship between Ψp and NDVI with R2 = 0.64 and R2 = 0.48, for
    2007 and 2008, respectively. Moreover, there were no significant differences in
    the regression models when year was considered as a factor. Thus, a unique and
    highly significant relationship emerged when data from both years were pooled
    (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5). In addition, when data from both years were pooled,
    ΔT was negatively related to Ψp (r = −0.37, p < 0.01), indicating that higher
    water potentials were translated into lower ΔT (i.e. higher transpiration) (data
    not shown). However, there was no significant relationship between Ψp and WI (data
    not shown). Nonetheless, within a year, there were significant relationships between
    WI and ΔT (p < 0.05). Thus, WI showed lower values on vines with higher ΔT with
    r = −0.67 (p < 0.05) and r = −0.75 (p < 0.05) for years 2007 and 2008, respectively

    that plants were under moderate to severe water stress (Carbonneau, 1998), and
    are similar to those reported in previous studies on potted plants subjected to
    moderate to severe water stress (Flexas et al., 1999) as well as under deficit
    irrigation programs in field studies conducted under Mediterranean environments
    (Grant et al., 2007, Patakas et al., 2005, Souza et al., 2005). In agreement with
    other studies conducted in potted plants (Medrano et al., 2002) different irrigation
    supply did not translate into significant differences in Ψp. Nonetheless, despite
    similar Ψp values in both treatments, deficit plants underwent earlier decreases
    in gas exchange parameters (A, gs and E) along the day when compared to control
    plants. A gradual decline in A from mid morning to evening has been previously
    described in V. vinifera and has been associated to a decline in stomatal conductance
    (Chaumont et al., 1994, Correia et al., 1990, Flexas et al., 1999). However, our
    vines showed low photosynthetic rates when compared with previous studies conducted
    on vines under similar water stress (Flexas et al., 1999). This might be attributed
    to the incidence of a virus infection in our plants and its resulting effects
    on photosynthesis. Indeed, several studies have reported decreases in photosynthetic
    performance as a result of a virus infection in grapevines (Pozsar et al., 1969,
    Sampol et al., 2003). In our study, leaves showed a slight chlorosis as well as
    a feathering of the leaf veins. Sampol et al. (2003) reported important reductions
    in chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in virus infected grapevines, albeit the
    primary light reactions were not identified as the main factor limiting photosynthesis.
    In our study, we did not determine pigment content but indirect estimates using
    reflectance based indices evidenced similar pigment composition in control and
    deficit plants (data not shown). In addition, Sampol et al. (2003) showed that,
    in virus infected grapevines, photosynthesis was primarily impaired by decreases
    in carboxylation and mesophyll conductance rather than to stomatal regulation.
    Although we cannot rule out the existence of a feedback control on stomatal behaviour
    resulting from these latter photosynthetic processes, we presume that, in our
    study, stomatal conductance was mainly affected by differences in water supply.
    Indeed, gs values were within the range reported for potted plants experiencing
    similar Ψp (Flexas et al., 1999, Flexas et al., 2009). Moreover, the results herein
    reported are consistent with those obtained with healthy potted plants cv. Cabernet
    Sauvignon in an analogous experiment (data not shown). Stomatal closure is among
    the first processes occurring in the leaves in response to drought. Tight stomatal
    closure occurs at relatively low soil water deficit in many grapevine cultivars,
    leading to a rapid reduction of gs as pre-dawn leaf water potential decreases
    (Chaves et al., 2010, Lovisolo et al., 2010, Schultz, 2003). Consistently, deficit
    plants had lower gs than control plants along the day. However, there were no
    differences in Tleaf − Tair between control and deficit plants, except at midday,
    despite higher E and gs in control plants. We did not have a plausible explanation
    for this response, but the decline in incident PPFD at the leaf surface (as a
    consequence of changes in leaf orientation) in deficit plants might have resulted
    in lower leaf temperatures. Indeed, if leaf movements occur after stomata close,
    they might contribute to leaf cooling, as intercepted radiation changes (Jones,
    2007). Alternatively, increased radiation load in control plants probably led
    to increases in leaf temperature (Gibberd et al., 2001). Thus, no significant
    relationship was found for control plants between gs and Tleaf − Tair. However,
    when midday data were disregarded a significant relationship (r2 = 0.52, p < 0.05)
    emerged for the whole data set. Differences in stomatal conductance between control
    and deficit plants were translated into differences in the reflectance based Water
    Index. Thus, at the leaf level, control plants showed along the day consistently
    higher WI values than deficit plants. This is consistent with previous studies
    that have shown that WI can be an indicator of gs at the leaf scale (Peñuelas
    et al., 1993). Moreover, decreases in gs were associated to increases in WI, although
    the relationship between WI and gs was found to be treatment dependent (control
    and deficit plants with similar gs had distinct values of WI) (Fig. 3). In a recent
    study conducted on citrus trees, Dzikiti et al. (2010) found that, at the leaf
    level, a water spectral index (calculated as the ratio of reflectance at 1070
    nm and 1340 nm) closely followed changes in crown water content resulting from
    variations in water supply and water loss (transpiration) determined using sap
    flow measurements. Apparently, the spectral features at the 970 nm centered water
    band might present a similar response (Dzikiti et al., 2010). Thus, in our study,
    increases in gs presumably led to a reduction in leaf water content as indicated
    by the negative relationship between WI and gs. A more detailed study on the dynamics
    of water recharge and depletion in relation to water content is needed in order
    to confirm this hypothesis. 4.2. Field canopy study Predawn water potential is
    commonly used as a reference method to determine vine water status (Choné et al.,
    2001b). Predawn plant water potential is thought to equilibrate with soil water
    potentials and, thus, it is an estimate of water availability. In the present
    study, predawn water potentials indicated that vines were under severe restriction
    in 2007 while in 2008 vines experienced moderate water stress (Carbonneau, 1998,
    Cifré et al., 2005) in agreement with the contrasted precipitation registered
    between both years. Moreover, Ψp values were in accordance with those obtained
    in other studies conducted in field studies under non-irrigated conditions (Koundouras
    et al., 2006, Pellegrino et al., 2004, Taylor et al., 2010). Thus, in our study
    under field conditions, water deficits were moderate to severe. In field grown
    vines, limited water availability affects vegetative growth (Dry and Loveys, 1999,
    Matthews et al., 1987, Pellegrino et al., 2005; among others). In agreement with
    these studies, water availability was a major determinant of vegetative growth
    in the vineyards studied as indicated by the close relationship between Ψp and
    NDVI. Indeed, previous studies have reported significant correlations between
    NDVI and canopy leaf area index (m2 leaf area per m2 of ground) and leaf area
    per vine (m2 per vine) over multiple vineyards using 4 m-resolution IKONOS satellite
    imagery (Dobrowski et al., 2002). Moreover, the Ψp vs. NDVI relationship was consistent
    across the study, so that a unique relationship emerged for the period of study.
    Thus, vegetative development was strongly determined by water availability and
    the vegetation index NDVI effectively characterized the effects of water availability
    on vine canopy growth. In agreement with previous studies (Rodríguez-Pérez et
    al., 2007) there was no significant relationship between Ψp and the WI. Nevertheless,
    it should be stressed that Ψp measures the leaf water status when transpiration
    stream is in equilibrium and transpiration is practically zero while WI values
    derived from reflectance at midday do not necessarily mirror this condition. Recently,
    Dzikiti et al. (2010) have shown that the WI was a good predictor of midday stem
    water potential in severely stressed citrus trees but failed to estimate midday
    stem water potential under mild or no drought stress. On the other hand, these
    latter authors reported close relationships between the WI and leaf water content
    on both non-stressed and stressed citrus trees. More accurate estimates of water
    content should be expected since water absorption features in spectral reflectance
    are determined by the amount of water (and leaf structural attributes) rather
    than by leaf water energy status (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990). Even though predawn
    and stem water potential are common indicators of water stress in grapevines (Choné
    et al., 2001b), plant water content is also a drought stress indicator although
    it is rarely used in practice for irrigation management (Jones, 2004). Nonetheless,
    some techniques widely used in vineyard irrigation scheduling rely on monitoring
    properties that respond to variations in water content. Particularly, linear transducers
    of displacement and sap flow meters capable of continuously monitoring variation
    in gs have proven useful to estimate canopy transpiration and to schedule irrigation
    in grapevines (Ginestar et al., 1998, Yunusa et al., 2000). Besides these contact
    techniques that provide point observations, remote estimates of canopy temperature
    have proven useful in irrigation scheduling in grapevines (Cifré et al., 2005,
    Dry et al., 2001, Jones et al., 2002). We found that the WI was negatively related
    to midday ΔT, suggesting that vines with higher water content had presumably higher
    transpiration rates and, consequently, lower ΔT (Jones et al., 2002). Indeed,
    our results showed that the WI is a relatively dynamic index, that tracks variation
    in gs on a diurnal scale (i.e. within treatments in potted plants) and variation
    in transpiration rate resulting from contrasted water availability (i.e. in field
    grown plants). These results are in agreement with recent studies conducted in
    citrus trees (Dzikiti et al., 2010) and on chaparral vegetation (Claudio et al.,
    2006) that demonstrate the capability of the WI to track variations in water fluxes
    under severe stress. Thus, our study adds on these previous results showing that
    the WI effectively followed changes in water fluxes under a range of moderate
    to severe water stress. Nonetheless, in our study, different relationships emerged
    at the leaf level between treatments as well as at the canopy level on different
    years. Probably, in our field study, differences in instrument calibration and
    measurement conditions introduced some biases in our results. Moreover, differences
    in vegetative growth between campaigns might have resulted in different WI values
    since the water content of vegetation at the canopy and landscape level responds
    to both leaf area and relative water content (Serrano et al., 2000, Sims and Gamon,
    2003). A reason for the interest in thermal and reflectance techniques is the
    possibility of measuring it remotely, thus avoiding time consuming techniques
    used for detecting water stress and providing spatially representative information
    on plant water status. Our results showed that both WI and ΔT (i.e., the canopy
    to air temperature difference) were good indicators of stomatal regulation in
    grapevines. However, thermal sensing requires calibration since both environmental
    conditions and stomatal aperture affect canopy temperature (Jones, 2004). Nonetheless,
    recent studies conducted in vineyards have shown that calibration of thermal data
    using a reference surface might provide accurate estimates of gs (Grant et al.,
    2007, Möller et al., 2007). Moreover, recently, Berni et al. (2009) have developed
    a methodology that overcomes the necessity of thermal data calibration providing
    good estimates of canopy conductance in irrigated olive orchards. On the other
    hand, imagery in the reflective bands is more readily available than thermal band
    data, and generally at higher spatial resolution, which is a key issue to conduct
    successful applications in partially covered surfaces (Serrano et al., 2000, Suárez
    et al., 2010), like vineyards. Moreover, as indicated in other studies (Claudio
    et al., 2006, Dzikiti et al., 2010), the 970 nm water band might be detected with
    silicon photodiode sensors, which makes it a good choice in terms of cost, availability
    and portability when compared to thermal sensors. Thus, the results obtained suggest
    new and potential applications of the WI in the frame of precision viticulture.
    Our results proved to work on a range that expands from moderate to severe water
    stress, a common situation in field grown grapevines under Mediterranean conditions,
    including those managed under deficit irrigation programs (Grant et al., 2007,
    Patakas et al., 2005, Souza et al., 2005). Characterization of the dynamics of
    water supply and water loss in relation to variations in the WI might further
    assist on estimating the capability of the WI as a potential tool in irrigation
    scheduling. The capability of assessing water status in fruit crops is also of
    great interest in the context of precision agriculture. Water deficits affect
    both fruit yield and quality and, particularly, in non-irrigated vineyards water
    status has been recognized to influence grape quality and thereby wine attributes
    (Choné et al., 2001a, Koundouras et al., 2006, Van Leeuwen and Seguin, 1994).
    Recent studies have proven the capability of remote sensing techniques for monitoring
    water stress and their effects on yield and fruit quality using thermal and reflectance
    imagery in olive orchards (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2007, Suárez et al., 2010).
    Therefore, the capability of the reflectance based WI to monitor drought stress
    might be of great significance in the context of precision viticulture as a potential
    tool to target harvesting strategies according to grape quality attributes as
    well as for ripening assessment. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our results showed
    that vines submitted to contrasted irrigation treatments showed significant differences
    in stomatal conductance and Water Index. Moreover, within a treatment, changes
    in stomatal conductance were closely mirrored by changes in WI. In field grown
    vines differences in water availability between years and among vineyards were
    translated into differences in canopy development as indicated by the close relationship
    between predawn water potential and NDVI. In addition, the WI was closely related
    to the midday canopy to air temperature difference, indicating that the WI effectively
    tracked variation in stomatal conductance within a range of moderate to severe
    water stress. More studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of the WI, prior
    to its extension as a common, practical tool, for vineyard water status assessment.
    The results obtained might be of great relevance in estimating the effects of
    water availability on grape yield and quality and might assist in irrigation scheduling.

    all metrics Abstract Persistent drought conditions in the Central valley of California
    demands efficient irrigation scheduling tools such as precision or variable rate
    irrigation (VRI). To assist VRI scheduling, an experiment was conducted in almond
    and walnut orchards using a sensor system called ‘leaf monitor’, which was developed
    at UC Davis to detect plant water status. A Modified Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI)
    was calculated to quantify plant water status using leaf temperature and environmental
    data collected by the leaf monitor. This technique also took into account spatio-temporal
    variability of plant water status. Stem water potential (SWP), which is considered
    a standard method for determining plant water stress (PWS), was also measured
    simultaneously. Relationships between measured deficit stem water potential (DSWP),
    which is the difference between SWP and the saturated baseline, and MCWSI were
    developed for both crops based on data collected during the 2013 and 2014 growing
    seasons. A linear relationship was found in the case of walnut crop with a coefficient
    of determination (r2) value of 0.67. A quadratic relationship was found in the
    case of almonds with a coefficient of multiple determination (R2) value of 0.75.
    Moreover, these results highlighted that at lower PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP,
    almonds crops did not show any decrease in transpiration rate. However, when the
    stress level exceeded 0.5 MPa of DSWP, transpiration rate tended to decrease.
    On the other hand, walnut crop showed decrease in transpiration rate even at low
    PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP. Temporal variability was noticed in PWS as it was
    found that coefficients of saturation baseline used for MCWSI method changed significantly
    throughout the season. MCWSI values estimated before an irrigation event was used
    to calculate the irrigation amount for low frequency variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) based on the relationship found between MCWSI and DSWP, and VRI led to an
    average 39% reduction in water usage as compared to the fixed 100% ET replacement
    irrigation method for all trees. Based on the results, leaf monitor showed potential
    for use as an irrigation scheduling tool. Similar content being viewed by others

    in drip-irrigated ‘Regina’ cherry trees Article 01 March 2024 Introduction The
    agriculture industry is facing a challenge to produce more food with limited resources
    in the face of increasing populations. Water is one of the major limiting factors
    to food production. Severe drought situations experienced in California in the
    recent past highlighted the need for irrigation techniques that use available
    water resources very efficiently and produce as much food as possible from every
    drop of water (Swain et al. 2014). This demands use of precision irrigation techniques
    to assist in the application of the right amount of water, at the right location,
    at the right time. Soil or Plant water status detection is a primary requirement
    to implement precision irrigation (Fereres and Soriano 2006). Plant water requirements
    and weather patterns change significantly over the cropping season (Goldhamer
    2005), so irrigation prescriptions should adjust to these changes. Plant water
    requirements also change spatially within a field due to differences in canopy
    size, soil variability, and field topography (Starr 2005). Therefore, it is important
    that plant water stress (PWS) is determined frequently and on a dense spatial
    scale. Usually, PWS is estimated by measuring stem water potential (SWP), especially
    in tree crops. In this technique, a leaf is cut from the tree and placed in a
    chamber while the leaf petiole remains outside the chamber through a rubber seal.
    The pressure in the chamber is gradually increased using compressed nitrogen gas
    until the sap comes out of leaf petiole. Upon sap expulsion, the pressure inside
    the chamber is recorded and referred to as “leaf water potential” (Turner 1988).
    To measure SWP, a leaf should be enclosed in reflective plastic bag for at least
    30 min to stop transpiration from the leaf surface and equilibrate the leaf water
    potential with stem water potential before removing the leaf from the tree (McCutchan
    and Shackel 1992; Fulton et al. 2002). “Pressure bomb” or “pressure chamber” is
    usually considered the standard device for measuring SWP because of its reliability
    and temperature independence (Turner 1981). However, it is very labor intensive
    and time consuming to make multiple mid-day SWP measurements using a pressure
    chamber in an orchard, which makes it difficult to obtain the large numbers of
    samples necessary to develop efficient irrigation scheduling techniques (Jones
    2004). Also, it is not feasible to develop automated Variable Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) systems based on manual measurements of SWP. VRI systems based on PWS measurements
    require convenient and automated method for PWS estimation. The Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI) is a popular parameter used to determine PWS. CWSI uses leaf temperature
    data of well-watered and fully water-stressed plants as references for calculation
    of the stress index (Idso et al. 1981). Idso et al. reported that for a well-watered
    crop, the difference of canopy temperature and air temperature (ΔT) was linearly
    related to vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and named this equation the well-watered
    baseline (ΔTww). $$\Delta {\text{T}}_{\text{ww}} = {\text{a}} + {\text{b }}\left(
    {\text{VPD}} \right)$$ (1) Where VPD (KPa) is calculated using air temperature
    (Tair) and relative humidity (RH) given by the equation: $${\text{VPD}} = 0.6108\left(
    {e^{{\frac{{17.27{\text{T}}_{\text{air}} }}{{{\text{T}}_{\text{air}} + 237.3}}}}
    } \right)\left( {1 - \frac{RH}{100}} \right)$$ (2) Moreover, it was found that
    the ΔT term for highly stressed crops (\({\text{i}}.{\text{e}}., \;\Delta T_{str}\))
    with no transpiration was constant, did not depend on VPD, and could be obtained
    empirically or from the well-watered baseline at VPD = 0. By knowing ΔT for well-watered
    (\(\Delta T_{ww}\)) and fully stressed (\(\Delta T_{str}\)) conditions, CWSI can
    be expressed as: $$CWSI = \frac{{\Delta T - \Delta T_{ww} }}{{\Delta T_{str} -
    \Delta T_{ww} }}$$ (3) CWSI has been recommended as a useful technique for PWS
    prediction. Idso (1982) empirically calculated CWSI and developed non-water stress
    baselines for 26 different crops. Alderfasi and Nielsen (2001) developed baseline
    equations for different genotypes of winter wheat for CWSI calculations. CWSI
    has also been used for PWS prediction in watermelons (Orta et al. 2003). In another
    study, Testi et al. (2008) measured pistachio tree canopy temperature and calculated
    CWSI to predict leaf water potential. They found that CWSI was a sensitive indicator
    of PWS, and that CWSI values measured during the 12:00–3:00 p.m. time interval
    were good indicators of seasonal changes in water status. However, most of the
    studies on canopy temperature and CWSI were conducted on field crops, and many
    researchers have suggested that additional work should be conducted on tree crops
    (e.g., Ben-Gal et al. 2010; Wang and Gartung 2010). An important requirement for
    a PWS detection method is to be used to trigger automated VRI. In general, the
    automated VRI systems in common use are based on simple automated timer operation,
    or in some cases the signal is provided by soil moisture sensors (Torre-Neto et
    al. 2000). Miranda et al. (2005) developed and tested an autonomous feedback distributed
    irrigation control system allowing site-specific management of fixed irrigation
    systems. This system proved to be reliable, affordable, and effective in maintaining
    the soil water potential in the root zone close to a preset value (less negative
    than − 18 kPa) for 100% of the time during the study. Few VRI Studies based on
    plant measurements have been conducted to date. For example, it was demonstrated
    that irrigation scheduling of almonds trees is feasible based on diurnal stem
    diameter fluctuations, which has the potential to be used as a fully automatic
    system (Goldhamer and Fereres 2004). Thermal sensing or CWSI of canopy has been
    used for VRI as well. O’Shaughnessy et al. (2012) used CWSI summed over daylight
    hours (CWSI-TT, CWSI time threshold) as a trigger for automatic irrigation scheduling
    in grain sorghum. Some researchers have studied the relationship of CWSI with
    leaf/stem water potential or another physiological response of crop to water stress,
    not many studies used these relationships to implement variable rate irrigation
    (Bellvert et al. 2013; Köksal et al. 2010). But temporal variation throughout
    the season in relationship between SWP and leaf temperature measurements is primary
    challenge to use these measurements for implementing VRI. Udompetaikul (2012)
    used a leaf energy balance equation to predict leaf temperature as a function
    of plant water status and microclimatic variables with a mobile sensor suite for
    almond and walnut crops. These prediction equations were used to classify trees
    as water-stressed and well-watered in almond, walnut, and grape crops (Dhillon
    et al. 2014). However, the prediction models were found to change as the season
    progressed (i.e., temporal variability), which suggested a need to calibrate these
    prediction equations multiple times during the season. Dhillon et al. (2017) developed
    a sensor system called “leaf monitor” to measure leaf temperature almost continuously
    (every 4 min) in order to track PWS throughout the season. The leaf monitor can
    be installed on a tree and is capable of measuring leaf temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, ambient light, and wind conditions continuously (every 4 min).
    Based on the challenges mentioned above faced in PWS detection, temporal variability
    in PWS throughout season, and VRI implementation based on PWS measurements, this
    research explored potential use of a leaf monitoring system to detect spatio-temporal
    adjusted plant water status and implement VRI schemes. The specific objectives
    of this study were: (1) to use leaf monitor data to compute the spatio-temporal
    adjusted Modified Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI) to quantify plant water status
    of almond and walnut crops and to develop empirical relationships between MCWSI
    and SWP for almond and walnut crops (2) to use leaf monitor for monitoring plant
    water stress over the growing season for almond and walnut trees with three different
    irrigation treatments i.e. ET-based deficit, traditional grower irrigation, and
    SWP-based irrigation (3) to implement variable rate irrigation (VRI) using the
    MCWSI values derived from the leaf monitor data. The corresponding hypotheses
    for these objectives were: (1) there are crop specific empirical relationships
    between MCWSI values and SWP values in almond and walnut crops, (2) the leaf monitor
    derived MCWSI values can be used to monitor PWS of almond and walnut crops that
    are subject to different irrigation treatments, and (3) these MCWSI values can
    be used to implement VRI. Materials and methods Data collection Experiments were
    conducted during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons in almond and walnut orchards
    at the Nickels Soil Lab near Arbuckle, CA (Fig. 1). Both almond (Non-pareil variety)
    and walnut (Chandler variety) trees were 7 years old during the 2013 growing season.
    Parameters measured during this experiment were leaf temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), wind speed, SWP,
    amount of water delivered during irrigation events, and yield at the end of the
    season. Leaf temperature and above-mentioned microclimatic parameters were logged
    on 16-min interval from mid-May to mid-October of both growing seasons using a
    device called “leaf monitor”. The leaf monitor consisted of an infrared sensor
    for measuring leaf temperature, a combination air temperature and relative humidity
    sensor, a PAR sensor, and a wind speed sensor. It can be installed on a tree branch
    to monitor a targeted leaf. Only shaded leaves were monitored in this study based
    on findings by Dhillon et al. (2014). Figure 2a, b shows leaf monitor installed
    on a walnut and almond leaf, respectively. Other than the sensors installed on
    a printed circuit board, the leaf monitor also consisted of a solar radiation
    diffuser dome and a wind barrier to ensure consistent light conditions and reduced
    wind speed around the leaf. More information about development of the leaf monitor,
    sensors and other components, installation procedures, and performance is discussed
    in Dhillon et al. (2017). Each leaf monitor unit was connected to a solar-powered
    eKo Pro Wireless Sensor Node (Memsic Inc., Andover, MA) for power and data communication.
    These nodes formed a wireless mesh network in the orchard and requested data from
    the leaf monitor every 16 min, and leaf monitor sensors made measurement every
    4 min and reported the averaged data on request by a node. Ultimately, data were
    transmitted to a gateway computer thorough a network of nodes and repeaters where
    they were stored in a database and could be uploaded to the web. Fig. 1 Field
    site for almond and walnut orchards and mesh network of wireless eKo nodes at
    research site in Arbuckle, CA Full size image Fig. 2 Leaf monitor installed on
    a walnut tree (without solar radiation diffuser) and b almond tree (with solar
    radiation diffuser) for field testing Full size image Reference plant water status
    measurements of trees on which leaf monitors were installed were obtained using
    a pressure chamber (Model 3005, Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara,
    CA 1) that measured mid-day SWP (measured at solar noon ± 1 h) on the first day
    after irrigation and then every day (or, in some cases, on alternate days) until
    the next irrigation. Actual tree water stress level was defined with respect to
    baseline stem water potential (BSWP), which is defined as maximum SWP achieved
    when the plant is fully irrigated at a given environmental condition. BSWP for
    almond (McCutchan and Shackel 1992) and for walnut crops (unpublished work) are
    given as function of Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) as follows: $${\text{Almond:}}\quad
    BSWP = -\,0.120\left( {VPD} \right) -\, 0.410$$ (4a) $${\text{Walnut:}}\quad BSWP
    = -\, 0.064\left( {VPD} \right){-}\, 0.278$$ (4b) Coefficients in empirical Eq.
    4 should be good for any location for the VPD range of 1–5 kPa. Then, deficit
    stem water potential (DSWP) was calculated using Eq. 5 presented below: $${\text{Deficit}}\;{\text{SWP}}
    = \;{\text{Baseline}}\;{\text{SWP}}\,{-}\,{\text{mid-day}}\;{\text{SWP}}$$ (5)
    A higher magnitude of DSWP indicates higher water stress at the time of measurement.
    Irrigation treatments A drip irrigation system was used in both orchards. The
    remote irrigation setup with eKo wireless sensor nodes, actuators, and latching
    solenoid valves to apply the desired amount of water was implemented using reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) from the nearest California Irrigation Management Information
    System (CIMIS) weather station at Colusa, CA (Jimenez-Berni 2013). Crop ET (ETc)
    was calculated using crop coefficients for almond and walnut crops, respectively.
    Irrigation dates and irrigation amounts (in minutes) were recorded for each tree
    during each irrigation event. Pressure sensors (P51-100-S-A-I36, SSI Technologies
    Inc., Janesville, WI) were installed on the drip lines, which were connected to
    the same network. These sensors recorded the time for which irrigation water was
    applied. The irrigation system flow rate was calibrated by collecting water delivered
    from emitters using catch can method. Three different irrigation treatments listed
    below were used to achieve different water stress levels and plant water status
    was measured (i.e., mid-day SWP) for all trees under all treatments. (1) ET-based
    irrigation Trees were irrigated to replace 60% of ETc (i.e., ET-based deficit
    irrigation). (2) Grower irrigation Trees were irrigated with the grower’s customary
    irrigation management practice, which was based on measuring soil moisture contents
    at a single location at three different depths in a nearby plot. These trees were
    normally irrigated two times a week. Grower irrigation was monitored, and the
    amount of water applied as a percentage of ETc was calculated for both crops.
    (3) SWP-based irrigation The amount of water delivered was adjusted iteratively
    to maintain trees’ SWP levels mid-way between the SWP level of other two treatments
    (i.e., ET-based and grower irrigation). Management zones Previous grower experience
    and plant water stress data from the 2012 growing season indicated that there
    was substantial spatial variability in plant water stress levels even when the
    trees in our experimental plots were subjected to uniform irrigation management.
    Therefore, three management zones were developed based on three plant parameters
    measured in 2012. Variables used for zone delineation were (a) average measured
    SWP throughout season 2012, (b) yield produced by trees for 2012 season, and (c)
    average PAR absorbed by the trees at mid-day. Average PAR absorbed by tree is
    directly proportional to the canopy size of the tree and was measured by Rojo
    et al. (2014) as part of another study. Management Zone Analyst (MZA v1.0.1, USDA-ARS)
    assigned each tree to one of the three zones, named as zones 1, 2 and 3 which
    represented high, medium, and low water requirement areas in the orchard, respectively.
    Trees in the orchard were divided into blocks of five consecutive trees along
    the same row and new drip lines were added to deliver irrigation independently
    to each block. Treatments were assigned randomly in each management zone for fifteen
    such blocks for each crop, as shown in Fig. 3. Blocks were always within a single
    management zone and did not cross the border between management zones. Nine leaf
    monitors per crop were installed—one for each treatment in each management zone.
    All trees under all three treatments were given the same amount of fertilizer
    at the same time through a separate irrigation line controlled by the grower.
    Any other chemical applications (pesticides, herbicides, etc.) administered through
    sprayers or cultural operations were also similar for all three treatments and
    were implemented by the grower using established practices. Fig. 3 Layout of assignment
    of irrigation treatments to all fifteen blocks of five trees in almond and walnut
    orchards and installation of nine leaf monitor (LM) units Full size image MCWSI
    calculation Data were analyzed using the SAS software package (SAS Institute,
    Inc. v.9.3 Cary, NC). The SAS program was used to organize the leaf monitor, SWP,
    and irrigation data. As mentioned earlier, the wireless nodes recorded leaf temperature,
    air temperature, relative humidity, PAR, and wind speed approximately every 16
    min. Moving-average of four such data points was calculated and recorded from
    10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. to filter out data when transpiration level was significant
    lower with respect to solar noon. Using these data, several parameters were calculated
    for further analysis: (i) saturation vapor pressure \(\left( {{\text{e}}_{\text{s}}
    [{\text{T}}_{\text{air}} ]} \right)\) at air temperature Tair, (ii) vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD), and (iii) slope of saturated vapor pressure–temperature relation
    (∆) for air temperature Tair. It should be noted that in Eq. 1, the dependent
    variable ΔT and the independent variable VPD are both calculated using measured
    Tair. Temperature of the leaf, TLeaf, was a tree parameter measured by the leaf
    monitor (not calculated using any of the microclimatic parameters). To overcome
    issues related to terms related Tair appearing on both sides of Eq. 1, a new method
    was proposed in which TLeaf was used as the dependent variable for developing
    a baseline for the well-watered condition. It was assumed that TLeaf at the well-watered
    condition was a function of Tair, PAR, Δ, and VPD based on energy balance equation
    of plant tissue (Jones 2013). Hence, in this method, the well-watered baseline
    was expressed in a functional form as follows: $$T_{L}^{ww} = f\left( {T_{air}
    ,VPD,PAR,\Delta } \right)$$ (6) However, it was found that independent variables
    Tair, VPD, and Δ were highly correlated to each other, as Tair was being used
    in calculation of VPD and Δ, and there was high multi-collinearity when regression
    coefficients were estimated for these variables. Therefore, the first principal
    component was calculated using these three variables (i.e., Prin1 = f (Tair, VPD,
    Δ)), which explained more than 95% of variability. The well-watered baseline equation
    is represented as Eq. 7. $$T_{L}^{ww} = f\left( {PRIN1, PAR} \right)$$ (7) Many
    studies in the literature used the ΔTstr as the intercept of the well-watered
    line (ΔTsat) or sometimes ΔTstr = 5 °C as a stressed baseline (Cohen et al. 2005;
    Möller et al. 2007; Alchanatis et al. 2009; Meron et al. 2010). However, Sammis
    et al. (1988) used ΔTstr = 6 °C and 4 °C for open and closed canopy, respectively,
    in pecan trees. It should be noted that all of these studies were conducted using
    sunlit canopies. A water-stressed sunlit canopy/leaf is expected to be at a higher
    temperature than air temperature, as evaporative cooling of the leaf is restricted
    by limited transpiration. Based on the conclusions found in previous study by
    Dhillon (2015) on sunlit and shaded leaves for prediction of plant water status,
    leaf temperatures of only shaded leaves were measured in this study; for shaded
    leaves, leaf temperature is lower than air temperature even for stressed trees.
    Therefore, ΔT was calculated as (Tair − TLeaf) instead of (TLeaf − Tair) because
    (TLeaf − Tair) was found to be a negative number for shaded leaves for well-watered
    to water-stressed conditions. A value of ΔTstr = 0.75 was determined with an iterative
    trial and error method to represent the fully water-stressed baseline, which was
    found to produce a good sensitivity for MCWSI. Assuming a value of ΔT = 0.75 for
    a fully water-stressed condition implies that a shaded water-stressed leaf is
    0.75 °C cooler than the ambient air temperature, perhaps due to convective heat
    loss from the leaf. So, the equation for the water-stressed baseline becomes \(T_{L}^{str}
    = T_{a} + 0.75\). Therefore, MCWSI was calculated using Eq. 8. $$MCWSI = \frac{{T_{L}
    - T_{L}^{ww} }}{{T_{L}^{Str} - T_{L}^{ww} }}$$ (8) Please refer to Dhillon et
    al. (2017) for additional details on MCWSI calculation. Spatio-temporal variability
    in MCWSI One of the objectives of this study was to explore the spatial and temporal
    variation of the water stress levels in the trees, as it has been reported that
    relationships between canopy temperature, plant water stress, and micro-climatic
    conditions changes throughout the season (Udompetaikul 2012; Dhillon et al. 2014).
    Idso (1982) also found temporal variability for barley and wheat crops, and developed
    two well-watered baselines corresponding to pre-heading and post-heading growing
    phases for those crops. To properly account for the temporal variability in MCWSI,
    we proposed a methodology that updated the well-watered baseline after every irrigation.
    This temporal scale was selected to ensure that well-watered baseline is updated
    after every irrigation that accounts effect of last irrigation and seasonal variations
    in plant water requirements. Temporal variability was accounted for by developing
    a new well-watered baseline for each irrigation event. This method allowed to
    correct for changes that occur in plant water requirements due to weather, plant
    phenological stage, or stress history for a specific tree. The first or second
    day after irrigation was selected as the reference day. Data corresponding to
    the reference day were used to develop well-watered baselines, as described below,
    where α1, α2, and α3 are regression coefficients for the reference day: $$T_{L}^{ww
    } = \left( {\alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2} PRIN1_{1} + \alpha_{3} PAR_{1} } \right)$$
    (9a) The coefficients corresponding to the reference day were used to calculate
    \(T_{L}^{ww }\) for nth day after the irrigation event, as follows: $$T_{L}^{ww
    } = \left( {\alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2} PRIN1_{n} + \alpha_{3} PAR_{n} } \right)$$
    (9b) Then, MCWSI values were calculated using Eq. 8. For each irrigation, coefficients
    α1, α2, and α3 were updated to compensate for any temporal changes. Spatial variability
    was accounted for by developing well-watered baselines per tree (or zone, in some
    cases). Variable rate irrigation using MCWSI MCWSI values measured using the leaf
    monitor data from the 2013 season and most of the 2014 season were regressed against
    measured DSWP. A relationship was found between MCWSI and DSWP (discussed in the
    results section and shown in Table 2). In light of this relationship, daily MCWSI
    was used to implement VRI by making irrigation decisions and to adjust crop evapotranspiration,
    ETc, before the irrigation. VRI was implemented as preliminary experiment for
    6 weeks at the end of season 2014. If measured SWP for a tree was higher than
    threshold SWP or critical SWP (CSWP), the tree was considered water-stressed.
    Dhillon et al. (2014) reported equations to calculate critical SWP (CSWP) based
    on BSWP that was influenced by weather conditions and crop. These equations are
    as follows: $${\text{Almond:}}\;{\text{CSWP}}\left( {\text{MPa}} \right) = {\text{BSWP}}\,{-}\,0.8$$
    (10a) $${\text{Walnut:}}\;{\text{CSWP}}\left( {\text{MPa}} \right) = {\text{BSWP}}\,{-}\,0.4$$
    (10b) Using the recommended CSWP, a critical value of MCWSI was calculated based
    on the relationship found between DSWP and MCWSI. A technique was presented to
    use critical value of MCWSI to adjust irrigation amounts, as it was assumed that
    irrigation frequency is mostly decided by availability of water, especially where
    water supply is limited, like in the Central Valley of California. Usually, irrigation
    was applied twice a week for these orchards, however for the VRI experiment irrigation
    was conducted once a week with objective of saving water. Management factor, f,
    was calculated (Eq. 11) based on critical MCWSI and was used in Eq. 12 to calculate
    adjusted crop evapotranspiration, ETc, where ETo is reference evapotranspiration
    (ET), Kc is crop coefficient, and \(f\) is management factor. MCWSI was calculated
    on the day of irrigation and used to adjust the amount of water to be delivered
    at night during irrigation. $$f = 1 + \left( {measured\;MCWSI - critical\;MCWSI}
    \right)$$ (11) $$ET_{c} = f*K_{c} *ET_{o}$$ (12) This method allowed us to increase
    the amount of water proportionally if a tree was stressed more than the critically
    stressed condition, and reduce the amount of applied water if a tree was found
    to be less stressed than critically stressed condition before irrigation. Results
    and discussion Results are discussed in three sections as per each objective of
    this study: Spatial temporal variability in MCWSI and its relationship to SWP
    Spatio-temporal MCWSI Leaf monitor data were downloaded from the gateway in CSV
    format and were used to calculate MCWSI automatically using data around solar
    noon (1:00–4:00 p.m.) for all trees on which leaf monitors were installed. Figure
    4 shows calculated MCWSI values for one irrigation event each for an almond and
    a walnut tree and depicts the typical trend in the stress index found in most
    of the data. The X-axis displays the “days after the last irrigation event”. As
    expected, MCWSI had very low or close to zero values for the first day after an
    irrigation event, and it further decreased for the second day, indicating that
    the tree was still recovering from water stress on the second day after irrigation.
    On the third day after the irrigation event, there was a rapid increase in the
    stress index. The indices reached a plateau after approximately 8–10 days after
    irrigation. MCWSI values depend on the difference between air temperature and
    leaf temperature, and according leaf energy balance equation, leaf temperature
    further depends on transpiration rate from leaf surface. Therefore, lower leaf
    temperature or lower MCWSI values after irrigation event corresponds to higher
    transpiration rate. The trees transpired at the maximum potential level for the
    first 3 days, and then there were sudden decreases in transpiration rates as the
    trees became water-stressed. Following this rapid decrease in transpiration, the
    trees continued to transpire at very low levels, which corresponded to highest
    stomatal resistance for a leaf at particular light level and environmental conditions.
    This pattern was observed most of the time in both crops with some differences
    in number of days it took to reach the maximum potential transpiration following
    an irrigation event, and different saturation levels for different trees depending
    on weather conditions. It should be noted that plots shown in Fig. 4 correspond
    to preliminary experiments conducted to explore the response of the leaf monitor
    to plant water stress induced by withholding irrigation. Typically, irrigation
    in these orchards was done twice a week so that such high stress levels that lead
    to almost total stomatal closure never occurred. Fig. 4 Typical pattern of MCWSI
    values after an irrigation event for a almond and b walnut trees Full size image
    A crucial step towards bringing precision irrigation to practice is the mapping
    of spatial and temporal variability in plant water status. To compensate for spatial
    and temporal changes throughout the season in MCWSI, tree-specific well-watered
    baselines were calculated for the reference day after every irrigation event using
    Eq. 9. Data corresponding to 2 days after irrigation (reference day) were used
    for well-watered baseline calculations. By definition, MCWSI values become zero
    for the reference day. However, there was a concern about assuming unique saturation
    baselines for each tree due to the possibility that a tree was not at its saturation
    condition even after irrigation or on the first or second day after irrigation.
    It was expected that trees in 60% deficit ET treatment might be water-stressed
    even after irrigation. Therefore, it was not possible to calculate tree-specific
    saturation baseline for trees in 60% deficit ET treatment. This phenomenon was
    statistically tested with DSWP data collected on the first or second day after
    an irrigation event to determine if trees in this treatment were significantly
    different from trees in the other two treatments using ANOVA. The sample size
    required for this analysis for a power of 0.95 was 27 in order to detect differences
    between means that exceed twice the variance when using the sample size determination
    technique (Kutner et al. 2005). Sample sizes of 33 and 60 were used in this analysis
    for almond and walnut crops, respectively, thus assuring a power of at least 95%
    for the statistical tests. This analysis showed that water stress levels of almond
    trees did not differ from each other for all treatments after irrigation (p value
    of 0.1131). Therefore, it was assumed that all almond trees achieved the saturation
    level after irrigation, and unique saturation baselines were developed for each
    tree. On the other hand, walnut trees with the 60% ET deficit treatment were significantly
    different from the two other treatments (p value was 0.0047 in this case). Therefore,
    ET-based walnut trees did not reach the same low stress level (i.e., saturation
    level) as grower- and stress- based trees, even after irrigation. This suggests
    that these trees should not be considered as well-watered trees even after irrigation.
    Therefore, the saturation baseline for walnut trees was calculated as zone-specific
    rather than tree-specific. Grower-based trees in the same zone were used to produce
    the saturation baseline. This suggests that it was important to calculate zone-specific
    saturation baselines to adjust for spatial variability. The coefficients of saturation
    baseline changed throughout the season. Temporal variability was tested for the
    coefficient of principal component PRIN1 (first principle component of variables
    Tair, VPD, Δ). The ANOVA (analysis of variance) model tested for these analyses
    for almond and walnut crop given as Yijk = μ + αi + βj(i) + εijk, Where, Yijk = regression
    coefficient of prin1 from saturation baseline equation for kth observation for
    jth irrigation event within ith year, αi = year, βj(i) = irrigation event nested
    within year, εijk = error term for kth observation for jth irrigation event within
    ith year. Results showed that the coefficient of PRIN1 for all irrigations events
    were significantly different throughout the season. Table 1 lists the results
    of ANOVA for the almond and walnut crops. One or more coefficients in saturation
    baseline are significantly different for at least one irrigation event at a significance
    level of 0.05 throughout the season for both crops. The p value was 0.0179 and
    0.0011, for the almond and walnut crops, respectively. Table 1 ANOVA table for
    testing variability in coefficient of first principal component in saturation
    baseline for the almond and walnut crops Full size table Tukey’s multiple comparison
    test was used to check the differences in coefficients for different irrigations.
    As expected, coefficients of PRIN1 for irrigation events were different from each
    other as these coefficients were different for irrigation events throughout the
    season Overall, for walnut crop, of the total 55 irrigation events, ~ 1480 tests
    were conducted and in 17% of these tests coefficients of prin1 were significantly
    different. Similarly, for total 45 irrigation events for almonds, ~ 945 tests
    were conducted and in 12% of these tests coefficients of prin1 were significantly
    different. Baselines for irrigation events from early in the season showed significant
    change in coefficients in comparison to middle of the season and end of the season
    as weather changed significantly. Therefore, considering the variability throughout
    the season, saturation baselines should be updated throughout the season for better
    irrigation management. Seasonal variability of leaf temperature based on micro-climatic
    variables has been studied by Udompetaikul (2012). He developed multiple linear
    regression models to predict leaf temperature using measured micro-climatic variables
    in almond and walnut orchards. He found that leaf temperature predicted by a model
    that uses early season (July) micro-climatic data correlated very well with leaf
    temperature measured at the same time. This correlation resulted in R2 values
    of 0.9 and 0.85 in almond and walnut crops, respectively, with zero intercept
    and unit slope. When he used the same model to predict leaf temperature later
    in the season, the model predicted leaf temperature with R2 values of 0.78 and
    0.60 in almonds and walnut crops, respectively. Moreover, linear relationship
    between measured and predicted leaf temperature resulted in slopes of 1.53 and
    1.04 and intercepts of − 14.3 and 1.708 for almond and walnut crops, respectively.
    These results also show that the relationship between leaf temperature and environmental
    variables varies throughout the season. Therefore, saturation baselines should
    be updated throughout the season to accommodate for temporal variability. The
    reason for this variability in regression coefficients throughout the season could
    be different transpiration potential of trees at different phenological stages.
    A given tree’s transpiration rate under saturated conditions can be affected differently
    by weather parameters, crop physiology, and interaction of these factors during
    the growth stages of bloom, canopy and fruit growth, and post-harvest. It has
    been mentioned in literature that transpiration levels for a crop can change throughout
    the season. Seasonal changes in transpiration have also been reported as a linear
    function of leaf area index(LAI) during time-period of bud-burst to the end of
    first flush expansion (mid-June) for oak trees, and transpiration for the later
    part of the season was found to be influenced by relative extractable water (REW)
    from soil (Bréda and Granier 1996). Variability in the regression coefficients
    suggests that it is important to consider temporal variability in a plant’s response
    for irrigation management decision making. With a high frequency leaf monitor
    data, it is possible to obtain these relationships in real-time by monitoring
    one or more trees in saturated conditions in an orchard or within a management
    zone, as long as there is a sufficient range in PAR and VPD during the time period.
    Overall, this spatio-temporal method of calculating saturation baseline allows
    to incorporate spatial and temporal variability, and makes it possible to manage
    irrigation at zone- or block- levels of trees, or even for individual tree levels,
    if required. Comparison of MCWSI with SWP The relationships among the MCWSI and
    SWP measured were studied as a means of establishing the pattern of crop physiological
    response to water stress. MCWSI has the potential to predict direct leaf or plant
    measurements and to provide a more convenient and less labor-intensive method
    to measure plant water status and its spatial pattern by having multiple leaf
    monitors in an orchard. For some irrigation events throughout the 2013 and 2014
    seasons, daily (or alternate day) mid-day SWP values were measured for the trees
    on which leaf monitors were installed for the comparison with MCWSI. DSWP values
    were calculated from measured SWP data by adjusting for VPD using Eqs. 4 and 5.
    MCWSI and DSWP were plotted together to see the trend for both curves following
    the irrigation. Figures 5 and 6 provide examples of comparison of MCWSI values
    with DSWP data for typical irrigation events in walnut and almond crops, respectively,
    with “days after irrigation” on the horizontal axes. A slight decrease in water
    stress was observed on the second day after irrigation, or even on the third day
    for some instances, and then increases in MCWSI and DSWP were observed as trees
    became water-stressed. These figures show that MCWSI follows similar trend and
    can be used to predict the overall DSWP trend. This is very important as usually
    it is not practical to obtain daily mid-day SWP data, and it is very difficult
    to automate irrigation systems based on SWP data. Fig. 5 MCWSI values calculated
    from leaf monitor data for typical irrigation events for walnut crops in comparison
    to same-day measured DSWP values Full size image Fig. 6 MCWSI values calculated
    from leaf monitor data for typical irrigation events for almond crops in comparison
    to same-day measured DSWP values Full size image Correlation between MCWSI and
    DSWP Since MCWSI had similar patterns to plant water stress following an irrigation
    event, so the data were analyzed to explore relationships between DSWP and stress
    index values. The plots of DSWP and MCWSI are shown in Fig. 7a, b for walnut and
    almond trees, respectively. Fig. 7 Comparison between DSWP and MCWSI values calculated
    for a walnut and b almond crops Full size image A linear relationship was found
    between DSWP and MCWSI for walnut crops (Fig. 7a) with coefficient of determination
    of 0.67. However, the relationship between DSWP and MCWSI for almond crops appeared
    to be curvilinear with (Fig. 7b) with coefficient of determination of 0.75. To
    check the possibility of a quadratic relationship, the square of the DSWP term
    was calculated, and a stepwise model selection technique was used to find the
    best model for the relationship between DSWP and MCWSI. The analysis indicated
    that both the linear and quadratic terms were highly significant for the almond
    crops. The selected models are listed in Table 2. Table 2 Stepwise model selection
    procedure for relationship of DSWP with MCWSI = f(DSWP, DSWP2) Full size table
    Similar results with coefficient of determination varying from 0.73 to 0.90 for
    different months throughout the season have been found when canopy temperature
    based index was compared with leaf water potential for cotton (Cohen et al.2005).
    Möller et al. (2007) predicted stomatal conductance using CWSI for grapevines
    for four different days throughout the season and also found linear correlation
    with coefficient of determination varying from 0.66 to 0.95. It should be noticed
    that current study used data from different months and different trees to develop
    correlation between DSWP and MCWSI after adjusting for spatial–temporal variability.
    Not many studies were found in literature where canopy temperature based index
    was used to predict SWP using data throughout the season. Figure 7b shows that
    there was negligible change in MCWSI values between 0 and 0.5 MPa (5 bar) change
    in DSWP, following which there was an increase in MCWSI values in the range of
    0.5–1.6 MPa of DSWP. These results suggest that the almond trees were transpiring
    at a maximum potential up to 0.5 MPa (or 5 bar) of DSWP water stress. On the other
    hand, walnut crops were sensitive even at small water stress and were showing
    decrease in transpiration rate even at low PWS of below 0.5 Mpa of DSWP as there
    was a linear increase in stress level, even at very low plant water stress. These
    results show that different crop’s response to water stress could be different.
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2018) also found these results in case of mandarin and late
    oranges crops for a regulated deficit irrigation experiment where 50–55% less
    water was applied as compared to control irrigation to study the impact on transpiration
    and yield and found that mandarin is less sensitive to water stress than late
    orange. Monitoring trees in different irrigation treatments using leaf monitors
    MCWSI was calculated for all trees that were monitored by LM in all three management
    zones for ET-based, SWP-based, and grower irrigation treatments. MCWSI values
    calculated for almond and walnut trees during the 2014 season are shown in Fig.
    8. This plot compares stress index values for trees with different irrigation
    treatments in the same management zone. As expected, Fig. 8a shows that ET-based
    deficit treatment (solid line) trees had higher water stress values for most of
    the season. Compared to the other two treatments, this treatment resulted in the
    lowest amount of water application and trees with the highest water stress levels.
    The almond crop had no irrigation for almost 3 weeks after mid-August because
    of harvest preparation. During that period, the grower treatment trees (dash line)
    were more stressed than the trees in the other two treatments. This may imply
    that trees in ET-based and SWP-based (dash dot line) treatments had adapted to
    some water stress by adjusting their root-to-shoot ratios or using other water
    stress adaption strategies as discussed by Chaves et al. (2002), whereas grower
    trees showed rapid increases in stress when irrigation was cut off. Similarly,
    Fig. 8b shows that the walnut trees with ET-based deficit irrigation treatment
    (solid line) were more stressed than other trees even though other trees were
    at similar stress levels for some part of the season (i.e., in late August and
    early September). There was some variability in the topography of the orchard
    leading to elevation differences within the same zone, particularly for the walnut
    crop. This situation influenced the stress levels of the trees because of surface
    runoff that caused water applied at one location to move to a different location.
    Some grower treatment trees at higher elevations may have been stressed because
    water was running off from those locations. Inclusion of a digital elevation map
    when creating management zones may help address this issue. Fig. 8 MCWSI calculated
    during the 2014 season on trees in the same management zones treated with three
    different irrigation treatments for a almond and b walnut crops (ET ET-based treatment,
    G grower irrigation treatment, SW SWP-based irrigation) Full size image At the
    end of each season, total irrigation water used by three treatments was calculated,
    and yields corresponding to the treatments were measured to calculate water productivity.
    As mentioned above, the water application rate for ET-based deficit irrigation
    treatment was controlled to 60% of ET requirements for both crops during the 2013
    and 2014 seasons. During the 2013 growing season, the SWP-based irrigation treatment
    used approximately 80% and 85% of ET requirements throughout the season (May to
    October) for almond and walnut crops respectively, and grower irrigation used
    more than 100% ET replacement for both crops. In the 2014 season, SWP-based irrigation
    treatment used approximately 70% of ET requirements throughout the season (May
    to October) for both crops, and grower irrigation used approximately 115% ET replacement
    for both crops. Exact amounts of water used (in liters and as percentages of ET)
    for the almond and walnut crops, measured yield, and water productivity data are
    provided in Table 3. Table 3 Amount of water used in liters and as a percentage
    of ET requirements for almond and walnut trees for three irrigation treatments
    during the 2013 and 2014 seasons Full size table For almond crop in 2013 and 2014
    and for walnut crop in 2013, grower management had the highest average yield,
    but the yields were not statistically different among the treatments at a significance
    level of 0.05 for this two-year study. These results are in accordance with regulated
    deficit irrigation (RDI) treatment experiment conducted by Stewart et al. (2011)
    for almond crop. In that study it was found that even though RDI applied 13% less
    water on average as compared to the control, there were no significant reductions
    in overall yield or amount of irrigation water used per gram of nutmeat. However,
    it was found that in another study that when high water savings about 40% for
    four continuous years were observed a significant reduction in yield (20%) was
    and a nonsignificant (3%) reduction in kernel dry mass Girona et al. (2005) were
    noticed. Water productivity (WP) of trees was calculated as the ratio of average
    yield (g) of a tree for a particular treatment to the average irrigation amount
    (liters) of a tree for that treatment. Almond trees had higher WP in comparison
    to walnut trees, and ET-based deficit irrigation treatment had the maximum WP
    for both almond and walnut crops, as depicted in Fig. 9. For 2013 almond crop
    data, WP for ET-based irrigation treatment was significantly higher than grower
    treatment, when tested statistically based on Tukey’s multiple comparison test
    at a significance level of 0.05. For 2013 walnut crop data, same test resulted
    that WP for ET-based irrigation treatment was significantly higher than grower
    and SWP-based treatments. These indicate that deficit irrigation could be more
    efficient compared to traditional grower practices, which is very useful especially
    in drought conditions. Similar results of higher WP for regulated deficit irrigation
    (RDI) treatment were also found by Goldhamer and Beede (2004) for experiment on
    pistachio trees to assess the impact of deficit irrigation during various parts
    of the season with the goal of determining which period was most stress tolerant
    in terms of nut production. For 2014 almond data, ET-based irrigation treatment
    had the maximum WP, but WP was not significantly different for the three treatments
    at a significance level of 0.05. In the case of the walnut crops, during 2014
    season, based on Tukey’s multiple comparison test, grower irrigation treatment
    had lower WP compared to the other two treatments at a significance level of 0.05.
    Fig. 9 Water productivities of almond and walnut trees assigned to different irrigation
    treatments during the a 2013 and b 2014 seasons (Note these results include water
    usage for the months of May to October only.) Full size image Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) At the end of season 2014, this study demonstrated potential of using leaf
    monitor as a device to schedule VRI as a plant based method. Daily MCWSI data
    were used to implement variable rate irrigation to demonstrate the feasibility
    of using the leaf monitor as an aid to irrigation management. SWP data measured
    before irrigation were used to classify trees as water-stressed or as not water-stressed.
    Similar predictions were made using DSWP and MCWSI relationships provided in Table
    3. Table 4 highlights the results of prediction of water stress levels based on
    MCWSI. Then, management factors were used to calculate the amounts of water to
    be applied based on MCWSI before irrigation (Eqs. 11 and 12). Table 4 also provides
    the calculation of water applied based on MCWSI values. These estimations show
    that MCWSI values calculated using leaf monitor predictions result in correct
    water stress most of the time. Using management factors based on MCWSI values
    obtained before irrigation events, the VRI led to an average 39% reduction in
    water usage as compared to the fixed 100% ET replacement irrigation method for
    all trees. It should be noted that for data in Table 4, even trees that were not
    water-stressed were also irrigated, but irrigation amounts were adjusted, as irrigation
    frequency was decided by availability of water. VRI results show that there is
    potential for saving water by making decisions based on plant water stress, and
    the leaf monitor can be a useful device for this purpose. It is recommended that
    this VRI technique be implemented on more trees for an entire season, and yield
    quality and quantity data be compared with data from traditional methods of irrigation.
    Table 4 Variable rate irrigation (VRI) based on MCWSI measured before irrigation
    and comparison with a traditional method of irrigation Full size table Goal of
    irrigation scheduling system is to determine the irrigation frequency and duration.
    In this study, irrigation frequency was decided by the water availability and
    MCWSI values were used to calculate irrigation duration/amount. If irrigation
    water is available daily, MCWSI based on leaf monitor data has potential to be
    used to determine the irrigation frequency by following the daily trend of MCWSI.
    Software can be modified to alert the grower when critical MCWSI value is reached.
    There is a potential to use this technique as automated VRI method but more work
    is required in the future to implement the automation. It should also be tested
    during the whole growing season on different crops to verify the reliability.
    Conclusions In this study, a leaf monitoring system was used to predict plant
    water status. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the leaf monitoring
    system is a useful device to collect data that can be used to monitor spatio-temporal
    variations in crop water stress index values necessary to implement VRI. The leaf
    monitor data were used to develop tree-specific/treatment zone-specific Modified
    Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI) values to quantify plant water stress levels.
    MCWSI values were correlated with measured plant water stress levels. Plant water
    stress levels were measured by measuring SWP and then subtracting the baseline
    to obtain deficit stem water potential (DWSP). Relationships between DSWP and
    MCWSI were developed for both crops. A linear relationship was found for walnuts,
    with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.67. A quadratic relationship
    was found for almonds, with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.75.
    Moreover, these results highlighted that at lower PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP,
    almonds crops did not show any decrease in transpiration rate. However, when the
    stress level exceeded 0.5 MPa of DSWP, transpiration rate tended to decrease.
    On the other hand, walnut crop showed decrease in transpiration rate even at low
    PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP. Temporal variability was noticed in PWS as it was
    found that coefficients of saturation baseline used for MCWSI method changed significantly
    throughout the season. The relationship between MCWSI and DSWP was used to implement
    variable rate irrigation or precision irrigation in the latter part of the 2014
    growing season. MCWSI values measured before irrigation were used to calculate
    irrigation amounts necessary for low frequency irrigation in walnut crops. Analysis
    showed MCWSI values can accurately predict plant water stress and can be used
    to adjust irrigation amounts. Moreover, on average, 39% less water was used for
    variable rate irrigation compared to the 100% ET replacement method. Based on
    these results, it is clear that the leaf monitor has the potential to be used
    as an irrigation scheduling tool in that it provided daily spatio-temporal stress
    index values that correlated well with traditional plant water stress measurements.
    Leaf monitor also offers few advantages that were reported as issues by other
    researchers i.e. inclusion of hot background soil during canopy temperature measurements,
    inconsistent light conditions on different parts of canopy, and changes in leaf
    angle and curling in water stressed canopies (Möller et al. 2007). Future studies
    should aim at (i) evaluating DSWP-MCWSI models for almond and walnut crops for
    VRI for complete and multiple seasons. (ii) evaluating leaf monitor and MCWSI
    for more crops and varieties to test its performance with respect to predicting
    water stress, convenience of use, and ability to assist in VRI management. Notes

    • Thermal imaging is a feasible technique for remote monitoring of grapevine water
    status. • Thermal indices (CWSI, IG, ΔTleaf-air) but also TC offer robust information
    of grapevine water status. • The best moment to monitor the crop water status
    on the basis of thermal data occurs between 11 and 14 h. • The genotype has an
    apparently limited effect on performance thermal indices under mild drought stress.
    Abstract Canopy temperature (TC) can be a robust indicator of grapevine water
    status. However, the assessment of TC by thermography in field conditions requires
    optimization, especially under variable environmental conditions (daily and seasonal)
    just like it occurs in Mediterranean areas. Besides, simplicity and robustness
    should be the basis of a wider use of thermography in field conditions. Therefore
    the comparison of simpler and more complex approaches in terms of thermal indicators
    is wise to test. Our major aims were: i) to assess the performance of four common
    thermal indicators (canopy temperature − TC, Crop Water Stress Index − CWSI, index
    of relative stomatal conductance − IG, and the difference between TC and the surrounding
    air − ΔTcanopy-air) to support irrigation decisions ii) to optimize the timing
    of thermal measurements for different genotypes and iii) to obtain mathematical
    functions to estimate leaf gas exchange parameters on the basis of thermal data.
    The trial was conducted in the summer of 2013, in south Portugal. Two V. vinifera
    red varieties, Touriga Nacional and Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo) were tested. Vines
    were subjected to two irrigation regimes: i) sustained-deficit irrigation (based
    on the farm’s schedule − control) and ii) regulated-deficit irrigation (∼50% of
    the control). We found that measurements done between 11:00 and 17:00 h provide
    the most significant correlations between TC, CWSI and IG and leaf stomatal conductance
    and net photosynthesis for both genotypes. Different linear mathematical functions
    were obtained to estimate leaf gas exchange based on the best performing thermal
    indicators under field conditions. Our results emphasize the value of TC as a
    relevant explanatory variable of vine’s physiological status, in spite of being
    a simpler and non-normalized thermal indicator. The potential relevance of TC
    for grapevine modelling and phenotyping is also discussed. Previous article in

    is the major limiting natural resource for crop production in irrigated agriculture,
    especially in semi-arid areas of European Mediterranean countries (EEA, 2012,
    Costa et al., 2007, García-Tejero et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the area of intensive
    irrigated agriculture (e.g. viticulture), has been increasing in Southern European
    countries, namely in Portugal and Spain (Costa et al., 2016, ESYRCE, 2012). Studies
    on more precise irrigation in viticulture are needed to promote water savings
    under unfavourable environments and specific terroirs (Möller et al., 2007, Chaves
    et al., 2010, Costa et al., 2016). Previous literature has shown variations in
    the water use and leaf gas exchange traits between different grapevine genotypes
    subjected to drought or deficit irrigation (Costa et al., 2012, Tomás et al.,
    2014, Bota et al., 2016) and seasonal variations in the leaf water use efficiency
    due to changing environmental conditions and leaf aging are also reported (Escalona
    et al., 2003, Williams, 2012, Tramontini et al., 2014, Medrano et al., 2015, Bellvert
    et al., 2015). Punctual measurements are often used to monitor crop water status
    in field conditions. Among them, pre-dawn and stem water potential are reliable
    indicators of plant-water status and are used to support irrigation scheduling
    (Naor, 2000, Lampinen et al., 2001, Jones, 2004a, García-Tejero et al., 2011a).
    Moreover, in species with strict stomatal regulation such as grapevine (Chaves
    et al., 2010), stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) can be a robust indicator
    of water stress (Chaves et al., 2010). Jones (2004a), for example, argued that
    gs would be a better indicator of plant response to soil water deficit than leaf
    water potential because reductions in gs may occur before any measurable change
    in plant water status. However, punctual measurements of gs cost time and labour,
    and require high number of replicates for a sound assessment, which makes such
    method less suitable for open field applications (Jones, 1999, Costa et al., 2010,
    Costa et al., 2013). In grapevine, different varieties may require different irrigation
    strategies due to differences in the regulation of leaf-gas exchange and plant
    water relations (Escalona et al., 2003, Chaves et al., 2010, Costa et al., 2012,
    Tomás et al., 2014, Bota et al., 2016). This can result in variable leaf/canopy
    temperature phenotype (Costa et al., 2012). As a consequence, more precise monitoring
    of grapevine water status on the basis of thermal data is required, especially
    when dealing with different genotypes in the same vineyard. Thermal imaging emerged
    as a non-invasive and robust technique to assess crop-water status and irrigation
    scheduling in grapevine but is still not widely used in modern orchards or vineyards
    (Jones and Leinonen, 2003, Grant et al., 2006, Grant et al., 2007, Jones and Grant,
    2016). Water stress induces stomatal closure, which limits transpiration and reduces
    evaporative cooling, resulting in higher leaf temperature (Tleaf) and/or canopy
    temperature (TC) (Jones, 1999, Jones, 2004b, Jones et al., 2009). Tleaf or TC
    can thus provide information to estimate stomatal conductance to water vapour
    and plant-water status (Jones, 2004b, Berni et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b,
    Jones et al., 2009). However, the relationships between Tleaf or TC and leaf physiological
    parameters are not always straightforward, in particular under variable meteorology
    (Tair, amount/angle of incident radiation, wind speed, vapour pressure deficit)
    (Jones, 2004b, Jones et al., 2009). Simplicity and robustness should be the basis
    to promote the use of thermography in field conditions (Fuentes et al., 2014).
    Therefore, the comparison of simpler or more complex approaches in terms of thermal
    indicators is wise to test. In order to make thermal imaging a more robust tool
    for field applications, different thermal indices were developed to normalize
    absolute values of Tleaf or TC (Jones et al., 1997, Jones et al., 2002, Maes and
    Steppe, 2012). These thermal indices are based on the estimation of artificial
    temperature references (See Eqs. (2) and (3)). The reference Twet works as a proxy
    of the minimal Tleaf measured in plants under optimal watering conditions and
    maximum transpiration. The reference Tdry is a proxy of the maximum Tleaf/TC due
    to maximum stomatal closure under severe water stress. The crop-water stress index
    (CWSI) and the index of relative stomatal conductance (IG) or the difference between
    TC and Tair (ΔTcanopy-air) are the most often used and were successfully tested
    in different crops, including grapevine (Jones, 1999, Jones et al., 2002, Grant
    et al., 2007, Costa et al., 2012, Bellvert et al., 2014). However, these indices
    require previous testing and validation for ground based and airbone thermal sensing.
    Previous works tested different strategies to optimize thermography use in the
    field by developing robust protocols based on thermal indices (Jones et al., 2002,
    Jones et al., 2009, Grant et al., 2006, Möller et al., 2007, Zia et al., 2009,
    Baluja et al., 2012, Bellvert et al., 2014, Pou et al., 2014). However, some questions
    remain though. For instance, to find which is the most practical but still robust
    thermal index that can be a proxy of plant physiological traits (e.g. leaf gas-exchange
    behaviour), and secondly, how would the variety/genotype influence thermal indices
    performance and time of measurements? The aim of the present work was to evaluate
    the performance under field conditions of different thermal indicators (TC, CWSI,
    IG and ΔTcanopy-air) to assess the water status of two red V. vinifera varieties
    [Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo), and Touriga Nacional], based on the relationships
    between these indicators and leaf stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis.
    In parallel, we aim to obtain the most representative relationships between the
    four thermal indicators and eco-physiological parameters. 2. Material and methods
    2.1. Location, plant material and growing conditions The trial was conducted in
    the 2013 in a commercial vineyard (Herdade do Esporão), Reguengos de Monsaraz,
    southern Portugal (38° 23′ 55.00″ N, 7° 32′ 46.00″ W). Eleven year-old red grapevines
    [Vitis vinifera L. cvs. Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo) and Touriga Nacional] grafted
    onto 1103 Paulsen rootstock were studied. Vines were spaced 1.5 m within and 3
    m between rows, on N-S orientation. Vines were spur-pruned on a bilateral Royat
    Cordon system and trained in a vertical shoot-positioning system with a pair of
    movable wires. All vines were uniformly pruned with 15–16 nodes per vine. Soil
    texture is a sandy-loam to silty-clay-loam, with a pH of 7.0–7.6, a low content
    in organic matter (10.5 g kg−1) and high P2O5 and K2O values (110 and 173 mg kg−1,
    respectively). The two varieties were planted side by side in two adjacent plots
    with the same experimental design: randomized complete block, with four blocks
    and two irrigation treatments: Sustained Deficit Irrigation − SDI, irrigated with
    ∼30% of ETC, and a Regulated Deficit Irrigation (RDI, ∼15% of ETC). The elemental
    plot comprised three adjacent rows (two buffer rows and a central one for data
    collection). Measurements were done in two blocks, using two vines per block.
    Water was applied using a single pipe of drip emitter (1/m) with a flow rate of
    2.2 L h−1. Crop-water requirements were weekly calculated according to Allen et
    al. (1998), using the reference evapotranspiration values obtained from an automatic
    weather station located in the experimental orchard, and considering a crop coefficient
    (Kc) equal to 0.7. Irrigation water was applied 1–2 times per week, starting at
    berry touch (berries beginning to touch − stage 77 of the BBCHscale for grapes).
    The crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and rainfall accumulated during the irrigation
    period were 429 and 9.4 mm respectively. The SDI treatment received a total of
    111 mm (∼30% ETc during the irrigation period) in 16 irrigation events, and the
    RDI treatment (late deficit at the ripening period), received 53 mm (∼15% ETc
    during the irrigation period) in 8 irrigation events. 2.2. Measurements Climate
    data (Tair, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiation) were hourly collected,
    using an automatic weather station (iMetos 1, Pessl Instruments GmbH, Werksweg,
    Austria), located in the vineyard and close to the experimental plot (about 900
    m). Vine water status was assessed along the trial by measuring leaf water potential
    at pre-dawn (Ψpd) with a Scholander pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment
    Corp., Sta. Barbara, CA, USA). A total of 4 leaves per irrigation treatment and
    genotype were used. Canopy temperature (TC) and leaf gas-exchange traits were
    measured along the day (8:00 h, 11:00 h, 14:00 h, 17:00 h, and 20:00 h) and along
    the growing season: i) 20 June (Day of the year − DOY 171, majority of berries
    touching), ii) 17 July (DOY 198, beginning of ripening: berries begin to develop
    variety-specific colour), iii) 8 August (DOY 220, mid-ripening) and iv) 21 August
    (DOY 235, full ripening, and 1 and 2 weeks before the commercial harvest of Aragonez
    and Touriga Nacional respectively). TC was measured by thermal imaging. Measurements
    were made periodically along the day with a thermal camera (Flir SC660, Flir Systems,
    USA, 7–13 μm, 640 × 480 pixels), with an emissivity (ε) set at 0.96. Each pixel
    corresponds to an effective temperature reading (Jones, 2004b). The imager was
    placed perpendicularly to the canopy, at about 2 m from the sunlit side. One image
    was made per vine, using two plants per variety, treatment, and replication (n
    = 4). Background temperature was determined by measuring the temperature of a
    crumpled sheet of aluminium foil placed near the leaves of interest using ε =
    1 (Jones et al., 2002). Thermal images were analysed by using the ‘Flir QuickReport’
    software (Flir Systems, USA). TC was estimated on the basis of the average temperature
    of 2–3 selected sunlit regions of interest (ROI) in each image. This avoided selection
    of pixels of shaded spots and/or of stem woody material. A total of 4 thermal
    images were taken per variety and irrigation treatment at each time of observation.
    The absolute TC values were normalized by calculating the thermal indices CWSI,
    IG, and ΔTcanopy-air as follows (Jones, 2004b, Maes and Steppe, 2012): (1) ΔTcanopy-air
    = TC − Tair (2) (3) Where Tdry and Twet are reference temperature values for a
    leaf with fully closed stomata and for a fully transpiring leaf, respectively;
    TC is the canopy temperature and Tair the temperature of the surrounding air.
    On each monitored vine, two fully sunlight exposed mature leaves were selected
    to obtain reference values of Tdry and Twet. One leaf was covered on both sides
    with vaseline 20–30 min before images were taken, whereas the other leaf was sprayed
    with water 15–20 s prior to thermal image acquisition. Individual leaf gas-exchange
    measurements (stomatal conductance to water vapour – gs, and net CO2 assimilation
    – An) were made by using a portable infrared gas-exchange system (LI-6400; LiCor
    Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA), equipped with a 6 cm2 transparent leaf chamber,
    with an air-flow rate set at 500 μmol s−1. These measurements were taken in two
    fully expanded and sunlit leaves per tested plant, using a total of 4 plants per
    irrigation treatment and variety. 2.3. Statistical analysis For each measurement
    day, an exploratory and descriptive analysis was made of all physiological measurements
    (gs, An and TC) and a Levene’s test was applied to test the variance homogeneity
    for the studied variables. To determine the effects of the measurement time, irrigation
    treatment and cultivar a three way ANOVA was applied using the statistical software
    SPSS (SPSS Inc., 15.0 Statistical package; Chicago, IL, USA). To evaluate the
    relationships between variables, a linear correlation analysis between the thermal
    indicators (TC, ΔTcanopy-air, CWSI and IG) and the crop physiological variables
    (gs, An) was done for each time of observation (hour) and variety (n = 32). The
    obtained correlation coefficients were used to support the decision on the best
    time of day to carry out TC readings for both varieties as well ass to assess
    robustness of the above thermal indicators as proxies of physiological meaningful
    traits (gs and An). Using the pooled data corresponding to the time periods during
    which thermal measurements showed the highest linear correlation coefficients,
    (between 11:00 and 17:00 h), a regression analysis between TC, ΔTcanopy-air, CWSI
    and IG (independent variables) and leaf gas-exchange parameters (dependent variables)
    was performed. Finally, the obtained linear regressions for each genotype were
    compared (slope and intercept) using a covariance analysis at a confidence level
    of 95%. 3. Results 3.1. Climate conditions and vine water status Fig. 1 shows
    the diurnal variation of solar radiation, Tair, air relative humidity (RH), and
    air vapour-pressure deficit (VPD) for the four observation dates. The most stressful
    environmental conditions occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 h. Solar radiation was
    similar along the trial period except under the cloudy conditions of 21 August
    (235 DOY). However, this did not reduce Tair and the highest Tair values (up to
    35 °C) occurred between 12:00 to 17:00 h, reaching a peak of 39 °C at 15:00 h.
    Tair values were lowest in early season (20 June, 171 DOY), ranging from 16 °C
    at 8:00 h to 28 °C at 17:00 h. On 17 July (198 DOY) and 8 August (220 DOY) Tair
    values were similar, ranging from 22 to 35 °C, and from 20 to 33 °C, respectively.
    RH showed an inverse trend to Tair, with the lowest values occurring on 21 August,
    and the highest ones on 20 June. The RH measured on 17 July and 8 August was similar
    for both dates. Download : Download high-res image (364KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Diurnal and seasonal time course of the climatic conditions
    along the trial and for four different days of the year (DOY): DOY 171, 20 June,
    DOY 198, 17 July; DOY 220, 8 August and DOY 235, 21 August 2013. The highest VPD
    values occurred on 21 August (reaching values up to 4.0 kPa between 10:00 and
    18:00 h), almost 3-fold higher than the minimum values registered on 20 June.
    Thus, during the trial, three distinct atmospheric situations were experienced
    by the crop: i) no-stress (DOY 171, 20 June), with low Tair and low VPD; ii) severe
    stress (DOY 235, 21 August), with very high VPD and Tair; and iii) moderate to
    severe stress due to high Tair and VPD (DOY 198 and 220; 17 July and 8 August).
    Crop-water status during the experimental period was assessed by measuring leaf
    water potential at pre-dawn (Ψpd) at each monitoring date (Fig. 3). On DOY 171
    we found no differences in Ψpd between treatments evidencing the absence of water
    stress at the starting phase of the trial. In general, the Ψpd decreased along
    the season for all treatments (Fig. 3). Aragonez vines experienced a more pronounced
    decrease and had lower Ψpd than Touriga Nacional, especially under RDI conditions
    and under specific climatic conditions (DOY 198 and 235). The range of Ψpd values
    observed along the trial (−0.2 < Ψpd < −0.5 MPa) shows that the imposed degree
    of water stress was within the range of what is considered mild-to moderate water
    stress. 3.2. Canopy temperature and individual leaf gas exchange Table 1 shows
    the diurnal variation of TC and leaf-gas exchange parameters for each irrigation
    treatment and variety. On DOY 171 significant differences were found between Aragonez-SDI
    and remaining treatments. At 17:00 h TC values of Aragonez-SDI were about 3 °C
    lower than the remaining treatments (Table 1, Fig. 2A). On DOY 198, TC increased
    along the day with a maximum at 17:00 h being the highest TC observed for Touriga
    Nacional-RDI, (Table 1, Fig. 2B). At DOY 220, (Table 1, Fig. 2C), the maximum
    TC was detected only at 17:00 h but no significant differences existed between
    RDI and SDI vines (Table 2). Finally, at DOY 235, the highest TC occurred again
    in the afternoon (14:00 and 17:00 h) and also in RDI vines (Table 1, Fig. 2D).

    cvs. Touriga Nacional and Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo) subjected to sustained deficit
    irrigation (SDI) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). Canopy temperature was
    measured with a ThermaCam FLIR SC660 (Flir Systems, USA) and leaf gas exchange

    1) and the Aragonez-SDI had the highest gs in agreement with the lowest TC values
    (Table 1). At DOY 171, the highest values of gs were observed in the morning (8:00
    h and 11:00 h) for both varieties (Table 1). At DOY 198 the SDI treatment presented
    significantly higher gs and Aragonez vines showed the highest gs along the day
    (Table 1). On DOY 220, the variation pattern of gs was similar to the one observed
    on DOY 198, which can be explained by similar climate conditions. Plants of Aragonez-SDI
    had the highest gs while Touriga Nacional-RDI showed the lowest. At the end of
    the season (DOY 235), and under the most severe drought conditions (lowest Ψpd
    of the trial) (Fig. 3), SDI vines had larger gs than RDI on both varieties. Download

    varieties Touriga Nacional (TN) and Aragonez (syn Tempranillo) (AR) subjected
    to regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or sustained deficit irrigation (SDI). Values
    are means ± SE (n = 4 leaves). Concerning leaf net photosynthesis (Table 1), the
    main differences were related to time of measurements (Table 2). The highest An
    was measured during the first measurements of the day (at 8:00 and 11:00 h) which
    paralleled the larger stomatal conductance. Irrigation strategy also influenced
    significantly the photosynthetic rates of vines, and at DOYs 198, 220 and 235
    we observed the highest rates of photosynthesis in SDI vines. In turn, most pronounced
    differences between irrigation treatments for the observed leaf gas exchange traits
    were found at 14:00 h (on DOY 198), and at 11:00, 14:00 and 17:00 h (on DOY 235).
    In fact, these two DOYs were characterized by the most stressful climatic conditions.
    Overall the highest variability in the studied parameters was associated with
    two major variables: first with the time of measurements (and related environmental
    conditions) and secondly the irrigation strategy adopted (Table 2). Despite punctual
    differences between varieties no clear distinct pattern for TC and for leaf gas
    exchange was found between Touriga Nacional and Aragonez. This can be related
    with the mild water stress conditions experienced by vines during the trial (−0.2
    < Ψpd < −0.5 MPa) (Fig. 3). 3.3. Relationships between thermal indicators and
    individual leaf gas-exchange In order to evaluate the relationships between thermal
    data and leaf gas-exchange traits (gs, An), a correlation analysis was performed
    separately for each time of measurement and variety (Table 3). While no significant
    (p < 0.05) correlations were found at beginning (8:00) and at the end of the day
    (20:00 h), we found significant correlations between thermal data and leaf gas-exchange
    parameters for the remaining hours. The correlation coefficients were negative
    for TC, ΔTcanopy-air and CWSI; and positive for IG (Table 3). The most robust
    relationships were found for the set of measurements taken at 11:00, 14:00 and
    17:00 h in both varieties, being the highest correlation coefficients found for
    the relationships between TC, CWSI and IG with An and gs. In turn, the index ΔTcanopy-air
    was found to be correlated significantly with gs at 11:00 h (only for Aragonez)
    and at 14:00 h (for both varieties) (Table 3). Table 3. Pearsońs correlation coefficients

    (TC) (E and F) for the two studied genotypes (Aragonez syn. Tempranillo) (), and
    Touriga Nacional (▲). The linear regressions for CWSI and IG are based on the
    readings taken between 11:00 and 14:00 h whereas the regressions estimated for
    TC used readings carried out between 14:00 and 17:00 h. Grey points and discontinuous
    lines (Aragonez, syn. Tempranillo) and the black points and continuous lines (Touriga
    Nacional) correspond to the linear functions obtained for each cultivar. The general
    equation corresponds to the pooled data i.e. measurements done at 11:00 h and
    14:00 h; (n = 128) for the case of the CWSI and IG. Once selected the different
    relationships for each cultivar, we have compared the differences between the
    slopes and the intercept of the obtained regression lines by ANCOVA. Because we
    found no effect of the variety either on the slopes and the intercepts a single
    function was built with the pooled data for 11–14 h, from the two varieties (Fig.
    4). Regarding the regression analysis between TC and leaf gas exchange traits,
    a similar statistical procedure was used. The pooled data relative to the 14:00
    and 17:00 h time period was used for a linear regression analysis for each variety
    (Fig. 4). Significant determination coefficients were obtained for TC vs An in
    Touriga Nacional (r2 = 0.58) and Aragonez (r2 = 0.72) and for TC vs gs in Touriga
    Nacional (r2 = 0.48) and Aragonez (r2 = 0.60). In this case, the ANCOVA analysis
    showed a significant effect of the variety on the slopes and intercepts, and separated
    relationships were retained for each variety. 4. Discussion Previous literature
    showed that thermal imaging can be used to estimate grapevine water status under
    field conditions (Jones et al., 2002, Möller et al., 2007, Costa et al., 2012,
    Grant, 2012). Nevertheless, rigorous management of deficit irrigation under variable
    climate conditions requires identification of the most adequate and robust thermal
    indicators as well as the best time of the day to perform infrared imaging measurements.
    Our results show that the best moment to monitor vine’s water status of the two
    varieties occurs between 14 and 17 h. Indeed, this is the moment of the day when
    the most significant differences in terms of TC, the thermal indices and leaf
    physiological traits (gs and An) are verified between vines subjected to RDI and
    SDI regimes (Table 1). The fact that the highest Tair and air evaporative demand
    are verified between 11:00 h and 17:00 h (Fig. 1) can generate the largest differences
    in stomatal aperture as well as in leaf temperature. Moreover, more severe soil
    water deficit promotes TC differences between varieties and deficit irrigation
    treatments (Table 1, Fig. 3). Under less stressful climatic conditions (DOY 171),
    the differences in TC between irrigation treatments were only detected at 17:00
    h. An identical pattern was found for the remaining days, in which the largest
    temperature differences (1.5–3.5 °C) between irrigation treatments occurred when
    measurements were done at 11:00, 14:00 and 17:00 h. These results are in line
    with previous studies on grapevine subjected to deficit irrigation conditions
    and which report temperature differences of 2–8 °C between plants subjected to
    different water stress levels and irrigation regimes (Costa et al., 2012, Grant
    et al., 2007, Möller et al., 2007). Additionally, other authors have shown that
    that the best moment of the day to do robust and physiologically sound temperature
    readings was at midday (Pou et al., 2014, Zia et al., 2009, Fuentes et al., 2012,
    Bellvert et al., 2015). Our findings show a high correlation between the thermal
    variables and leaf gas exchange parameters namely at 11:00 h, 14:00 h and 17:00
    h (Table 3). The non-normalized thermal indicator TC, and the thermal indices
    CWSI and IG had the highest correlation coefficients with gs and An, whereas the
    index ΔTcanopy-air showed a significant determination coefficient only at 14:00
    h, which translates some limitations of this last thermal index. The apparent
    low robustness of the index ΔTcanopy-air relatively to the other thermal indicators
    may relate to differences between the real microclimate data and the data provided
    by the meteorological station located at about 900 m distance from the field trial.
    It is possible that the accuracy of this thermal index would increase if Tair
    values were gathered at the same time and closer to the canopy area imaged by
    the thermal camera. In this study we have shown that the four thermal indicators
    have advantages and disadvantages that must be accounted when using them for water-stress
    monitoring in field and support of irrigation strategies in the vineyard Regarding
    the simplicity and the time consuming aspects, the index ΔTcanopy-air would be
    recommendable because it is easy to calculate. Besides this thermal indicator
    was successfully used in ground and aerial thermal monitoring of woody crops such
    as olives (Berni et al., 2009a), citrus (García-Tejero et al., 2011b) almonds
    (García-Tejero et al., 2012, García-Tejero et al., 2015) and grapevine (Baluja
    et al., 2012). These authors have found significant correlations between ΔTcanopy-air
    and gs and leaf water potential, when measurements were done at midday. In turn,
    Suárez et al. (2008) showed for olive trees that the diurnal variation of ΔTcanopy-air
    correlated significantly with the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), a physiological
    reflectance index that indicates photosynthetic efficiency, attesting the physiological
    relevance of this “simple” index. In order to decide if ΔTcanopy-air can be considered
    as robust as the IG and CWSI, we should consider that both the CWSI and IG are
    based on TC readings and on artificial T references (Twet and Tdry), which were
    directly collected near the zone of interest of the canopy of the monitored vines.
    This fact could justify the weaker relationships between leaf gas exchange parameters
    and ΔTcanopy-air as compared to the relationships found for CWSI and IG. Nevertheless,
    determination of reference temperatures has also limitations that can limit robustness
    of the CWSI and IG, in particular under conditions of significant environmental
    variation and variable angle of observation in relation to the solar beam (Jones
    and Grant, 2016). An important aspect raised by our results is the possibility
    of using TC values as feasible indicator of vine’s water status and a basic parameter
    to have into account for water stress monitoring and irrigation management. This
    is corroborated by the Pearson’s correlation coefficients from the relationship
    between this indicator and gs or An. Indeed, significant relationships between
    TC and gs and An were obtained for both cultivars, using the data from measurements
    at 14:00 and 17:00 (Fig. 4) The simplicity of TC could favor its use as a preliminary
    stress indicator. However, TC is highly influenced by environmental conditions,
    and hence, it can have major limitations for remote sensing of crop water status
    especially under highly variable climate conditions (e.g. windy, slightly cloudy).
    On the contrary, CWSI and IG, which represent normalized values, may be more robust
    especially under more variable environmental conditions (e.g. radiation, wind,
    Tair) along the day or in case there are limitations in obtaining a precise Tair
    near vine canopies. A final question was to assess to what extent grapevine genotype
    would be influencing robustness of the used thermal indices and related information
    on vine’s water status as this is not a fully covered aspect by literature. Different
    varieties may present different physiological response to water stress, expressed
    via different gs and transpiration rate and, consequently, different evaporative
    cooling and TC (Costa et al., 2012, Bota et al., 2016). Such differences in leaf
    gas exchange and TC will be reflected in the relationships between the thermal
    indices and plant water status and leaf gas-exchange as described in previous
    literature (Costa et al., 2012; Bellvert et al., 2013, 2015). Since we have not
    observed a significant effect of the variety on the slopes and intercepts of the
    relationships between CWSI and IG indices and leaf gas exchange parameters, a
    single function can be used for the two genotypes. In fact, under mild water stress
    (predawn ranging between −0.2 and −0.5 MPa) the stomatal behaviour of the two
    varieties was similar, with no effect on the relationships between An or gs and
    TC (Table 1, Table 3) as well as on the thermal indices (Fig. 4). Although the
    linear regression models estimated in our study for Aragonez and Touriga are in
    line with previous findings for Mediterranean conditions (Table 4), literature
    also suggests some degree of variation between genotypes, the measuring conditions
    and the set up (Table 4). Table 4. Non exhaustive list of examples showing the

    to predict vine’s leaf gas exchange on the basis of TC, CWSI and IG show the potential
    of these thermal indicators for modelling approaches in grapevine, namely to predict
    vine water status, growth and carbon balance along the day/season which is increasingly
    relevant in the context of precision viticulture as well as in the context of
    modern crop phenotyping and breeding (Greer and Weedon, 2012, Tuberosa, 2012,
    Klodt et al., 2015, Jones and Grant, 2016). 5. Conclusions Modern irrigated viticulture
    in the Mediterranean demands solutions to optimize crop monitoring and to improve
    water savings. In addition, simpler to operate but still robust methodology approaches
    should be the basis of a wider use of thermography in viticulture, Our results
    show that thermal imaging is a feasible tool to monitor remotely grapevines water
    status. Nonetheless, the decision on the most adequate thermal index to use and
    the best time of the day to perform measurements must be defined and have in consideration
    the combined effects of the genotype and the environment . Our results suggest
    that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically meaningful thermal
    data to assess vine’s water status is between 11:00 h and 14:00 h (local time),
    independently of the variety. Regarding the robustness of the tested thermal indicators,
    our results suggest that CWSI and IG provide more meaningful information about
    the crop-water status than ΔTcanopy-air. Equally relevant from our findings is
    the fact that TC shows to be significantly correlated with gs and An, suggesting
    that it can be used as simpler parameter to support thermal remote sensing of
    water stress in grapevine. In spite of being a non-normalized thermal indicator,
    TC can work as an explanatory variable of vine’s eco-physiology with potential
    use for grapevine growth models. The usefulness of ground based TC data is also
    envisaged to support validation of aerial based data which is an increasingly
    important topic of thermal infrared remote sensing (Tang and Li, 2014). The absence
    of genotype effects on the relationships between CWSI and IG indices and gas exchange
    parameters allowed us to obtain a single function to monitor crop-water status
    independently of the variety. Nevertheless, the present results should be confirmed
    for more severe drought situations, where the effect of the genotype is expected
    to become more significant. Acknowledgements This research received funding from

    \ by visible and thermal proximal sensing\nsystems under different water stress\
    \ levels to evaluate the canopy water content (CWC). The oven-\ndrying method\
    \ was employed for assessing the canopy’s water state. This CWC is of great importance\n\
    for irrigation management decisions. The proposed framework is to integrate visible\
    \ and thermal\nimaging data using an artiﬁcial neural network as a valuable promising\
    \ implement for accurately\nestimating the water content of the plant. The RGB-based\
    \ features included 20 color vegetation indices\n(VI) and 6 gray level co-occurrence\
    \ matrix-based texture features (GLCMF). The thermal imaging\nfeatures were two\
    \ thermal indicators (T), namely normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT)\n\
    and the crop water stress index (CWSI), that were deliberated by plant temperatures.\
    \ These features\nwere applied with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for\
    \ training the samples with minimal\nloss on a cross-validation set. Model behavior\
    \ was affected by ﬁltering high-level features and\noptimizing hyperparameters\
    \ of the model. The results indicated that feature-based modeling from\nboth visible\
    \ and thermal images achieved better performance than features from the individual\n\
    visible or thermal image. The supreme prediction variables were 21 features: 14VI,\
    \ 5GLCMF,\nand 2T. The fusion of color–texture–thermal features greatly improved\
    \ the precision of water content\nevaluation (99.40%). Its determination coefﬁcient\
    \ (R2 = 0.983) was the most satisﬁed with an RMSE\nof 0.599. Overall, the methodology\
    \ of this work can support decision makers and water managers to\ntake effective\
    \ and timely actions and achieve agricultural water sustainability.\nKeywords:\

    \ of global water resources are consumed through agriculture [1]. Ex-\ntreme water\
    \ use in the agricultural sector also causes water scarcity in semi-arid and arid\n\
    regions [2]. Rice is one of the most economical crops that requires large amounts\
    \ of water.\nDecreasing water availability for agriculture threatens the productivity\
    \ of the irrigated\nrice ecosystem and ways to save water and increase the water\
    \ productivity of rice must\nbe found [3]. By optimizing the timing, duration,\
    \ and amount of irrigation and drainage,\nwater-saving irrigation practice has\
    \ been proven effective in saving water and increasing\nrice yield [4]. To improve\
    \ the water use efﬁciency of plants, it is important to accurately\nand timely\
    \ predict crop water status. Canopy water content (CWC) is a signiﬁcant factor\n\
    in regard to the water use efﬁciency of plants [5], drought assessment [6], a\
    \ key input\nvariable in irrigation management decisions, and crop ripening monitoring\
    \ [7]. Moreover,\nit is a vital parameter that reﬂects plant physiological status\
    \ and health [8]. It is one of the\nindicators widely used to evaluate a plant’s\
    \ water condition [9]. Traditionally, there are\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091785\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n2 of 23\nvarious manners of observing the water state\
    \ in a plant such as lab-based leaf water content\nanalysis [10], stomatal conductance\
    \ [11], and sap ﬂow measurement [12]. Despite the high\nprecision delivered by\
    \ these ways, they are time consuming, destructive and laborious,\nparticularly\
    \ in large-scale areas [13]. Moreover, the interest in monitoring the plant water\n\
    status has increased in the scientiﬁc community through remote sensing, which\
    \ is very\nwidely used to reliably retrieve leaf water content [8].\nWe focused\
    \ on modern procedures for estimation of the CWC from optical remote sens-\ning\
    \ data, especially from visible (RGB: red–green–blue) and thermal imaging. These\
    \ have\nseveral beneﬁts compared to hyperspectral sensors. Thermal sensing is\
    \ useful since it is\ncheap, non-destructive, convenient, and can be done remotely\
    \ [14]. Digital imaging may\nprovide a low-cost and easy-to-use alternative [15].\
    \ The hyperspectral camera is heavy,\nexpensive, and requires professional imaging\
    \ and data processing [16]. The superiority of\nproximity sensing technology with\
    \ regression algorithm relies on three major aspects: hand-\ncrafted feature selection,\
    \ data fusion for different sensors, and selecting the best model\nhyperparameters.\
    \ Elsherbiny et al. [17] explained that the regression algorithms could be\nupgraded\
    \ for robust prediction of rice water status through some actions, including high-\n\
    level features nominating, hyperparameters optimization, providing various alternatives\n\
    for the most sensitive features, and integrating the model with the best-combined\
    \ features.\nPrimary, common methods for extracting RGB-based features include\
    \ color vegetation\nindices (VI) and gray level co-occurrence matrix-established\
    \ texture features (GLCMF).\nSeveral studies have found that the crop water deﬁcit\
    \ will directly affect the biochemical\nprocesses and morphology of crops, and\
    \ this effect can be observed in the color changes of\nthe crop leaves. Digital\
    \ images are composited by pixels, which are a combination of the\ncolor channels\
    \ RGB. The VI can be calculated from these channels [18]. Wang et al. [19]\ngenerated\
    \ regression models using the G–R parameter of the RGB color system with the\n\
    moisture content of cotton and the moisture content index. The prediction accuracies\
    \ were\nup to 90.7% and 91.0%, respectively. Zakaluk and Sri [20] checked the\
    \ use of artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks (ANN) for digital images, taken by a 5 megapixel\
    \ RGB camera to predict the leaf\nwater potential of potato plants. Then, the\
    \ relationship between leaf water potential and\nimage features was determined.\n\
    Another variant of GLCMF was derived from RGB images to estimate the water\nsituation\
    \ in plants. Wenting et al. [21] concluded the relationship between GLCMF of the\n\
    RGB image of crop leaves and leaf water content at heading-stage maize with an\
    \ expected\nR2 value of 0.702 and the RMSE was within ±2%. Shao et al. [22] indicated\
    \ that GLCMF-\nbased partial least square regression model can predict water content\
    \ in grapevines with\nbetter performance. The prediction R2 was 0.833 with an\
    \ RMSE of 1.049. Additionally,\nthe thermal imaging system can provide an indication\
    \ of the water condition in the plant.\nLeaf temperature is an alternative measure\
    \ that is a suitable indicator of a plant’s water\nstate [23]. Moller et al. [24]\
    \ showed that thermal imagery can be used to accurately estimate\ncrop water status.\
    \ Ballester et al. [25] used a handheld infrared thermal imager to study\nleaf\
    \ moisture content in citrus trees and persimmon trees.\nThe integration of different\
    \ data sources was a vital component of this work to im-\nprove the quality and\
    \ robustness of the CWC prediction model. This has previously been\nused to evaluate\
    \ plant phenotypes. Moller et al. [24] elucidated that the fusion of visible\n\
    and thermal imaging could develop the accuracy of the crop water stress index\
    \ (CWSI) com-\nputation and provide accurate data on the crop water status of\
    \ grapevines. Shao et al. [22]\nclariﬁed that the incorporation of both GLCMF\
    \ and reﬂectance features could enable the\nprediction of water content of grapevines\
    \ and be beneﬁcial for grapevine management and\nachieved prediction R2 of 0.900\
    \ with an RMSE of 0.826.\nThe hyperparameter optimization of the model is another\
    \ factor that has a signiﬁcant\nimpact on the efﬁciency of water content prediction.\
    \ The performance of any machine\nlearning (ML) model is profoundly affected by\
    \ hyperparameter selection, which has several\nbeneﬁts: it can improve the performance\
    \ of ML algorithms [26] and improve the repro-\nducibility and fairness of scientiﬁc\
    \ studies [27]. Furthermore, it could perform a major role\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 1785\n3 of 23\nin improving the prediction model because of the direct control\
    \ of the behaviors of training\nalgorithms [28]. In this research, the ANN building\
    \ possibility was used as a tool to support\naccurate irrigation management decision\
    \ making by means of visible and thermal sensors.\nDawson et al. [29] developed\
    \ an ANN model for predicting water content in leaves de-\npending on single leaf\
    \ reﬂectance and transmittance, which are important input variables\nto vegetation\
    \ canopy reﬂectance models. The R2 was deﬁned as 0.86 with an RMSE of 1.3%.\n\
    Marti et al. [30] described the application of ANN to estimate stem water potential\
    \ from soil\nmoisture at different depths and standard meteorological variables,\
    \ such as temperature,\nrelative humidity, and solar radiation. The ANN presented\
    \ high-performance accuracy\nwith an optimum R2 of 0.926.\nTo maximize irrigation\
    \ in rice ﬁelds, the plant’s water content should be explored\naccurately via\
    \ proximal sensing systems. Although visible and thermal imagery are widely\n\
    used to estimate water content in plants, the best performing algorithm has a\
    \ high priority\nin research interests. Based on our knowledge, no prior research\
    \ has implemented the\nhybrid methodology of BPNN with features extracted from\
    \ thermal and RGB imaging to\ndevelop a predictive model for accurate estimation\
    \ of the water content status of rice under\ndifferent irrigation water treatments\
    \ and climate change. Hence, the main objectives of\nthis study were (i) to create\
    \ a well-structured CWC modeling of rice relying on high-level\nfeatures derived\
    \ from RGB and thermal images, (ii) to deﬁne the superior variants of\nthermal\
    \ and RGB features for robust CWC prediction, and (iii) to evaluate the performance\n\
    of BPNN models using the best-combined features and to adopt the ﬁnest model that\
    \ could\nbe recommended for precision irrigation in the future.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\n2.1. Experimental Design\nThe experiment was conducted on 120 potted\
    \ plants of rice under natural conditions\nat Zhejiang University (120◦09′E, 30◦14′N),\
    \ Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, P.R. China.\nOften, a plastic cover was set\
    \ up over the plants during precipitation to control the water\nadded for them,\
    \ and to obtain the heterogeneous water condition from the tested leaves.\nTo\
    \ prepare the germination, the rice seeds (Xiushui 134) were submerged in the\
    \ water\nfor four days at a temperature of 28–30 ◦C, and the water was replaced\
    \ twice a day.\nThen, the 10 rice plants were sown into a single PVC (polyvinyl\
    \ chloride) pot, which had\ndimensions of 140 × 95 × 125 mm. Each pot was ﬁlled\
    \ with 300 g of black peat moss\n(HAWITA Gruppe GmbH, Germany) and was irrigated\
    \ to achieve saturation during\nthe ﬁrst growing month. The compound fertilizer\
    \ treatment, N–P2O5–K2O (15-15-15),\nwith a rate of 100 kg ha−1 was applied at\
    \ 10-day intervals, produced by Qingdao SONEF\nChemical Company. Potted rice plants\
    \ were transplanted on July 10, 2018 and divided into\n3 groups, each with 40\
    \ pots. It was harvested on August 12, August 30, and September 21,\n2018 for\
    \ the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd groups, respectively. Table 1 shows the summary statistics\n\
    of air temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD). The values\
    \ of\nVPD were determined from the formula stated by Abtew and Melesse [31]. In\
    \ this work,\nthere were three different growth stages of the rice plants: tillering,\
    \ stem elongation,\nand panicle initiation. The water deﬁcit was implemented within\
    \ a period of 27–34 days,\n34–52 days, and 52–74 days of plant life for the 1st,\
    \ 2nd, and 3rd groups, respectively.\nAs declared in Figure 1, an experiment was\
    \ carried out with a completely randomized\nblock design in a factorial experiment.\
    \ The experimental design was divided into three\ngroups, each comprising four\
    \ irrigation treatments: fully-irrigated (T1: 100%), mild (T2:\n80–70%), moderate\
    \ (T3: 60–50%), and severe water stress (T4: 40–30% ﬁeld capacity),\nrespectively.\
    \ The number of replicates (R1, R2, etc.) of treatment was 10 samples. Generally,\n\
    the gravimetric approach was used to measure the volume of water by manually weighing\n\
    pots twice a day, supplemented by replacing the transpiration of water to preserve\
    \ the\nrespective moisture stress conditions. Gross water applied volumes were\
    \ estimated for\neach group, 1st stage values were 44.35, 41.65, 39.4, and 37.15\
    \ L (liter) for well-controlled,\nmild, moderate, and severe stress conditions,\
    \ respectively. Their corresponding values at\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n4\
    \ of 23\nthe 2nd group were 60.35, 56.40, 53.29, and 49.25 L and at the 3rd group\
    \ were 73.55, 69.15,\n65.85, and 63.65 L, respectively.\nTable 1. Brief measurements\

    \ infrared camera is Tau2-640 (FLIR systems, Inc., USA), which had a\nresolution\
    \ of 640 × 512 pixels, and a focal length of 19 mm. The sensitivity of the Tau2-640\n\
    camera is 0.05 ◦C (50 mK), and the accuracy of the measurement is ±5% after calibration.\n\
    The thermal sensor has a spectral response in the range of 7.5–13.5 µm. The thermal\n\
    camera was mounted on a tripod at a distance of 1 m above the crop, and the angular\n\
    ﬁeld of view was perpendicular to the plants. The thermal images were taken from\
    \ the\ntop view of the plant canopy. The water status measurements were conducted\
    \ between\n12:00 and 13:00 local standard time on all plants, when the crop plants\
    \ had a maximum\ndaytime temperature, were in perfect sun, and with minimal wind\
    \ movement. The crops\nexhibit high emissivity as well as low reﬂectivity [32].\
    \ In the thermal images, a signiﬁcant\ndifference in soil temperature was noticed,\
    \ but when the soil was masked out, it was not\nimportant when remaining focused\
    \ on the crop. The thermal value obtained by thermal\ninfrared images was originally\
    \ stored in the raw image in which each pixel is 14 bits.\nThe raw format can\

    \ − 273.15\n(1)\nwhere Thraw and Tem (◦C) represent the thermal value and the\
    \ corresponding pixel tem-\nperature, respectively. The ﬁrst constant (0.04) is\

    \ and the second value (−273.15) is to convert Kelvin\nto Celsius.\n2.4. Image\

    \ efﬁcient computation of the canopy water\ncontent. Firstly, for the RGB images,\
    \ a thresholding technique was employed, which is a\nprocess of image segmentation\
    \ to convert the image to grayscale [34] and produce a binary\nimage [34], which\
    \ has two possible pixel values, namely the intensity value of the image\nthat\
    \ is more than or equal to the threshold value of 1 (white or foreground) and\
    \ when\nit is less than the threshold value or value 0 (black or background) that\
    \ can be removed.\nEach pixel in the binary image has a size of 1 bit. After separating\
    \ the rice pixels from the\nbackground objects, a set of candidate features, including\
    \ color and texture, were extracted\nfor further analysis. Secondly, for the thermal\
    \ images, python software was employed\nto generate a code for segmenting the\
    \ rice plants. The ground temperature was higher\nthan any parts in the image,\
    \ despite the soil and pot being lower than others. Accordingly,\nwe can separate\
    \ the temperature of the objects as either higher or lower than that of rice\n\
    plants. Average plant temperature was calculated for all pixels in each thermal\
    \ image.\nFigure 3 describes thermal image segmentation and canopy temperature\
    \ distribution\nduring the different irrigation treatments in the three growth\
    \ stages of the rice. At the 1st\nstage, the canopy temperatures were observed\
    \ in the ranges of 32–33.5 ◦C (well-watered),\n33.8–35.4 ◦C (mild stress), 35.75–36.5\
    \ ◦C (moderate stress), and 36.9–37.55 ◦C (severe stress).\nThe canopy temperature\

    \ Extraction from RGB Images\nRGB images contain large amounts of data, thereby\
    \ analyzing the image requires a\nlarge volume of memory and leads to more time.\
    \ Consequently, to decrease the volume of\ndata, an image is depicted using a\
    \ series of features. The purpose is to capture the image’s\ncertain visual properties.\
    \ Feature extraction has a crucial role in different image processing\nsystems.\
    \ The most common ways to extract features from RGB images are RGB color space\n\
    percentage and GLCM-based texture features.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n7 of\
    \ 23\n2.5.1. RGB Color Space Percentage\nThe RGB imagery involves three bands\
    \ of red, green, and blue, where each band has\na value of each pixel [35]. The\
    \ rice plants modiﬁed the content of chlorophyll to balance\nphotosynthesis and\
    \ transpiration under conditions of water stress. The RGB channel values\nwere\
    \ affected, owing to different levels of canopy water content. The percentage\
    \ values of\nthe RGB color space were determined as typical features using the\
    \ following formulas:\nR=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\ni=1 Ri\n(2)\nG=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\n\
    i=1 Gi\n(3)\nB=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\ni=1 Bi\n(4)\nwhere Ri, Gi, and Bi are the pixel\
    \ value for the red, green, and blue band in the digital\nimage, respectively;\
    \ i and Snum are the ﬁrst pixel and the maximum number of pixels,\nrespectively;\
    \ R, G, and B are mean values of RGB color space.\nAbout 20 color vegetation indices\
    \ for plant water status estimation were evaluated.\nTable 2 reveals RGB-based\
    \ vegetation indices as claimed by numerous previous studies.\nIn our study, these\
    \ indices were examined to explore their feasibility for CWC modeling\nand compared\
    \ as input to the model for adoption of the best indices.\nTable 2. Description\

    \ Matrix-Based Texture Features (GLCMF)\nSeveral studies related to assessing\
    \ the water status of the plant have used GLCMF:\nWenting et al. [21], to predict\
    \ maize leaf moisture content, and Ushada et al. [46], to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ content and leaf water potential of moss. This is based on the fact that changes\n\
    in the textural appearance of a plant canopy due to the water status reﬂects tonal\
    \ variations\nover the community of plants [47]. The co-occurrence matrix is a\
    \ statistical method for\nexamining the texture of a grayscale image [48]. The\
    \ GLCMF analyzes the grayscale rela-\ntionship between two pixels in the image\
    \ space that are separated by a certain distance and\nthen randomly extracts the\
    \ canopy texture feature information premised on probability\ncharacteristics.\
    \ There were six variants of GLCMF in this study such as contrast, dissimilar-\n\
    ity, homogeneity, angular second moment (ASM), energy, and correlation. The contrast\n\
    clearly represents the depth of the image and texture. Dissimilarity measures\
    \ the distance\nbetween pairs of pixels in the region of interest. Homogeneity\
    \ estimates the closeness of\nthe distribution of elements in the GLCMF. ASM discovers\
    \ the roughness distribution and\ntexture image. Energy measures textural uniformity.\
    \ The correlation ﬁnds out the degree of\ncorrelation in the local grayscale image.\
    \ The RGB-based GLCMF variables are explicated,\nas shown in Table 3.\nTable 3.\

    \ of values. N is the number of\nrows or columns.\n2.6. Feature Extraction from\
    \ Thermal Images\nThermal indicators (T) are features extracted from thermal images\
    \ depending on the\nrice plant temperatures, which consist of two indices in this\
    \ study: the crop water stress\nindex (CWSI) and normalized relative canopy temperature\
    \ (NRCT).\n2.6.1. Canopy Temperature-Based Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)\nThe\
    \ CWSI deduced from canopy temperature for many crops has been widely nom-\ninated\
    \ as an instrument to elucidate plant water conditions and schedule irrigation\
    \ [50].\nThe CWSI concept is linked to the standard in which the leaf surface\
    \ is cooled during the\ntranspiration process, and as soil moisture in the root\
    \ zone is also depleted, leaf temperature\nincreases and stomatal transpiration\
    \ and conductance decrease. An empirical approach\nwas proposed to determine crop\
    \ water stress as reported by Idso et al. [51]:\nCWSI =\n[(Tc − Ta) − (Tnws −\
    \ Ta)]\nh\x10\nTdry − Ta\n\x11\n− (Tnws − Ta)\ni\n(5)\nwhere Ta, Tc, Tnws, and\
    \ Tdry are air temperature (◦C), canopy temperature (◦C), non-water-\nstressed\
    \ canopy temperature (◦C), and water-stressed canopy temperature (◦C), respectively.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n9 of 23\n2.6.2. Normalized Relative Canopy Temperature\
    \ (NRCT)\nTo calculate the NRCT index, wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures were\
    \ suggested by\nJackson et al. [23] as the lower and upper baseline, respectively.\
    \ As stated in the formula\nby Elsayed and Darwish [9], the NRCT was computed\
    \ as follows:\nNRCT =\nTc − Tmin\nTmax − Tmin\n(6)\nwhere Tmin and Tmax are the\
    \ lowest and highest temperatures measured in the experiment\n(◦C), respectively.\n\
    2.7. Canopy Water Content Computation\nAfter scanning by the visible and thermal\
    \ imaging system, the plants in each pot were\npicked. The roots were removed\
    \ and the rest was studied to provide a reference for data\nanalysis. Thus, the\
    \ above-ground part of the plants in one pot was deﬁned as one sample\nin this\
    \ study. To obtain the fresh weight (FW), the samples were weighed before drying.\n\
    Then, the dry weight (DW) was obtained after drying the samples for 24 h in an\
    \ oven at\na temperature of 70 ◦C. The percentage of canopy water content was\
    \ estimated by the\nfollowing formula:\nCWC (%) = FW − DW\nFW\n× 100\n(7)\n2.8.\
    \ Dataset and Data Analysis Software\nA total of 120 readings were split into\
    \ training, validation, and testing, where 80%\n(96 samples) were used for the\
    \ training and validation process of the regression model,\nwhile the other 20%\
    \ (24 samples) were used to verify the model’s performance by com-\nparing the\
    \ expected CWC values with the calculated CWC values. A leave-one-out cross-\n\
    validation (LOOCV) approach was utilized to train and validate the model. LOOCV\
    \ ex-\ncludes one sample for validation and uses the rest of the samples for training\
    \ in every trial.\nThis method can decrease over-ﬁtting and permits a more accurate\
    \ assessment of model\nprediction strength [52]. The feature selection, model\
    \ establishment, and data analysis were\nimplemented using Python 3.7.3. The ANN\
    \ module from the Scikit-learn library version\n0.20.2 was used for the regression\
    \ task. The software was run on a PC with Intel Core\ni7-3630QM, 2.4 GHz CPU,\
    \ and 8 GB RAM.\n2.9. Implementation of a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN)\n\
    The BPNN employs the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) as a supervised learning\n\
    algorithm that contains a ﬂexible function to train a speciﬁc data set [53]. MLP\
    \ is one of\nthe neural network models that has the same back-propagation structure\
    \ for supervised\ntraining. Typically, back-propagation is used for the training\
    \ of feed-forward. The neural\nnetwork is structured from 3 types of layers: (1)\
    \ the input layer is the primary data for the\nneural network, (2) the hidden\
    \ layer is an intermediate layer between the independent\ninputs layer and dependent\
    \ output layer, and (3) the output layer produces the results\nof the speciﬁed\
    \ inputs. Figure 4 displays the architecture of an artiﬁcial neural network,\n\
    which is a class of machine learning algorithms. It uses multiple layers to gradually\n\
    extract high-level features from the raw input. Five squares as input layers are\
    \ noted\nas vector I. The network contains two hidden layers, the number of nodes\
    \ determined\naccording to regression accuracy. Four squares as hidden layers\
    \ represent the “activation”\nnodes and usually are noted as weight; W, Wh, and\
    \ Wo are with layers 1–2, 2–3, and 3–4,\nrespectively. The ﬁnal square represents\
    \ the output layer that shows the predicted value\nof canopy water content. The\
    \ bias neuron (B) is a special neuron added to each layer in\nthe neural network,\
    \ which is usually taken to be 1 [54]. The artiﬁcial neural networks\nare generalized\
    \ mathematical models that use a series of neurons or nodes interlinked by\nweighted\
    \ connections to simulate human cognition as it applies to pattern identiﬁcation\n\
    and prediction [55].\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n10 of 23\n \n\U0001D466 ൌ ሺ\U0001D703\

    Input variants involve RGB-based features (color: 20VI and texture: 6GLCMF) and\n\
    thermal properties (2T). To facilitate the model training process, a transformation\
    \ was\nperformed to rescale the features. Normalization is transformed across\
    \ individual features\n(f) to adjust for differences in magnitude between different\
    \ features. Feature normalization\n(fnorm) is computed by subtracting the minimum\
    \ image data (fmin) and by dividing the\ndifference between the maximum (fmax)\

    \ to\nimplement the algorithm efﬁciently [56]. Otherwise, there are several methodologies\
    \ to\nselect premium features depending on feature selection algorithms that have\

    Various combinations of variables were examined to predict CWC, and the top neural\n\
    network architectures for hidden conﬁgurations were presented. The numbers of\
    \ hidden\nneurons were different due to the variations in the feature values extracted\
    \ from the\nvisible and thermal images. The proposed features of color indices,\
    \ texture characteristics,\nand thermal indicators were evaluated to adopt the\
    \ best-combined variants.\n3.1.1. Color Vegetation Indices (VI)\nThe optimal VI\
    \ identiﬁed in each loop during neural network training are clariﬁed in\nFigure\
    \ 6. The neural network performance was estimated with different VI. As explained\n\
    in Table 4, model performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, and MAPE) were evaluated through\n\
    training, cross-validation, and a test set. Moreover, the prediction accuracy\
    \ (Acc) was\ncalculated. The best hyperparameters such as hidden neurons, activation\
    \ function, and the\nmaximum number of iterations of the neural network were chosen.\
    \ Several architectures\nof the BPNN model relying on VI were collected. The best\
    \ neural network results were\nattained by fusing data of 14VI at the 7th loop,\
    \ as displayed in Figure 6. The ﬁnest\nhyperparameters of activation function,\
    \ hidden neurons, and maximum iterations were\nlogistic, (19,15), and 119 iterations,\
    \ respectively. The RMSECV decreased to 2.291 vs. 2. 444\ncompared to 14VI vs.\
    \ 20VI. The prediction ability of the BPNN-VI-14 model increased\nequivalent to\
    \ the model with full VI, with prediction R2 (0.632 vs. 0.556), MAPE (2.832% vs.\n\
    3.273%), RMSE (2.788 vs. 3.065), MSE (7.776 vs. 9.394), and Acc (0.972 vs. 0.967).\n\

    \ Features Extracted from Visible and Thermal Imagery\nThe ﬁndings inferred that\
    \ in comparison with the BPNN-GLCMF-5 and BPNN-VI-14\nmodels, the BPNN-T-2 model\
    \ had dependable foretelling. Further, the thermal indica-\ntors (T) were joined\
    \ with VI and GLCMF to improve the forecasting performance and\ndiscover the unmatched\
    \ model. The three approaches were espoused as a new expecta-\ntion procedure\
    \ of the rice water content, incorporating VI-T, GLCMF-T, and VI-GLCMF-T\nfeatures\
    \ with the BPNN model. Their outputs (MSE, RMSE, and MAPE) and notable\nparameters\
    \ are disclosed in Table 7. The order of the models was deﬁned by the smallest\n\
    RMSECV: the performance of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21>BPNN-GLCM-T-7>BPNN-VI-T-16.\nTheir\
    \ corresponding values at cross-validation R2 were 0.984 (RMSECV = 0.361), 0.982\n\
    (RMSECV = 0.447), and 0.956 (RMSECV = 0.661), respectively. Their prediction outputs\n\
    with the R2, MAPE, RMSE, MSE, and Acc were 0.983, 0.564%, 0.599, 0.359, and 0.994;\
    \ 0.972,\n0.668%, 0.764, 0.583, and 0.993; and 0.978, 0.682%, 0.674, 0.455, and\
    \ 0.993, respectively.\nThe distinguishing parameters of the most robust model\
    \ were with hidden layer neurons\n(8,9), activation function (logistic), and maximum\
    \ iterations (422). The BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-\n21 model had quick predictive outcomes\
    \ within 31.911 s for a single sample compared to the\noven-drying method [17,60];\
    \ a test time of 24 h is required to dry the sample. The ﬁndings\nare in agreement\
    \ with Meeradevi et al. [61] who used ANN as a fast tool with a prediction\ntime\
    \ of 9.74 s. The results elucidated that the improvement in prediction accuracy\
    \ of CWC\ncan be fulﬁlled if adequate neural network parameters and higher variables\
    \ are assigned.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n16 of 23\nTable 7. Various architectures\

    \ (sec).\n3.2. Neural Network Learning Curves with Super Features\nThe learning\
    \ curve of the regression model was promoted in this study through the\nfollowing\
    \ considerations: (1) number and characteristics of nominated features, (2) pick-\n\
    ing the supreme parameters, and (3) neural network deﬁnite iterations to avoid\
    \ model\nover-ﬁtting. The ﬁrst two points are discussed in the previous sections.\
    \ The last factor\nrefers to the neural network stopping at speciﬁc iterations\
    \ that can progress the network\nperformance, as indicated in Figure 9. These\
    \ curves exhibit an evaluation of the model’s\nbehavior with the higher variants\
    \ at training, cross-validation, and testing. As the number\nof iterations increases,\
    \ the accuracies of training, cross-validation, and testing increase\ngradually\
    \ to reach a point where the learning curves show a good model. As publicized\n\
    in Figure 9a–d, the optimal repetitions of the BPNN training process through the\
    \ highest\nvariables (14VI, 5GLCMF, 2T, and VI-GLCMF-T-21) were 119, 175, 217,\
    \ and 422 steps,\nrespectively. The learning curves of the innovative models reached\
    \ a cross-validation\naccuracy of 0.625, 0.656, 0.851, and 0.984, respectively.\
    \ The learning outcomes veriﬁed that\nthe accuracy measure steadily increases\
    \ over iterations of training. When the permissible\niterations of the neural\
    \ network are exceeded, the model generally takes the form of making\nan overly\
    \ complex model. Moreover, training accuracy was usually higher than cross-\n\
    validation accuracy. The three-stage model of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T was accomplished\
    \ with\n21 variables and 422 steps. Its prediction accuracy was 99.4% (R2 = 0.983\
    \ with an RMSE\nof 0.599), and the learning curve performance was impressive (Figure\
    \ 9d). The expected\nperformance was improved as said by Thawornwong and Enke\
    \ [62]; to avoid over-ﬁtting,\nthe network was trained by the back-propagation\
    \ algorithm with early stopping.\n3.3. Neural Network Topology with Higher Variants\n\
    The neural network architectures after gathering senior features are introduced\
    \ in\nFigure 10. This ﬁgure showed the best neural network structure with the\
    \ variants chosen.\nEach network topology offers basic information such as the\
    \ synaptic weights trained,\na range of hidden neuron layers, steps for converging,\
    \ and the overall errors. The network\ntopology is constructed with a speciﬁc\
    \ combination of input variables with a number of\nhidden neuron layers. For instance,\
    \ the model of BPNN-VI-14 had hidden neuron layers\n(19,15), BPNN-GLCMF-5 needed\
    \ (6,10), BPNN-T-2 required (19,18), and BPNN-VI-GLCMF-\nT-21 desired (8,9). The\
    \ layout presented in Figure 10a depicts the BPNN-VI-14 model;\nthe training process\
    \ needed 119 steps to achieve a lower error function. The process has\nan overall\
    \ error of roughly 2.358. The learning process of the BPNN-GLCMF-5 model\n(Figure\
    \ 10b) demands 175 steps, containing an overall error of about 3.130. At the BPNN-T-\n\
    2 model (Figure 10c), the training process obligated 217 steps with a total error\
    \ of about\n0.960. At the BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21 model (Figure 10d), the learning\
    \ process requested\n422 steps, and the overall error was 0.0317.\n3.4. Canopy\
    \ Water Content Prediction and Validation\nFrom the results, the thermal features\
    \ had a high ranking for measuring the CWC of\nrice in contrast to VI and GLCMF.\
    \ The super thermal variables were linked to acceptable-\nlevel features as follows:\
    \ VI-GLCMF-T, VI-T, and GLCM-T. The VI-GLCMF-T features\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13,\
    \ 1785\n17 of 23\nwere the premium integration to ﬁlter the uppermost variables.\
    \ The neural network\nwas trained with the previous features (independent variables)\
    \ for predicting the CWC\n(dependent variable). The expected CWC values were then\
    \ compared with the reserved\nvalues not implemented for the neural network. Figure\
    \ 11 illustrates the scatter plots of\nobserved and predicted CWC in rice exploiting\
    \ the proposed features. This study evaluated\nmultivariate methods and compared\
    \ the results clearly, so the use of multivariate methods\ngreatly enhances predictability.\
    \ Independent validation can also be considered the most\nrobust method for evaluating\
    \ the accuracy of the regression model since validation data\nare not involved\
    \ in the model development process. The BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21 was\nthe ﬁrst best\
    \ predictive model as evidenced by the performance and showed a stronger\nrelationship\
    \ between the superlative features and CWC. These features involved in this\n\
    model are of great signiﬁcance for predicting water content. Its outputs with\
    \ R2 were\n0.984 (cross-validation) and 0.983 (test set). The BPNN-GLCMF-T-7 model\
    \ ranked second\nin performance. The R2 value was 0.982 and 0.972 in the cross-validation\
    \ and test set,\nrespectively. The BPNN-VI-T-16 was the third highest accurate\
    \ model (R2 = 0.956 and\n0.978 for cross-validation and test set, respectively).\
    \ Models constructed with individual\nfeatures of either VI or GLCMF had lower\
    \ performance expectations, while these features\ncombined with 2T achieved robust\
    \ forecasting. Otherwise, the residual value plays a vital\nrole to validate the\
    \ obtained regression model. The difference between the actual CWC\nand the predicted\
    \ CWC value is the residual. We calculated the residual value with the\nﬁrst three\
    \ higher models. At BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-21, −1.223% and 1.916% were the lowest\nand\
    \ highest residuals for the CWC prediction, respectively. At BPNN-VI-T-16, the\
    \ lowest\nand highest residuals were −1.128% and 1.380%, while the lowest residuals\
    \ of −0.583%\nand highest of 2.859% were calculated with BPNN-GLCMF-T-7.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n\

    plantʹs water condition. The plant color feature can be used for plant stress assessment \n\
    [63]. Texture analysis is significant in many areas such as remote sensing and its common \n\

    4. Discussion\nColor and texture are two important aspects in digital imagery.\
    \ Plant temperature is\nalso a remarkable tool in thermal imaging, which can be\
    \ used as an indicator to identify a\nplant’s water condition. The plant color\
    \ feature can be used for plant stress assessment [63].\nTexture analysis is signiﬁcant\
    \ in many areas such as remote sensing and its common\napplications include image\
    \ classiﬁcation and pattern recognition [64]. These features of VI\nand GLCMF\
    \ were applied with a neural network for CWC quantiﬁcation in rice. The results\n\
    conﬁrmed that the neural network behavior with GLCMF was superior to VI for predicting\n\
    the water status of plants. This is similar to applying classiﬁcation in the following\
    \ studies:\nJana et al. [65], to classify eight varieties of fruits, and Dubey\
    \ and Jalal [66], to recognize\ndiseases in fruits. Texture features performed\
    \ better than color features for classiﬁcation\nvia support vector machine algorithm\
    \ with accuracy, 32.29% and 69.79% and 83.5% and\n88.56%, respectively. Moreover,\
    \ the thermal analysis results agreed with the ﬁndings of\nJones [67], who identiﬁed\
    \ that water content or transpiration has an inverse relationship\nwith leaf temperature.\
    \ The CWC values were highly inﬂuenced owing to the loss of water\nthrough transpiration;\
    \ CWSI and NRCT reﬂected normalized temperature values for the\ncrop. These results\
    \ are in agreement with Blum et al. [68], who indicated that the CWC\ndecreases\
    \ with increasing canopy temperature as a result of increased water stress.\n\
    The current work has allowed a more accurate determination of the water conditions\n\
    in rice, using the best-combined features extracted from RGB and thermal images.\
    \ The pro-\nposed approaches use all of the sensitive features to changes in the\
    \ CWC that greatly\nincrease the model performance. Our outcomes achieved greater\
    \ accuracy than those of\nAlchanatis et al. [69], who demonstrated that fusion\
    \ of thermal and visible imaging can\nprovide precise data on the crop water status\
    \ of grapevines, and the CWSI was highly\ncorrelated with measured stomatal conductance\
    \ with an R2 value of 0.97. The developed\nmodel outperformed Leinonen and Jones\
    \ [70], who stated that the combination of thermal\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n\
    20 of 23\nand visible imagery was a more accurate tool for estimating canopy temperature\
    \ and\ncould be used to identify water deﬁcit stress in a plant. They investigated\
    \ the relation-\nship between the measured stomatal conductance and the calculated\
    \ CWSI with an R2 of\n0.867. Likewise, the ﬁrst-order model of the BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-21\
    \ was very precise in\ncontrast to that of Sun et al. [71], who referred to a\
    \ reasonable model for computing CWC\nin wheat based on the ratio vegetation index\
    \ (RVI: 1605 and 1712 nm) and the normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI:\
    \ 1712 and 1605 nm), having the highest R2 and lowest\nRMSE in model calibration\
    \ and validation (R2c = 0.74 and 0.73; RMSEC = 0.026 and 0.027;\nR2v = 0.72 and\
    \ 0.71; RMSEV = 0.028 and 0.029). Furthermore, the proposed model is better\n\
    than Ge et al. [72], who concluded that leaf water content in maize at a pot-scale\
    \ is success-\nfully predicted with the hyperspectral images using the PLSR model\
    \ for two genotypes\nin model cross-validation (R2 = 0.81 and 0.92; RMSE = 3.7\
    \ and 2.3; MAPE = 3.6 and 2.2).\nThe created model achieved high performance compared\
    \ to Pandey et al. [73], who reported\nthat PLSR analysis can be performed to\
    \ predict the leaf water content of pot-grown maize\nand soybean plants with the\
    \ highest accuracy (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 1.62, and MAPE = 1.6%)\nfor validation.\
    \ In addition, this research is in agreement with the following study in that\n\
    the combination of color–GLCM–thermal features are high-quality variants in regression\n\
    or classiﬁcation applications. Bhole et al. [74] used different features such\
    \ as the color (CM:\ncolor moments and CCV: color coherence vector), texture (GLCMF),\
    \ and thermal (T) with a\nrandom forest for classiﬁcation of eleven categories\
    \ of fruits. The results showed that the\nmodel accuracies for integrating GLCM-T,\
    \ CM-T, CCV-T, and CM-CCV-GLCM-T features\nwere 84.26%, 91.17%, 92.95%, and 93.4%,\
    \ respectively.\nFinally, remote and proximal sensing images acquired with high-resolution\
    \ cameras,\nmounted at ground level or on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), have\
    \ spatial resolutions\nof a few centimeters. These images can provide sufﬁcient\
    \ accurate information for both\nassessing plant water status in the ﬁeld and\
    \ implementing appropriate irrigation man-\nagement strategies [75]. Thus, this\
    \ work can assist in improving inexpensive, effective\nhigh-throughput phenotyping\
    \ platforms for large numbers of breeding plants at different\nlevels of irrigation.\
    \ A practical sharing of research may improve site-speciﬁc rice irrigation\nmanagement\
    \ through designing an intelligent irrigation system based on the best-proposed\n\
    model. The methodology of this study that relied on ground-based cameras can be\
    \ scaled\nup to UAV-based applications to increase productivity [76] and monitor\
    \ the water condition\nof crops in large-scale areas.\n5. Conclusions\nEstimation\
    \ of canopy water content (CWC) is highly important in precision plant\nreproduction\
    \ and agricultural development. Low-cost outdoor cameras, such as visible\nand\
    \ thermal imaging systems, would be an applicable implement for predicting water\n\
    content in the plant. Therefore, the present study explored the ability to incorporate\
    \ top-\nlevel features retrieved from visible and thermal imaging with a back-propagation\
    \ neural\nnetwork (BPNN) to adopt a three-stage model of CWC for rice. Hand-crafted\
    \ features,\nincluding 20 vegetation indices (VI), 6 GLCM texture features (GLCMF),\
    \ and 2 thermal\nindicators (T), were identiﬁed for analysis. The experimental\
    \ results showed that the\nproposed model of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T provided effective\
    \ recognition of CWC in the\nrice crop. Expectation accuracy increased to 99.4%\
    \ by conjoining 21 superlative features.\nAt hidden neuron layers (8,9), the R2\
    \ raised to 0.983 with an RMSE of 0.599. The models\nwith separate features performed\
    \ lower than the best built-in features. Their corresponding\nvalues with prediction\
    \ R2 were 0.632 (RMSE = 2.788), 0.679 (RMSE = 2.607), and 0.803\n(RMSE = 2.043)\
    \ using 14VI, 5GLCM, and 2T, respectively. Ultimately, the superlative model\n\
    has a high level of conﬁdence and reliable outcomes. In the future, this tool\
    \ may open an\navenue for rapid, high-throughput assessments of the water condition\
    \ of plants, as well as\nbeing equally important for procedures related to agricultural\
    \ water management.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n21 of 23\nAuthor Contributions:\

    December 2013   Published: 13 January 2014 Abstract Crop canopy temperature (Tc)
    is coupled with transpiration, which is a function of soil and atmospheric conditions
    and plant water status. Thus, Tc has been identified as a real-time, plant-based
    tool for crop water stress detection. Such plant-based methods theoretically integrate
    the water status of both the plant and its environment. However, previous studies
    have highlighted the limitations and difficulty of interpreting the Tc response
    to plant and soil water stress. This study investigates the links between cotton
    Tc, established measures of plant water relations and atmospheric vapour pressure
    deficit (VPDa). Concurrent measures of carbon assimilation (A), stomatal conductance
    (gs), leaf water potential (Ψl), soil water (fraction of transpirable soil water
    (FTSW)) and Tc were conducted in surface drip irrigated cotton over two growing
    seasons. Associations between A, gs, Ψl, FTSW and Tc are presented, which are
    significantly improved with the inclusion of VPDa. It was concluded that utilising
    the strong associations between Ψl, VPDa and Tc, an adjustment of 1.8°C for each
    unit of VPDa should be made to the critical Tc for irrigation. This will improve
    the precision of irrigation in Tc based irrigation scheduling protocols. Improved
    accuracy in water stress detection with Tc, and an understanding of the interaction
    the environment plays in this response, can potentially improve the efficiency
    of irrigation. Additional keywords: cotton, gas exchange, Gossypium hirsutum,

    water-status by plant-based sensors Alessio Scalisi [Department of Agricultural,
    Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, Italy] Kushtrim Bresilla [Department
    of Agricultural Sciences, University of Bologna, Italy] Filipa Simões Grilo [Department
    of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, Italy] Recently,
    climate change has caused shortages of water worldwide, especially in semi-arid
    and arid regions. Several irrigation strategies have been studied with the aim
    of saving water overuse in agriculture. In the past most of the attention was
    directed towards soil water content, but recently the focus has moved to plant
    responses to water deficit. In recent years, crop evapotranspiration (ETc) obtained
    from reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficients (Kc), has become
    common for irrigation scheduling in several crops, but it does not provide precise
    insights on the tree water status. Today an increasing focus is being given to
    plant-based sensors for the continuous monitoring of plant water status to provide
    support to irrigation management strategies with a precision approach. In this
    work several plant-based (leaf, stem and fruit) devices used for plant water status
    sensing and for irrigation scheduling are reviewed. Scientists have managed to
    create and test a variety of small leaf-adapted sensors with the aim of 7collecting
    valuable information on water dynamics. Nondestructive continuous water status
    detection in leaves is difficult due to the intrinsic fragility of these organs.
    Yet, the data collected can provide insights on the actual status of one leaf,
    within a multitude of other leaves which might have a slightly different behavior
    because of factors such as age, sun exposure, canopy position and others. Leaf
    thickness sensors, leaf pressure and leaf thermal probes are discussed in this
    review. Stems and shoots establish the connection between climatic conditions
    and water availability in the soil. Continuous measurements of stem water status
    by non-destructive sensors provide information not only on the variations of soil
    water availability but also on the reserves of plant tissues. The use of stem
    dendrometers, sap flow probes, stem hygrometers and stem microtensiometers for
    continuous determination of plant water status and irrigation management is discussed.
    Moreover, it has been demonstrated that fruit water relations have key implication
    on horticultural production and quality. Measurements of fruit water status and
    fruit growth dynamics under different irrigation strategies might be crucial in
    order to reduce water use, maintain yield and/or improve fruit quality. Advantages
    and disadvantages of different sensors ranging from linear variable displacement
    transducers (LVDTs), strain-gauges, potentiometers and/or optoelectric sensors,
    are discussed. However, a unique methodology for continuous plant water status
    determination in fruit trees has yet to be found. An integrated approach, which
    considers contemporary use of sensors on different plant organs is proposed as
    effective strategy to collect exhaustive information on tree water status. DOI:

    classification models, Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector\
    \ Machine (SVM) \nwere developed and validated in different scenarios with overall\
    \ accuracy over 90% for all. SVM model \nhad the highest value, but it required\
    \ the longest training time. All models had accuracy over 85% in all \nscenarios,\
    \ and more stable performance was observed in RF model. Simplified SVM model developed\
    \ \nby the top five most contributing traits had the largest accuracy reduction\
    \ as 29.5%, while simplified RF \nand NN model still maintained approximately\
    \ 80%. For real case application, factors such as operation \ncost, precision\
    \ requirement, and system reaction time should be synthetically considered in\
    \ model \nselection. Our work shows it is promising to discriminate plant root\
    \ zone water status by implementing \nphenotyping and machine learning techniques\
    \ for precision irrigation management.\nOver the past decade, the environmental\
    \ information based methods for precision management have been widely \napplied\
    \ in greenhouse practice. The ambient climate of greenhouse such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, and root zone \nwater content is monitored closely as the reference\
    \ for crop management1. Water and fertilizer are the most \nimportant inputs for\
    \ greenhouse crop because the plant growth is significantly affected by plant\
    \ water and nutri-\ntion status. Root zone water status has a significant influence\
    \ on plant evapotranspiration rate2. Root zone water \nstatus indicates the moisture\
    \ situation of plant root growth environment and highly correlates to plant growing\
    \ \nstatus3. Monitoring of root zone water status could help to establish the\
    \ precision management strategy on irriga-\ntion in crop production. However,\
    \ conventional probe sensors for moisture measurement are limited on detecting\
    \ \nthe actual substrate water status effectively in trays. Several commercialized\
    \ soil moisture sensors such as tensi-\nometer, neutron probes and time domain\
    \ reflectometry probes have been widely used in pot planting but not \napplicable\
    \ for seedlings mainly because the high costs, unsuitable size, and unreliable\
    \ measurements. The volume \nof cell in plug tray is minimal resulting that common\
    \ probe sensors can hardly insert into substrates. In addition, \ndue to the uneven\
    \ water distribution among different plug trays, the growers require continuous\
    \ and real-time \nwater content monitoring for large -scale rather than for single\
    \ point, to prevent the seedlings from water stress \nand growth restriction.\
    \ The relationship between plug tray weight and root zone water content was studied\
    \ to \nprovide a weighting based irrigation control strategy4. However, irrigation\
    \ based on tray weight is labor intensive \nand inaccuracy in practice.\nWith\
    \ the development of sensing technology, real-time monitoring of physiological\
    \ and ecological informa-\ntion of the plant itself provides an approach to indicate\
    \ root zone water status5, 6. Plant physiological traits such \nas tissue water\
    \ status, stomatal conductance, and sap flow are known sensitively responding\
    \ to water stress. The \nstatus of plant water content could be a useful indicator\
    \ for irrigation7. Phenotypic traits such as leaf area, leaf \nangle, and thermal\
    \ temperature show strong correlations with the root zone water status8. However,\

    \ irrigation methods are still at research/developing stage and little used yet\
    \ for practice (except for \nthermal sensing in some situations). Systematical\
    \ research on phenotypic traits selection for irrigation has seldom \nbeen reported.\n\
    Rapid and non-destructive plant sensing method is needed for plant-based information\
    \ acquisition. The \napplication of machine vision technology could be the solution.\
    \ Plant phenotypic traits can be quickly and effi-\nciently obtained by imaging-based\
    \ automatic inspection and analysis5. Therefore, machine vision has the poten-\n\
    tial to realize the rapid, reliable, real-time monitoring of plant status with\
    \ low cost, which meets the requirements \nfor precision irrigation scheduling9.\
    \ Machine vision technology has been applied in plant monitoring such as the \n\
    detection of plant abiotic stress through color variation, plant movement monitoring,\
    \ textural features detection, \ncanopy temperature measurement and detection\
    \ of plant biotic disease8, 10–13. With the development of pheno-\ntyping technology,\
    \ various imaging sensors have been used to collect phenotypic parameters which\
    \ are related \nto plant stress in automated or semi-automated high-throughput\
    \ plant phenotyping platforms14, 15. However, \ndata generated by these platforms\
    \ has enormous volume, variety, velocity, and veracity, which must be efficiently\
    \ \nanalyzed. The classical statistical method is difficult to analyze the high-dimensional\
    \ and dynamical image data, \nresulting limited phenotyping interpretation16.\n\
    Machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence has good performance in efficiently\
    \ dealing with large \namount of data in various domains. It is promising in phenotyping\
    \ applications on features extraction and pat-\nterns identification from large\
    \ dataset through holistic approaches. Machine learning algorithm has few input\
    \ \nfactors with high predict accuracy and strong adaptability. Several machine\
    \ learning algorithms, such as support \nvector machine (SVM), artificial neural\
    \ network (ANN) and random forest (RF), have been used for classification \nmodel\
    \ development17, 18.\nIn practice, machine learning method has been applied to\
    \ remote sensing system and irrigation system19, 20. \nMany studies have reported\
    \ plant stress phenotyping using machine learning in identification, classification,\
    \ \nquantification, and prediction of plant water status, but few focused on phenotyping\
    \ root zone water stress10, 21, 22. \nIt is crucial to detect plant water stress\
    \ at the early stage before any damage observed with visible wilting, which \n\
    affect subsequent plant growth and quality. Correlating root zone water status\
    \ with plant phenotype to supervise \nirrigation system could be a practical way\
    \ in precision irrigation system with easy operation and quick response.\nPakchoi\
    \ (Brassica campestris ssp. L. chinensis) is one of typical vegetables in greenhouse\
    \ production, which is \nsensitive to water status. During the past few years,\
    \ commercial production of leafy vegetable has been initiated \nand developed\
    \ both in the greenhouse (solar plant factory) and artificial light plant factory23.\
    \ Growing baby pak-\nchoi with plug trays using substrate in greenhouse is a promising\
    \ production mode because it is suitable for mech-\nanized harvesting and precision\
    \ management, which improves the production efficiency24. The accurate irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling is critical for safe and high quality of greenhouse vegetable,\
    \ as well as improving the resource utiliza-\ntion and production profits. This\
    \ study aims to discriminate plant root zone water status nondestructively, taking\
    \ \npakchoi as the plant material, which is a part of on-going research on developing\
    \ machine vision-based precision \nirrigation system for factory production of\
    \ pakchoi. The objectives of this study are: (1) investigating the rela-\ntionship\
    \ between root zone water status and plant growth; (2) developing a root zone\
    \ water status discrimination \nmodel by applying phenotyping technology and machine\
    \ learning algorithms; (3) evaluating the performance of \ndeveloped models in\
    \ various application scenarios.\nResults and Discussion\nThe effect of root zone\
    \ water status on plant growth. \nThe effect of root zone water status on pakchoi\
    \ \nplant growth was investigated under three relative water content treatments,\
    \ 40% (low), 60% (medium), and \n80% (high). The fresh and dry weight of shoot\
    \ and root for both cultivars were significantly different between \ntreatments\
    \ as shown in Fig. 1 with ANOVA test (p < 0.01). Treatments had different effects\
    \ between cultivars. For \ncultivar “Huawang”, treatment of medium water content\
    \ had the highest values of fresh and dry weight of shoot \nand root (fresh weight\
    \ as 2727.1 mg and 184.4 mg for shoot and root respectively, and dry weight as\
    \ 185.1 mg and \n15.1 mg per plant for shoot and root respectively), while cultivar\
    \ “Kangre 605” had the lowest values under such \ntreatment (fresh weight as 500.3\
    \ mg and 52.0 mg for shoot and root respectively, and dry weight as 45.3 mg and\
    \ \n5.1 mg per plant for shoot and root respectively). The differences of pakchoi\
    \ growth were significant between two \ncultivars under the treatment of medium\
    \ water content (p < 0.01 for all comparisons), but there were no signifi-\ncant\
    \ differences observed between cultivars under the other two treatments. This\
    \ is mainly because “Kangre 605” \nis a heat-resistant cultivar, which has the\
    \ ability of growing well under water stress conditions. “Huawang” prefers \n\
    moderate water condition, and both the excess and deficiency of water supply could\
    \ affect the accumulation of \nbiomass.\nRelationship between root-zone water\
    \ status and phenotypic traits. \nPhenotypic traits extrac-\ntion. Two types of\
    \ images were acquired, visible and near-infrared (NIR) image (Supplementary Fig. S1).\
    \ There \nwere in total 37 phenotypic traits extracted from images for each plant\
    \ (Table 1). These phenotypic traits were \nclassified into three categories for\
    \ easy description, morphological trait, color trait, and NIR trait, including\
    \ 19, 6, \nand 12 traits respectively. Morphological traits mainly indicated the\
    \ shape feature of target plant region, such as \ncircumference and eccentricity.\
    \ Color traits were generated from color images, including the pixel value informa-\n\
    tion of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) components. NIR traits were the pixel\
    \ intensity information of different \nranges in NIR images.\nWater related phenotypic\
    \ traits selection. \nIn order to increase the efficiency of model development,\
    \ \ntraits selection is necessary to identify redundant traits which are irrelevant\
    \ to root zone water status. The signif-\nicance of 37 extracted phenotypic traits\
    \ on classifying root zone water status were investigated by using ANOVA \n(Fig. 2).\
    \ For better illustration, the p value was transformed into -log10 (p). There\
    \ were five traits with p > 0.05 \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nSCienTifiC\
    \ RePORts | 7: 8303  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-08235-z\n(i.e. -log10 (p) < 1.301)\
    \ including Normsmallpax, Circumference, Roundness, Bdrycount and Bdrytoarearatio\
    \ \n(numbered as 14, 23, 26, 28, and 29 in Table 1 respectively). Therefore, the\
    \ five traits were excluded from the data-\nsets in the following modeling process.\n\
    Root zone water status discrimination model development and validation. \nModeling\
    \ potentiality \nassessment. The Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (PLS-DA) was conducted to present a visual \nspace distribution of three treatment\
    \ groups for assessing the modeling potentiality using the 32 selected phe-\n\
    notypic traits. Figure 3 shows the PLS-DA model performance and cumulative variance\
    \ explained by the top \nfive components. The goodness of fit was quantified by\
    \ R2 while the predictive ability was indicated by Q2. The \naccuracy, R2, and\
    \ Q2 of PLS-DA model by using all the top five components reached 73%, 0.35, and\
    \ 0.34, respec-\ntively. The value of R2 and Q2 should be greater than 0.5 to\
    \ be taken as an indicator of model acceptability. The \ncumulative explained\
    \ variance ranged from 17.6% to 72.2% by the number of components from one to\
    \ five, with \nthe first three components explaining 66.9% variance. The performance\
    \ of PLS-DA model improved (R2 = 0.67, \nQ2 = 0.66) by excluding the medium root\
    \ zone water group as the difference between medium water group and \nthe other\
    \ two groups was not significant. Overall, PLS-DA shows the potential of root\
    \ zone water status discrim-\nination by phenotypic traits.\nDiscrimination model\
    \ development. The total dataset used for model development was 2120 samples with\
    \ 32 \ntraits of each (2120*32), and the dataset was separated into 80% training\
    \ dataset and 20% testing dataset. The \ntraining data set was used for model\
    \ development. Parameter values for the three modeling algorithms, which are \n\
    Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were\
    \ selected by using 10-fold \ncross validation in three repetitions tuning (Table 2).\
    \ Among the training dataset, 10% of the data were used as \nvalidation in each\
    \ cross validation. Table 2 also lists the package, function, and program training\
    \ time of modeling \nalgorithms. All the R codes ran in Rstudio 1.0.44 on the\
    \ platform of windows 10 × 64 system with an Intel Core \ni7-5500U CPU and 4 GB\
    \ RAM.\nConsidering the dynamics of the data input and training in practice, the\
    \ model training time is an important \nfactor to be considered in the optimization\
    \ process. The training time increases exponentially with the number \nof parameters\
    \ and varies substantially between algorithms. Among these three modeling algorithms,\
    \ NN took \nthe shortest training time as 544.37 seconds, which was approximately\
    \ 76% of RF and 44% of SVM. The training \ntime consumption of SVM should be considered\
    \ in real case of decision support system as this method is more \nsensitive to\
    \ the data size than others, especially when time is limited and data set is large.\
    \ The trait contribution \nanalysis in each model could be a way to simplify the\
    \ model inputs and reduce the training time, which was dis-\ncussed in section\
    \ 3.3.\nThe mean prediction accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (k) of all\
    \ the three models were higher than 90% \nand 0.85 respectively, as shown in Fig. 4A,B.\
    \ SVM model had the best performance with higher accuracy and k \nvalue (92.5%\
    \ and 0.89 respectively) than the other two models. The result also showed that\
    \ SVM was slightly more \nstable with less variation than others.\nThe ROC (receiver\
    \ operating characteristic) curve was used to evaluate the performance of modeling\
    \ classi-\nfier. Figure 4C shows the ROC curves of the three models. The x-axis\
    \ represents false positive rate (FPR), and the \ny-axis represents true positive\
    \ rate (TPR). The area under the curve (AUC) indicates classification performance,\
    \ \nwhich is the ability of target model to correctly classify the plants in different\
    \ root zone water status. SVM model \nhad the highest AUC value as 0.6827 among\
    \ the three models, while the differences were not substantial com-\npared to\
    \ 0.6766 and 0.6788 AUC of RF model and NN model respectively.\nFigure 1. Effects\

    \ Confusion matrix was implemented to validate the three developed models \nwith\
    \ 2120*32 dataset. The prediction accuracy of each model from cross validation\
    \ is the sum of the predic-\ntion accuracy on the diagonal in each sub-table of\
    \ Table 3. All the developed models had good prediction accu-\nracy higher than\
    \ 90%. SVM model had the highest prediction accuracy as 92.5%, but no substantial\
    \ difference \nobserved on accuracy among the three models (91.3% and 91.4% for\
    \ RF model and NN model respectively).\nCompared to the other two treatments,\
    \ the medium root zone water group had the highest percentage of false \npositive\
    \ (4.0%, 3.4%, 3.8% for RF, NN, and SVM model) and false negative (3.2%, 2.9%\
    \ and 3.2% RF, NN, and \nSVM model) among the three models. It could be explained\
    \ as that medium level is adjacent to both high and low \nlevel, which is less\
    \ distinguishable comparing to the other two levels.\nModel evaluation under different\
    \ conditions. To investigate the robustness and applicability of the three models\
    \ \nin different conditions, the test dataset was reorganized into different scenarios,\
    \ different time of a day, growth \nstage (stage 1 to stage 5), weather condition\
    \ (sunny and cloudy), and cultivar (“Huawang” and “Kangre 605”). \nThe dataset\
    \ used for each growth was 120*32, the dataset used for each time in day was 240\
    \ to 270 records with \n32 traits, and the dataset used for each cultivar was\
    \ 1060*32. All the datasets were separated into 80% training \ndataset and 20%\
    \ testing dataset. Figure 5 shows classification accuracy of three models in all\
    \ scenarios were over \n85%. Among the seven time points of a day, the accuracy\

    \ model training time without significant accuracy reduction, sensitivity analysis\
    \ was conducted to assess the \ncontribution of each trait in developed models.\
    \ The simplified model with less explanatory variables were devel-\noped according\
    \ to the traits importance evaluation of the model implementation in the root\
    \ zone water status \ndetection. Table 4 lists the top five of most contributing\
    \ traits in each model. The explanation of each trait could \nbe referred to Table 1.\
    \ Different model had different preference on the trait type. In the top five\
    \ traits, there was no \nmorphological trait in RF model, no NIR trait in NN model,\
    \ and no color trait in SVM model.\nFigure 5. Classification accuracy of developed\

    \ trait and NIR trait appeared more frequently than morphological trait, which\
    \ shows plant \ncolor and NIR characteristics would be more related to root zone\
    \ water status. This result agrees with several \nstudies in spectroscopy and\
    \ remote sensing research on the relationship between spectral reflectivity and\
    \ water \nrelated index13. The most frequently appearing traits in top five traits\
    \ of developed models were Mean.Color.\nGreen and Mean.Color.Red. There was only\
    \ one morphological trait in NN model and in SVM model, named as \nVrectsizeymm\
    \ and Compactness, respectively. This is likely because plant morphological appearance\
    \ is basically \ndetermined by genotype and substantially influenced by environment\
    \ such as airflow and illumination.\nModel classification ability dropped when\
    \ only the top five traits were used to develop model, named as sim-\nplified\
    \ model. The accuracy of simplified RF model and NN model could still reach 79.7%\
    \ and 77.4% respectively, \nwhile the accuracy of simplified SVM model decreased\
    \ substantially from 92.5% to 63.0% with 29.5% reduction. \nFor SVM model, the\
    \ cumulative contribution of the top five traits was 22.8%, lower than that of\
    \ RF model and \nNN model (32.6% and 29.9%, respectively), which could be the\
    \ main reason for the great decrease on the simpli-\nfied model accuracy. In addition,\
    \ simplified SVM model did not include color trait, while simplified NN model\
    \ \ndid not include NIR trait (Table 4), which showed color related traits would\
    \ better reflect plant root zone water \nstatus than the other two trait types\
    \ in RF and NN models while the SVM model relied more on NIR traits than \nthe\
    \ others.\nConclusion\nThis study developed a root zone water status discrimination\
    \ method during plant growth by integrating phe-\nnotyping and machine learning\
    \ techniques. Pakchoi plants were used. Three types of phenotyping traits such\
    \ \nas morphological trait, color trait, and near-infrared trait were acquired\
    \ as the inputs for classification models. \nThree machine learning models were\
    \ developed, Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector \nMachine\
    \ (SVM), with accuracy above 90% for all. The SVM model had the highest accuracy\
    \ as 92.5% in model \ndevelopment but it took the longest training time as 1245.94\
    \ seconds in this study. In addition, the SVM model \nhad the largest accuracy\
    \ reduction (22.8%) in simplified model developed by the top five most contributing\
    \ trait \nresulting from trait contribution evaluation.\nThe three developed models\
    \ were evaluated by test dataset (20% of entire data pool) consisting of data\
    \ from \ndifferent scenarios, which were different time a day, growth stage, weather\
    \ condition, and pakchoi cultivar. All the \nthree models reached the overall\
    \ accuracy higher than 90%. SVM model had the highest value as 92.5%, but no \n\
    substantial differences were observed among the three. By evaluated in different\
    \ scenarios, the three models had \naccuracy over 85% in all scenarios with some\
    \ fluctuations. The accuracy at the time point of 06:00 h was the lowest \nfor\
    \ all the three models, and the trend of increasing was observed during the growth\
    \ of plant. Better performances \nwere observed in cloudy weather condition than\
    \ in sunny weather condition of the three models. NN model had \nthe largest difference\
    \ on accuracy between cultivars. Overall, SVM model had the highest classification\
    \ accuracy, \nbut more stable performance was observed in RF model considering\
    \ all the scenarios.\nThis study demonstrates the potential of machine learning\
    \ approach on discriminating root zone water status \nbased on complex plant phenotyping\
    \ traits. The developed discrimination method could promote the plant-based \n\
    irrigation decision making and implementation in practice. Developed models could\
    \ be further used in precision \nirrigation system with appropriate modifications\
    \ if environment or crop change. Further study is suggested to \ninvestigate the\
    \ repaid response of plant phenotypic traits to the change of root zone water\
    \ status and the perfor-\nmance of classification models on such response. Therefore\
    \ accumulative effect of water stress on plant growth \nduring the growing period\
    \ should be minimized with the real-time discrimination to control the potential\
    \ yield \nloss. Population phenotyping and water status discrimination are also\
    \ worth further study due to plant canopy \nmutual occlusion and growth competition.\
    \ In addition, phenotyping traits were extracted from images acquired \nin a constant\
    \ light environment. Changes in intensity, quality, and beam angle of illumination\
    \ would have effects \nModel\nTrait name\nContribution \n(%)\nCumulative \ncontribution\

    \ capable of serving as a basis and supporting for intelligent greenhouse management,\
    \ especially \nfor irrigation management.\nMaterials and Methods\nPlant materials\
    \ and growth conditions. \nThe experiment was conducted in a commercial greenhouse\
    \ \nfrom May 1th to 29th in year of 2015, located at northeast of Shanghai, China\
    \ (31°10′ N, 121°36′ E). Two cultivars \nof pakchoi were used, “Huawang” and “Kangre\
    \ 605”, under pot substrate cultivation. Commercial substrate (veg-\netable seedling\
    \ substrate, Zhongnuo Agriculture Technology Co., Ltd, Huaian, China) composed\
    \ of peat moss, \nperlite, and organic matter was used. Plug tray was used at\
    \ seedling stage. On the tenth day after sowing, seedlings \nwere transplanted\
    \ to pots (volume of 1.13 L) with one seedling per pot.\nThe greenhouse air temperature,\
    \ humidity, photosynthetic photon flux, substrate temperature and electrical \n\
    conductivity were monitored every 5 minutes by using an automatic data logging\
    \ system (PM-11 Phytomonitor, \nBio Instruments S.R.L., Chisinau, Moldova) with\
    \ RTH-11 Meter and SMTE sensor. During the whole experimen-\ntal period, the average\
    \ air temperature was 24.3 °C with the highest as 36 °C and lowest as 13.7 °C.\
    \ The relative \nhumidity ranged from 16.4% to 88% with an average of 58%. Mean\
    \ daily accumulative solar radiation in the \ngreenhouse was 2.62 MJ/(m2·d), with\
    \ a maximum of 5.41 MJ/(m2·d) at May 21st.\nTreatments of root zone moisture level\
    \ were applied to each pot after transplanting. Root zone moisture was \nindicated\
    \ by the relative water content, the percent of volumetric water content comparing\
    \ to field water capacity. \nBecause of the dynamic change of root zone moisture\
    \ status, upper limit was applied to define the moisture level \nof root zone.\
    \ In other word, irrigation stopped when root zone moisture reached the upper\
    \ limit. Considering the \nfeasibility of moisture level control and plant growth,\
    \ three root zone moisture levels were applied, 40%, 60%, and \n80% (referred\
    \ to as ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, and ‘High’ hereafter, respectively). In total, five plants\
    \ of each cultivar were \nrandomly assigned to each treatment. Irrigation was\
    \ conducted manually for all plants once a day according to \nthe pot weight.\n\
    Image acquisition and processing. \nA commercial phenotyping system (Scanalyzer3D,\
    \ LemnaTec GmbH, \nWürselen, Germany) was used for image acquisition (Supplementary\
    \ Fig. S2). Images of each plant were taken \ndaily from top view before irrigation\
    \ from May 11th to 29th, 2015. Two types of image were acquired simultane-\nously,\
    \ near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) images. The 20-day growing period was\
    \ divided into five stages with \nfour days of each, referred to as stage 1, 2,\
    \ 3, 4, and 5. Plant growing level especially the number of leaves was dif-\n\
    ferent at different stage (Fig. 6). The reference growth stage was divided mainly\
    \ according to the new leaf emerge \ntime under different treatments and adjusted\
    \ to even distribution for model comparison.\nTwo image acquisition schedules\
    \ were applied with one from 06:00 h to 18:00 h at two hour intervals and the\
    \ \nother one only at 14:00 h. Weather condition was classified into two scenarios,\
    \ sunny and cloudy (referred to as ‘S’ \nand ‘C’ hereafter, respectively) according\
    \ to weather forecast. Efforts were made to have the two image acquisition \n\
    schedules for each weather scenario in each stage (Table 5). At the end of 20-day\
    \ growing period, the fresh and \ndry weight of each plant sample were measured.\
    \ Each sample was dried at 105 °C for 1 hour and then at 60 °C to \nconstant weight.\
    \ The dried sample was weighted to an accuracy of ± 0.1 mg.\nImages acquired by\
    \ the imaging system were organized into LemnaBase which is the central database\
    \ interface \nfor the phenotyping system, and processed through an analysis pipeline\
    \ specifically adjusted for pakchoi by using \nLemnaGrid which is an image analysis\
    \ component of the phenotyping system. Image processing procedure in \nLemnaGrid\
    \ consisted of four main steps shown as the flowchart in Supplementary Fig. S3:\
    \ (1) image preprocess-\ning, extracting target images from LemnaBase; (2) segmentation,\
    \ separating target plant from the background \nin the image; (3) feature extraction,\
    \ analyzing segmentation result and producing phenotypic traits; and (4) \npost-processing,\
    \ summarizing feature extraction results of all target images and exporting as\
    \ “.xls” file.\nRoot zone water status discrimination model development. \nThe\
    \ development of root zone water \nstatus discrimination was consisted of three\
    \ steps: (1) data preprocessing, organizing data for phenotypic analysis \nand\
    \ model development; (2) phenotypic traits screening, removing those phenotypic\
    \ traits with insignificant \nFigure 6. Pakchoi seedling appearance at five growing\

    \ between treatments of root zone moisture level; (3) model development, using\
    \ different modeling algo-\nrithms to classify root zone water status. MetaboAnalyst\
    \ statistical analysis module (http://www.metaboanalyst.\nca) was implemented\
    \ for data preprocessing and phenotypic traits screening, and R language (windows,\
    \ R3.2.5, R \ncore Team, 2016) was implemented for model development.\nData preprocessing.\
    \ \nIn MetaboAnalyst statistical analysis module, data of extracted phenotypic\
    \ traits from \neach image were organized into one datasheet by sample ID (row)\
    \ and phenotypic traits (column). Empty rows \nwere detected and excluded after\
    \ data uploaded. Columns with more than 50% empty records were removed. In \n\
    the case of columns with data missing but less than 50%, the NAs (not available\
    \ values) were replaced by with \na small value (half of the minimum positive\
    \ values in the original data). All the traits value were normalized by \nusing\
    \ auto scaling method (mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of\
    \ each variable).\nPhenotypic traits screening. \nAmong those phenotypic traits\
    \ extracted by imaging processing, traits which \nare insignificantly relevant\
    \ to treatments may influence the modeling accuracy. In this study, one-way Analysis\
    \ \nof Variance (ANOVA) was applied to screen traits resulting an optimal set\
    \ of explanatory variables for discrim-\nination model development. Traits with\
    \ P > 0.05 (Fisher’s LSD method) were excluded from the traits set. In \naddition,\
    \ the result of ANOVA presented a preliminary overview of the significance of\
    \ each trait to treatments.\nIn order to assess the potentiality of using phenotypic\
    \ traits to develop discrimination model, Partial Least \nSquares Discriminant\
    \ Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied, which is a supervised algorithm that uses multivariate\
    \ \nregression techniques to predict class membership via linear combination of\
    \ original variables. The PLS-DA was \nperformed by using plsr function in pls\
    \ package of R language, and the classification and cross-validation were \nperformed\
    \ by using the corresponding wrapper function in caret package of R language.\
    \ The resulted PLS-DA \nthree-dimensional component score plot, which shows the\
    \ overall data distribution of different treatments, pre-\nsents the preliminary\
    \ classification indicating modeling potentiality.\nDiscrimination model development.\
    \ \nBased on the purpose of multi-classification in this study, three \nclassification\
    \ modeling algorithms, Random Forests (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector\
    \ Machine \n(SVM) were selected to develop discrimination model and performed\
    \ with the randomForest, nnet, e1071 pack-\nages in R language, respectively.\n\
    RF was used as a supervised learning algorithm suitable for the case of high dimensional\
    \ data analysis. The RF \ncan handle multiple input variables from large databases\
    \ without variable selection and give estimates of impor-\ntant variables in the\
    \ classification25. RF modeling was performed by using the randomForest package.\
    \ Ntree (the \nnumber of trees) and mtry (the number of features) used to find\
    \ the best feature were required in RF. In this study \nthe RF model was trained\
    \ with ntree as 500 and mtry from 2, 5, and 8.\nNeural network have been successful\
    \ as predictive tools in variety domains such as uncovering \ngenotype-phenotype\
    \ interactions26. Researchers reported that properly trained deep neural networks\

    \ model, and disentangle latent factors for phenotyping27. For NN model in this\
    \ study, nnet package was \nused to train the single-hidden-layer feed-forward\
    \ neural network. There are two main parameters, decay and \nsize, which can be\
    \ tuned for NN model in R. In this study, the decay were tuned from 0, 0.1, and\
    \ 0.001, and the \nsize were tuned from 2, 5, and 9.\nThe goal of a SVM is to\
    \ create a boundary, called hyperplane, which leads to homogeneous partitions\
    \ of data \non either side. In this study, multiclass SVM model were trained with\
    \ kernel parameter C (from 10, 100, and \n1000) and regularization parameter gamma\
    \ (from 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0). The best combination of C and gamma \nleading\
    \ to the highest prediction accuracy was chosen. For SVM, svm function in e1071\
    \ package was used to \nspecify the kernel function, cost, and the gamma function.\n\
    The 80% of total samples were selected as the training dastaset via stratified\
    \ random sampling method for \nmodel development and optimization and the rest\
    \ 20% as the test dataset. In order to prevent the over fitting \nproblems, all\
    \ three models were trained with the 10-fold cross validation in three repetitions\
    \ by using the caret \npackage in R language. This method randomly splits the\
    \ dataset in 10 subsets, among which 9 instances of the \ndata were used to train\
    \ the model and the other instance was used to validate the training model. By\
    \ performing \nthree repeats of the 10-fold validation, the average accuracy (percentage\
    \ of correctly classified samples out of all \nsamples) was used to assess the\
    \ performance of the model. However, only accuracy is not enough to evaluate the\
    \ \nmodel performance especially for imbalance data or multi class data. Therefore,\
    \ Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (k) and \nROC (Receiver operating characteristic)\
    \ curve were also used to evaluate the model performance. The k is a good \nmeasure\
    \ that can handle multi-class well and calculated as:\n=\n−\n−\np\np\np\nk\n1\n\
    o\ne\ne\nwhere, po is the observed agreement, and pe is the expected agreement.\
    \ The ROC curves of different models were \ncompared according to the area under\
    \ the curve (AUC) by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive\
    \ \nrate. AUC represents the probability that the classifier will assign a higher\
    \ score to a randomly chosen positive \nexample than to negative example28.\n\

    Stem water potential. Abstract. A mobile sensor suite was developed and evaluated
    to predict plant water status by measuring the leaf temperature and microclimatic
    variables in nut crop trees and grapevines. The sensor suite consists of an infrared
    thermometer to measure leaf temperature along with other relevant sensors to measure
    microclimatic variables. The sensor suite was successfully evaluated in commercial
    orchards in the Sacramento Valley of California on three orchard crops, i.e.,
    almond (Prunus dulcis), walnut (Juglans regia), and grape (Vitis vinifera), for
    both sunlit and shaded leaves. Stepwise linear regression models developed for
    shaded leaf temperature yielded coefficient of multiple determination values of
    0.90, 0.86, and 0.86 for almond, walnut, and grape crops, respectively. Stem water
    potential (SWP) was found to be a significant variable in all models. The regression
    models were used to classify trees into water stressed and unstressed categories.
    Critical misclassification errors (classifying a water stressed tree as unstressed)
    for sunlit and shaded leaf models were 8.8% and 5.2% for almond, 5.4% and 6.9%
    for walnut, and 12.9% and 8.1% for grapevine, respectively. Canonical discriminant
    analyses were also conducted using the sensor suite data to classify trees into
    water stressed and unstressed trees with critical misclassification errors for
    sunlit and shaded leaves of 9.3% and 7.8% for almond, 2.0% and 4.1% for walnut,
    and 9.6% and 1.6% for grapevine, respectively. These results show the feasibility
    of the sensor suite to determine plant water status for irrigation management
    of nut and vineyard crops. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 19 Share Facebook

    Index DOI:   10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1038.28 Abstract: This paper outlines the
    ways in which thermal and spectral remote sensing can be used to monitor the development
    of water deficits in horticultural crops and to schedule irrigation. The first
    part outlines the basic principles involved in the use of remote sensing for monitoring
    plant responses to water deficits. Thermal sensing is shown to be particularly
    sensitive to stomatal closure, while spectral sensing can be used to study both
    the development of leaf area (using standard vegetation indices) and the responses
    of processes such as photosynthesis (using chlorophyll fluorescence and the photochemical
    reflectance index). Such remote sensing methods may be applied both within-field
    and from airborne or even satellite-mounted sensors. The specific opportunities
    and problems of applying this technology to a range of horticultural crops will
    then be addressed and recommendations made, particularly relating to its application
    to irrigation scheduling. The problems involved with scaling up remote sensing
    from the leaf scale to the canopy scale are discussed with particular emphasis
    on the large potential errors involved when inverting a remotely sensed index
    (whether CWSI or any other vegetation index) to estimate a biophysical par¬ameter
    such as leaf area index, stomatal conductance or photosynthesis rate. Article

    Keywords:   Almonds, Artificial neural network, Leaf monitor, Machine learning,
    Plant water status, Precision irrigation, Stem water potential. Abstract. Stem
    water potential (SWP) is a commonly used method for determining plant water status
    (PWS) but requires a significant amount of time and is tedious to measure. To
    eliminate the necessity for this fieldwork, artificial neural networks (ANNs)
    were designed to predict PWS using information that is easier to measure, such
    as leaf temperature and microclimatic variables including ambient air temperature,
    relative humidity, incident radiation, and soil water content. To collect these
    variables, leaf and soil water sensors were placed in a 1.6 ha almond orchard.
    The sensors were interconnected through a wireless mesh network, which allowed
    remote data access. SWP values were taken in the field at midday three times a
    week during the growing season. The ANNs were trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt
    algorithm with the data divided into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test
    data. Each network contained one hidden layer with one to three hidden neurons.
    For each unique combination of inputs, the network was retrained five times, and
    the best network was selected based on the lowest mean squared error for the test
    data. When compared with multiple linear regression models fitting the same data,
    the networks consistently resulted in better R2 values, and higher values may
    be achieved with further optimization. These results suggest that there is potential
    for machine learning techniques that use ANNs to model the relationship between
    environmental conditions and PWS, which may be used for predicting acceptable
    temperature differences from target SWP. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes)

    potential, SWP. Abstract. Measurement of plant water status (PWS) provides the
    key information necessary for efficient irrigation management schemes. A continuous
    leaf monitoring system based on leaf temperature and relevant microclimatic variables
    that can provide real-time PWS is currently available. Crop water stress index
    (CWSI) or modified crop water stress index (MCWSI) values are usually computed
    with leaf monitor data, which requires a knowledge of well-watered and fully stressed
    conditions. We proposed a methodology to compute CWSI and MCWSI using the leaf
    monitor data, where the well-watered and dry conditions were measured using a
    well-watered vine and simulated dry leaf. The objectives of this research were
    to implement a PWS based site-specific irrigation management scheme in a vineyard
    and to assess PWS of grapes by comparing MCWSI and CWSI with stem water potential
    (SWP). Samples were obtained prior to harvest to determine grape quality and yield
    information. The stressed based treatments received 69% of the amount of water
    compared to the grower treatment. Yield results show no significant differences
    between stressed and grower treatments, while quality results showed a significant
    difference in malic acid content (all other quality attributes were similar),
    suggesting this method of precision irrigation may be a useful tool for irrigation
    scheduling and controlling PWS in grapes, while conserving water and enhancing
    quality of the product. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) Share Facebook

    Wireless mesh network. Abstract. There is increased demand for irrigation scheduling
    tools that support effective use of the limited supply of irrigation water. An
    efficient precision irrigation system requires water to be delivered based on
    crop needs by measuring or estimating plant water stress. Leaf temperature is
    a good indicator of water stress. In this study, a system was developed to monitor
    leaf temperature and microclimatic environmental variables to predict plant water
    stress. This system, called the leaf monitor, monitored plant water status by
    continuously measuring leaf temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, ambient
    light, and wind conditions in the vicinity of a shaded leaf. The system also included
    a leaf holder, a solar radiation diffuser dome, and a wind barrier for improved
    performance of the unit. Controlled wind speed and consistent light conditions
    were created around the leaf to reduce the effect of nuisance variables on leaf
    temperature. The leaf monitor was incorporated into a mesh network of wireless
    nodes for sensor data collection and remote valve control. The system was evaluated
    for remote data collection in commercial orchards. Experiments were conducted
    during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons in walnut () and almond () orchards.
    The system was found to be reliable and capable of providing real-time visualization
    of the data remotely, with minimal technical problems. Leaf monitor data were
    used to develop modified crop water stress index (MCWSI) values for quantifying
    plant water stress levels. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 6 Share Facebook

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Core Ideas Maximum yields were obtained with wireless
    real-time tensiometers initiating irrigation at –45 kPa. A significant 16% reduction
    in water use relative to the grower control was achieved by initiating irrigation
    at –45 kPa with no yield reduction. Almond crop is sensitive to water management,
    as being too wet (initiation at -35 kPa) or too dry (initiation at –55 kPa) reduced
    yield by about 11.0 and 11.3%, respectively. ABSTRACT In North America, almond
    [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb] trees are grown almost exclusively in the Central
    Valley of California. Research on deficit irrigation is needed to improve water
    productivity. Real-time technology assessing soil water potential to manage irrigation
    initiation has led to significant improvements in water productivity in other
    crops. The objective of this study was to examine the possibility of using real-time
    tensiometry for irrigation to trigger irrigation events and to generate water
    savings without affecting crop yield. The yield responses and water consumption
    of mature almond trees were quantified from 2012 to 2015 for four different irrigation
    strategies in a commercial orchard located in the San Joaquin Valley in California.
    Three of the treatments were based on soil water potential threshold (SWPT) measurements
    and the fourth on the grower’s current management practices, which used estimated
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The SWPT treatments were based on three different
    stress levels: wet (–35 kPa), medium (−45 kPa), and dry (−55 kPa). There was no
    significant difference in marketable yield between the grower irrigation strategy
    and the medium treatment, although the latter used 139 mm less water as a yearly
    average. In the dry treatment, there was 10% less water applied relative to the
    medium treatments and 30% less than the grower treatment but a 10% yield reduction
    compared with the medium and grower treatments. These results indicate that irrigation
    management for almond could be optimized by initiating irrigation at –45 kPa.

    obtained with tensiometers VPDleaf leaf vapor pressure deficit Almonds are produced
    on more than 345,000 ha in California, mainly in the Central Valley (USDA-NASS,
    2015). This area is responsible for almost all almond production in the United
    States and 80% of the world’s production (Almond Board of California, 2016). Directly
    or indirectly, the industry provides about 104,000 jobs and yields an annual economic
    output of about $21.5 billion (Sumner et al., 2014). Although almonds are considered
    to be drought-resistant (Torrecillas et al., 1996), approximately 600 to 1500
    mm of water is required annually to generate acceptable yields (Micke and Kester,
    1998). In California, agriculture uses nearly 80% of the dedicated freshwater
    (Canessa et al., 2012). Excessive pumping leads to lower groundwater levels, saline
    water intrusion, and dry wells (Croyle et al., 2014) and producers are under increasing
    social and environmental regulatory pressure to reduce water use for irrigation.
    The water requirements of almond trees cannot be met by current levels of precipitation
    (75–305 mm, depending on the area), a situation worsened by drought years, like
    those which prevailed in the 2004–2014 period (California Department of Water
    Resources, 2014). With 70% of producers now using microirrigation, water use has
    decreased by almost 33% over the same period (Almond Board of California, 2015)
    but despite this improvement, additional gains in water productivity are needed
    to decrease the water use associated with this major crop. There are three main
    types of irrigation scheduling in use, based on climatic (Type 1), plant (Type
    2), or soil water (Type 3) measurements. The climatic system, Type 1, is the most
    commonly used but requires an accurate estimate of local ETc, which depends on
    the canopy, the irrigation method, the climate, and crop development (Allen et
    al., 1998). Although it provides a good approximation of the quantity of water
    required, it does not, however, determine when it is required, as no soil or plant
    measurements are involved. With respect to Type 2 irrigation scheduling, researchers
    have developed several methods based on tree water status measurements to determine
    when irrigation should be activated (Fereres and Goldhamer, 2003; Fulton et al.,
    2001; Goldhamer et al., 2006; Shackel et al., 1997). Midday stem water potential
    (MSWP) has thus become the current standard irrigation management tool (Fereres
    and Goldhamer, 2003; Fulton et al., 2014; Shackel, 2007; Shackel et al., 1997).
    The continuous monitoring required by this technique is time-consuming (Fulton
    et al., 2001) and requires well-trained technicians (Williams and Araujo, 2002).
    Moreover, it is ill-suited to automated irrigation (Jones, 2004). Thermal sensing
    represents a promising alternative to detect plant stress, especially with the
    rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle technology (Maes and Steppe, 2012).
    Dhillon et al. (2014) have also developed a set of mobile sensors that measure
    leaf temperature and climatic variables to predict water stress. These techniques
    will need to be improved before they can be fully automated (Dhillon et al., 2014;
    Maes and Steppe, 2012). The Type 3 approach to irrigation scheduling uses soil
    water measurements. However, many researchers (Fereres, 1996; Naor, 2006) have
    identified difficulties with regard to these measurements, such as variability
    arising from soil heterogeneity, equipment cost limitations, and calibration requirements.
    Nonetheless, soil water measurements can be collected at multiple locations in
    real time, fully automated, and easily integrated into an irrigation system to
    provide well-timed irrigation (Hodnett et al., 1990; Moutonnet et al., 1981).
    Tensiometers are used to measure soil water potential and have proven to be very
    useful in timing irrigations (Richards and Marsh, 1961; Shock and Wang, 2011).
    Recent technologies based on real-time soil matric potential measurements have
    been successfully implemented in cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) (Pelletier
    et al., 2013) and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) (Létourneau et al.,
    2015; Anderson, 2015; Gendron et al., 2017) production to reduce water use and
    increase productivity. This technology also has been shown to successfully increase
    celery (Apium graveolens L.) and onion (Allium cepa L.) yields, and spinach (Spinacia
    oleracea L.) germination (Rekika et al., 2014) and prevents tip burn in romaine
    lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in muck soils (Périard et al., 2015), but has
    never been tested for almond. A problem that has been reported when irrigation
    is reduced for strawberry (Anderson, 2015, Gendron et al., 2017) and lettuce (Périard
    et al., 2015) production is that a small delay in initiating irrigation can be
    detrimental to crop growth. These studies used real-time tensiometry to manage
    irrigation and its potential to anticipate coming stress as well as manage deficit
    irrigation to limit any negative effect on crop productivity. However, this approach
    also has never been tested for almond production and may not necessarily be applicable,
    as almond is a tree crop and thus yields respond not only to yearly irrigation
    but, to a large extent, to fruit bearing-spur numbers formed in the previous years
    (Lampinen et al., 2011). The crop is therefore expected to respond to both short-term
    and long-term water management. Therefore, additional research is needed in almond
    to test irrigation scheduling based on real-time soil water potential measurements.
    The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of real-time soil water
    matric potential irrigation thresholds on almond yield and water consumption and
    its potential to manage deficit irrigation in a long-term trial. MATERIAL AND
    METHODS Experimental Site The experiment was conducted from 2012 to 2015 in a
    mature almond tree orchard located in Shafter, CA (35.346° N, 119.2067° W), just
    outside Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley. The site is characterized by a
    Milham sandy loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids)
    (O’Green et al., 2016). The experiment ran from 3 Apr. to 19 Aug. 2012, from 2
    Apr to 15 Aug. 2013, from 1 Apr. to 8 Aug. 2014, and from 18 May to 8 Aug. 2015.
    The almond (cv. Nonpareil) trees were planted on alternate rows (see further details
    below). The experimental plot was located on a 1.2-ha section of a 30.4-ha field,
    with 5.5-m (within-row) by 7.3-m (inter-row) tree spacing. Trees were irrigated
    with a 12-jet microsprinkler irrigation system placed midway between trees at
    58 L h–1 at 0.17 to 0.24 MPa, with a 2-m wetted radius (Gironet, Netafim, CA).
    The soil surface was kept weed-free with herbicides during the experiment according
    to the grower’s management practices following the state appropriate recommendation
    (Weed Research and Information Center; http://wric.ucdavis.edu, accessed 28 Jan.
    2019). Experimental Design The trial comprised 16 rows of 22 trees each (Nonpareil
    variety) separated by guard rows of other varieties (‘Sonora’ and ‘Fritz’). Rows
    were divided into four blocks of four treatments: wet, medium, dry, and grower
    irrigation. Two sample trees per replicate were randomly selected to monitor tree
    water stress (Fig. 1). The experimental layout was arranged as a completely randomized
    block design, with each of the four irrigation treatments described above randomly
    allocated to one single row of the Nonpareil variety within each of the four blocks.
    All four blocks (rows) of a same treatment were irrigated at the same time, independently
    of the other treatments (see below), following the procedure described below.

    randomized complete block design in four blocks (rows). The number following the
    treatment represents the block number. MSWP, midday stem water potential; VPDleaf,
    leaf vapor pressure deficit. Climatic, Soil and Tree Water Data In Block 2, three
    tensiometers, connected to a TX3 wireless station (Hortau Inc., Saint-Nicolas,
    QC, Canada), were installed in each of the four treatments at three different
    depths: 25, 50, and 75 cm. Soil water potential data (SWT) were collected continuously
    at 15-min intervals and sent to a web server (Irrolis, https://irrolis.hortau.net,
    accessed 17 Jan. 2019). These depths were chosen after observations made on site
    when the cores were sampled. Roots were not present below 75 cm and root growth
    was sampled idicated that roots were concentrated in the 0- to 50-cm depth at
    the beginning of the experiments. Likewise, an oxidized layer was observed at
    about 75 cm, indicating that little water movement occurred below this depth.
    Several studies have shown that active water uptake by roots occurs mainly in
    the upper soil layer (0–30 cm) and decreases significantly below that depth and
    that the total root zone is limited to the 90- to 100-cm soil depth (Andreu et
    al., 1997; Koumanov et al., 1997, 2006; Vrugt et al., 2001). Tensiometers were
    installed at a distance of 1 m from the microsprinkler, within the 2-m wetted
    radius, at a 45° horizontal angle to the tree row. Because of cost limitations,
    only one station per treatment was used and installed within Block 2, located
    centrally on the site (Fig. 1). Additional hand-held tensiometers were installed
    and used to make sure that the wireless tensiometers’ readings were representative
    of the overall treatment effect. Irrigation was controlled to maintain the soil
    water potential above the target threshold (SWPT) in each treatment: –35 kPa (wet),
    −45 kPa (medium), and −55 kPa (dry). The SWPT values were determined by averaging
    the readings of the tensiometers (the SWT data) at the 25- and 50-cm depths. These
    thresholds were selected according to the model of Rekika et al. (2014), which
    uses site estimates of the expected ETc, the rooting depth, and the soil hydraulic
    properties described below to estimate the critical SWPT when the soil water supply
    could not meet ETc under steady-state conditions. Preliminary evaluations suggested
    that the driest thresholds (−55 and −45 kPa) were low enough to generate some
    stress to the crop relative to the wettest one (–35 kPa). When the threshold was
    attained, irrigation was activated for all rows of the same treatment by a control
    unit (CTR, Hortau Inc.), which remotely triggered solenoid valves (Irritrol, Riverside,
    CA; Rainbird, Azusa, CA) and an electric pump. Irrigation was stopped when the
    wetting front reached the tensiometer at the 75-cm depth (when the SWT at 75 cm
    began to increase). The grower treatment (grower) was controlled by the producer
    on the basis of ETc estimates and amounted to 758, 754, 685, and 450 mm yearly
    from 2012 to 2015. The producer aimed to replace 100% of ETc losses over 2- or
    3-wk cycles. Climatic data were measured by an automated weather station (Hortau
    Inc.) installed on site. Reference evapotranspiration was calculated via the Penman–Monteith
    equation (Allen et al., 1998) for a fully irrigated grass cover. For comparison
    purposes, the crop coefficient (Kc) values of Allen et al. (1998), Goldhamer and
    Viveros (2000), Steduto et al. (2012), and Sanden (2009) were used to estimate
    ETc. Water use differed from year to year as the duration of the trial varied
    from year to year. For that reason, the percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc), calculated as the sum of irrigation water use
    and rainfall divided by ETc, was used to compare water use among years and between
    the two treatments. Midday stem water potential was measured weekly (12:00 PM
    to 16:00 PM) (Fulton et al., 2014) on the same two trees in each plot with a pump-up
    chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, OR) and a pressure chamber (Soil Moisture
    Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). Stem water potential bags (PMS Instrument
    Company) were installed on shaded leaves on a lower branch near the trunk at least
    10 min before measurements were taken (Fulton et al., 2001). Measurements were
    taken immediately after leaf excision. Before installing the stem water potential
    bags, leaf temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer (IR 1000, Klein
    Tools, IL). Shaded leaves are better suited for determining plant water status
    and measuring leaf temperature (Dhillon et al., 2014). Leaf temperature and relative
    humidity, as measured by the weather station, were used to estimate the leaf vapor
    pressure deficit (VPDleaf). Plant measurements were taken from the beginning of
    May until harvest in mid-August and were averaged per single tree per year for
    statistical analysis. In 2012, soils were excavated to describe and characterize
    soil properties by horizon and to evaluate root growth. Profiles were made midway
    between trees on the same row. Thirteen undisturbed soil cores (8.2 cm diameter
    by 5.5 cm height) were collected at depths of 25 (×7) and 50 cm (×6) to determine
    bulk density, which averaged 1.67 g cm–3 at the 25-cm depth and 1.65 g cm–3 at
    the 15-cm depth. Data on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention
    curves have been reported elsewhere (Collin, 2017). Root distribution was observed
    in open profiles and noted. Textural classes were determined from particle size
    analysis of disturbed samples taken in 2011 (Gee and Bauder, 1986). At the beginning
    and end of each season, new profiles were characterized, root distribution was
    recorded, and disturbed soil samples were analyzed in all plots to monitor electrical
    conductivity and pH at the 25- and 50-cm depths via the soil saturated extract
    method (Brown, 1988) to check salinity buildup under different irrigation management
    systems. Yield Measurements At harvest, two trees per replicate were mechanically
    shaken by commercial equipment. Immediately afterwards, almonds were collected
    in an average area of 5.5 by 7.3 m and weighed. Subsamples (∼300 almonds) were
    cracked, sorted, and dried at 80°C until equilibrium weight was attained to determine
    marketable yield. Additional yield values were obtained from producer data for
    2011 to 2014 for neighboring plots in which the same wireless tensiometer technology
    was used. The in-season (May to mid-August) average SWPT at 25 to 50 cm was related
    to these average yields to obtain more response values. Water Use During the monitoring
    period, rotary flowmeters were installed to measure the quantity of water applied,
    with an accuracy of ±1.5% (IP80-Series, Seametrics, WA) and ±3% (TM Series, GPI,
    KS). Flowmeters measured all water applied to the crop: water used for irrigation
    treatments and water used for fertilizer applications. Fertilizer applications
    were performed weekly in four shots in April, before the irrigation treatments
    started. Flowmeters were installed for treatments at the beginning of irrigation
    lines (IP80-Series flowmeters) and at the end of the first block of all irrigation
    treatment (TM Series flowmeters). Water use was recorded continuously by flowmeters
    and transmitted by a wireless station at 15-min intervals (Hortau Inc.) in the
    SWPT treatments and weekly for fertilization application and the grower irrigation.
    The SWPT treatments were connected to the grower irrigation system through manual
    valves to ensure that all treatments received the same fertilization. The valves
    were opened before and closed after the fertilizer applications by a technician.
    Irrigation was taken over by the producer 2 wk before harvest to allow the same
    preharvest management in all treatments. Statistical Analysis ANOVA was carried
    out with SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) via the GLM procedure. Least
    significant differences were calculated to compare treatment means. Statistical
    comparisons were considered significant at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis and
    relationships were based on the mean values of seasonal MSWP, VPDleaf, SWPT, and
    %ETc of the whole season. The boundary approach (Webb, 1972) was used to approximate
    the optimum values for MDSWP, VPDleaf, SWPT, and %ETc on the basis of almond yield.
    The boundary data were established via the Schnug approach (Schnug et al., 1996)
    without excluding outliers or lifting data. Polynomial and spline functions were
    used on the boundary data to generate the boundary lines. The boundary line analysis
    was programmed using R software (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). This
    approach is often chosen for biological databases when one has little control
    over the environmental conditions (Webb, 1972), like the case here, and was selected
    for this reason. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The textural analyses showed that the
    soil is a fine sandy loam at both depths, consistent with O’Green et al. (2016).
    Soil analysis did not indicate crop limitation effects or treatment effects on
    pH and electrical conductivity. Soil salinity never exceeded the salt tolerance
    threshold of 1.5 dS m–1 (Bernstein et al., 1956; Brown et al., 1953; Maas, 1990)
    for the 4 yr of the experiment (Table 1). Bulk density values did not indicate
    crop limitations effects and were characteristic of light-textured soils. Roots
    were mainly observed in the first 50 to 60 cm, as reported above, in the first
    two samplings and were observed to have moved deeper in the profile (70–90 cm)
    in 2015 and closer to the emitter. Table 1. Soil chemical and physical properties

    Tree and Soil Water Status With available water in the soil from winter rain,
    irrigation, additional water from fertigation, and reduced evapotranspiration
    demand, the trees were not subjected to hydric stress at the beginning of the
    season (before May). Even if irrigation treatments started in early May, stresses
    were mainly observed from early June to harvest, when ETc demand peaked, as confirmed
    by plant water status measurements. Table 2 presents the cumulative water input,
    SWPTs, and the number of irrigation applications for each year of the experiment.
    Figure 2 presents the cumulative water components for each season: ETc, rainfall,
    and irrigation water for each SWPT treatment as calculated from the tensiometer
    readings at the 25- and 50-cm depths. During the monitoring period, the grower,
    wet, and medium treatments received more water than the dry treatment. Over the
    4-yr experimental period, the grower treatment used about 557 mm (24%) more irrigation
    water than the wet and medium treatments, and about 971 mm (51%) more than the
    dry treatment. The medium and wet treatments received similar amounts of water,
    probably because of the reduced growth observed in the wet treatment, which is
    likely to be a result of root asphyxia, leading to lower water consumption. Table

    The experiment was carried out from 3 Apr. to 19 Aug. 2012, from 2 Apr. to 15
    Aug. 2013, from 1 Apr. to 8 Aug. 2014, and from 18 May to 8 Aug. 2015. ‡ The percentage
    of cumulative crop evapotranspiration of the monitoring season (%ETc) was calculated
    as the sum of irrigation water use and rainfall divided by crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) with the crop coefficient provided by Allen et al. (1998). Values in parentheses
    are in mm. § Average SWPT ± SD ¶ Number of irrigation applications corresponds
    to the number of samples used for mean SWPTs. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Cumulative
    water input (for treatments), site rainfall, and crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. A water use trend is apparent in the three SWPT
    treatments through all 4 yr, especially so in the dry treatment. Although the
    target SWPT was the same every year and ETc decreased with time, water use in
    %ETc increased from 2012 to 2015; this increase was particularly evident at the
    end of 2015. In the wet and medium treatments, increased water use was observed
    in 2014 and 2015, relative to the first 2 yr. In 2015, water use in all treatments
    exceeded ETc. Qualitative in-field observations suggest that with more regular
    irrigation and a wetting bulb (the wetted volume by the emitter) of quite uniform
    size relative to uneven irrigation, almonds trees reacted by increasing root development
    at the periphery of the wetting bulb. In the profile dug up in 2015, roots were
    found deeper than in 2012 and were located in between the tensiometer and the
    emitter. This increased root density caused a reduction of the wetting bulb dimension,
    because of roots intercepting the water front moving from the emitter toward the
    tensiometer. As the tensiometers remained in the same location from year to year,
    the expected tensiometer responses were delayed because of this interception for
    the same irrigation duration, which led to increased water applications. This
    observation made in the profile is consistent with those of Coelho and Or (1999)
    and Vrugt et al. (2001), who showed that irrigation strategy influences root development.
    Consequently, in future studies and for long-term use in irrigated almond orchards,
    tensiometers should be moved periodically to avoid such an effect. Targeted SWPTs
    differed slightly from the observed values as the thresholds were difficult to
    achieve at the beginning of the season during fertigation and were exceeded at
    the end of the season during the dry period when water applications were delayed
    because of restricted water allocation and availability. Furthermore, since irrigation
    water had to be ordered in advance for a specific threshold and because SWT readings
    at the 50- and 75-cm depths reacted only a couple of hours after the beginning
    of irrigation, the start of irrigation needed to be approximated and, consequently,
    irrigation had sometimes to be activated earlier or was sometimes delayed relative
    to the target threshold because of these ordering or additional usual operational
    constraints (staff or equipment limitations). Despite these limitations, the thresholds
    for all treatments were not significantly different from the target values, except
    for the wet treatment in 2013. All data were kept, though, as the wet treatment
    still remained wetter than the medium and the dry treatments in that year. Regarding
    the objective of the study, the most important difference among treatments was
    that the grower treatment used more water but this treatment had a more variable
    threshold, indicating that the grower sometimes irrigated when the soil was still
    wet and sometimes when it was too dry. The second important observation regarding
    the objective of this study was that MSWP and VPDleaf in the dry treatment (–1.346
    MPa and 2.419 kPa) were different (higher for VPDleaf and lower for MSWP) from
    those in the other treatments (Table 3). The values were similar in the wet (–1.246
    MPa and 2.371 kPa) and medium (–1.198 MPa and 2.354 kPa) treatments, except for
    MSWP in 2013. The grower treatment (–1.089 MPa and 2.297 kPa) showed the least
    stress (higher MSWP or less negative), consistent with the higher water consumption
    measured in this treatment. The mean seasonal MSWP in all treatments was generally
    maintained in the mild stress zone [–1.0 to –1.4 MPa according to Fulton et al.,
    (2014)], except in the dry treatment in 2012–2013 (–1.643 and –1.401 MPa) and
    in the wet treatment in 2013 (–1.520 MPa). Table 3. Midday stem water potential

    Table 4 presents the mean marketable yield for each treatment and for each year
    of the experiment. The mean yield from the experimental site was higher (3114
    kg ha–1) than the average yield in California (2477 kg ha–1) for the same period,
    suggesting that the overall growing conditions were representative, if not better,
    than normal almond orchard operations and productivity (USDA-NASS, 2016) and that
    factors other than irrigation were unlikely to control plant responses. Table

    were used to determine relationships between seasonal yield and the following
    variables: soil water potential threshold (SWPT), midday stem water potential
    (MSWP), leaf vapor pressure deficit (VPDleaf), and percentage of cumulative crop
    evapotranspiration of the monitoring season (%ETc). § Not applicable. The average
    yield (2012–2015) from the medium treatment (−45 kPa) exceeded that of the wet
    (11.0% increase) and dry (11.3% increase) treatments and these differences were
    significant. The results associated with the wet treatment relative to the medium
    treatment could be attributable to increased vegetative growth, as reported by
    other studies (Ebel et al., 1995; Hutmacher et al., 1994); root asphyxia causing
    stomatal closure and a consequent decrease in photosynthesis (Amador et al., 2012);
    or other constraints. Yield reductions in the dry treatment were linked to decreased
    fruit load and kernel size resulting from limited soil water availability and
    the possible years of cumulative irrigation effect on spur production (Lampinen
    et al., 2011). Indeed, even if yield is possibly affected by the same year’s irrigation
    management, it is also affected by antecedent management (including irrigation)
    effects on fruit-bearing spurs produced the years before. Therefore, irrigation
    effects may be better evaluated by looking at long-term yield irrigation trials.
    When summed over 4 yr, although the grower and medium treatments produced the
    same average yield, the medium treatment used an yearly average of 139 mm less
    water (16% less). Moreover, the grower treatment produced a higher yield than
    the wet treatment (11.2% higher). This yield difference may be attributable to
    the more variable irrigation pattern in the grower treatment, as reflected by
    the higher SD of the SWPT of grower’s data relative to the wet treatment (Table
    2). Indeed, data for the grower treatment indicated a SD of SWPT of 21.6 relative
    to 12.5 kPa for the wet treatment, showing that irrigation was sometimes initiated
    as low as −60.6 kPa (–39.0 + 1 times the SD of –21.6 kPa), in comparison with
    −53 kPa for the wet treatment. Dry periods in this treatment may have allowed
    more oxygen to enter the soil profile than the more uniform irrigation pattern
    in the wet treatment. Relative to the medium treatment, the dry periods in the
    grower treatment may have also caused some yield decrease (the medium treatment
    reached a low −57.0 kPa on average for 4 yr) but also some wetter conditions in
    the grower treatment, with irrigation initiation in the range of –27.4 kPa (–39
    + 21.6 kPa), compared with –37 kPa for the medium treatment. These results indicate
    that all water potential irrigation treatments had a less variable SWPT than the
    grower treatment. There were significant yield differences among years (P < 0.0001)
    and for the interactions among treatments and years (P = 0.0004) and treatments
    and blocks (P < 0.0001). Although the linear correlations were generally low (R2
    = 0.166 and 0.150, and 0.455 and 0.102 respectively for MSWP vs. VPDleaf and yield
    in 2012 and 2013, they were significant (data not shown). Figure 3 shows data
    for all years for MWSP, VPDleaf, and %ETc in relation to yield. Midday stem water
    potential was concentrated between –0.8 and –1.4 MPa in the grower treatment and
    between –1.0 and –1.4 MPa in the wet and the medium treatments, except in 2013,
    when MSWP in the wet treatment was lower than –1.4 MPa. Midday stem water potential
    in the dry treatment was generally lower than –1.3 MPa (indicating more stress),
    except in 2015, when it rose to –1.00 MPa (see Table 3). According to the boundary
    line, optimum yields were obtained for MSWPs between –1.1 and –1.3 MPa. This finding
    is consistent with that of Fulton et al. (2014), who suggested maintaining MSWP
    in the –1.0 to –1.4 MPa range from mid-June through to July. The VPDleaf data
    were more variable, ranging from 2 to 2.9 kPa for each treatment. Higher yields
    corresponded to VPDleaf values between 2.2 and 2.5 kPa. Although there was only
    one %ETc value for each treatment in each year, the boundary line indicated the
    highest yields when ETc was near 100%, according to the Kc recommended by Allen
    et al. (1998). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Midday stem water potential (MSWP),
    leaf vapor pressure deficit (VPDleaf), and percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc) related to almond yield for all experimental years,
    except for VDPleaf in 2014, when leaf temperatures were missing. Each point represents
    the season average data of the same tree (weekly measurements between 1200 and
    1600 hr as recommended by Fulton et al. (2014)), with the same replicate, with
    its corresponding yield. In the same way, the boundary line for SWPT and yield
    data was used to determine the optimal value (Fig. 4). We used mean yield data
    from neighboring fields collected over different years and monitored with SWT
    stations to improve this relationship. When we used a polynomial regression on
    the boundary data, a SWPT of −45 kPa was found to be optimal, according to our
    experiment. This is wetter than the recommendations of Taylor (1965) and Micke
    (1996), who suggested starting irrigation between −50 and −80 kPa for deciduous
    fruit trees or between −50 and −70 kPa at a depth of 45 to 60 cm for almonds.
    On the basis of the results obtained in the experimental treatments from 2012
    to 2015 (Fig. 4), however, it seems that a small deviation from the −45 kPa target
    value would lead to a greater decrease in marketable yield than the boundary line
    responses obtained for values from the neighboring fields for different years
    monitored with SWT stations. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer Relationship between
    soil water potential threshold (SWPT) and almond yield via the boundary line approach.
    The regression was drawn from the boundary data (open boxes). Boxes that appear
    to be filled simply reflect superimposition of symbols. Figure 5 shows simulated
    relationships between MSWP and %ETc and between SWPT and %ETc, with boundary lines
    for yield (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4), as suggested by Webb (1972). Even if the intervals
    between the SWPTs in this study were relatively large, the treatments were still
    in the mild stress range according to the MSWP values. The boundary lines for
    these parameters show that almond yield was affected by both insufficient and
    excess irrigation. Most studies focus principally on deficit irrigation, so little
    information is available on the effects of excess water in almond production.
    In a young orchard, Hutmacher et al. (1994) found no significant difference in
    yield between treatments receiving 150 and 175% ETc through drip irrigation. However,
    their experiment detected leaching even at the rate of 100% ETc and the authors
    questioned their irrigation frequency, application rates and wetted volume. They
    also showed that applying more water than required increased vegetative growth.
    Girona et al. (2005), on the other hand, reported no surplus vegetative growth
    for a 130% ETc treatment and a nonsignificant decrease in yield between 70 and
    130% relative to 100% ETc in a young (<5 yr) orchard under micro-sprinkler irrigation;
    ours was much older (>8 yr). Nevertheless, even if this phenomenon is more frequent
    in flood irrigation, hypoxia has been found to cause atmospheric gas exchange
    problems leading to growth reductions (Drew, 1983). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer
    Boundary relationships between percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc) and midday stem water potential (MSWP) and between
    %ETc and soil water potential threshold (SWPT). Red, orange, and blue lines represent
    crop stress associated with different MSWP levels in almonds according to Fulton
    et al. (2014). For practical use and irrigation guidance, this study also indicates
    the importance of the choice of Kc value to calculate the 100% ETc water requirements,
    as the height of water to be applied through irrigation will vary according to
    the calculated 100% ETc and hence the chosen model. For models indicating maximum
    yield at 80% ETc like Sanden (2009) and those recommended by Goldhamer, as cited
    by Steduto et al. (2012), applying water up to 100% ETc will obviously result
    in 20% extra water use than other Kc values suggested by Allen et al. (1998) (Fig.
    6). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc) related to almond yield for all experimental years,
    using crop coefficient values from Allen et al. (1998), Goldhamer (Steduto et
    al. 2012), Sanden (2009), Girona (2006), and Goldhamer and Viveros (2000). According
    to the results of this study, increased irrigation would probably have reduced
    yields and led to overapplication of water. This difference emphasizes the importance
    of Kc in irrigation scheduling based on ETc and indicates that using the Kc suggested
    by Allen et al. (1998) would help producers reduce water consumption without compromising
    yield. The study also emphasizes the importance of having soil water potential
    measurements not only to detect appropriate irrigation timing but also to allow
    adjustment for biases with evapotranspiration models used for irrigation management.
    The −45kPa threshold recommended here is for a full season, after fertilizer application
    and prior to harvest. This threshold reduced water use by 16% relative to the
    grower treatment, with the same yield. Further research is needed to determine
    optimum SWPTs for different stages of growth, as some additional water savings
    could be generated, particularly prior to harvest. There is also a need to adjust
    these thresholds to account for spatiotemporal variability (Collin, 2017). Practical
    Implications First, the results of this study indicate that growers under the
    same orchard conditions can use a SWPT of −45 kPa between May and harvest to schedule
    irrigation with wireless tensiometers. This threshold represents the mean value
    of tensiometers placed at the 25-cm depth and those at the 50-cm depth. Irrigation
    should be stopped when the wetting front reaches the 75-cm tensiometer. Tensiometers
    should be placed in the wet zone at the periphery of the wetted perimeter and
    moved as the perimeter evolves. Practically, they should be moved every second
    year as the rooting volume moves closer to the emitter with time. If only one
    tensiometer station is used in a field, it should be coupled with direct observations
    or plant measurements of MSWP several times during the season to ensure that the
    system is functioning adequately. Additional soil water potential measurements
    at different locations should be performed to confirm that the station is located
    in a representative spot of the orchard. Ideally, additional stations should be
    added to provide a good average and to increase the net margin of almond orchards,
    as reported by Collin, (2017). Second, this study shows that almond yield is adversely
    affected by excess water, possibly because of surplus vegetative growth or root
    asphyxia. Third, it was noted that using the new Kc values recommended for almond
    production (Steduto et al., 2012) under the conditions of this study would not
    only have led to increased water use but decreased marketable yield as well. Growers
    should therefore take care to use the Kc values best suited to their specific
    orchard characteristics. CONCLUSION For the 4 yr of the experiment, the medium
    treatment used about 20% less water than the grower treatment, with no decrease
    in average yield. A SWPT of −45 kPa is therefore recommended in sandy loam soils
    under San Joaquin Valley conditions between May and harvest to reduce irrigation
    water use without diminishing productivity. This study also showed that almond
    trees were negatively affected by both excess irrigation and deficit irrigation
    (−55 kPa). Finally, some attention should be paid to the Kc recommendations in
    almond orchards to ensure optimal yield and water use. CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT

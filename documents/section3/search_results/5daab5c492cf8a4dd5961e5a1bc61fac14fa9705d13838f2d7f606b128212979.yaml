    \ advancing over the past few years. This advancement\nis attributed to the increased\
    \ innovation and availability of new technologies which can enable the\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping of complex plant traits. The application of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ in\nvarious domains of science has also grown exponentially in recent years.\
    \ Notably, the computer\nvision, machine learning, and deep learning aspects of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence have been successfully\nintegrated into non-invasive\
    \ imaging techniques. This integration is gradually improving the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ data collection and analysis through the application of machine and deep learning\
    \ for\nrobust image analysis. In addition, artiﬁcial intelligence has fostered\
    \ the development of software\nand tools applied in ﬁeld phenotyping for data\
    \ collection and management. These include open-\nsource devices and tools which\
    \ are enabling community driven research and data-sharing, thereby\navailing the\
    \ large amounts of data required for the accurate study of phenotypes. This paper\
    \ reviews\nmore than one hundred current state-of-the-art papers concerning AI-applied\
    \ plant phenotyping\npublished between 2010 and 2020. It provides an overview\
    \ of current phenotyping technologies and\nthe ongoing integration of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence into plant phenotyping. Lastly, the limitations of the\ncurrent\
    \ approaches/methods and future directions are discussed.\nKeywords: artiﬁcial\

    \ the United Nations, the world population is expected to grow\nto nine billion\
    \ by 2050 [1]. With the increasing need for food production to match the\nprojected\
    \ population growth in order to prevent food insecurity, plant phenotyping is\n\
    now at the forefront of plant breeding as compared to genotyping [2]. Plant phenotyping\n\
    is deﬁned as the assessment of complex traits such as growth, development, tolerance,\n\
    resistance, architecture, physiology, ecology, yield, and the basic measurement\
    \ of individual\nquantitative parameters that form the basis for complex trait\
    \ assessment [2]. Scientists\nare increasingly interested in the use of phenomic-level\
    \ data to aid in the correlation\nbetween genomics and the variation in crop yields\
    \ and plant health [3–5]. In this way, plant\nphenotyping has become an important\
    \ aspect of crop improvement, availing data to assess\ntraits for variety selection\
    \ in order to identify desirable traits and eliminate undesirable\ntraits during\
    \ the evaluation of plant populations [6]. Plant phenotyping has improved\nprogressively\
    \ over the past 30 years, although obtaining satisfactory phenotypic data for\n\
    complex traits such as stress tolerance and yield potential remains challenging\
    \ [7]. The\nlarge data required for the effective study of phenotypes has led\
    \ to the development and\nuse of high-throughput phenotyping technologies to enable\
    \ the characterization of large\nnumbers of plants at a fraction of the time,\
    \ cost, and labor of previously used traditional\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21134363\n\

    \ Traditional techniques previously required destructive measurements whereby\n\
    crops were harvested at particular growth stages in order to carry out genetic\
    \ testing and\nthe mapping of plant traits [8]. Since crop breeding programs require\
    \ repeated experimental\ntrials in order to ascertain which traits are of interest,\
    \ the process was slow, costly and\nsigniﬁcantly lagging behind the DNA sequencing\
    \ technologies which are necessary for\ncrop improvement [9].\nHigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping has been fostered by non-invasive imaging techniques,\nwhich have\
    \ enabled the visualization of plant cell structures on a wider scale. As these\n\
    imaging technologies develop, images carry more useful extractable information\
    \ that sup-\nports biological interpretations of plant growth [10,11]. These techniques\
    \ include thermal\nimaging [12], chlorophyll ﬂuorescence [13,14], digital imaging\
    \ [15], and spectroscopic\nimaging [16].\nHigh-throughput phenotyping techniques\
    \ are currently being used to enable data\nacquisition in both laboratory and\
    \ ﬁeld settings. They are being employed at the levels of\ndata collection, data\
    \ management, and analysis. They include imaging sensors, growth\nchambers, data\
    \ management and analysis software, etc. [7,17–20]. The integration of\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence into these technologies has contributed to the development of the\
    \ non-\ninvasive imaging aspect of phenomics. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies\
    \ in the form\nof computer vision and machine learning are increasingly being\
    \ used to acquire and analyze\nplant image data. Computer vision systems process\
    \ digital images of plants to detect\nspeciﬁc attributes for object recognition\
    \ purposes [21]. Machine learning employs various\ntools and approaches to ‘learn’\
    \ from large collections of crop phenotypes in order to classify\nunique data,\
    \ identify new patterns and features, and predict novel trends [22,23]. Recent\n\
    advancements in deep learning, a subset of machine learning, have provided promising\n\
    results for real-time image analysis. Deep learning is a machine learning approach\
    \ that\ntakes advantage of the large plant datasets available and uses them to\
    \ carry out image\nanalysis using convolutional neural networks [24]. In ﬁeld\
    \ phenotyping, AI is being applied\nin ﬁeld equipment for ground and obstacle\
    \ detection, the detection of plants and weeds\nduring data collection, and the\
    \ stable remote control of the equipment [25]. Although\nthe ﬁeld phenotyping\
    \ applications of AI are in relative infancy compared to laboratory\nphenotyping,\
    \ their growth is notable because they provide the phenotypic data of plants in\n\
    their natural environment.\nIn addition to image analysis, AI applications that\
    \ are widely used in other domains\nof science are now being integrated into the\
    \ phenomics data management pipeline. Cy-\nberinfrastructure (CI), a research\
    \ environment that provides linkages between researchers,\ndata storage, and computing\
    \ systems using high-performance networks has been applied\nwidely in the environmental\
    \ sciences [26–28]. CI is now being applied to phenomics in\norder to facilitate\
    \ collaboration among researchers [29]. Open-source devices and tools\nrepresent\
    \ another fast developing application of AI technologies [30]. In phenomics, these\n\
    tools are addressing the challenges of expensive phenotyping equipment and proprietary\n\
    or incompatible data formats. The growth of these applications of AI has expanded\
    \ the\nﬁeld of phenomics with industry companies investing in the manufacture\
    \ and distribution\nof phenotyping technologies alongside government-funded agricultural\
    \ institutions.\nThis review begins by considering the broader area of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence and its inte-\ngration and application in phenomics through machine\
    \ learning and deep learning. Digital,\nﬂuorescence, spectroscopic, thermography,\
    \ and tomography imaging, and the integration\nof artiﬁcial intelligence into\
    \ their individual data management are highlighted. Thereafter,\nadditional applications\
    \ of AI such as cyberinfrastructure and open-source devices and tools\nare discussed.\
    \ The current utilization of phenotyping technologies for ﬁeld phenotyping,\n\
    which is increasingly gaining ground over phenotyping in controlled environments,\
    \ is then\ndiscussed brieﬂy, highlighting their cross applicability with artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence.\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n3 of 19\n2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\

    \ 1970s, AI research has been focused on machine learning. Statistical ma-\nchine\
    \ learning frameworks and models such as Perceptron, support vector machines,\
    \ and\nBayesian networks have been designed. However, no single model works best\
    \ for all tasks.\nIt is still challenging to determine the best model for a given\
    \ problem [34]. According\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n4 of 19\nto Roscher et al.\
    \ 2020 [35], the rise and success of neural networks, coupled with the\nabundance\
    \ of data and high-level computational and data processing infrastructure, has\n\
    led to the comprehensive utilization of machine learning (ML) models and algorithms\n\
    despite the challenge of model determinations for a given task.\nThe utilization\
    \ of a range of imaging techniques for nondestructive phenotyping has\ninﬂuenced\
    \ the development of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), whereby multiple\nimaging\
    \ sensors collect plant data in near-real-time platforms. These sensors have the\n\
    capacity to collect large volumes of data which has, in turn, made phenomics a\
    \ big data\nproblem well suited for the application of ML. The analysis and interpretation\
    \ of these large\ndatasets are quite challenging, but ML algorithms provide an\
    \ approach for faster, efﬁcient,\nand better data analytics than traditional processing\
    \ methods. Traditional processing\nmethods include probability theory, decision\
    \ theory, optimization, and statistics. ML\ntools leverage these processing methods\
    \ to extract patterns and features from these large\namounts of data in order\
    \ to enable feature identiﬁcation in particular complex tasks such\nas stress\
    \ phenotyping [36].\nAccording to Rahaman et al. 2019 [37], one of the advantages\
    \ of using ML approaches\nin plant phenotyping is their ability to search large\
    \ datasets and discover patterns by\nsimultaneously looking at a combination of\
    \ features (compared to analyzing each feature\nseparately). This was previously\
    \ a challenge because of the high dimensionality of plant\nimages and their large\
    \ quantity, making them difﬁcult to analyze through traditional\nprocessing methods\
    \ [36]. Machine learning methods have thus far been successfully\napplied in the\
    \ identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant diseases [38,39] and plant organ\n\
    segmentation, among other tasks as shown in Table 1 below. This has been achieved\
    \ by\nsupervised learning, where the algorithms can identify diseased plants after\
    \ being trained\nwith sample images from large datasets. However, this approach\
    \ prevents the search for\nnovel and unexpected phenotypic traits that would otherwise\
    \ be discovered by the less\naccurate unsupervised ML [40].\nTable 1. Examples\

    \ is a rapidly advancing subset of machine learning tools that has created\na\
    \ paradigm shift in image-based plant phenotyping. It is efﬁcient in the discovery\
    \ of\ncomplex structures in high-dimensional data and is thus applicable to a\
    \ range of scientiﬁc\nresearch tasks [24]. The plant images collected using the\
    \ various sensors have a wide\nvariability, making the use of some machine learning\
    \ techniques challenging [47]. While\ntraditional machine learning involves trial-and-error\
    \ steps in the feature extraction process\nof images, deep learning tools have\
    \ enabled the creation of more reliable workﬂows for\nfeature identiﬁcation. They\
    \ employ an automatic hierarchical feature extraction process\nusing a large bank\
    \ of non-linear ﬁlters before carrying out decision-making, such as\nclassiﬁcation.\
    \ Deep learning approaches have multiple hidden layers in the network, with\n\
    each layer performing a simple operation on the images in succession which increases\
    \ their\ndiscrimination and prediction ability [48]. A wide range of deep learning\
    \ architectures has\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n5 of 19\nbeen used in plant phenotyping\
    \ by a process called transfer learning. This involves the use\nof a network that\
    \ was pre-trained on a large dataset somewhat similar to the one under\ninvestigation\
    \ and retraining it with weights for the new dataset. Table 2 details some deep\n\
    learning architectures that have been applied using transfer learning for phenotyping.\n\

    \ still limited availability\nof publicly available annotated agricultural data,\
    \ which reduces the possibility of obtain-\ning high-performance feature extraction\
    \ models through transfer learning. In addition,\nmany agricultural image data\
    \ have high levels of occlusion (especially plant leaves and\nbackground noise),\
    \ leading to higher likelihoods of error from confusing objects of interest\n\
    with the background. This is partly due to the environmental variations (e.g.,\
    \ cloudy sky,\nwindy weather for ﬁeld data collection) that signiﬁcantly impact\
    \ the images and make\nthem harder to work with. Similarly, data samples are also\
    \ sensitive to imaging angles,\nﬁeld terrain and conditions, and variations within\
    \ plant genotypes. Hence, the robustness\nand adaptability requirements are signiﬁcantly\
    \ high for the deep learning models built for\nagricultural applications [55].\n\
    Thus far, deep learning architectures in phenotyping have been used in leaf count-\n\
    ing [56], the classiﬁcation of plant morphology [57], plant recognition and identiﬁcation\
    \ [55],\nroot and shoot feature identiﬁcation [48], and plant stress identiﬁcation\
    \ and classiﬁca-\ntion [58]. A few reported applications of machine learning or\
    \ deep learning for stress\nprediction and quantiﬁcation provide great opportunities\
    \ for new research efforts of plant\nscientists. A key challenge to overcome is\
    \ that the underlying processes for linking the\ninputs to the outputs are too\
    \ complex to model mathematically.\n3. Application of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in\
    \ Phenotyping Technologies\n3.1. Imaging Techniques\nTraditionally, the measurement\
    \ of observable plant traits has been conducted by\ndestructive sampling followed\
    \ by laboratory determinations to characterize phenotypes\nbased on their genetic\
    \ functions. Due to technological advancement in AI, imaging tech-\nniques (overview\
    \ in Table 3) have emerged as important tools for non-destructive sampling,\n\
    allowing image capture, data processing, and analysis to determine observable\
    \ plant traits.\nAccording to Houle et al. 2010 [5], “imaging is ideal for phenomic\
    \ studies because of the\navailability of many technologies that span molecular\
    \ to organismal spatial scales, the\nintensive nature of the characterization,\
    \ and the applicability of generic segmentation\ntechniques to data.” Spatial\
    \ or temporal data of many phenotype classes such as mor-\nphology and geometric\
    \ features, behavior, physiological state, and locations of proteins\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 4363\n6 of 19\nand metabolites can be captured in intensive detail\
    \ by imaging. For that reason, imaging\ntechniques have allowed for high-throughput\
    \ screening and real-time image analysis of\nphysiological changes in plant populations.\
    \ At the laboratory scale, the different imaging\nmethods are tested individually.\
    \ One, or a combination of the best-suited methods for crop\nsurveillance, are\
    \ then used both in controlled and ﬁeld environments [5,59].\nTable 3. Visualization\

    \ state that “computer\nvision aims to bring together factors derived from multiple\
    \ research areas such as image\nprocessing and statistical learning to simulate\
    \ human perception capability using the\npower of computational modeling of the\
    \ visual domain.” Computer vision uses machine\nlearning to recognize patterns\
    \ and extract information from the images. The computer\nvision workﬂow (shown\
    \ in Figure 2) carries out visual tasks ranging from pre-processing\n(e.g., conversion\
    \ of image formats, color space conversions etc.) to object detection applied\n\
    in ML algorithms, resulting in the comprehension of image understanding in a human-like\n\
    way [34]. Computer vision transforms the images so that they can be applied to\
    \ an AI\nsystem. This process has high computational demands, especially when\
    \ working with\nimages of varying formats from a range of sensors, as is the case\
    \ in phenotyping imaging\ntechniques [32]. A few of the different imaging techniques\

    \ also provides information on the size and color of\nplants, which enables the\
    \ quantiﬁcation of plant deterioration arising from, for example,\nnutrient deﬁciencies\
    \ or pathogen infections, etc. Using a combination of careful image\ncapture,\
    \ image analysis, and color classiﬁcation, it is possible to follow the progression\
    \ of\nlesions from infections and deﬁciencies over time quantitatively [8].\n\
    Advances in hardware and software for digital image processing have motivated\
    \ the\ndevelopment of machine vision systems providing for the expeditious analysis\
    \ of RGB\nimages. Being relatively the simplest and most widely used technique\
    \ has served as an\nadvantage, as many machine learning techniques and deep learning\
    \ architecture can be\napplied effectively to RGB images. These techniques have\
    \ been applied in the identiﬁcation\nof plant growth stage [41], classiﬁcation\
    \ of plant images [43–46], disease detection and\nclassiﬁcation [38,52,53,65],\
    \ identiﬁcation of biotic and abiotic stress [49,58], weed detec-\ntion [50,51],\
    \ detection of ﬂowering times [57], and leaf counting [54–56]. Although the\n\
    extraction of useful phenotyping features from 2D digital images has been successful,\
    \ the\nexpansion in computer vision has led to an exploration of the applications\
    \ of 3D imaging.\nThis has been achieved using stereo-vision, where two identical\
    \ RGB cameras are used\nto capture images in a setup similar to the operation\
    \ of the human eyes. These images\nare then used to reconstruct a 3D model of\
    \ the plant for analysis using stereo-matching\nalgorithms [60,77]. Approaches\
    \ using multiple images from more than two RGB cameras\nplaced at different viewing\
    \ angles have been successfully used for larger plants with a\nhigher degree of\
    \ occlusion thereby expanding the applications of digital imaging [78].\n3.1.2.\
    \ Spectroscopy\nSpectroscopic imaging is a widely used imaging technique that\
    \ has been used to\npredict many properties of large plant populations [5]. It\
    \ consists of multispectral and\nhyperspectral imaging. In multispectral imaging,\
    \ the images are captured in wavelengths\nbetween visible and near-infrared, consisting\
    \ of up to ﬁfteen spectral bands, whereas in\nhyperspectral imaging, hundreds\
    \ of continuous spectral wavebands are available. Pre-\nvious phenotyping studies\
    \ have shown that spectroscopy can be used to monitor plant\nphotosynthetic pigment\
    \ composition, assess water status, and detect abiotic or biotic plant\nstresses\
    \ [79]. During plant development, varying growth conditions induce changes in\n\
    surface and internal leaf structure, modifying the reﬂection of light from plant\
    \ leaves or\ncanopies. These changes can be visualized by spectroscopy, either\
    \ in the visible spectrum\nor near-infrared wavelengths undetectable by the human\
    \ eye (0.7–1.3 mm) [18]. The appli-\ncation of spectroscopy is therefore important\
    \ for the ﬁeld monitoring of plant traits arising\nfrom gene expression in response\
    \ to environmental factors [20].\nHyperspectral imaging has thus far been successfully\
    \ applied in both controlled envi-\nronments (i.e., greenhouses and growth chambers)\
    \ and ﬁeld environments [80]. However,\na major limitation to the utility of hyperspectral\
    \ data in ﬁeld phenotyping, besides the\ncost of the equipment, is the variability\
    \ in environmental conditions during measurements.\nSpectrometers are highly sensitive\
    \ and rely on solar radiation as a light source in the ﬁeld,\nand this leads to\
    \ difﬁculty in the analysis of images due to cloud cover, shadows caused\nby phenotyping\
    \ platforms, and changes in solar angle during the photo period [8,80].\nAnother\
    \ challenge in hyperspectral data analysis is data redundancy due to the continuous\n\
    nature of wavelengths and their similarity. This has been alleviated by the selection\
    \ of\neffective wavelengths using algorithms such as the successive projections\
    \ algorithm (SPA),\ngenetic algorithm (GA), the Monte-Carlo uninformative variable\
    \ elimination (MC-UVE),\nand boosted regression tree (BRT) which is also a ML\
    \ technique [81–83].\nAlthough these difﬁculties can potentially be remedied by\
    \ applying robust com-\nputer vision algorithms, hyperspectral images have only\
    \ been successfully applied to\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n8 of 19\nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms and not to faster and more advanced deep learning algo-\nrithms.\
    \ Nonetheless, hyperspectral imaging allows for a wide variety of stresses to\
    \ be\ndetected and continues to be a promising way to detect speciﬁc signatures\
    \ for a particular\nstressor [18].\n3.1.3. Thermography\nThermography, also known\
    \ as thermal imaging, is a technique that detects infra-\nred radiation from an\
    \ object and creates an image based on it. Thermographic cameras\ndetect infrared\
    \ radiation (9000−14,000 nanometers) in the electromagnetic spectrum and\ncreate\
    \ images based off of it [84]. Thermography has been used in plant research to\n\
    monitor transpiration and canopy temperature. Transpiration is linked with nutrient\n\
    uptake by the roots and, ultimately, with crop productivity. However, it also\
    \ reﬂects\nwater use efﬁciency. Canopy temperature has been widely used to infer\
    \ crop water use,\nphotosynthesis, and, in some cases, to predict yield. In breeding\
    \ programs aimed at\nselecting plants based on water use efﬁciency, thermography\
    \ improves the speed and\neffectiveness of monitoring transpiration [18]. It has\
    \ also been used in the ﬁeld as a\nremote sensing tool to capture canopy temperature\
    \ data for a large number of plots using\nmicrobolometer-based thermal imaging\
    \ mounted on ﬁeld phenotyping platforms above the\ncrop using helium balloons\
    \ or manned aircraft [8]. Despite the inability of thermography to\ndetect pre-symptomatic\
    \ changes in leaves, it can detect changes in leaf thickness [18]. This\nallows\
    \ for the visualization and monitoring of internal structural heterogeneity resulting\n\
    from stresses or infections.\nIn phenotyping, thermography is used in combination\
    \ with other imaging techniques\nfor effective diagnostics [85]. Photogrammetry\
    \ algorithms such as structure-from-motion\nhave been applied to thermographic\
    \ images [86] collected in ﬁeld environments without\nmuch success. Currently,\
    \ the data collected from the images is analyzed using standard\nequations and\
    \ ML statistical methods such as probability theory, decision theory and\nclassiﬁers\
    \ [87]. Thermography has a range of applications from medical diagnostics to\n\
    metal defect detection in industries where deep learning algorithms have been\
    \ applied to\nthermal images [88].\n3.1.4. Fluorescence\nFluorescence imaging,\
    \ also known as ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, is used as a measure-\nment technique\
    \ for photosynthetic function under stresses such as drought and infections\n\
    by detecting light emitted after the plant has been exposed to a speciﬁc wavelength\
    \ of light.\nThese stresses have adverse effects that lead to a decrease in photosynthesis\
    \ which, in turn,\nlimits crop yield. Chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging has enabled\
    \ the early visualization\nof viral and fungal infections due to its ability to\
    \ achieve high resolutions. It has also\nbeen used in studies to determine plant\
    \ leaf area [18]. For the rapid screening of plant\npopulations, portable ﬂuorometers\
    \ are being used to obtain average measurements of\nwhole plants or leaves at\
    \ the same developmental stage. There is potential for portable ﬂu-\norescence\
    \ imaging to be used for the ﬁeld-scale assessment of infections, even for those\
    \ that\nleave no visible trace [8,18,67]. Fluorescence imaging is usually used\
    \ in combination with\nhyperspectral imaging, and image data extracted using this\
    \ technique has been successfully\napplied to algorithms based on AI methods,\
    \ such as neural networks, for analysis [89].\n3.1.5. Tomography\nX-ray computed\
    \ tomography (X-ray CT) is a technology that uses computer-processed\nX-rays to\
    \ produce tomographic images of speciﬁc areas of scanned objects. It can generate\
    \ a\n3D image of the inside of an object from an extensive series of 2D radiographic\
    \ images taken\naround a single axis of rotation [76]. X-ray CT imaging technology\
    \ has been used for several\napplications in plant phenotyping. It has been applied\
    \ in the observation of root growth\nbecause of its ability to capture the intricacies\
    \ of the edaphic environment with high spatial\nresolutions [90,91]. X-ray CT\
    \ has also been used in the high-throughput measurement of\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 4363\n9 of 19\nrice tillers to determine grain yield. It was applied as the\
    \ preferred imaging technique for\nthe rice tiller study because of the tendency\
    \ of rice tillers to overlap and, hence, not be easily\ndetectable by digital\
    \ imaging [92]. According to Li et al. 2014 [76], however, “tomographic\nimaging\
    \ remains low throughput, and its image segmentation and reconstruction need to\
    \ be\nfurther improved to enable high throughput plant phenotyping.” Although\
    \ this technology\nis effective in the early detection of plant stress symptoms,\
    \ its effectiveness is further\nimproved by combined use with other imaging techniques.\
    \ The simultaneous use of CT and\npositron emission tomography (PET) has the potential\
    \ to be used to provide insight into the\neffect of abiotic stress in particular\
    \ [71,76]. Additionally, to provide satisfactory resolutions,\nX-ray CT requires\
    \ small pot sizes and controlled environments, making it unsuitable for\nﬁeld\
    \ applications. For morphological root phenotyping tasks, X-ray CT has been applied\
    \ in\nthe identiﬁcation of root tips and root-soil segmentation tasks using machine\
    \ learning [93].\nDespite the minimal use of tomography in phenotyping, its application\
    \ in the medical ﬁeld\npositions it as a powerful technique that, coupled with\
    \ AI algorithms (and particularly\nCNNs), is beneﬁcial in diagnostics [94].\n\
    3.2. Cyberinfrastructure\nCyberinfrastructure (CI) is described by Atkins et al.\
    \ 2003 [95] as a “research environ-\nment that supports advanced data acquisition,\
    \ storage, management, integration, mining,\nvisualization and other computing\
    \ and processing services distributed over the internet\nbeyond the scope of a\
    \ single institution.” It consists of computing systems, data storage\nsystems,\
    \ advanced instruments and data repositories, visualization environments, and\
    \ peo-\nple (shown in Figure 3) linked together by software and high-performance\
    \ networks [27].\nThis enhances the efﬁciency of research and productivity in\
    \ the use of resources. Some CI\nsystems can provide for in-ﬁeld data analysis\
    \ to point out errors in data collection that can\nbe rectiﬁed and identify further\
    \ areas of interest for data collection.\nSensors 2021, 21, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ to the various components required, CI systems are expensive, with\nthe cost\
    \ of a supercomputer alone being upwards of US$90 million. For this reason, some\n\

    \ a fee to researchers.\nFor example, the University of Illinois at Chicago provides\

    \ sharing through its GeoPlatform (https:\n//www.geo-platform.gov/, accessed on\
    \ 26 June 2021) [98]. In the geospatial domain, one\nexample is the Data Observation\
    \ Network for Earth (DataONE), which is a CI platform for\nintegrative biological\
    \ and environmental research. It is designed to provide an underlying\ninfrastructure\
    \ that facilitates data preservation and re-use for research with an initial focus\n\
    on remote-sensed data for the biological and environmental sciences [99]. Because\
    \ of the\ncomplexities in developing and setting up a CI, Wang et al. 2013 [100]\
    \ put forward the\nCyberaide Creative service, which uses virtual machine technologies\
    \ to create a common\nplatform separate from the hardware and software and then\
    \ deploys a cyberinfrastructure\nfor its users. This allows for end-users to specify\
    \ the necessary resource requirements and\nhave them immediately deployed without\
    \ needing to understand their conﬁguration and\nbasic infrastructures.\nIn plant\
    \ phenotyping, a case for the use of CI has been made similarly in that non-\n\
    invasive high throughput phenotyping technologies collect large amounts of plant\
    \ data.\nAnalysis methods for this data using AI are being developed but face\
    \ the challenge of\nintegrating datasets and the poor scalability of these tools\
    \ [29]. The large amounts of data\ngenerated by HTP platforms need to be efﬁciently\
    \ archived and retrieved for analysis.\nResearchers afﬁliated with the United\
    \ States National Science Foundation (NSF) have\ndeveloped a form of CI called\
    \ iPlant that incorporates artiﬁcial intelligence technologies to\nstore and process\
    \ plant data gathered from the various HTP platforms. This CI platform\nprovides\
    \ tools for data analysis and storage with high-performance computing to access\n\
    and analyze the data. It also has methods for the integration of tools and datasets\
    \ [29].\nIn order to support both genotyping and phenotyping, iPlant uses the\
    \ BISQUE (Bio-\nImage Semantic Query User Environment) [101] software system.\
    \ Its main functionality is\nimage analysis which it supports using its ﬁve core\
    \ services: image storage and manage-\nment, metadata management and query, analysis\
    \ execution, and client presentation. Its\ndesign is ﬂexible enough to support\
    \ the range of variability in image analysis workﬂows\nbetween research labs.\
    \ The plant-oriented version of BISQUE, PhytoBISQUE, provides\nan application\
    \ programming interface integrated with iPlant to develop and deploy new\nalgorithms,\
    \ facilitating collaboration among researchers [29].\n3.3. Open-Source Devices\
    \ and Tools\nOpen-source is a term generally used to refer to tools or software\
    \ that, as stated by\nAksulu & Wade, 2010 [30], “allows for the modiﬁcation of\
    \ source code, is freely distributed,\nis technologically neutral, and grants\
    \ free subsidiary licensing rights.” Characteristically,\nOpen-Source Systems\
    \ (OSS) are voluntary and collaborative in nature and their lifespan\nlasts as\
    \ long as there is an individual willing and able to maintain the system [102].\
    \ Few\ntraditional operation constraints such as scope, time, and cost factors\
    \ affect these systems,\nand they have the added advantage of enhancing the skills\
    \ of the people involved while\nproducing tangible cost-effective technology output\
    \ [30]. Some OSS development teams\ntake advantage of crowdsourcing which widens\
    \ the scope and quality of ideas and reduces\nproject cycle time [103].\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 4363\n11 of 19\nIn phenomics, new crop management strategies require\
    \ the co-analyses of both sensor\ndata on crop status and related environmental\
    \ and genetic metadata. Unfortunately, this\ndata is mostly restricted to larger\
    \ well-funded agricultural institutions since the instruments\nfor data collection\
    \ are expensive. The available phenotyping instruments output data that is\nchallenging\
    \ to interpret because of proprietary or incompatible formats. Many techniques\n\
    that are being applied are ready-made off-the-shelf software packages that do\
    \ not have\nspeciﬁc algorithms for this data interpretation. Phenotyping researchers,\
    \ therefore, have to\naddress the challenges of data interpretation and data sharing\
    \ alongside limited access to\ninstrumentation (especially that which is well\
    \ suited for ﬁeld phenotyping). Open-source\ntools and devices represent a promising\
    \ approach for addressing these challenges. Those be-\ning applied in phenomics\
    \ are more accessible and easy to use while providing a connection\nto a community\
    \ of users with broader support and continuous improvement [104,105]. One\nsuch\
    \ open-source device is the MultispeQ device (PhotosynQ, East Lansing, MI, USA),\
    \ an\ninexpensive device linked through the PhotosynQ platform (https://www.photosynq.com,\n\
    accessed on 1 June 2021) to communities of researchers, providing useful data\
    \ on plant\nperformance. The MultispeQ device is rugged and ﬁeld deployable, open-source,\
    \ and\nexpandable to incorporate new sensors and techniques. The PhotosynQ platform\
    \ connects\nthe MultispeQ instrument to the community of researchers, breeders,\
    \ and citizen scientists\nto foster ﬁeld-based and community-driven phenotyping\
    \ [105].\nAn open-source prediction approach called Dirichlet-aggregation regression\
    \ (DAR)\nwas put forward by Bauckhage and Kersting, 2013 [104], to address the\
    \ challenge of manual\ndata labeling and running supervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ on hyperspectral data.\nHyperspectral cameras record a spectrum of several hundred\
    \ wave-lengths ranging from\napproximately 300 nm to 2500 nm, which poses a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge of data handling\nin hyperspectral image analysis. Therefore, working\
    \ with hyperspectral data requires\nalgorithms and architecture that can cope\
    \ with massive amounts of data. Their research\nshows that DAR can predict the\
    \ level of drought stress of plants effectively and before it\nbecomes visible\
    \ to the human eye.\nOpen-source software and platforms have also been developed\
    \ that simplify the com-\nputer vision image management pipeline. One such tool\
    \ is the PlantCV image analysis\nsoftware package. It is used to build workﬂows\
    \ that can be used to extract data from images\nand sensors, and it employs various\
    \ computational tools in python that are extendable,\ndepending on the required\
    \ image analysis task, in order to provide data scientists and\nbiologists with\
    \ a common interface [106]. It deploys additional open-source tools such as\n\
    LabelImg for image annotation [107]. PlantCV’s image processing library has been\
    \ applied\nin Deep Plant Phenomics which is an open-source software platform that\
    \ implements deep\nconvolutional neural networks for plant phenotyping [108].\
    \ Deep Plant Phenomics pro-\nvides an image processing pipeline that has been\
    \ used for complex non-linear phenotyping\ntasks such as leaf counting, mutant\
    \ classiﬁcation, and age regression in Arabidopsis.\nAnother group of open-source\
    \ tools that have been applied in phenomics are the\nMobileNet deep learning architectures.\
    \ MobileNet architectures are convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) with reduced\
    \ complexity and model size and are suited to devices with\nlow computational\
    \ power such as mobile phones. MobileNets optimize for latency resulting\nfrom\
    \ low computing power by providing small networks with substantial accuracy that\n\
    can be used in real-world applications [109]. One example is the MobileNetV2 which\
    \ is\nbuilt to be used for classiﬁcation, detection, and segmentation of images.\
    \ It uses ReLU6\nnon-linearity, which is suited to low-precision computation [110].\
    \ These are promising for\nuse on mobile phones which are widely accessible and\
    \ commonplace to be potentially used\nfor ﬁeld phenotyping. MobileNets employ\
    \ TensorFlow Lite, an open-source deep learning\nframework used to deploy machine\
    \ learning models on mobile devices [111].\nLighting problems in outdoor settings\
    \ have the potential to affect open-source tools\nand the performance of CNNs.\
    \ There is, therefore, a need to test and train the networks\non plant images\
    \ collected in the ﬁeld. A mobile-based CNN model was used for plant\ndisease\
    \ diagnosis, and the problem of inconsistent light conditions was solved in this\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 4363\n12 of 19\nstudy [112] by the use of an umbrella. This\
    \ model was employed ofﬂine and displayed\ndecreased performance because of differing\
    \ training datasets from the data collected in\nthe ﬁeld and, therefore, highlighted\
    \ the need to capture more images using mobile devices\nin typical ﬁeld settings\
    \ and to use those very images for the training of the models in\norder to improve\
    \ the accuracy. In deploying open-source platforms and CNNs, there is an\nadditional\
    \ challenge in developing tools that can analyze and determine a wide variety\n\
    of phenotypes from various crops, and it has not been possible to develop a one-size-\n\
    ﬁts-all platform for analysis. However, various platforms are thus far available\
    \ for some\nphenotyping tasks.\n4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Field Phenotyping\n\
    In order to screen plants for valuable traits (such as grain size, abiotic stress\
    \ toler-\nance, product quality, or yield potential), experiments with repeated\
    \ trials are required\nin different environments based on the objectives of the\
    \ study. Much of the discussion of\nphenotyping has focused on the measurement\
    \ of individual plants in controlled environ-\nments. However, controlled environments\
    \ do not provide an accurate representation of\nplant growth in open-air conditions\
    \ [7]. Field-based phenotyping (FBP) is now increasingly\nwidely recognized as\
    \ the only approach that gives accurate depictions of the traits in\nactual cropping\
    \ systems. Currently, sensor systems suitable for high-throughput ﬁeld\nphenotyping\
    \ can simultaneously measure multiple plots and fuse a multitude of traits in\n\
    different data formats [17]. Through the use of vehicles carrying multiple sets\
    \ of sensors,\nFBP platforms are transforming the characterization of plant populations\
    \ for genetic re-\nsearch and crop improvement. Accomplishing FBP in a timely\
    \ and cost-effective manner\nhas led to the use of unmanned aircraft, wheeled\
    \ vehicles, or agricultural robots to deploy\nmultiple sensors that can measure\
    \ plant traits in brief time intervals [7]. Therefore, pheno-\ntyping in many\
    \ crop breeding programs is now being conducted by combining instruments\nwith\
    \ novel technologies such as non-invasive imaging, robotics, and high-performance\n\
    computing on the FBP platforms [8].\nUnmanned aircraft are particularly attractive\
    \ for data acquisition because they enable\nsensing with a high spatial and spectral\
    \ resolution for a relatively low cost. Unmanned\nhelicopters (such as the one\
    \ shown in Figure 4) can carry various sensors and have the ac-\ncommodation to\
    \ carry larger sensors. In windy conditions, helicopters enable precise ﬂight\n\
    control and operations in cluttered environments because of their maneuverability\
    \ and\nability to ﬂy at low speeds. Replicated collection of sensor data can be\
    \ achieved through au-\ntomatic ﬂight control when the helicopter is equipped\
    \ with algorithms for ground detection,\nobstacle detection and avoidance, and\

    \ using these FBP systems faces the challenge of instability\nduring motion and\
    \ weather changes, which cause occlusion and mal-alignment in the\nimages. This\
    \ is partially addressed by using proximal sensing at slower speeds in order to\n\
    improve image resolution (although this limits the areal coverage in one ﬂight\
    \ and does\nnot fully solve the misalignment). Data processing for this data has\
    \ signiﬁcantly improved\nin recent years with AI-enabled snapshot and line scanning\
    \ imaging software, optimized\nspeciﬁcally for unmanned aircraft such as structure-from-motion\
    \ photogrammetry [87,116].\nOne approach that has been proposed to enhance the\
    \ application of these platforms for\nsensing in ﬁeld conditions is adapting ﬁeld\
    \ conditions to align with the HTP ﬁeld tech-\nniques (rather than the traditional\
    \ approach of adapting the instruments for the ﬁeld),\ndepending on the crop of\
    \ interest without compromising the realistic crop evaluation in\nﬁeld conditions\
    \ [6].\n5. Phenotyping Communities and Facilities\nThe growth in plant phenotyping\
    \ research coupled with the integration of AI tech-\nnology has fostered the development\
    \ of laboratories and centers equipped with high-\nthroughput phenotyping technologies.\
    \ Some of these plant phenotyping centers are\nmembers of the International Plant\
    \ Phenotyping Network (IPPN), which works with\nvarious member organizations in\
    \ academia and industry to distribute relevant information\nabout plant phenotyping\
    \ and increase its visibility [117]. Partner facilities such as the\nAustralian\
    \ Plant Phenomics Facility, a government-funded national facility, provide access\n\
    to infrastructure such as glass-house automation technologies, digital imaging\
    \ technologies,\nlong-term data storage, etc. [118]. Such facilities have and\
    \ continue to provide subsidized\naccess to advanced AI-phenotyping technologies\
    \ that would otherwise be inaccessible due\nto the costs of operation and maintenance.\
    \ In addition, as high-throughput phenotyping\nbecoming more common, there has\
    \ come the issue of data-merging with many laboratories\ngathering phenotypic\
    \ data that rarely enter the public domain where it could be accessed\nby other\
    \ institutions to foster interdisciplinary research [8]. Networks such as the\
    \ IPPN\ncontinue to provide access to phenotyping information generated by member\
    \ organiza-\ntions which is key in enabling cooperation between the organizations\
    \ and advancing the\nphenomics agenda through collaborative research.\nBesides\
    \ the academic institutions and government organizations, private industry\ncompanies\
    \ (a few of which have been highlighted here) are establishing themselves as\n\
    key providers and facilitators of plant phenotyping AI technology around the world.\
    \ Bio-\npute technology provides high-end research instruments such as multispectral\
    \ cameras\nfor ﬁeld phenotyping, drones for aerial photography, and provides after-sales\
    \ support\nservices to their customers. In partnership with universities and research\
    \ institutes, Bio-\npute provides innovations that are contributing to the progress\
    \ of plant phenotyping\nin China (http://www.bjbiopute.cn, accessed on 1 June\
    \ 2021). KeyGene is an agricul-\ntural biotechnology company providing tools for\
    \ precision breeding and digital pheno-\ntyping investing in deep learning-based\
    \ algorithms and virtual reality for data visual-\nization (https://www.keygene.com,\
    \ accessed on 1 June 2021). PhenoTrait Technology\nSensors 2021, 21, 4363\n14\
    \ of 19\nCo., Ltd. mainly focuses on plant phenotyping using the photosynthesis\
    \ characteris-\ntics of plants and promoting the use of phenotyping technologies\
    \ to improve crop qual-\nity, crop yield, and environmental conditions in China.\
    \ Some of their products include\nhigh-throughput phenotyping instruments, chlorophyll\
    \ ﬂuorescence imaging systems, etc.\n(http://www.phenotrait.com, accessed on 1\
    \ June 2021). Photon Systems Instruments (PSI)\nis a company in the Czech Republic\
    \ that also supplies a range of phenotyping systems,\nboth ﬁeld and laboratory-based,\
    \ including root system phenotyping. They have also in-\ncorporated machine learning\
    \ to integrate robotics into the systems they develop to better\nautomate the\
    \ processes (https://psi.cz, accessed 1 June 2021).\n6. Conclusions\nRecent advancements\
    \ in high-throughput phenotyping technologies have led to signif-\nicant strides\
    \ in plant phenomics. The on-going integration of artiﬁcial intelligence into\
    \ these\ntechnologies promises progression into smarter and much faster technologies\
    \ with signiﬁ-\ncantly lower input costs. In the area of phenotyping image data\
    \ analysis, the integration\nof AI into the data management pipeline of tomography\
    \ and thermography is on a lower\nscale in comparison to the other imaging techniques.\
    \ The application of deep learning in\nthe data analysis of these techniques is\
    \ promising, as it has been successfully implemented\nin analysis of composite\
    \ materials [88] and medical diagnostics [94]. As much as ﬁeld\nphenotyping is\
    \ the most effective way to collect phenotypic data, it is still being conducted\n\
    on a relatively lower scale than is possible. Artiﬁcial intelligence technologies\
    \ also require\nlarge amounts of data from various sources to improve their accuracy.\
    \ This provides an\nopportunity to invest more into the tailoring of current technologies\
    \ for ﬁeld data collection\nand the utilization of already existing AI adaptable\
    \ technologies, such as smartphones, to\nincrease the quantity of quality data.\
    \ Smartphones have become widespread consumer\nproducts, and the simplicity and\
    \ ease of use of their sensors suggest that their use can be\nexplored in agriculture\
    \ [104]. Some of the challenges that would need to be addressed are\nthat advanced\
    \ signal processing on smartphones has to cope with constraints such as low\n\
    battery life, restricted computational power, or limited bandwidth [104]. The\
    \ use of citizen\nscience alongside professional researchers [119] in data collection\
    \ also has the potential\nto aid in increasing the amount of data collected. The\
    \ overall goal of employing these\napproaches and technologies is to provide the\
    \ infrastructure that allows for tracking how\nplant traits progress throughout\
    \ the growing season and facilitate the coordination of data\nanalysis, management,\
    \ and utilization of results using AI methods.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Green Chemistry  Conversion of lignin pyrolysis oil to cyclohexyl methyl ethers
    as a promising biomass-derived solvent† Sohaib Haseeb,a   Jesse R. Vanderveen,
    a   Devni Elamaldeniya, a   Jesse Harris,ab   Kyle J. Boniface,a   Roland Lee,
    c   Pascale Champagne bd  and  Philip G. Jessop *a   Author affiliations  Abstract
    A mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers was prepared from Kraft lignin pyrolysis
    oil for use as a biomass-derived aliphatic solvent. Using Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic
    parameters, it was determined that the solvent mixture is somewhat more basic
    and polar than cyclopentyl methyl ether. Neither the biomass-derived solvent nor
    pure cyclohexyl methyl ether formed any detectable peroxides in 12 weeks of exposure
    to air, even though THF formed peroxides rapidly under such conditions. This mixture
    can be used as a biomass-derived aliphatic ether solvent and as a potential replacement
    for THF, dioxane, ethyl acetate, acetone and 2-butanone. Introduction Lignocellulose
    is the most abundant biomass available for use as a renewable feedstock for the
    synthesis of chemical products.1 All three components of lignocellulose: lignin,
    cellulose, and hemicellulose are being explored as alternatives to fossil fuels
    as feedstocks for preparation of a wide variety of materials such as fuels, polymers
    and value-added chemicals.1 These three components can be separated from each
    other by various methods.2,3–6 Lignin, the second-most abundant component in lignocellulose
    after cellulose,7,8 is the main byproduct of the conventional pulp and paper industry.7
    However, currently, the main use of lignin is as a low-grade energy source.8 Holladay
    et al. (2007) pointed out that overall revenue could be increased from $12 billion
    to $35 billion if lignin were used to produce value-added chemicals and transportation
    fuel, rather than power.8 However, lignin is a complex, cross-linked, and non-repeating
    polymer that can require extensive processing before it can be used for a particular
    application or treatment. Pyrolysis of lignin produces a complex liquid mixture,
    primarily of phenols, called lignin pyrolysis oil (LPO).9–11 There are two general
    strategies for making chemical products from this oil. First, one can separate
    LPO into individual compounds, at significant expense, and then sell those compounds
    as specialty chemicals. A historical example is the production of vanillin from
    lignin, which is no longer practiced. The second option is to use the LPO or fractions
    thereof as mixtures, without separating the individual compounds. This second
    strategy is less expensive, but the products can only be used in lower-value applications
    where mixtures, rather than pure compounds, are acceptable. The only product that
    is currently commercially produced from LPO, smoke flavouring, is an example of
    this second strategy. Different approaches have been proposed to extract phenols
    from LPO. Solvent extraction is a technique extensively used to separate phenolic
    compounds from pyrolysis oil, as a mixture.12 Steam distillation separates phenols
    at a lower temperature than their normal boiling points.13 However, the temperature
    of 105 °C was still found to be too high for thermally sensitive pyrolysis oil,
    and further separation was required because the concentration of phenols in the
    distillate was relatively low.13 Molecular distillation can be used to extract
    thermally unstable materials. However, the method requires expensive equipment
    and high vacuum, which makes it cost-prohibitive.14–16 Our group has reported
    a supercritical fluid rectification (SFR) method for separating single ring phenols
    from the heavier components of lignin pyrolysis oil (LPO).10,11 In the same study,
    isothermal supercritical CO2 extraction was also shown to be effective, although
    not quite as selective. The resulting mixtures of single ring phenols can be methylated
    to make polar aprotic solvents (aromatic ethers) as substitutes for petroleum-derived
    aromatic solvents like toluene, xylene, and anisole.11 There is also a need for
    bio-derived aliphatic ether solvents to replace petroleum-derived aliphatic ethers
    such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Such solvents are not only unsustainable
    but are prone to forming dangerous peroxides over time.17,18 Here we report the
    conversion of LPO into a mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers that can serve as
    a biomass-derived aliphatic ether solvent. The composition, Kamlet–Taft properties,
    and risk of peroxide formation of the mixture are reported. This mixture may be
    used as a renewably-sourced alternative to fossil-derived low to medium polarity
    solvents, in applications or formulations where a pure single-compound solvent
    is not required. Such applications may include inks, adhesives, cleaning solvents,
    and paint stripper. Moreover, both the aromatic and aliphatic ether mixtures can
    be used as oxygenates for gasoline or diesel. Several ethers such as ethyl tert-butyl
    ether, tert-amyl ethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, and tert-amyl methyl ether
    have been shown to impart excellent fuel properties.19 Ethers are preferred due
    to their high octane numbers and cause less pollution, because they do not contain
    sulfur and produce lower levels of carbon monoxide when they burn.19 Results and
    discussion The conversion of LPO to aliphatic ethers was envisioned as a process
    involving three steps which could, theoretically, be performed in any sequence:
    (1) methylation of the phenolic components of LPO, (2) isolation of the single-ring
    compounds from the heavier components, and (3) hydrogenation of the aromatic rings
    (Scheme 1). This particular sequence was chosen for two reasons. First, the rectification
    method developed by the Jessop group11 and used in this study is selective for
    single ring aromatic ethers and guaiacols, but rejects catechols and multi-ring
    compounds. Because catechols are anticipated to be a constituent of the LPO that
    could be converted to cyclohexyl methyl ethers, it is desirable to methylate the
    catechols to veratroles prior to rectification in order to obtain greater yields
    of anisoles/veratroles from the rectification step. Second, it is beneficial to
    remove unwanted material earlier in the process to avoid consuming reagents unnecessarily
    and to decrease the likelihood of unwanted side reactions. For that reason, the
    rectification step was performed prior to the hydrogenation step. Scheme 1 The
    synthetic route for converting LPO into cyclohexyl methyl ethers. Methylation
    and supercritical fluid rectification of LPO The phenolic groups present in LPO
    were methylated using stoichiometric amounts of 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene
    (DBU) and an excess of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as both solvent and methylating
    agent. This methylation procedure was first tested on several individual compounds
    that are known10 to exist in LPO, including phenol, guaiacol, catechol, and eugenol;
    these model compounds were all successfully methylated with yields in excess of
    95% (Table S1†). The crude isolated product after methylation of the LPO retained
    97% of the mass of the LPO. The crude product was then purified by SFR. The SFR
    procedure involves extracting the lighter components from the LPO using supercritical
    CO2 (scCO2) and passing the scCO2 solution up a progressively hotter steel column
    packed with small steel rings.11 The rectification process produces a mixture
    of aromatic single ring ethers which we refer to as lignin oil methyl ethers (LOME).
    The composition of LOME was determined by GC-MS (Table S2†). The compounds were
    identified using standards and by comparing mass spectra with spectra in the NIST
    MS Library.20 4-Methyl veratrole, veratrole, 4-ethyl veratrole, 2,3-dimethylanisole
    and 4-ethylveratrole were the major components in the LOME mixture (Table S2†),
    which matches the observations of Mudraboyina et al.11 Hydrogenation of rectified
    ethers A procedure for the hydrogenation of LOME was developed using veratrole
    as a model reactant. Catalysts and conditions were screened to identify a procedure
    that would provide a high conversion of veratrole to 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane
    (Table 1). Table 1 Hydrogenation catalyst and conditions screened for the heterogeneously

    90 10 a 24 h reaction. b Veratrole (0.1 g) was dissolved in hexanes (3 ml). Solvent-free
    conditions were used for all the other trials. Initially, different catalysts
    were screened for the hydrogenation at 80 °C (entries 1–5). Using Rh(5%)/C (entry
    2) resulted in a nearly complete reaction of veratrole with 84% yield of the desired
    product 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane. Hydrogenations using other catalysts all had
    large quantities (25–75%) of unreacted veratrole remaining after the reaction
    time. Each catalyst, including Rh(5%)/C, also produced cyclohexyl methyl ether
    as a byproduct. Although this demethoxylation was an unanticipated side reaction,
    cyclohexyl methyl ether would be a welcome component in the aliphatic ether mixture
    we are trying to produce and is likely to also be produced from the methylation
    and hydrogenation of the phenol present in LPO. Further demethoxylation to cyclohexane
    was negligible. Based on the results, Rh(5%)/C was identified as the best catalyst
    of those tested. Hydrogenations of pure veratrole were carried out next using
    Rh(5%)/C under different conditions in an attempt to limit the formation of side
    products (entries 6–11). Reactions at lower temperatures or H2 pressures all had
    unreacted veratrole present, even after extended reaction times. Solvent-free
    conditions were used for the initial reactions. When hexanes was used as the solvent,27,28
    conversion of veratrole to 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane improved, even if the temperature
    was lowered to 50 °C, and apart from cyclohexyl methyl ether, negligible amounts
    of side products or unreacted veratrole were present (entry 11). The combined
    yield of the 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and cyclohexyl methyl ether was >99%. Therefore,
    the conditions described in entry 11 were selected as the conditions to be used
    for LOME hydrogenation. Prior to LOME hydrogenation, a desulfurization step is
    required to prevent catalyst poisoning. Sulfur is present as an impurity in Kraft
    lignin. Even after rectification, approx. 1 wt% sulfur was present in the LOME
    according to elemental analysis. Attempts at hydrogenation without prior desulfurization
    were not successful. The sulfur was removed using a RANEY® nickel slurry in alkaline
    water following the procedure described by Field et al.21 No sulfur was detected
    by elemental analysis after the RANEY® nickel wash. LOME prepared from raw lignocellulose
    or from lignin separated without use of sulfur-containing reagents would presumably
    not require this desulfurization step. Hydrogenation of LOME was performed using
    the best conditions identified for veratrole (entry 11) in Table 1 and the major
    compounds were identified by comparing mass spectra with spectra in the NIST MS
    Library.20 Methoxycyclohexane, 1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and 1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane
    were identified. The hydrogenated lignin oil methyl ethers (HLOME) were analyzed
    by 1H (Fig. S1†), 13C (Fig. S2†), DEPT 135 (Fig. S3†) NMR and IR (Fig. S4†) spectroscopy.
    It is difficult to determine whether the methylation was complete using NMR spectroscopy.
    However, the IR spectrum of HLOME has a broad peak around 3500 cm−1, which has
    a weaker absorbance intensity than cyclohexanol. This suggests the presence of
    some unreacted hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR spectrum shows that all peaks corresponding
    to aromatic protons have disappeared (the 13C {1H} NMR spectrum confirms this).
    In the 1H NMR spectrum the peaks at 3.1–4.3 ppm correspond to methoxy and methoxymethine
    protons and the peaks at 0.8–2.1 ppm corresponds to aliphatic protons. Kamlet–Taft
    properties of lignin-derived ethers Kamlet–Taft solvatochromic parameters are
    the most comprehensive measure of solvent properties.22,23 Mathematical combinations
    of these parameters can be used to predict the solvent effect on a variety of
    parameters such as solubility, rate constants, equilibrium constants and spectral
    frequencies.23 Compounds with similar Kamlet–Taft parameters are likely to perform
    similarly as solvents. Therefore, these parameters can be used to determine which
    non-renewably sourced solvents could potentially be replaced by HLOME. Polarity/polarizability
    (π*) and hydrogen bond accepting ability (β) were calculated from the UV/visible
    absorption maxima of 4-nitroanisole and 4-nitroaniline dissolved in the solvent.22
    Taft and coworkers assigned an α (hydrogen bond donating ability) value of 0.00
    for ethers,23 therefore, we assumed that the hydrogen bond donating ability of
    HLOME is negligible. However, the presence of a small amount of unreacted hydroxyl
    groups could give the HLOME some hydrogen bond donating ability. π* is the ability
    of the solvent to stabilize a charge or dipole moment and is therefore high for
    polar or polarizable solvents. HLOME has a π* value of 0.57, lower than anisole
    (0.73), because the aromaticity of anisole increases its polarizability. The π*
    of HLOME is slightly higher than that of cyclopentyl methyl ether (0.42). The
    hydrogen bond accepting ability (β) of HLOME is 0.75. It is unsurprisingly larger
    than anisole (0.22) and somewhat larger than cyclopentyl methyl ether (0.53).
    Aromatic ethers like anisole are known to be much weaker bases than their aliphatic
    counterparts. However, the difference between the β value of the ether mixture
    and cyclopentyl methyl ether was unexpected and may be due to the presence of
    1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and other more complex structures. Such components in
    the mixture may also explain the higher π*. Peroxide formation in lignin-derived
    ethers A serious safety concern regarding the use of aliphatic ethereal solvents
    is their potential to form explosive organic peroxides over time. For this reason,
    ethers are often discarded after 3 or 12 months even if they have been spiked
    with inhibitors to slow down peroxide formation.6 Nevertheless, explosions due
    to peroxide formation in ethers still occur. Ethers that have low tendencies to
    form peroxides, such as tert-butyl methyl ether24 and cyclopentyl methyl ether,18
    have safety advantages over other ethers and their use is preferred even though
    they are fossil-fuel derived. The rate of peroxidation of methoxycyclohexane,
    a major component of the HLOME, was compared to that of tetrahydrofuran and cyclopentyl
    methyl ether under air to determine whether methoxycyclohexane and, by extension,
    HLOME, are dangerously prone to peroxidation. The ethers were purified, placed
    in 3 amber vials per solvent under air, and stored in a solvent cabinet for a
    period of 12 weeks to allow peroxides to form. A sample of HLOME mixture was also
    placed in an amber vial and stored under the same conditions. All samples were
    opened and exposed to fresh air once per week. After the 12-week period, the solvents
    were quantitatively tested for peroxide content by iodometry. The results (Table
    2) show that tetrahydrofuran forms peroxides much more quickly than cyclopentyl
    methyl ether. This result is in agreement with the report by Watanabe et al.18
    Additionally, no peroxides were detected in either HLOME or cyclohexyl methyl
    ether by iodometry. Therefore, cyclohexyl methyl ether and HLOME have a very low
    tendency to form peroxides, evidently lower than cyclopentyl methyl ether. Table

    solvents are used in large quantities in industrial processes and products such
    as coatings, paint stripper, cleaning solutions, adhesives, and inks. In many
    such applications there is no requirement that the solvent be a single pure compound.
    The volume of solvent usage in such applications greatly exceeds the volume of
    solvents used as media for chemical synthesis. Replacing petroleum-derived organic
    solvents with bio-derived solvents could make solvent usage more environmentally
    sustainable, but only if the bio-derived solvents do not introduce new health
    and environmental concerns. To this end, we compared the health and environmental
    effects of HLOME to THF, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), cyclopentyl methyl
    ether and methoxycyclohexane in Table 3. Health and environmental effects can
    be compared using experimental or computationally-predicted values such as LD50
    or using GHS (globally harmonized system) classifications. The latter approach
    will be used here. Table 3 Health and environmental impacts of THF, cyclopentyl

    d HLOME is a complex mixture with some batch-to-batch variability in composition
    and therefore liquid range. However, the boiling point of HLOME is assumed to
    be greater than or equal to that of its most volatile component, methoxycyclohexane.
    Similarly, the melting point is estimated as that of methyoxycyclohexane. e Solubility

    the EPA test program for the major components of HLOME. Conventional aliphatic
    ether solvents have significant disadvantages. For example, THF has a low flashpoint,
    strong tendency to form peroxides, high miscibility in water resulting in difficult
    solvent recovery, high energy requirement for manufacture18,25 and is fossil-derived.
    MeTHF is a biomass-derived alternative to THF. However, it also has drawbacks
    such as low flash point, rapid peroxide formation, and difficult recovery from
    water.18 Cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME)18,26–28 is a greener and much safer alternative
    to THF. It has preferable characteristics such as a narrow explosion range, wide
    liquidity range, low rate of formation of peroxides, higher flash point and low
    solubility in water, but it is manufactured from fossil fuels. Ethereal solvents
    that, like CPME, do not form peroxides at a significant rate are particularly
    needed in applications where they may be exposed to oxidants.26,27 Because we
    do not have information about the health hazards of HLOME, we had to make some
    assumptions. First, we assumed that HLOME is no more flammable than its most volatile
    component, cyclohexyl methyl ether. However, flammability is the only hazard class
    measured for cyclohexyl methyl ether. As for the acute toxicity of HLOME, we list
    the GHS code that corresponds to the lowest of the predicted LD50 (rat, oral)
    values predicted by the EPA TEST program for the major components of the mixture.
    We therefore predict that HLOME should have acute toxicity and flammability comparable
    to other aliphatic ethers. HLOME is bioderived and has a very low peroxide formation
    rate. Currently, HLOME mixture has a high energy requirement for manufacture,
    in part because it was prepared on a gram scale. A fully developed, optimized,
    and scaled manufacturing process would likely have lower energy requirements.
    Conclusions A mixture of cyclohexyl methyl ethers (“HLOME”) was prepared from
    lignin pyrolysis oil via methylation, supercritical rectification, and catalytic
    hydrogenation. The final mixture was composed primarily of methoxycyclohexane,
    1,2-dimethoxycyclohexane and 1,3-dimethoxycyclohexane. The cyclohexyl methyl ether
    mixture can be used as a solvent or oxygenate fuel additive. The Kamlet–Taft solvent
    properties of the mixture indicate that it is a suitable alternative to THF, dioxane,
    ethyl acetate, acetone and 2-butanone. Furthermore, the solvent does not form
    peroxides rapidly compared to cyclopentyl methyl ether and especially THF. For
    these reasons, HLOME can be considered a bioderived and safer alternative to petroleum
    derived ethereal solvents or as a fuel oxygenate. Now that the proof of concept
    has been achieved, future work will include the development of a more efficient
    conversion of lignin to HLOME, including the use of sulfur-free lignin so that
    the RANEY® nickel step becomes unnecessary, and a search for reaction conditions
    and methods to decrease the amount of reagents required to generate HLOME. Additionally,
    LOME and HLOME will be evaluated for various practical applications in which they
    could replace more harmful or less sustainable liquids. Experimental methods Softwood

    and finally ramped at 20 °C min−1 to 320 °C, with a dwell time of 3 min. NMR spectra
    were acquired using a Bruker 400.30 MHz spectrometer. UV/visible spectra were
    acquired using an Agilent 8453 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. IR spectra were acquired
    using a Bruker Alpha spectrometer. Methylation of LPO The methylation reactions
    were performed by a modification of the method reported by Mudraboyina et al.11
    LPO (25.54 g), dimethyl carbonate (125 ml), and DBU (31.25 ml) were combined in
    a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and a reflux condenser. The
    mixture was refluxed in an oil bath heated to 120 °C and stirred at 450 rpm overnight
    (approx. 20 h). Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature (22–25
    °C). The dimethyl carbonate was removed under reduced pressure. The remaining
    mixture was dissolved in 750 mL ethyl acetate and the resulting solution was washed
    with 3 × 150 mL 1 M aqueous HCl and then 3 × 150 mL brine. The organic phase was
    dried with Na2SO4 and decanted to remove the solids. Finally, the ethyl acetate
    was removed under reduced pressure to afford the methylated LPO with 97% retention
    of mass. Supercritical fluid rectification of methylated LPO The SFR of methylated
    LPO was performed by a modification of the procedure reported earlier.11 The methylated
    LPO sample (24.7 g) was placed into the 160 ml stainless steel reactor vessel
    which was then heated to 40 °C. The CO2 was chilled prior to entering the pump
    by a cooling jacket filled with 1 : 1 v : v ethylene glycol/water mixture maintained
    at a temperature of −11 °C. Liquid CO2 at a pressure of 8 MPa was passed through
    the liquid in the vessel at a flow rate of 8 ml min−1 and up through a rectification
    column packed with Dixon rings. The column had a temperature gradient of 37–95
    °C from bottom to top. The temperature gradient was established by heating the
    column in six different temperature zones with heating tape (37 °C, 43 °C, 56
    °C, 69 °C, 82 °C and 95 °C). A back-pressure regulator, connected to the top of
    the column was set to maintain a pressure of 8 MPa and was heated to 55 °C. A
    250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 75 mL acetone was placed under the outlet to
    collect the rectified material after the CO2 had vapourized. After 5 h, the contents
    of the Erlenmeyer flask were transferred to a 250 mL round bottom flask and the
    acetone was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the rectified, methylated
    LPO. The extract weighed 3.12 g (12.6% yield relative to the mass of methylated
    LPO). The composition of the mixture was analyzed by GC-MS. Hydrogenation of rectified
    ethers The sulfur present in LPO was removed using a RANEY® nickel slurry in alkaline
    water following the procedure described by Field et al.21 The RANEY® nickel (15.1
    g) was added to a 500 ml flask containing rectified ethers (3.12 g) and 210 ml
    of 7 : 3 acetone : H2O solution. The mixture was refluxed in an oil bath for 7
    h. Afterwards, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The Ni was removed
    by gravity filtration and acetone was removed under vacuum. Rectified ethers were
    extracted with 125 ml of hexanes, dried with Na2SO4, and filtered to remove solids.
    Then the hexanes were evaporated under reduced pressure to afford a mixture of
    rectified desulfurized ether (1.82 g, 7.4%). The rectified and desulfurized ethers
    (1.82 g) were then dissolved in 54 mL hexanes and placed in a 100 ml glass insert
    with 0.182 g of 5% Rh/C and a stir bar. The vial was placed in a stainless-steel
    vessel, which was flushed 5 times with H2 to remove oxygen, then heated to 50
    °C and pressurized to 60 bar with H2. The mixture was stirred at 500 rpm for 24
    h. Then, the vessel was cooled to room temperature and depressurized. The contents
    of the vial were passed through a Celite filter to remove the Rh/C and then the
    hexanes were evaporated using a rotary evaporator to afford hydrogenated ether
    mixture HLOME (1.37 g, 5.5%). Kamlet–Taft measurements The π* of HLOME was calculated
    from the average wavelength of maximum absorbance of solutions of 4-nitroanisole
    in HLOME at three different concentrations giving absorbances between 0.5 and
    2.5. The π* was then calculated from that average wavelength using eqn (1).22
    π* = 14.57 − 4270/λmax, OMe (1) Similarly, the β of HLOME was calculated from
    the average wavelength of maximum absorbance of solutions of 4-nitroaniline in
    HLOME at four different concentrations having absorbances between 0.3 and 1.6.
    The β value was then calculated from that average wavelength using eqn (2).22
    β = 11.134 − 3580/λmax,NH2 − 1.125π* (2) Peroxidation measurements Tetrahydrofuran
    was dried and stripped of inhibitor by refluxing over sodium benzophenone followed
    by distillation. Cyclopentyl methyl ether was purified by distillation. Cyclohexyl
    methyl ether was prepared from anisole using the hydrogenation procedure described
    above and purified by distillation. A portion of ethereal solvent was placed in
    a 20 ml dram amber vial under air. The vial was stored in a solvent cabinet with
    the lid firmly screwed on. All samples were opened and exposed to fresh air once
    a week. On the 12th week, the peroxide content was quantitatively determined by
    iodometry following the procedure described in Fábos et al.35 The peroxide content
    of HLOME was measured once and the average peroxide content in three samples were
    taken for other solvents. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest

    Water information and data bases are used for addressing environmental, physical,
    social, political, economic, and ecological issues of water supply, consumption,
    availability, and accessibility. Different disciplines of water resources management,
    such as flood risk assessment, water supply management, reservoir operation, and
    water sanitation require incorporation of different types of water information
    for efficient planning and decision making. Therefore, this chapter aims to investigate
    the main features of water information, data sources, water data challenges, water
    data processing, analysis and dissemination which also play a key role in integrated
    and sustainable water resources management. This chapter begins with an introduction
    to the importance of data and information in various water disciplines as well
    as indication of data life cycle. Thereafter, different types of water data and
    sources (measurements, models, remote sensing, and administrative institutes)
    are proposed. Additionally, the challenges and limitation of water data, such
    as poor data quality, lack of integrated water portals, limited funds, and big
    data problems are discussed. This section is followed by indication of water data
    processing key points and steps of water data dissemination. Additionally, the
    World Hydrological Cyclone Observing System (WHYCOS), Global Runoff Data Centre
    (GRDC), and Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) are introduced as examples of important
    water data systems which improve development in delivery and use of water data,
    and evaluation of environmental impacts and risks. Finally, the chapter revealed
    recommendations to improve water data information and portals for the purpose
    of efficient water resources planning and management. Keywords Water data Measurements

    © 2021 3.1 Introduction Limited access to safe water, sanitation, and increased
    demand threatens human health, environmental sustainability, and economic growth,
    while leading to poor water security and supply. The increasing pressure on water
    resources is the result of global drivers such as rapid population growth, industrialisation,
    inefficient water management, water pollution, climate change, serious imbalance
    between supply and demand, but also poor water data (World Bank 2018). Therefore,
    water security, reliable water supply, as well as environment and ecosystem protection
    are directly dependant on the level of efficiency, integration, and sustainability
    of water resources management. Data and information are denoted as the “life blood”
    of a research with the purpose of efficient water management and decision making.
    Hence, data is the foundation for well-informed decisions and sustainability that
    is required by all decision makers. Water data, or in other words measurements,
    is a key element in water resources management projects and planning. Water information
    is generated from water data through a process of analysis, integration, and interpretation.
    In other words, water information is the processed and synthesized form of water
    data. The generated water information should be combined with infrastructure and
    institution in order to reach an efficient water resources planning and management
    for both the current and uncertain future periods (Cantor et al. 2018). Different
    water management disciplines, such as the flood response, drought management,
    water supply systems, reservoir operations, water sanitation, groundwater management,
    and irrigation supply require incorporation of different types of water information
    for better decision making and water planning. Thus, decision makers and water
    organizations need to access water information with proper spatial and temporal
    resolution (Cantor et al. 2018). Additionally, provision of sound data with proper
    quality is essential as it can affect the decisions and management strategies.
    However, there have been debates among organizations and water sector participants
    that some provided data do not meet the need of water users. Additionally, some
    water information is not shared openly. Despite the development of technology
    and modern measuring devices, there are still many gaps in available water data,
    and the quality of some water information is also still unacceptable (BOM 2017).
    Therefore, unmet data needs can interfere the efficient and sustainable water
    management. Figure 3.1 indicates the data life cycle (NSF DataONE project 2017)
    and the required steps from the data need evaluation to the data application.
    The main nine steps of the data life cycle are as follow: Fig. 3.1 Data life cycle
    (Adopted from NSF DataONE Project 2017) Full size image Data need evaluation and
    planning: needs of decision makers are fully evaluated; Data collection: observations
    are performed; Data quality assurance: checks and inspections are required to
    analyse the data quality; Data description and documentation: data should be accurately
    described using the metadata standards and guidelines; Data preservation and archival:
    data should be preserved in a specific archive (e.g., data service and data centre);
    Data discovery: both useful and relevant data information should be obtained;
    Data integration: data from different sources should be combined; Data analysis:
    data should be interpreted; and Data release planning: data should be described,
    managed, and made accessible. Globally, water data and information is essential
    for sustainable planning, policy, management, and prediction. Additionally, water
    data provides decision makers with proper information about water demand, weather
    patterns, hydrologic modelling, infrastructure needs, climate change, and extreme
    events. This book chapter examines the important role of water data and information
    in integrated water resources management. It also provides an in-depth understanding
    of different water data types, sources, challenges, processing, and dissemination,
    which are essential for sustainable planning, policy, management, prediction,
    and decision making. Thereafter, examples of two international information systems
    (WHYCOS and GRDC) and a national water portal (BOM) are proposed to indicate how
    water data organisation can enhance climate trend analysis, water information
    products and services, and sustainable protection of water resources systems through
    regional and international cooperation. Finally, conclusions summarizes focal
    points of this work, and recommendations are proposed to help stakeholders discover
    and overcome limitations of current water data. 3.2 Water Data Type Water data
    is a set of information that can address issues associated with physical, environmental,
    social, economic, ecological, biological, chemical, cultural, and political parameters
    in disciplines such as water use, availability, and accessibility. Additionally,
    water data can consist of a complex mix of different formats, including spreadsheets,
    satellite images, geospatial databases, and photographs (Laituri and Sternlieb
    2014). Generally, water data can be classified in two main categories: (1) Primary
    data and (2) secondary data. Primary data indicates the collection of raw data,
    including the data collected through measurements by technician and/or automated
    sensors. Measurements of water quality parameters, streamflow and precipitation
    are examples of primary data. Secondary data are obtained from models, specific
    methods, and lab experiments under controlled condition. Typically, models and
    methods apply primary data from different sources to compile and analyse them
    for estimating a variable. For instance, precipitation pattern, streamflow condition,
    irrigated area, and crop data can be combined through a model or method to estimate
    the agriculture water demand (Ziman 2016). Climatological models, hydrological
    models, processed remote sensing data or satellite images are some examples of
    secondary data (Laituri and Sternlieb 2014). In addition to these classes of water
    data, 12 extensive groups of water data can be developed based on disciplines
    or sectors where water data is applied (BOM 2017). Detailed classifications of
    water data with respective examples are shown in Table 3.1. Table 3.1 Water data
    types together with data sources and examples Full size table All the stated data
    are essential for efficient decision making in different water disciplines, including
    the sectorial water management, integrated water sector planning, climate change
    adaptation, global and regional reporting, as well as operational and emergency
    management. Additionally, the type of required data for a specific project relies
    on the type of activity and plans. For instance, a flood inundation project will
    not require the same data as a peak flood prediction project. Additionally, the
    temporal and spatial resolution of the required water data should be specified
    for each project. For instance, the hourly river flow is generally applicable
    to peak flow prediction, and estimation of flash flood peak flows requires even
    higher temporal river flow resolution (e.g., minutes), while the daily river streamflow
    is required for analysis of river flow due to changes in land use pattern. Thus,
    the researchers and managers are required to consider the required data type and
    resolution from the beginning of a project. 3.2.1 Water Data Source Different
    distinct types of water data are required to determine water quality and quantity
    to achieve efficient integrated water resources management. Water data is obtained
    through different sources and methods. Basically, the water data comes from four
    sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and (4) administrative
    institutes (BOM 2017). Each of the stated sources will be discussed in the next
    four sections. 3.2.1.1 In Situ Measurements Water resources management constitutes
    a data-driven discipline, which involves consistent measurements of water quantity
    and quality. The measurements are mainly concerned with monitoring meteorological
    and hydrological variables (BOM 2017). In order to measure water variables, including
    physical, chemical, and biological parameters, specific methods and instruments
    are applied. For example, water level can be measured using different techniques
    such as a float and shaft encoder, a radar or an ultrasonic level sensor (NIWA
    2019), turbidity by determining the intensity of light scattered by suspended
    particles in the water column (EHMP 2006–07), and biological contamination using
    E. coli concentration as a marker (Edberg et al. 2000). In addition to the variables
    which come from direct measurement, some other variables are calculated according
    to a mathematical transformation of a direct measurement. For instance, river
    discharge is computed by multiplying the water area in a channel cross section
    by the water average velocity in that cross section (BOM 2017). In situ measurements
    can yield the most reliable water data, provided that the measuring devices are
    precise and properly calibrated. The restriction of direct measurements is the
    high cost of purchasing, installing, calibrating, fixing, and maintaining the
    measuring devices and equipment. Additionally, regular monitoring should be conducted
    periodically to obtain the proper data length and spatial coverage, and therefore,
    constant financial support and effort are required to manage the long and intensive
    monitoring programs (BOM 2017). Due to the discussed high costs, many poor countries
    suffer from improper and inadequate water data, which can directly affect the
    water management planning and strategies. This issue necessitates the provision
    of financial support by international agencies and organizations to improve the
    water monitoring networks in poor countries dealing with critical water supply
    and management problems. 3.2.1.2 Remote Sensing In 1957, the Sputnik 1 was the
    first artificial earth satellite that placed into orbit. This satellite had significant
    impact on humanity’s perception of space, and announcing a new era if earth observation.
    After launching the Sputnik 1, several systems (e.g., Television and InfraRed
    Observation Satellite (TIROS 1), Nimbus 1 etc.) were launched in the following
    year to weather and climate conditions. Such satellite missions led to dramatic
    advances in remote observations and measurements (McCabe et al. 2017). Remote
    sensing refers to the process of inferring surface parameters, which are derived
    from measurements of the emitted/reflected electromagnetic radiations, from the
    land surface (Schmugge et al. 2002). The application of remote sensing in hydrological
    sciences has provided new datasets with high temporal and spatial resolution for
    continuous water resources observations, which addresses the low resolution and
    expensive in situ measurements. Figure 3.2 indicates the earth observing system
    applied in hydrological sciences. The stated system consists of several components,
    signals of opportunity (e.g., cars, mobile phones), Doppler radar, mobile rovers,
    smart phone and citizens science (e.g., simple image capturing, plug-in and Bluetooth
    technologies), cell signals (e.g., antennas), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (e.g.,
    drones), research balloons, airborne vehicles, CubeStas, high definition (HD)
    videos, satellite missions (e.g., Landsat 1–8), sensors aboard the International
    Space Station (ISS), and geosynchronous meteorological satellites (McCabe et al.
    2017). Fig. 3.2 Earth observing system (Adopted from McCabe et al. 2017) Full
    size image There are two types of remote sensing instruments: i) active and ii)
    passive. These instruments are mounted on satellites, drones, vehicles, aircrafts,
    and ground-based structures to measure different water data parameters, such as
    soil moisture, evaporation, water temperature, rainfall rate, sediment concentration,
    flood inundation area, rainfall distribution, surface topography, wind speed and
    direction, cloud composition, and air humidity (BOM 2017). Active sensors provide
    their own source of energy for emitting radiation towards the investigated target,
    and then measure the time of arrival radiation reflected from the target. The
    majority of active sensors are able to perform in the microwave portion of the
    electromagnetic spectrum. Hence, these sensors can potentially penetrate the atmosphere
    under rough conditions. Laser altimeter, radar, Lidar, Ranging instrument, Scatterometer,
    and Sounder are examples of active sensors (NASA 2019). On the other hand, passive
    sensors detect natural energy (light wavelength) which is emitted or reflected
    from the observed scene. The common source of radiation measured by passive sensors
    is the reflected sunlight. Passive sensors include various types of spectrometers
    and radiometers. These sensors are able to perform in the infrared, visible, thermal
    infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Accelerometer,
    Hyperspectral Radiometer, Imaging Radiometer, Sounder, Spectrometer, and Spectroradiometer
    are some examples of passives sensors (NASA 2019). Remotely sensed data provides
    continuous spatial coverage and are typically presented in gridded form. The most
    temporally regular remotely sensed data set is obtained from satellites (BOM 2017).
    Since its advent in the 1960s, satellite remote sensing has been widely used as
    a complete source of information. Satellite sensors can measure almost all components
    of hydrological cycle, such as precipitation, evaporation, surface water, soil
    moisture, lake and river levels, surface and sub-surface water storage, and snow
    storage (Sheffield et al. 2018). However, satellites have relatively coarser spatial
    resolution than in situ measurements due to their large distance from the earth
    in relation to the resolution of the sensor and the attenuation effect of the
    atmosphere between the sensor and the observation point. Low earth orbiting satellites
    present much higher spatial resolution with lower temporal resolution (BOM 2017).
    The only issue that should be carefully considered in remote sensing is the requirement
    of significant information technology infrastructure for data management. Additionally,
    complex image processing tasks are needed to provide the data with suitable format
    (BOM 2017). In summary, remote sensing tools play an important role in improving
    water resources management through provision of large spatial and high temporal
    resolution. 3.2.1.3 Models In order to tackle the shortcomings and costs associated
    with in situ measurements and also to address the poor spatial support of in situ
    point measurements, different types of models and methods can be applied to generate
    water data. Modelling approaches are useful tools to address poor spatial support
    of in situ point measurements. For instance, required spatially distributed water
    surface elevations for flood magnitude, extent and timing estimations are derived
    from hydrodynamic models. Therefore, models and methods are applied for different
    purposes. For example, different rainfall-runoff models have been developed for
    generating the runoff data in ungauged catchments. Conceptual rainfall-runoff
    model applications such as Nedbor-Afstromings Model (NAM) (Makungo et al. 2010;
    Faiz et al. 2018; Zhen-lei et al. 2019), Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning
    (HBV) (Engeland and Hisdal 2009; Osuch et al. 2019), and The Hydrologic Engineering
    Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) (Gumindoga et al. 2017) are examples
    of model applications, which converts the rainfall to runoff in a defined catchment.
    In the field of water resources engineering, data-driven approaches have gained
    popularity for different water modelling purposes (Kim et al. 2013; Jahandideh-Tehrani
    et al. 2019; 2020a). Artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM),
    and random forest (RF) are few examples of data-driven approaches, which have
    been extensively applied in the area if water related modellings such as ground
    water level prediction (Daliakopoulos et al. 2005; Tsanis et al. 2008; Baudron
    et al. 2013), rainfall-runoff modelling (Daliakopoulos and Tsanis 2016; Berezowski
    and Chybicki 2018; Jahandideh-Tehrani et al. 2020b), reservoir operation (Niu
    et al. 2019; Ahmad and Hossain 2019), flood prediction (Zhou et al. 2019; Ahmadalipour
    and Moradkhani 2019). Some models are also used to extrapolate to past (e.g.,
    paleoclimate) and future conditions, such as climate models. Future precipitation,
    evaporation, wind, and temperature can be generated using different climate models,
    such as Hadley Center Coupled Model (HADCM3), Norwegian Erath System Model (NorESM),
    and The Fifth Version Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC5)
    (Randall et al. 2007). In order to summarize a large amount of information, specific
    approaches such as system dynamics (SD) are applied to analyse and interpret information.
    Using flow diagrams and feedback loops facilitate the analysis and conclusion
    for complex information (Ahmad and Simonovic 2004; Jahandideh Tehrani et al. 2014;
    Christias et al. 2020). In summary, models and methods are used for tasks, such
    as making predictions, data assimilation, and interpreting the large amount of
    complex information. The main limitation of applying models is the uncertainty
    resulting from models due to prior assumptions and scale issues. In water resources
    engineering field, analytical techniques (e.g., Mellin transform technique, and
    Fourier transform technique) and approximation techniques (e.g., first-order variance
    estimation (FOVE), probabilistic point estimation (PE) methods, and Monte-Carlo
    simulation) are the two main uncertainty analysis categories that can be applied
    to address hydrologic, hydraulic, structural, and economic uncertainties (Tung
    2011). Many researchers have discussed model uncertainty analysis and proposed
    methods to reduce the amount of uncertainty. For instance, Wagener and Wheater
    (2006) investigated the sources of uncertainty in a rainfall-runoff model by focusing
    on 10 catchments. They identified that the uncertainty is related to local modelling
    (process of selection and calibration of the local model structure) and regionalization
    procedures. To increase the accuracy of model results, many studies have focused
    on analysing uncertainty and reducing the vulnerability. Her et al. (2019) evaluated
    the associated uncertainties with multi GCMs in runoff and precipitation projections.
    In terms of adaptation planning for uncertain climate change impacts, evaluating
    the robust adaptation decisions to climate change uncertainties was studied by
    Dessai and Hulme (2007). They concluded that water resources are sensitive to
    regional climate response uncertainties in climate change impacts. Also, Fletcher
    et al. (2019) developed a new planning framework to evaluate climate uncertainty
    over time for flexible planning strategies. In summary, despite the wide applications
    of models in improving water data, research is still required to improve the accuracy
    of the model results. 3.2.1.4 Administrative Institutes Two types of data, including
    the water rights data and administrative data (mentioned in Table 3.1) are not
    obtained from measurements or models. Data such as water rights, water pricing,
    water infrastructure inventories, water demand in different economic activities,
    water ownership, and basin borders are basically recorded by water management
    agencies as part of their business purposes. Additionally, such data can be collected
    by conducting household and business surveys (BOM 2017). Water rights data and
    administrative data play a critical role in developing, proposing, and evaluating
    the water management strategies and policies as well as decision making. For instance,
    water system governance, which refers to the structure and administrative process,
    should direct and control operations, decision making, legislation, and finance
    as part of their tasks. Therefore, administrative data is required in order to
    determine operational standards and water regulations. A large number of agencies
    and organizations are involved in the establishment and administration of water
    rights in scale of regional, national and international scopes. In Europe, the
    Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the main foundation of European Union (EU)
    water policy that aims to ensure sustainable water use and protect aquatic systems
    through applying legislations to all surface waters (rivers, lakes, transitional
    and coastal waters) as well as groundwater (Carvalho et al. 2019). In Australia,
    the Department of Natural Resources and Mines is involved in water system administration
    in all states (Productivity Commission 2003). While different countries/regions/continents
    have their own administrative institutes to dictate water related policies (e.g.,
    water pricing, water ownerships, river borders, etc.), there are also international
    foundations, which deal with global water issues. For example, World Water Council
    is an international multi-stakeholder organization that enhance political action
    and awareness to deal with critical water issues through developing partnerships
    between countries (World Water Council 2020). Pacific Institute, Clean Water Action,
    and Water.org are other examples of global organizations that aim to solve water
    conflicts, promote legislation for water protection, and deal with water crisis.
    3.3 Key Characteristics of Water Data Type Different types of water data have
    their own characteristics and use. In other words, each type of water data should
    be applied for a specific purpose of water resources management, such as flood
    management, water quality management, sediment control, and water security management.
    The key characteristics of water data together with examples are listed below
    (BOM 2017): Parameter type (e.g., river flow data for reservoir operation; water
    demand data for irrigation management) Measurement location (e.g., water quality
    data for upstream of water offtakes for drinking water supply; groundwater level
    data for heavily utilized aquifers) Spatial coverage (e.g., flood level data for
    flood prone areas; national scale water assessment) Spatial density (e.g., rainfall
    distribution for rainfall pattern assessment) Temporal frequency (e.g., daily
    or monthly river data for regional water security assessment; high frequency river
    and rainfall data for flood forecasting) Longevity of measurements (multi-decadal
    data of continuous rainfall for rainfall IDF analysis; historical river flow data
    for flood frequency and magnitude analysis) Latency (e.g., basin time concentration
    for rainfall-runoff modelling; real-time rainfall and river level data for flood
    forecasting) Precision (e.g., water quality data should be precise in order to
    confirm safe drinking water supply; water pricing should be assessed carefully
    to prevent probable issues between stakeholders). 3.4 Challenges of Water Data
    In most countries, the nation’s water data arrangements cannot satisfy the need
    of water sector participants, and the processes of data collection are limited.
    There is an increasing need for systematic data collection in order to improve
    monitoring and ensure informed decision making (IWRM 2019). Over the next three
    sections, basic challenges of accessing proper and accurate water data will be
    discussed. 3.4.1 Poor Quality of Water Data There are many gaps in the available
    water dataset, and the quality of some water data is poor. Generally, the available
    water datasets are heterogeneous, dispersed, and poor in quality (BOM 2017). Dispersion
    and gaps in water data are mainly the result of poorly calibrated measuring devices
    as well as inefficient equipment maintenance. Apparently, water management will
    be challenging without good water data. Therefore, policy makers and managers
    are unable to make sound decisions as the provided water data are unreliable and
    contradictory (BOM 2017). Additionally, many poor countries, which are facing
    financial problems, are not equipped with modern and efficient measuring devices
    and techniques, which leads to poor measurements, and subsequently poor quality
    datasets (INBO 2018). Lack of homogeneity in water data causes poor data management
    as the data is useless, and massive investments on water infrastructure and data
    collection is wasted. Heterogeneous data mainly occurs when private organizations
    follow their own specific guidelines and procedures for data collection, and there
    is no general adopted rules for all data collector organizations (BOM 2017). 3.4.2
    Lack of Integrated Water Portal Systems One of the main water data challenges
    in many countries is the lack of information about the available water data, and
    also not openly shared datasets. Basically, there is no single established organization/tool/website
    to provide potential users with information about the different available water
    types, and characteristics of the water date sets. Detailed metadata, i.e. information
    on “how the data is produced”, “how the data can be accessed”, “how the data should
    be used”, “who to contact”, and “what the licence of the data is” are not provided
    by institutions in many countries. Thus, researchers and water data users require
    considerable time, effort, and investment to identify stated information. Therefore,
    data users and researchers need to spend time on basic data gathering and transformation
    rather than scientific analysis. This problem is noticeable when data is collected
    by multiple agencies for a specific task purpose. For instance, the required meteorological
    data models and formats for hydrological purposes (e.g., groundwater and catchment
    modelling) are different from the meteorological data formats for atmospheric
    science analysis. As a result of this data difference, a hydrologist should spend
    significant amount of time on learning the file format and visualization tool
    used by atmospheric science community. To address this problem, data should be
    communicated between scientific sub-disciplines systems through standard protocol/web
    services (Goodall et al. 2008). In this context, organizations such as European
    Flood Awareness System (EFAS), Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS), European
    drought observatory (EDO), Watershed Index Online (WSIO), United States Geological
    Survey (USGS) Water Data, BOM climate data online, European Space Agency (ESA),
    Copernicus Space Component (CSC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) have made efforts to provide users with documented, homogeneous, and well-organized
    data set, which can be accessed through web services, and indicate datasets in
    the form of maps, tables, and graphs. 3.4.3 Limited Access to Data According to
    the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principle, the public should
    participate in decision making processes. In order to pave this way, water institutions
    and organization should make the water data and information available and accessible
    to the public. However, much water data is not accessible by the public, or the
    water data type is not understandable by people with no expert knowledge. Thus,
    to ensure the participations of the public, water data should be disseminated
    in an informative and comprehensible way (INBO 2018). In addition to the public,
    openly shared and freely access to most water data is limited for water data users,
    particularly researchers. Regarding the fact that in many countries, funds for
    data collections come from private sectors, institutions are mainly reluctant
    to share the data freely. Additionally, many national organizations have no tends
    to share the collected data with the neighbouring countries or other international
    organizations. This situation is observed particularly when the countries are
    facing critical water scarcity, and the countries under such conflicts deny publishing
    information due to security risks (INBO 2018). Additionally, poor countries, which
    are facing financial problems, are unable to build efficient water information
    systems, manage water data, and develop efficient web portals and tools for data
    sharing. As a result, international organizations and agencies play an important
    role in providing financial support as well as remote monitoring to deal with
    the water problem in poor countries (INBO 2018). 3.4.4 Big Data Problems Regarding
    the increased amount of water data, several challenges can appear for big water
    data management. Big water data is associated with increased data volume, variety,
    and velocity. The amount of measured and processed data is growing rapidly. Additionally,
    the growing formats of data can make data management challenging. Considering
    the increased automation in data measurement process, the biases, abnormalities,
    and noise are also increasing in raw water data. As a result, a suitable and massive
    validation process is required to treat raw water data. Citizen science data is
    another aspect of big data complexity. Citizen science refers to the participation
    of the general public in the process of research design and data collection, which
    leads to the collection of large volumes of data (Buytaert et al. 2014). In the
    field of climate modelling, the spatial and temporal dimensions of data are intensive
    as such data indicates complex process of atmosphere and ocean circulation. Therefore,
    such climate data requires high storage space and large computer processing power
    (Cuntz et al. 2007). High volume data with long time periods can lead to high
    potential of data loss or intrusion. Generally, with high increase in the amount
    of data, many challenges are coupled with the process of big water data management.
    3.5 Data Processing Data processing refers to the manipulation of data obtained
    from in situ measurements or remote sensing, before they can be efficiently stored
    or made available (Hughes 1998). Raw data should be processed and transformed
    into formats to be identified and applied by researchers, data users, and decision
    makers (INBO 2018). Regarding the cost, effort, and high volume involved in data
    collection, proper data processing tools and approaches should be adopted (Hughes
    1998). Many tools are available for data processing, including spreadsheets and
    databases, database management tools, geographic information systems (GIS), Extract-Transform-Load
    (ETL) tools, modelling tools, and statistical data analysis tools. However, the
    selected tools and approaches should meet the requirements of the data users and
    researchers: What data format is required? What is the purpose of using the data?
    What kind of research will be conducted? And which organization will use the data?
    (INBO 2018). 3.5.1 Water Data Processing and Analysis The main purpose of data
    processing is to convert raw data into information, which meets the need of researchers
    and decision makers. Key points of water data processing are (Hughes 1998): Data
    encoding and digitizing; Quality control, consistency checking, and error checking;
    Data storage resolution; Data calibration and stability; Data storage and retrieval
    system. The stated key points will be discussed below: Data encoding and digitizing:
    Converting the measurements to digital is the first step of data processing. Hand-written
    field sheets or automatically penned charts mounted on a rotating drum are simple
    forms of data collection, which is still applied in many areas, particularly for
    collecting rainfall, evaporation, and other meteorological variables. Next, this
    data should be transferred to a computer database. Lost or damaged data is the
    main drawback of this manual data recoding. Therefore, modern telemetry, remote
    sensing, and other modern instruments have been developed to record the data automatically,
    particularly collecting the “real time” data (Hughes 1998). The vast quantities
    of recorded data (in situ measurements and remote sensing data) should be transformed
    into the cloud services in order to be stored and classified and then be accessible
    through portals and web services (McCabe et al. 2017). Data quality control: Data
    collection corresponds with issues such as missing data, recorded data over the
    incorrect time, accumulated data, instrument failure, etc. Additionally, most
    databases are not able to identify poor and incorrect data and inform data users
    of data inconsistency (Hughes 1998). Missing data processing, logical error detection,
    repeated data processing, abnormal data detection, and inconsistent data processing
    are main aspects of hydrological data quality control. Prediction methods (e.g.,
    recurrence neural network (RNN), and support vector machine (SVM)), optimization
    methods (e.g., particle swarm optimization (PSO)), and statistical methods (e.g.,
    adaptive boosting, and statistical control) are some examples of data driven approaches
    for data quality control (Zhao et al. 2018). Data storage resolution: Time resolution
    is of great importance in water data, particularly, the data used in hydrological
    analysis. For example, required time step for analysing the rainfall intensity
    in temperate climate is different from the arid and semiarid climates. Normally,
    the rainfall data with a resolution of one hour should be proper in temperate
    climate, while short-term variation of intensity is more important in arid and
    semiarid areas, and hence, minute should be the proper time step in arid areas
    (Hughes 1998). Therefore, disaggregation methods, such as Hyetos based on Bartlett-Lewis
    process and Marcov chain model should be applied in order to break down the data
    into shorter time steps (Koutsoyiannis 2003), which is considered as an important
    task of data processing. Data value accuracy: Accuracy of observations is a numeric
    value that quantifies the data measurements accuracy based on the closeness to
    the standard value. The stated value accuracy measures the associated uncertainty
    with data measurements, which is the result of errors in bias and precision. The
    value accuracy can be estimated using the knowledge of instrument accuracy and
    measurement method as well as statistical analysis of the records from repeated
    measurements (Horsburgh et al. 2008). Additionally, some instrument calibration
    process (either manual calibration or using table and equations) is required to
    ensure accurate measurements. For instance, the stage-discharge relationship is
    commonly used to convert water level measurements of a flume to flow rate or discharge.
    In the case of a flooding event in a river, calibration process is necessary as
    riverbank erosion and massive sediment transport occur over flood events (Hughes
    1998). Data storage and retrieval system: As describe in Sect. 4.4, big data requires
    massive amounts of data to be stored. Metadata catalogues and data storage systems
    help data users to identify the available datasets and check their characteristics
    (Hughes 1998). Within this context, recorded observations should be stored with
    sufficient supporting information (e.g., the location, date and time and type
    of variable that was observed) about the observations to enable data interpretation
    and cross-dimension data retrieval and analysis (Horsburgh et al. 2008). The databases
    should provide users with helpful information on the type measurements, data length,
    instrument details, the latitude and longitude of measurements, data quality,
    missing data, time zone, etc. Additionally, an efficient database is able to allow
    user to access and download the data in different formats, such shape files, text
    file, and excel files. It is also necessary to design a frequent backup system
    for the databases in order to prevent data lost in a case of system failure (Hughes
    1998). In the scope of data storage and retrieval, Internet of Things (IoT) technology,
    which has been developed rapidly in recent years, is considered as a key approach
    in big data processing. Within this context, cloud computing is a new generation
    of computing architecture that supports big data applications and growing data
    processing (Fan et al. 2018). As an example of such applications, the cloud-computing
    services have been applied to watershed management by enabling watershed partnerships
    for focusing primarily on decision-making activities (Sun 2013). Bürger et al.
    (2012) also developed an intuitive Web interface to create an integrated hydrologic
    simulation platform that enables users to access scientific software through a
    web browser. 3.5.2 Water Data Visualization After the data process step and data
    preparation, the next step is to present the data in an understandable and efficient
    way. Regarding the recent improvements of digital culture and information technologies,
    large datasets become complex to understand. Therefore, visual presentation of
    data has been developed, which presents data in the form of a graph, map, video,
    animation, hierarchy, etc. Data visualization can also improve understanding of
    existing trends, patterns and correlation in the datasets that might not detected
    in text and number-based data. As a result, stakeholders and decision makers can
    easily identify the important issues of water resources management to focus on
    as well as adapting new policies. In the scope of data visualization, the quality
    of data presentation is important as a poor or incorrect type of data visualization
    may cause misleading and hinder smart decision making. The visualization tool
    should be selected based on specific criteria, including i) how data viewers interact
    with data, ii) the information that should be obtained by the viewers, iii) the
    function of the data, and iv) the data composition. The three main types of water
    data presentation are as below (INBO 2018): Maps: They indicate the geographical
    distribution of different parameters, such as evaporation, rainfall, temperature.
    Maps can be produced using GIS software. Key figures: They are generated from
    data processing and document analysis. Key figures are understandable by public.
    Factsheet: They show a regular summary of data analysis, information, and graphs
    on different topics such as global warming, climate change, and drought trend.
    3.5.3 Water Data Dissemination After collecting, verifying, processing, and storing
    the water data, the next important task is to release and disseminate the data
    according to the target group (e.g., the general public, researchers, and decision
    makers) (e.g., before and after a flooding event). Data dissemination consists
    of four main steps (SEQwater 2014): (1) Data value identification: The first step
    is to evaluate the data value and information asset to decide on the price of
    the water data. The data value is conducted by surveying business system, water
    companies, and stakeholders about their needs and interests. Some data can be
    accessible free of charge considering the expenses of data preparation process
    and company’s needs and interests. (2) Data assessment: Over the second step,
    the data suitability for release should be assessed based on relevant guidelines,
    policies, and legislations. Additionally, depending on the target group (e.g.,
    scientific, non-expert purposes), data visualizations, data use instructions,
    and data use policies should be defined. (3) Data publication: Over the third
    step, data should be published based on priority factors such as public interest,
    stakeholder feedback, company and institutes need, and economic values. Additionally,
    given the type of requirements of different target groups (e.g., the general public,
    researchers, and decision makers) and required time of hydrological events (e.g.,
    before and after a flood event, before and after a dam construction), data dissemination
    should be specified. (4) Data management: Over the last step, data quality should
    be improved with regard to data user’s feedback. In order to release the water
    data, different strategies and digital tool are available. Below is the list of
    different water data dissemination plans (INBO 2018): Web portals and websites:
    data resulted from monitoring programs is delivered through portals and website.
    Basically, portals provide organized data, and water data is classified based
    on different criteria such as collected data from open stations, water data type
    (e.g., water level, streamflow, and rainfall), collected data from closed station,
    river type, time periods, water data unit (e.g., mega litre and cubic meters),
    and measured interval (e.g., hourly, daily, and monthly). Factsheets: guidelines,
    water issues (e.g., global warming and climate change), water data change trend
    analysis (e.g., temperature trend, major flood event trend and evaporation change
    trend), monitoring programs (e.g., coastal erosion monitoring), management programs
    (e.g., integrated sub-basin management plans) can be published through digital
    books. Social media networks: In addition to portals, websites, and digital books,
    social media networks also play an important role in water data dissemination.
    Social media networks increase people’s awareness of available water data and
    establish contact with internet and data users. Additionally, social media are
    effective way of transferring news and water data updates to users. Smart apps:
    smart and free apps are favourable, particularly among the public. Smart applications
    can potentially target different water users and improve interaction. For instance,
    “Ma Cons’eau” is a useful free application, which can estimate the people’s water
    consumption through providing a set of simple questions. The amount of water consumption
    is calculated based on the water price of resident locations. 3.6 Practical Examples
    Many organizations, systems and programs have been developed to provide high quality
    data and services of weather, climate, hydrological, and environmental fields
    for the purpose of integrated water resources management. Therefore, multiple
    water data, information, and knowledge should be shared to build cross-functionality
    between stakeholders. One example of the water data system is the World Hydrological
    Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS), launched by the World Meteorological Organization
    (WMO) in 1993 to improve sustainable development in delivery and use of hydrological
    data as well as promoting regional and international cooperation. WHYCOS aims
    to enhance the sustainable protection, use and management of water resources systems
    as well as support decision makers through reliable and data provision. In terms
    of regional water resources management, HYCOS promotes data and information products,
    such as flood forecasts and warning data. At global scale, the WHYCOS International
    Advisory Group (WIAG) was introduced to provide support for policy guidelines
    and future development of the projects (WMO 2019). Another example of global water
    data organization is the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), which was established
    three decades ago. GRDC is an international archive of streamflow data, which
    aims to enhance analysis of global climate trends and evaluate environmental impacts
    and risks. The Global Runoff Data Base (GRDB) at GRDC was built on an initial
    dataset collected in the early 1980s. GRDB is a unique tool for obtaining river
    streamflow data at daily and monthly time step from over 9,500 gauging stations
    in 161 countries. In terms of national scale, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)
    in Australia has developed the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS).
    As shown in Fig. 3.3, the purpose of AWRIS is to receive and manage water data
    and information as well as supporting and disseminating different water information
    products and services. Fig. 3.3 The role of AWRIS in water information in Australia
    (Adopted from AWRIS Information Sheets 2019) Full size image AWRIS is able to
    store and manage information about groundwater levels, river flow, the quality
    of water in rivers and aquifers, water trades, water use and restrictions, and
    water volume in storages in a central database. Next, the stored data is checked
    for quality and standards to ensure that the stored data is consistent with the
    current available data. Over the next step, the Australian Hydrological Geospatial
    Fabric cast the stored water information in a spatial context through encoding
    the spatial connections between Australia’s hydrological features (e.g., rivers,
    lakes, aquifers, dams, channels etc.). As indicated in Fig. 3.3, the final step
    includes analysing, interpreting, and integrating the water data. AWRIS delivers
    variety of water data, reports, and forecasts, such as real-time water reports,
    regular national water resources assessments, improved flood warning systems,
    and seasonal streamflow forecasts. The main advantage of AWRIS is that water users
    are able (i) to identify water resources condition in Australia through integrated
    viewpoint, (ii) to prepare benchmark reports using quality and transparent data,
    (iii) to check the details of standards, (iv) to control the quality of applied
    water data, and (v) to easily use the data for planning, analysis, reporting,
    and modelling (AWRIS information sheets 2019). 3.7 Summary Limited water resources
    and increased demand for the resources leads to growing challenges facing water
    resources systems. This growing pressure on water resources is the result of many
    issues, such as rapid population growth, poor water data, inefficient water resources
    management, and climate change. Therefore, the need to enhance water security,
    sustainable water management, reliable water supply, and environment protection
    necessitate the integrated water resources planning and management. The chapter
    underlines that water data and information are considered as the key components
    of water-based research, which provide decision makers with proper information
    in different water disciplines. Water data can be classified into two main categories,
    primary data and secondary data, where primary data is the collection of raw data,
    and secondary data obtained from models, lab experiments, and specific methods.
    Additionally, water data types can be grouped based on disciplines/sectors that
    water data is used. For instance, hydrometric data, meteorological data, and groundwater
    data are applied in hydrology services, meteorological services, and geological
    and mining institutes, respectively. Different distinct water data is obtained
    from four main sources: (1) measurements; (2) models; (3) remote sensing; and
    (4) administrative institutes. The chapter also discuss the limitation of water
    data, including poor quality, lack of integrated water portal systems, limited
    funds for data provision, and big data problems. In order to efficiently store
    and apply data, water data should be processed and analysed through key steps:
    (1) data encoding and digitizing; (2) quality control, consistency checking, and
    error checking; (3) data storage resolution analysis; (4) data calibration and
    stability; and (5) data storage and retrieval systems. After the data processing
    steps, water data should be visualized and presented in an understandable way
    to find our existing climate trend, pattern and correlation for the purpose of
    adapting new policies and management strategies in the realm of water resources.
    Thereafter, water data should be released and disseminated through web portals
    and websites, E-books, media and social networks, and smart apps to be used by
    decision makers, researchers, and policy makers for efficient water management
    planning. In general, the outcomes of the present chapter will benefit different
    water disciplines sectors through provision of discussion on the role, current
    condition, and importance of water data and information in water resources management.
    3.8 Recommendations Regarding the important role of data provision in integrated
    water resources management, it is recommended: (1) To provide public easy access
    to water data with the purpose to serve many different contexts: In order to improve
    decision making strategies, enhance national and international research studies,
    and ensure efficient water resources management, different water data sources
    and types should be highly accessible. Additionally, free provision of some data
    sources can potentially increase people’s awareness about the responsibility and
    importance of different water sectors. As a results of this increased awareness,
    public tends to have interactions and collaborations with experts, which leads
    to efficient water supply and management. (2) To improve collaboration and engagement
    between water data system or portal developers and users: Identification of the
    intended purpose of data provision is a fundamental need for achieving efficient
    data use. Therefore, before providing the data, sound understanding of the need
    of stakeholders and data users is essential to ensure the relevant data collection.
    (3) To develop a single global data system: Despite the availability of many different
    sources, portals and websites for data users, some researchers have challenge
    to identify the most accurate and efficient source of data for their studies.
    In order to address this issue, multiple sources of water data at different spatial
    and temporal resolutions should be consolidated in a single global data system.
    (4) To provide data in different formats and resolutions to target different decisions
    making strategies: Based on the type of decision-making strategy, research project,
    and water management strategy, different temporal and spatial resolutions of data
    should be provided. Hence, an efficient water data system should provide resolution
    flexibility in data as well as ensuring the quality and integrity of data. (5)
    To propose and build a novel water data system for water data format conversion:
    Many researchers and water data users should convert the format of the collected
    water data into the required input data format of different water software packages.
    The process of data format conversion is time and money consuming. Therefore,
    the generation and provision of different water data formats help users to save
    time in running water software and models. (6) To develop efficient water data
    systems, which are able to generate and update information from water data automatically:
    Water data systems should be improved in order to automatically generate some
    illustrations (maps, figures, and tables) from the input data. Additionally, the
    new collected data should automatically update the water data system by providing
    updated illustrations and information. (7) To develop more accurate data gap filling
    methods: Some data, such as future meteorological data under climate change, should
    be estimated. There are also gaps in some data due to different reasons, such
    as defective measuring device. In order to inform decision making and researchers
    with proper data, the stated limitations and gaps should be addressed. (8) To
    integrate different data sources to ensure quality data: Various organizations
    provide water data based on different standards of data measurements, processing,
    and collection. Water organizations and sectors should integrate water data system
    by satisfying specific level of standards in terms of data quality, processing,
    measurements, and documentations. These recommendations will help water data providers,
    modellers, and researchers to detect the limitations of current water data and
    to identify room for improvements. References Ahmad SK, Hossain F (2019) A generic

    It is increasingly recognized that water scarcity, rather than a lack of arable
    land,

    will be the major constraint to increase agricultural production over the next
    few

    decades. Therefore, water represents a unique agricultural asset to drive agricultural

    sustainability. However, its planning, management and usage are often inﬂuenced
    by

    a mix of interdependent economic, engineering, social, hydrologic, environmental,
    and

    even political factors. Such a complex interdependency suggests that a sociotechnical

    approach to water resources management, a subject of the ﬁeld of Hydroinformatics,

    represents a viable path forward to achieve sustainable agriculture. Thus, this
    paper

    presents an overview of the intersection between hydroinformatics and agriculture

    to introduce a new research ﬁeld called agricultural hydroinformatics. In addition,
    it

    proposes a general conceptual framework taking into account the distinctive features

    associated with the sociotechnical dimension of hydroinformatics when applied
    in

    agriculture. The framework is designed to serve as a stepping-stone to achieve,

    not only integrated water resources management, but also agricultural sustainability

    transitions in general. Using examples from agricultural water development to
    horticultural

    and livestock farming, the paper highlights facets of the framework applicability
    as a

    new paradigm on data ﬂows/sources consideration, and information and simulation

    models engineering as well as integration for a holistic approach to water resources

    management in agriculture. Finally, it discusses opportunities and challenges
    associated

    with the implementation of agricultural hydroinformatics and the development of
    new

    research areas needed to achieve the full potential of this emerging framework.
    These

    areas include, for example, sensor deployment and development, signal processing,

    information modeling and storage, artiﬁcial intelligence, and new kind of simulation
    model

    development approaches.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    1. INTRODUCTION

    The ever-growing world population and the rapidly approaching

    planetary boundaries have led to widespread discussion and

    consensus on the urgent need for the ﬁeld of agriculture

    to gear toward sustainability-oriented initiatives (Giovannucci

    et al., 2012; Herrero and Thornton, 2013; FAO, 2017; Pretty

    et al., 2018). The objective is to reduce, avoid or redress

    environmental impacts and lessen the intense competition for

    input resources such as land, water, energy, and nutrients caused

    by conventional practices (Garnett et al., 2013; Jägermeyr et al.,

    2016; Kamilaris et al., 2017; Pretty et al., 2018; Calicioglu et al.,

    2019). Consequently, a variety of approaches (e.g., “ecological

    intensiﬁcation,” “agroecological intensiﬁcation,” and “sustainable

    intensiﬁcation”) and technologies (e.g., “Precision Agriculture”)

    promoting transitions to sustainable practices have emerged. We

    argue that all these concepts can be summarized in the following

    common denominator: “a blend of technological, social, and

    institutional innovations at diﬀerent scales around a common

    agricultural asset, resource, or subsystem represents a pivot to

    underpin sustainability transitions in agriculture.”

    Sustainability

    transitions

    is

    a

    social

    and

    technical

    (sociotechnical) concept deﬁned as a set of “long-term, multi-

    dimensional, and fundamental transformation processes through

    which [well]-established [organizations] shift to more sustainable

    modes of production and consumption” (Markard et al., 2012).

    This deﬁnition implies that the application of the concept in

    agriculture presents some serious challenges. A ﬁrst challenge

    is the need for a genuine participation and interaction of

    both established and innovative stakeholders or organizations.

    Second, within and between (established) organizations, the

    interactions/relations between individuals and (agricultural)

    technologies and tools existing at a certain level often diﬀer

    considerably from those employed at other levels. In other

    words, established stakeholders and organizations are often

    sociotechnically stratiﬁed (Abbott, 1999; Ingram, 2015). Third,

    the identiﬁcation and contribution of all other concerned

    stakeholders are required to ensure that both social and

    non-social expectations are met (Cunge and Erlich, 1999;

    Rousseau et al., 2005; Abbott and Vojinovic, 2010a,b, 2014).

    Last but not least, it is a multi-disciplinary exercise involving

    a comprehensive knowledge of the diﬀerent subsystems and

    subdomains in agriculture (Killham, 2011; Zomorodian et al.,

    2018; Al-Jawad et al., 2019). This challenge, in turn, leads to the

    ﬁrst challenge mentioned above. Thus, the implementation of the

    sustainability transitions concept in agriculture can be thought

    as a continuous, and even iterative and circular, process of

    engaging all concerned stakeholders around the same common

    agricultural asset, resource, or subsystem discussed above.

    Water is a unique agricultural input that connects, is aﬀected

    by (quantitatively and qualitatively) and aﬀects all agricultural

    subsystems (Zhu et al., 2019). Its use and management are often

    inﬂuenced by a mix of highly complex economic, engineering,

    social, hydrologic, environmental, and even political factors

    (Zomorodian et al., 2018; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019). These

    inﬂuences are expected to become more challenging to cope with

    in light of the anticipated increase in agricultural water demand

    due to climate change impacts and global population growth.

    Furthermore, the conﬂicting behavior, preferences, and goals

    of water stakeholders further complicate the management of

    available water resources (Walker et al., 2015; Zomorodian et al.,

    2018). However, despite the challenges imposed by the water

    stakeholders ecosystem, roughly half of the total agricultural

    water use is lost somewhere between the point of abstraction and

    the crop, and thus, not eﬀectively used (Knox et al., 2012). In

    this same vein, water scarcity, rather than a lack of arable land,

    will be the major constraint to increase agricultural production

    over the next few decades (Watkins, 2006; Hanjra and Qureshi,

    2010). Therefore, water represents the abovementioned common

    agricultural asset/resource to underpin agricultural sustainability

    transitions. It is unarguably the most critical resource to achieve

    sustainable agriculture (Chartzoulakis and Bertaki, 2015).

    Sustainable agriculture is often seen as an umbrella term for

    knowledge-intensive systems that require, beyond the application

    of domain knowledge, a new kind of knowledge (El Bilali

    and Allahyari, 2018). This latter is the knowledge of how

    to apply domain knowledge in new or unprecedented ways,

    i.e., a metaknowledge. In a context of using water resources

    as pivot to achieve agricultural sustainability, the common

    denominator we identiﬁed above, this metaknowledge is known

    as Hydroinformatics (Abbott, 1999). This discipline has emerged

    to deliver unprecedented results in situations where stakeholders

    engagement/mobilization around water resources planning and

    management are most needed, and environmental stakes are

    high. A landmark example of the signiﬁcance of this discipline

    in mobilizing stakeholders is the social breakthrough achieved

    by applying hydroinformatics tools from design to ﬁnish of the

    bridge and tunnel connection between Denmark and Sweden

    (the Oresund Project; Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001). In this

    project, hydroinformatics, through the use of technologies

    of persuasion to communicate complex decision problems,

    was signiﬁcantly successful in adequately informing politicians,

    responsible authorities, and ordinary citizens about the project,

    empowering, and persuading them as well to act as trusted

    stakeholders. Another related example has been introduced

    by Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev (2014) to demonstrate the

    practical application of hydroinformatics in supporting the

    implementation of the concept of “Integrated Water Resources

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    Management” (IWRM; GWP, 2000; Furlong et al., 2015) across

    diverse institutional settings in Central Asia.

    Several eﬃciency-based techniques and approaches aligned

    with the knowledge management function and the sociotechnical

    dimension

    of

    hydroinformatics

    have been

    proposed

    and

    applied to address the problem of agricultural water resources

    sustainability. These include: the IWRM concept (GWP, 2000;

    Furlong et al., 2015); the conjunctive use of surface water

    and groundwater resources (Singh, 2014); novel irrigation

    management systems (Sandler et al., 2004; Evans and Sadler,

    2008; Gumiere et al., 2014; Pelletier et al., 2015; Vanderleest

    et al., 2016; Caron et al., 2017; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019);

    and minimization of food waste and losses (Kummu et al.,

    2012; Pretty et al., 2018; Bjornlund and Bjornlund, 2019; among

    others). An eﬃciency-promoting paradigm with a focus on water

    management includes Precision Irrigation (PI; Perea et al., 2018)

    for crops and aquaculture, and Precision Livestock Farming

    (PLF) for dairy, egg, and meat production (Fournel et al., 2017).

    PI and PLF have emerged to make intensive use of information

    and communication technologies for spatio-temporal data

    collection

    and

    processing

    in

    support

    of

    improved

    farm

    productivity, and cost-eﬀectiveness, sustainability of operations

    and environmental quality. They entail that farms (livestock,

    crops, aquaculture, etc.) are continuously monitored, and the

    collected data mined using integrated modeling approaches

    (e.g., water application models, biophysical simulation models,

    and empirical models) to make decisions and ensure favorable

    production conditions (Fournel et al., 2017; Perea et al., 2018).

    Using water resources as a pivot, these knowledge-intensive

    techniques represent an application for the data-mining-for-

    knowledge-discovery line of development of hydroinformatics

    (Abbott, 1999). Thus, with its (meta)knowledge-producing and

    management function, hydroinformatics represents a viable

    path forward to achieve smart, i.e., sustainable agriculture

    (Allahyari, 2009).

    Although water resources productivity or eﬃciency represents

    a cornerstone to achieve agricultural sustainability, it is not

    a panacea (Wichelns, 2014; Pretty et al., 2018). In this

    regard, substitution-based approaches consisting mainly of

    changes in consumption behaviors have been proposed (van

    Huis and Oonincx, 2017; Pretty et al., 2018; Bjornlund and

    Bjornlund, 2019). These approaches require the application of

    the technologies of persuasion, a subset of hydroinformatics’

    technologies, to change individuals’ inner world and achieve

    behavioral changes (Abbott, 1999; Thorkilsen and Dynesen,

    2001). This suggests that the inherent quantitative way of

    working of hydroinformatics must be complemented by its

    qualitative way of working (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017).

    Thereby, hydroinformatics represents a prospective enabler of

    stakeholders engagement to achieve sustainable agriculture. It

    is exactly this persuasive knowledge-management purpose that

    Abbott (1999) had anticipated, and hence, must be fulﬁlled

    by hydroinformatics in order to realize its full sociotechnical

    potential, particularly in sustainable agriculture (DiSalvo et al.,

    2010; El Bilali and Allahyari, 2018).

    This non-exhaustive overview of the interplay between

    agriculture and hydroinformatics highlights the anticipated

    role and relevance of the discipline proposed herein. This

    paper, thus, introduces agricultural hydroinformatics as a new

    interdisciplinary ﬁeld of research. In addition, it proposes

    a general conceptual framework taking into account the

    distinctive features associated with the sociotechnical dimension

    of hydroinformatics when applied in agriculture. It exempliﬁes

    the quantitative and qualitative interdependencies necessary

    to support the development of sociotechnical environments

    in which hydroinformatics-enabling social “transmutations”

    necessary to achieve agricultural sustainability can be catalyzed. It

    underlies the social and technical “threads” to be woven together

    in order to extend from a hydroinformatics of the quantities into

    a hydroinformatics of the qualities (i.e., subjective experiences,

    perceptions; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017), a necessary condition

    to unleash the potential of the application of hydroinformatics

    in agriculture.

    The paper is organized as follows: section 2 is dedicated to

    the deﬁnition and roles of the discipline and provides rationales

    for the proposed framework; section 3 discusses the applicability

    of the framework using examples from agricultural water

    development projects in horticultural farming. The objective

    of this section is not to demonstrate the applicability of the

    framework, but only to propose a blueprint on how to develop

    it; section 4 discusses opportunities and challenges associated

    with the implementation of agricultural hydroinformatics; and

    section 5, before summarizing and concluding, discusses the

    development of new research areas to achieve the full potential

    of this emerging framework.

    2. AGRICULTURAL HYDROINFORMATICS:

    CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK,

    DEFINITIONS, AND ROLES

    Owing to the inevitable and complex interactions between water

    and the agricultural subsystems, hydroinformatics combines,

    coordinates and interplays with several scientiﬁc ﬁelds of study

    and practices when applied in agriculture. This synergy gives

    rise to a multi-purpose conceptual framework that captures the

    wholeness and inter-dependencies necessary to conduct holistic

    agricultural water systems studies and modeling.

    2.1. The Conceptual Framework

    A

    ﬁrst

    factor

    that

    highlights

    the

    synergy

    between

    hydroinformatics and existing disciplines in agriculture is water

    over-extraction for growing purposes (i.e., at the operational

    level), because of its two-faced (beneﬁcial and detrimental)

    impacts. Some implications include, for example: (i) land

    subsidence (Deng et al., 2018) which is a subject of geology;

    (ii) potential loss of livelihoods and ecosystems due to ﬂooding

    risks, water scarcity and, thus, food security which are subjects

    of hydrology, hydraulics, ecology, economics, and sociology; (iii)

    the implementation of water governance institutions along

    with water rights and water conﬂicts resolution which are

    subjects of legal sciences. The resulting impacts and changes

    of these implications often in turn generate new social and

    technical developments that characterize the circular nature of

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    3

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    hydroinformatics in supporting decisions that improve society

    (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Makropoulos and Savi´c, 2019).

    A second factor is water stress at the farm level as it is

    regarded as the greatest abiotic inhibitor of agricultural yield

    (Ciais et al., 2005; Gumiere et al., 2020). Such a factor has

    potentially destructive impacts on plant phenotypes such as

    growth, yield, eﬃciency and resistance (Houle et al., 2010)

    and livestock phenotypes such as feed intake, body mass, and

    milk production (Chedid et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2015).

    Consequently, agricultural hydroinformatics may have a role

    to play in phenomics research (Houle et al., 2010; Furbank

    and Tester, 2011) and potentially in genomics research as well

    (Chaves et al., 2003; Tuberosa and Salvi, 2006). This role may

    be further extended into new gene-based crop and livestock

    models of interactions between genotypes, growth environments,

    and farmers’ management decisions and practices to improve

    farm performance (Antle et al., 2017). Furthermore, water stress

    also inﬂuences the physiology of both plants (e.g., photosynthetic

    activity) and livestock (Osakabe et al., 2014; Fournel et al., 2017).

    Last but not least, pest-management regimes (pest management

    science) and waste management practices in agriculture are known

    to have consequences on water quality with implications on water

    stress (Sims and Wolf, 1994; Larson et al., 1997; Burkholder et al.,

    2006; Zhang et al., 2008).

    The overviewed synergy between ﬁelds of studies and

    practices embodies the sociotechnical nature of the application

    of hydroinformatics in agriculture and, accordingly, it sets

    the basis for the generic conceptual framework depicted in

    Figure 1. Together, the components of the framework exemplify

    the wholeness and inter-dependencies necessary to conduct

    agricultural systems studies and modeling. Such an endeavor

    requires the weaving of the naturalistic perspective (i.e.,

    clearly deﬁned quantities) and the hydro-social perspective

    (subjective/phenomenological in nature) of water resources

    management (Biswas and Dune, 1971; Walker et al., 2015;

    Vojinovic et al., 2016; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Zomorodian

    et al., 2018; Ženko and Menga, 2019). As such, the framework

    accounts for those aspects of water resources management that

    may not at all be expressed in numerical and/or monetary terms

    (Vojinovic and Van Teeﬀelen, 2007; Ten Veldhuis, 2011; Walker

    et al., 2015; Vojinovic et al., 2016). Thus, it exempliﬁes an

    anchor or starting point for extending from the rather narrow

    techno-centric approach of hydroinformatics toward a broader

    hydroinformatics of the qualities (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017).

    In doing so, the potential of hydroinformatics in its scope and

    reach will be unleashed.

    The framework also oﬀers the opportunity to delineate the

    scope of future sociotechnological development for agricultural

    hydroinformatics. In this regard, it can be viewed as: (a) the

    data ﬂows inventory necessary when conducting sustainable

    water resources management in agriculture, and (b) a discipline-

    delineated approach for the engineering of information and

    simulation models development and integration in agriculture.

    These two facets conﬁrm the multi-purpose nature of the

    framework. The framework is amenable to capture, for example,

    the underlying data infrastructure needed to support the Plants

    in silico vision (Zhu et al., 2016), as well as the multi-scale crop

    modeling framework for climate change adaptation assessment

    as proposed by Peng et al. (2020). In these and similar

    contexts, agricultural hydroinformatics is expected to evolve with

    additional links to other ﬁelds of study and the development

    of new classes of tools and technologies. Accordingly, it may

    develop to (a) move the frontiers of the subﬁeld currently known

    as AgInformatics or Agroinformatics (Gupta, 2009; De Montis

    et al., 2017; Gustafson et al., 2017) and (b) carry in its own

    right the sociotechnical implications of agricultural systems,

    an important aspect that is overlooked in the literature on

    agroinformatics (Sørensen et al., 2010; Lokuge et al., 2016; De

    Montis et al., 2017; Gustafson et al., 2017).

    2.2. Deﬁnitions of Agricultural

    Hydroinformatics

    In

    light

    of

    the

    proposed

    framework,

    agricultural

    hydroinformatics

    can

    be

    intrinsically

    deﬁned

    as

    “the

    production and use of knowledge from data ﬂows relevant to

    the understanding and management of water in agriculture,

    together with interactions with, transformation by, and impacts

    on surrounding environments (e.g., plants, soil, animals, people)

    and vice versa”. However, the agriculture sector represents a

    typical example of a technology ecosystem within which several

    technologies interact and inﬂuence one another’s evolution. In

    such an ecosystem, agricultural hydroinformatics as a technology

    itself will interact with other technologies (e.g., farm machinery)

    either directly (e.g., usage and integration of data from agro-

    equipment) or indirectly (e.g., modeling of agro-equipment

    impacts on water). We have identiﬁed many components of the

    ecosystem, often referred to as reverse salient in the literature

    on sociology of technology (Hughes, 1987), that fails to deliver

    an acceptable level of technological capabilities to facilitate

    the integration and evolution of hydroinformatics therein.

    Therefore, we further deﬁne agricultural hydroinformatics

    as “the technology that should identify, support and promote

    corrective measures, and ultimately apply those (if necessary)

    capable of enhancing the performance delivery of the ecosystem of

    technologies as a whole.”

    2.3. Anticipated Roles of Agricultural

    Hydroinformatics

    In

    light

    of

    the

    second

    deﬁnition

    presented

    above,

    hydroinformatics, when integrated in the agricultural technology

    ecosystem, will impose both physical and digital constraints

    on the design, functionalities, characteristics of the ecosystem

    itself and respond to similar constraints that will contribute to

    the whole ecosystem evolution. This suggests that agricultural

    hydroinformatics carries the responsibility to deﬁne what we call,

    using an object-oriented software engineering metaphor, a set of

    role types as part of a role model that describes the functionalities

    of and collaborations between its inner and outer components

    in the technology ecosystem. This metaphor triggers the idea

    that agricultural hydroinformatics will hold an evolutionary

    inﬂuence on the other technologies it interacts with. Therefore,

    using social media parlance, agricultural hydroinformatics is a

    technology inﬂuencer and role model. Overall, it can be regarded

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    FIGURE 1 | Agricultural hydroinformatics and interacting entities as a conceptual
    framework.

    as a blueprint for implementation and adoption of information

    and communication technologies in agriculture.

    Last but not least, agricultural hydroinformatics may play a

    unique role in the deﬁnition of control and response variables

    based on local water systems conditions in support of the

    scientiﬁc roadmap toward the redeﬁnition of the water planetary

    boundary concept as proposed by Gleeson et al. (2020). For

    instance, ﬁve of the six proposed new water planetary sub-

    boundaries (e.g., soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration,

    groundwater) have direct connections with water management

    in agriculture.

    3. APPLICABILITY OF THE PROPOSED

    FRAMEWORK

    The proposed framework embodies a certain degree of generality

    that makes it amenable to transcend both spatial (ﬁeld, farm,

    watershed, regional, national, and global) and temporal (from the

    planning stage to food distribution stage) scales of food modeling

    and production systems. Therefore, it is suitable to be used

    in a wide range of agricultural development situations beyond

    connections between agro-economic and water engineering

    development and its socioeconomic impacts. We have identiﬁed

    at least three preponderant use cases for which the framework

    can be applied to support and guide sustainable agricultural

    development. They are: (i) data and information modeling,

    (ii) agricultural systems simulation and modeling, and (iii)

    engineering of simulation models source codes. We need to

    reiterate that the objective of this section is not to demonstrate

    the applicability of the framework, but only to propose a

    blueprint on how to develop it. However, the applicability will

    be exempliﬁed through the detailed discussion of real-world

    case studies.

    To better guide the discussion, especially on the data and

    information modeling, we must introduce a use case in the

    form of a complex situation where the majority, if not all, the

    components of the framework can be at play simultaneously.

    Such a use case must draw on prior practical situations that

    involve the tasks of water management for various (large-scale)

    purposes and at diﬀerent spatial scales. Similar to the Oresund

    Project discussed before, this project to be selected as an example

    must also involve political and environmental stakeholders.

    Accordingly, it must address concerns, expectations, and

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    requirements of a range of both formal and informal groups.

    In addition, it would do more justice to the utility of the

    framework to use at least a project that may have involved

    spatio-temporal sustainability-related simulations to persuade

    stakeholders during the planning stage through the project

    approval process and construction completion phase.

    The Brazilian Rio Sao Francisco transbasin diversion project

    (de Andrade et al., 2011), owing to its unique socioeconomic,

    hydrologic and geologic context, is a particular project that ﬁts

    well the stated criteria. It evolved under strict environmental

    laws; it required socially and environmentally conscious and

    participative stakeholders; it was designed to supply water to

    the most water-scarce area of the country with only 3.3% of

    water resources, but 29% of the national population; and it went

    through a tribulated approval process mostly due to a lack of

    solid technical plans, and public consensus about its potential

    beneﬁts (de Andrade et al., 2011). In addition, agricultural water

    demand accounted for the largest percentage of the total demand

    (Maneta et al., 2009; Roman, 2017). Last but not least, the project

    has attracted the attention of a large community of both national

    and international researchers, making it a highly studied and

    adequately documented case.

    3.1. Data and Information Modeling

    In data and information modeling scenarios, the ﬁrst step is

    to examine which component (s) of the proposed framework

    (Figure 1) is relevant. To determine this, the type of questions

    to be asked is for example: what kind of both quantitative

    and qualitative data or variables should be considered? The

    answer to this question would lead to an inventory of variables

    pertaining to each relevant component of the framework. This

    is the starting point to determine data ﬂows consideration for

    a particular agricultural water management scenario using the

    proposed framework. If we consider the legal sciences component,

    the answer to this question is that the data model may include,

    for example, entities associated with description of laws or legal

    frameworks established to govern or constrain the operation

    and management of water development projects, as well as

    description of water governance institutions.

    We present a preliminary example in Figure 2 with suﬃcient

    details depicting how some of the framework components

    can be used to develop information models for agriculture-

    related water development projects and farm management. We

    acknowledge that the example is non-exhaustive in the sense

    that it does not present a complete data model that includes all

    the components of the framework. This is also not the main

    objective of the paper. Therefore, instead of introducing a whole

    new information model, we tap into the Observations Data

    Model (ODM2; Horsburgh et al., 2016), a water-focused data

    model that has caught the attention of the agricultural research

    community (Janssen et al., 2017). It has been developed as a

    general information model to integrate both in situ sensors data,

    and ex-situ analyses results data, two situations that are common

    in the agriculture domain. It has also been successfully applied

    to four diﬀerent disciplines (hydrology, rock geochemistry, soil

    geochemistry, and biogeochemistry) to meet ﬁeld and laboratory

    data management needs (Hsu et al., 2017; Horsburgh et al., 2019).

    The example data model shows how some of the project

    attributes such as construction costs, distance of transfer and

    annual volume of water transferred (Shumilova et al., 2018) can

    be represented in the envisioned data model. The consideration

    of this simple metadata set is important for several reasons. First

    and foremost, there is no dedicated and maintained database on

    water transfer projects, particularly with irrigation as a purpose

    (Shumilova et al., 2018). Second, one can capitalize on the data

    ﬂows from the proposed framework to include food traceability

    information as part of the data model by linking food chains

    to water supply sources. Thus, the information model can be

    extended to support more accurate and detailed embedded

    or virtual water (D’Odorico et al., 2010; Konar et al., 2011;

    MacDonald et al., 2015) and water footprint (Hoekstra, 2017)

    proﬁles. This is a growingly accepted factor to be accounted for

    in sustainable resource-use decision-making processes (Zipper

    et al., 2020). In addition, the hydraulics component may include

    time series of ﬂow rate and diverted ﬂow rate. Although not

    presented in the example, the data model may contain provision

    to record the characteristics of both the donor and receiving

    basins under the hydraulics component of the framework. A

    many-to-many donor-receiver relationship must be maintained

    as well to enable the ability of a donor basin to supply more

    than one receiver basin and vice versa. The purposes of the

    project (e.g., agriculture, mining, steelworks, domestic supply),

    a determinant factor in assessing economic impacts of water

    development projects (Xiao et al., 2019), may as well be included

    in the data model (e.g., as a controlled-vocabularies-based entity;

    see ConstructionPurposesCV and ProjectDescription entities in

    Figure 2).

    Transboundary water development projects, such as the

    Brazilian Rio Sao Francisco transbasin and the Oresund Project,

    are often signiﬁcant sources of water disputes and legal challenges

    (Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001; de Andrade et al., 2011; De

    Stefano et al., 2017). This suggests the need for the relationship

    shown between the hydraulics and legal sciences components in

    Figure 2. The latter component is presumed to contain mostly

    qualitative variables which are often associated with a set of

    weights or scores to quantify their importance (Vojinovic et al.,

    2016). Therefore, for the purpose of the example, we introduce

    an entity named CausesOfConﬂictCV, an entity to host controlled

    vocabularies describing causes of water conﬂict. A similar score-

    based variable approach was used to develop the Basins at

    Risk (BAR) scale that aims to systematically assess the process

    of international water conﬂict resolution (Wolf et al., 2003).

    Another example is the Water Events Scale (WES; Bernauer et al.,

    2012) depicting the intensity and impact of domestic cooperative

    and conﬂicting water-related events. The BAR and WES scales

    may also be included in the form of controlled vocabularies as

    entities of the legal sciences component.

    Similarly, the hydrology component may contain hydro-

    meteorological variables recorded as time series. To not delve

    into the details of fully documenting hydrological data, we show

    how entities under the hydrology component, i.e., observational

    data derived from both sensors and specimens, can be described

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    FIGURE 2 | Example of data model schema conceptualized based off the agricultural
    hydroinformatics framework and the ODM2 developed by Horsburgh et al.

    (2016). It depicts four components of the proposed framework with related table
    deﬁnitions that may be used in developing a data model. The identiﬁer ﬁeld for
    each

    tuple (row) in the tables ends with the string “ID” with or without the +– symbol.

    and juxtaposed to entities already deﬁned in the ODM2. In

    Figure 2, we show an example of entity (WaterTableDepth)

    that has its additional characteristics deﬁned in the ODM2.

    This extension of our example data model to ODM2 is

    achieved through the ODM2Core.SamplingFeatures entity, used

    to store the physical characteristics of the river basins which

    include spatially referenced data. This juxtaposition requires

    slight modiﬁcations in the ODM2 Core schema, such as the

    elimination of tables such as ODM2Core.Variables and the update

    of others such as the ODM2Core.SamplingFeatures table (see

    rows highlighted in blue in Figure 2) which serves as the point

    of connection.

    Although groundwater is not directly withdrawn in the

    donor basin, for such a large-scale project, subsidence rates

    may be monitored in the donor basin. Accordingly, the geology

    component may be used to record measured subsidence rates

    and geologic characteristics of the donor and receiver basin. The

    description of such a variable would follow the same structure

    deﬁned for the variables under the hydrology component as in

    Figure 2, i.e., the use of variable names as controlled vocabularies

    (e.g., water table depth, land subsidence) for the entity name.

    The sociology component can be modeled as a set of entities

    representing relevant qualitative and quantitative variables.

    There is a systematic gap in the literature on the qualitative

    entities that should be considered. However, we draw from the

    literature on the ﬁeld of socio-hydrology that aims to investigate

    the co-evolution and dynamics of social-water systems (Sivapalan

    et al., 2012). Research work on this subject (Elshafei et al.,

    2014; Kandasamy et al., 2014; van Emmerik et al., 2014; Kotir

    et al., 2016) suggest that the dynamics of the population is

    a quantitative variable that should be included. Therefore, we

    include an entity with attributes relevant to represent this

    phenomenon in Figure 2. The diﬀerent types of social/behavioral

    responses (e.g., contractive, expansive, accommodating) and

    beneﬁts of stakeholders/actors as well as impacts (Biswas and

    Dune, 1971; Abdullaev and Mollinga, 2010; Wheeler et al., 2013;

    Liu et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2015; Vojinovic et al., 2016;

    Srinivasan et al., 2017; Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017; Zomorodian

    et al., 2018; Ženko and Menga, 2019) at both the donor

    and receiver basins should be considered. Figure 2 shows an

    entity named BehavioralResponses with parameters describing

    how behavioral responses from each group of actors can be

    represented in the information model. The responses can be

    further segmented into classes (Neutral, Low, Medium, High)

    according to their level of signiﬁcance or relative importance,

    which can themselves be standardized terms. This entity or the

    sociology component can also be extended to account for changes

    in behavioral responses and interactions through time or adjusted

    to consider the need of the pluralistic water research concept

    (PWR; Evers et al., 2017).

    The discussed model for inter-basin water transfer projects

    may be extended to integrate a farm-level and ﬁeld-level

    data model. Again, the ﬁeld ProjectID can be used to link

    this data model to the example shown in Figure 2. Such a

    model may adapt, mimic, and extend, for example, the ODM2

    discussed above. Depending on the type of farm, the data model

    may contain provision to record farm machinery operation

    information and accordingly may integrate entities for a Farm

    Machinery Management Information System (FMMIS; Fountas

    et al., 2015b). Ultimately, it may be extended to integrate

    components of a Farm Management Information System (FMIS;

    Fountas et al., 2015a). In addition, this data model may also

    contain description to record waste management practices, pest

    management practices, soil properties and water status (soil

    science component) through the ODM extension, phenomic

    data including crop water status (phenomics component) and

    ultimately genomic data (genomics component). For livestock

    farming, Fournel et al. (2017) provide a list of environmental,

    physiological and behavioral variables for farm-level data and

    they fall under the phenomics component and meteorology

    which we assume is part of the hydrology component of the

    proposed framework.

    The current trend in agriculture is toward more complex,

    technologically-enabled farm production systems with increasing

    control and supervision (Lindblom et al., 2017; Wolfert et al.,

    2017; Peng et al., 2020). With the ideas presented in this

    section, we bring forth the vision to treat agricultural production

    as a sociotechnical phenomenon and promote a sociotechnical-

    system approach to data and information models development

    as epitomized by the proposed framework. The discussed data

    model, due to its holistic nature, may be called a Sustainability-

    oriented Agricultural Data Model (SADaM). As highlighted

    above, agricultural hydroinformatics, in its role as a technology

    inﬂuencer, bears the responsibility to build on and adapt existing

    progress and proven best practices in information modeling

    such as the ODM2 to deliver a fully-ﬂedged data model. This

    task constitutes a ﬁrst and foremost step toward building

    a strong foundation for new and more profound changes

    in the agricultural sector. As a consequence, we anticipate

    and discuss below the development of more advanced data

    acquisition systems and tools/middleware enabling direct data

    and metadata streaming to database systems implementing the

    SADaM information model.

    Our attempt to represent qualitative variables as part of

    the information model example in Figure 2 highlights an

    outstanding gap in the literature on socio-hydrology. This is

    the need for the development of a common nomenclature and

    controlled vocabularies to represent qualitative processes such

    as attitudes of stakeholders toward water availability or scarcity.

    Well-known eﬀorts such as the Open Geospatial Consortium

    (OGC), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the

    Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic

    Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI) are of very little or no relevance.

    Nevertheless, Wheeler et al. (2013) lay the groundwork for

    such future research eﬀort on this subject. The development

    of such a data model also involves the need to capture not

    only the semantics of each component, but also the lineage

    relationships between the processes and the resulting outputs as

    part of the metadata development processes. This may ultimately

    lead to a specialized ontology integrating the elements and

    relationships in the proposed framework. This eﬀort may build

    on prior ontology-development eﬀort as this practice has been

    promoted and is widely implemented by the hydroinformatics

    community (Abbott, 1999; Islam and Piasecki, 2006; Beran and

    Piasecki, 2009; Garrido et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Brodaric and

    Hahmann, 2014; Yu et al., 2015; Brodaric et al., 2016).

    3.2. Agricultural Systems Simulations

    Models Development

    We have discussed how the proposed framework can be

    applied to develop linked data models through a discipline-

    delineated entities approach whereby variables are arranged

    under their corresponding component of the framework. The

    same approach can be adopted to architect agricultural systems

    simulation models. The ﬁrst step is to identify the target

    processes to be simulated. These can be crop yields, water

    use, or demand and evapotranspiration rate. The second step

    is then to identify the relevant variables (raw or processed

    data) and new or existing models that output the relevant

    variables (data products) for the identiﬁed target processes. For

    example, the simulation of crop water demands (hydraulics

    component) requires a model (hydrology component) to estimate

    the potential evapotranspiration rate (data product). A more

    complex example can be the simulation of crop growth

    (phenomics component) response to water and nutrients. This

    requires a water budget model (hydrology component), nutrients

    budget model (soil science component), nutrients transport

    model (soil science component), inﬁltration and runoﬀ models

    (hydrology component).

    The identiﬁed models fall under a certain component (e.g.,

    hydrology) but are able to pull data (raw, processed, aggregated,

    model results) from any component with the relevant data. Thus,

    simulation models of various complexity level can be built on

    top of and tap into a database that implements the data model

    discussed above. In such a data system and simulation model

    conﬁguration, the new model results can be saved back to the

    data system with its provenance information (e.g., Rousseau et al.,

    2000). We present in Figure 3 the four-layer skeleton of such a

    system in the form of a multi-layer Artiﬁcial Neural Networks

    architecture for knowledge workﬂows engineering. It shows the

    relationships between: (a) ﬁrst layer: raw data (e.g., temperature

    from sensors), (b) second layer: processed data from the previous

    layer (e.g., minimum and maximum daily temperatures), (c)

    third layer: simple models (e.g., evapotranspiration) that use data

    from either of the ﬁrst two layers or from both of them, and

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    (d) fourth layer: complex physical models (e.g., Hydrus; Simunek

    et al., 1999; AquaCrop; Vanuytrecht et al., 2014; AquaCrop open-

    source version; Foster et al., 2017) that, for example, suggest the

    amount of water to apply for irrigation or quantify crop yield

    response to water. This last layer may also include data-driven

    models (e.g., machine learning models) similar to the example

    reported by Gumiere et al. (2020) and can pull data from any

    combination of the three layers on top.

    The versatility of the framework confers to agricultural

    hydroinformatics the ability to promote sustainability through

    water management-centric practices. These practices are in

    turn supported by a sociotechnical-system approach built on

    information and simulation models. We, therefore, envision

    an agricultural simulation system or environment that boosts

    reproducibility of research through systematic and formal

    records of the relationships among raw data, the processes that

    produce results and the results themselves as highlighted by

    Pasquier et al. (2017). This feature of the framework makes

    it particularly well-suited to support the delivery of integrated

    modeling structures for complex agricultural systems using, for

    example, the system dynamics method (e.g., see Berthiaume et al.,

    2005). This method has gained grounds in a broad spectrum

    of applications, primarily when water resources and agricultural

    production systems sustainability objectives are pursued (Walters

    et al., 2016; Zomorodian et al., 2018). It subdivides a system

    into an interconnected series of ﬂows (inputs and outputs) and

    stocks (reservoirs) aﬀecting one another through a feedback

    mechanism, thereby providing decision-makers with possible

    consequences of system perturbations (Zomorodian et al., 2018).

    A preliminary example of the application of the system dynamics

    approach to simulate agricultural production systems (crop and

    livestock) sustainability by Walters et al. (2016) demonstrates

    that ﬁve (5) clusters of ﬂows and stocks (Economics, Crop

    Production, Livestock Production, Environmental Quality, and

    Social Quality) are reﬂected in our proposed framework.

    3.3. Simulation Models Source Codes

    Engineering

    The framework brings forth the ability to guide the engineering

    of simulation models source codes. In line with the new

    architecture of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology

    Transfer (DSSAT) cropping system model presented in Jones

    et al. (2003), the framework imposes a modular structure in

    which components separate along scientiﬁc discipline lines;

    it is structured to allow easy replacement or addition of

    components or sub-components, and enable greater cooperation

    in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge

    to solve problems at all levels. In addition, it promotes the

    granularity of simulation models development by supporting

    the generation of source codes incrementally through the

    combination of atomically-deﬁned model algorithm blocks. A

    block can be developed to comply with the Single Responsibility

    Principle or Separation of Concerns of software engineering

    (Martin, 2002) and thus, is responsible for a single task (e.g.,

    computation of hourly averages). An anticipated beneﬁt is that

    a block of source codes responsible to compute a speciﬁc data

    product within or for a model can be developed under one

    component of the framework and reused under any other

    component of the framework. Thus, from a software engineering

    point of view, a block of codes may be designed to serve as a single

    channel to output a speciﬁc time series from the database or data

    product from a model to any component or any model within a

    component of the framework.

    4. OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

    FOR AGRICULTURAL

    HYDROINFORMATICS

    Although the agricultural domain is well-stratiﬁed with its

    techniques and approaches for knowledge generation and

    consumption, we anticipate that hydroinformatics will ﬁnd

    many not-currently-apparent opportunities to underpin social,

    institutional, and technological innovations around water

    resources management toward agricultural sustainability. We

    anticipate that more opportunities will occur when, for example,

    the agricultural hydroinformaticist explores the business and

    phenomenological dimensions of hydroinformatics. In line with

    this “entrepreneurial” endeavor, Kamilaris et al. (2017) call for

    the creation of radically new services to promote, for example,

    the practices and beneﬁts of (big) data collection and analysis in

    agriculture. Next, we highlight opportunities and challenges to

    accelerate social and technological transformations through the

    application of hydroinformatics in agriculture.

    4.1. High-Performance Data Acquisition

    Systems Development

    The complexity of a data management system that implements

    the information model discussed here will evidently require more

    automation and capabilities from data acquisition systems. In

    this regard, a best practice we have learned through experience

    is that the development in data acquisition systems must take

    place after the data management planning phase. This constitutes

    the main reason why we introduce the discussion on data and

    information modeling ﬁrst. The primary rationale for such order

    is that when data acquisition devices/systems are designed and

    developed with no consideration of the (digital) constraints

    imposed by a data management system that prioritizes data

    standardization, they tend to obey what we may call the “data

    logging rules or philosophy.” This implies that the devices or data

    acquisition systems (i.e., current dataloggers and sensors) simply

    collect and operate on data values. In other words, they have no

    formal support for metadata annotations, a critically important

    feature to reduce the manual data-to-metadata-mapping eﬀort

    on data managers (when data standardization is adopted) and

    increase the useability and value of the data. Furthermore, the

    conﬁguration process (e.g., programming) of those devices often

    allows the user or operator to inﬂuence the data production

    process. This inﬂuence occurs through tasks that are as simple as

    allowing the operator to set names for variables being measured.

    This is an outlet for all three types of heterogeneities (schematic,

    semantic, syntactic) in the collected data. As pointed out by

    Kruize et al. (2013), it usually results in substantial manual

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    FIGURE 3 | Architecture of the envisioned knowledge workﬂow management of agricultural
    hydroinformatics.

    and cognitive eﬀorts to preprocess and harmonize the collected

    data. In addition, it becomes more complicated to annotate the

    data with corresponding metadata. These shortcomings are also

    present in data acquisition systems used in the agricultural sector.

    A review of the literature reveals that current (farms) ﬁeld

    data acquisition systems are not designed to be, and thus, are

    not considered as an integral part of FMISs (see Nikkilä et al.,

    2010; Kaloxylos et al., 2012; Kruize et al., 2013; Zia et al., 2013;

    Fountas et al., 2015a; López-Riquelme et al., 2017; Paraforos

    et al., 2017; for examples of FMIS building blocks). Such a

    technical deﬁciency or schism may explain why data acquisition

    and management, for on-farm decision support, research and

    policy decision-making purposes, is recognized as the most

    pressing limitations of agricultural systems models (Capalbo

    et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2017). In the context of precision

    agriculture, which is a growingly accepted practice to achieve

    sustainability, these limitations are mainly attributed to the

    heterogeneities of the collected and available datasets (Nikkilä

    et al., 2010; Wolfert et al., 2017). Two widely cited reasons are

    that the data ﬂows involved originate from various instruments

    and technologies (Fournel et al., 2017; El Bilali and Allahyari,

    2018), and from several (sub)disciplines and sources (Capalbo

    et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2017). Therefore, the development

    of more advanced technologies for data acquisition that resolve

    schematic, semantic and syntactic heterogeneities is another area

    wherein the impacts of hydroinformatics is most needed. The

    hydroinformatics community has made signiﬁcant development

    in this area with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT)

    paradigm, low-cost, and open-source software and hardware

    (e.g., Wong and Kerkez, 2016; Horsburgh et al., 2019). Although

    in some hydroinformatics case studies, the devices automatically

    ingest the collected data to a standardized data management

    system, they still adopt the data logging philosophy, reveling an

    opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to introduce some

    new technologies using new approaches. Below, we introduced

    characteristics of potential data acquisition systems that are more

    suitable to close existing gaps toward a more integrated farm

    sensing and FMIS.

    A potential innovative solution that could get at least three

    birds with one stone is a new generation (second generation with

    respect to data loggers) of sensing systems for both point-based

    and spatial monitoring designed to be deployed in the ﬁeld with

    a (minimum) knowledge base of the object being monitored, in

    addition to user-deﬁned deployment-context metadata. Celicourt

    et al. (2020) have created a preliminary prototype of such

    system mainly to cope with the data management issues

    previously mentioned. An immediate and ﬁrst beneﬁt is that

    the devices (for point-based and geospatial observations) could

    work autonomously and in synergy to make decisions in the

    ﬁeld. Second, they can themselves be programmed or conﬁgured

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    10

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    to automatically create new metadata and/or derive metadata

    from original deployment-context metadata and document the

    decisions made. Subsequently, the documented decision along

    with farm ﬁeld statuses may ultimately be submitted via some

    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the backend of

    a cyberinfrastructure. Third, the devices may be also designed

    to output human and machine-readable data in standardized

    formats such as WaterML (Almoradie et al., 2013).

    A prototype of this second generation of data acquisition

    system may simply consist in a Soil Matric Tension (SMT) sensor

    along with other relevant sensors attached to a microcomputer

    (e.g., Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black) or microcontroller (e.g.,

    Arduino), but with onboard deployment-context information as

    highlighted in the aforementioned ODM version 2.0 example, in

    addition to farm characteristics. The knowledge base can contain

    information that is as minimal as the root zone tension range

    of −4 to −7.5 kPa and water table depth range of 500–600 mm

    (Vanderleest et al., 2016) for cranberry productivity optimization,

    for example. In situations where an irrigation event occurs in

    a speciﬁc ﬁeld, the data acquisition system can be programmed

    to automatically generate the data and metadata necessary (e.g.,

    water volume, duration, soil matric potential, weather conditions,

    ﬁeld or bed identiﬁer, etc.) to document such event according

    to a relevant agri-food standard. The ﬁle may be downloaded

    on-site, or the content can be encoded and transmitted to a

    web server where it is accessible to a FMIS. This latter may, in

    turn, formats and shares the received information using the same

    standard format.

    This generation of sensing devices (front-end) can be

    integrated in a feedback loop with crops and livestock models

    (backend of a cyberinfrastructure) to assess the inevitable gap

    between experimental results and ﬁeld implementation and

    take on-the-ﬂy corrective measures. Thorkilsen and Dynesen

    (2001) implemented a feedback monitoring programme with a

    similar mechanism in the context of the aforementioned Oresund

    project which was quite eﬀective in ensuring the fulﬁllment of

    environmental objectives and design criteria during and after the

    project construction phase.

    A third and more futuristic generation of farm monitoring

    systems include those based on artiﬁcial intelligence techniques

    (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) along with

    other relevant techniques to automatically determine relevant

    information about the farm ﬁelds (e.g., geospatial extent, type

    of crop, growth stage, crop statuses) being monitored. Contrary

    to the second generation previously mentioned, this one would

    be capable of generating nearly all of the necessary metadata

    (auto-generated metadata) needed to document the collected

    information including geographic positions of the sensors or

    all components of overall sensing system. Such a system would

    require a new kind of “built-in” metadata that is relevant to help,

    in a ﬁrst stage, the interpretation of the auto-generated metadata,

    and in a second stage, the collected data.

    As an example, such a third-generation ﬁeld-data acquisition

    system may consist of a SMT sensor that automatically reports

    its deployment depth (e.g., 250 mm) as a piece of metadata.

    This SMT sensor may rely on either a patched depth sensor

    (assuming in prototyping stage) or an integrated one (e.g., using

    Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation (RFID) technology) that behaves

    as multi-parameter sensor. In this situation, the depth sensor has

    its own, preferably built-in, metadata (e.g., accuracy, variable,

    unit, etc.) that describes the depth measurement for the SMT

    sensor. The SMT sensor also has a similar set of, preferably

    built-in, metadata. In this example, the interpretation of the

    SMT sensor data involves the knowledge of: (a) the sensor

    metadata itself, (b) the auto-generated metadata by the depth

    sensor and (c) the metadata of the depth sensor. This last set

    of metadata is a new kind of data that bears the potential to

    help in understanding the ﬁrst two sets (a, b) of metadata and

    is, therefore, a “meta-metadata” or “super-metadata” or “root

    metadata.” The SMT sensor may be further retroﬁtted with a

    GPS device and an accelerometer to automatically report its

    deployment position (latitude, longitude, and/or altitude). This

    would further simplify the metadata provision process and allows

    automatic management (commissioning and decommissioning)

    of the sensor. In this case, the characteristics of the GPS

    device and accelerometer would serve as additional super-

    metadata for the SMT sensor. Although the hydroinformatics

    community has not dealt with the management of this new

    kind of metadata before, the experiences developed therein in

    terms of metadata management and ontology development may

    guide the path forward, as this concept is applied to data and

    information modeling.

    The ideas presented above set agricultural hydroinformatics

    in a position to help address the major lag time in systems to

    exploit new advances in data, information and communication

    technology (Berger and Hovav, 2013; Fountas et al., 2015a; Antle

    et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2017). Consequently, recent eﬀorts to

    improve and accelerate the rate of agricultural innovation and

    meeting the growing global need for food and ﬁber have been

    limited by the need for improved data, models and knowledge

    products (Fountas et al., 2015a; Capalbo et al., 2017; Jones et al.,

    2017). The ideas presented here as possible pathways for new

    sensing systems for farm monitoring are intended to alleviate the

    usability problems and the requirements for farmers to manually

    input data that they are not familiar with. These two obstacles are

    identiﬁed as important limiting factors to the adoption of FMIS

    (Alvarez and Nuthall, 2006; Nikkilä et al., 2010; Kruize et al.,

    2013).

    4.2. Novel Approaches to Simulation

    Models Development and Integration

    A common limitation of most crop and environmental models

    is that the model is distributed solely as a compiled software

    package (Foster et al., 2017). Furthermore, Jones et al. (2017)

    acknowledge that major advances are needed to achieve the

    next generation of simulation models that move beyond the

    inclusion of economic and sustainability issues to meet, for

    example, the agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

    In line with this vision, our proposed framework promotes

    the level of ﬂexibility in terms of modeling approach, models

    implementation and modularity, types of models, and models-

    integration extent needed to tackle the complexity of agricultural

    systems modeling. To this end, the development of open

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    11

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    web-based computational infrastructures or tools ecosystems

    that support the creation of models source codes through

    the combination of atomically-deﬁned models components or

    subsystems components may be handy. To facilitate model

    integration, such a tool ecosystem may be designed to

    automatically encapsulate the generated source codes for each

    model within the structure of a chosen modeling framework (e.g.,

    OpenMI; Gregersen et al., 2007). Although the implementation

    process can be quite a complex task to achieve a resulting

    set of coupled models that is as simple as the prescriptive

    sociohydrology framework presented by Elshafei et al. (2014), it

    would be instrumental in delivering truly reusable, modular and

    highly granular models. Such an infrastructure bears the potential

    to be transformed into a new kind of decision-support system

    which is that of the creation of integrated agricultural models and

    even DSS, thus a meta-DSS. Last but not least, it may be further

    extended to enable the generation of the resulting models in

    diﬀerent programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C, C++, Python)

    using the Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) concept (Noonan, 1985).

    This is another opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to

    play its role of a technology inﬂuencer.

    4.3. Innovative Technologies Adoption

    We have hitherto identiﬁed a number of avenues to overcome

    challenges pertaining mostly to improvement in agricultural

    data quality and management along with model implementation

    and a new kind of DSS to facilitate models integration.

    However, these challenges represent quite a narrow view of

    the challenges ecosystem to achieve agricultural sustainability

    and meet future demands for food and ﬁber. Here, we aim

    to move the horizon a little further to include those related

    to innovations adoption with a focus on precision agriculture,

    which is our paradigm of interest. Adoption challenges are

    preponderant as they represent serious barriers toward practical

    applications, improvement, adaptation, and maturation of

    innovations to empower farmers of all classes as genuine

    stakeholders. The objective is on-farm inputs optimization to

    achieve lower food production costs and food prices, higher

    inputs productivity, environmental sustainability, food security,

    and safety.

    Despite the experienced and potential beneﬁts of precision

    agricultural technologies (PATs), including proﬁtability and

    productivity (Capalbo et al., 2017; Griﬃn et al., 2017; El Bilali

    and Allahyari, 2018), their adoption is still limited in farming

    practice. This can be seen as a particular case of the more general

    problems of adoption and diﬀusion of new technologies or

    products that also occur outside the agricultural domain studied

    by Moore (1991) as the chasm theory. In the agriculture domain,

    a major impediment to adoption is the lack of technology delivery

    mechanism (Zhang et al., 2002) that often hinders the perceived

    beneﬁts and usability to justify upfront investments in new

    technologies. This stumbling factor is often attributed to the

    implementation problem of FMISs incorporating support for

    farm managers to implement decisions (McCown, 2002; Rossi

    et al., 2014; Lindblom et al., 2017). They fail to capture the “tacit”

    knowledge and practical needs of farmers and are, therefore, not

    adapted to the trade-oﬀs and high complexity that characterize

    farmers’ decision making processes (Lindblom et al., 2017).

    This results in what McCown et al. (2009) called the relevance

    gap, a discrepancy between scientiﬁc knowledge implemented

    in agricultural decision support systems (AgriDSS) and practical

    needs and experience-based knowledge of farmers.

    The relevance gap indicates that the sociotechnological nature

    of AgriDSS has not been (adequately) captured over the last 30

    years of research and development (Lindblom et al., 2017). It

    is also supporting the evidence that the transformation in the

    role of farmers, agricultural technologists, and scientists from

    knowers to consumers of knowledge, whereby the latter becomes

    a kind of product to be consumed through socioinstitutional

    arrangements, has yet to occur. Such a transformation has

    been instrumental to the success of hydroinformatics as it

    is applied to water systems (Thorkilsen and Dynesen, 2001;

    Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev, 2014) and it is now an essential

    aspect of the discipline (Vojinovic and Abbott, 2017). It is

    also a precondition for agriculture to enter the postmodern era

    and for agricultural hydroinformatics to become a postmodern

    technology that transforms farmers’ behaviors toward water

    management practices in particular and agricultural production

    practices in general.

    The relevance gap is driving a growing interest in the adoption

    of sociotechnical approaches to agricultural technologies in

    general and (big) data management and DSS development

    in particular by integrating stakeholders in the development

    process (Rossi et al., 2014; Fountas et al., 2015a; Janssen et al.,

    2017; Jones et al., 2017; Lundström and Lindblom, 2018; Rose

    et al., 2018a,b; Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Jakku et al., 2019; Rupnik

    et al., 2019). Such approaches are implemented through a

    number of so-called sustainability theoretical and conceptual

    frameworks that include the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP),

    the social practice theory discussed by Jakku et al. (2019) and

    the Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS) approach introduced

    by Kilelu et al. (2013). However, the eﬀorts appear to be at an

    infancy stage. Nevertheless, this convergence in development

    approaches toward what we can call the hydroinformatics

    ways of working further justify its relevance to agriculture. It

    presents an opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics to

    promote and accelerate the adoption of existing and future

    technologies in agriculture to deliver better decisions. That

    is the kind of situation therein Abbott and Jonoski (2001)

    anticipated hydroinformatics could play a vital role in producing

    and consuming conjunctive (social and technical) knowledge

    that relates water-dependent soil-cultural practices and plant

    cultivation practices in new ways to promote justiﬁable

    productivity. To this end, they have proposed a three-part

    conceptual framework representing a generic hydroinformatics

    knowledge self-management system for knowledge-intensive

    applications such as precision agriculture and aquaculture,

    health

    care

    services.

    al.’s

    (2012)

    view

    of

    future Farm Management Systems shares some similarities

    with the proposed system. However, Abbott and Jonoski

    (2001) acknowledge that the realization of a corresponding

    prototype represents the greatest sociotechnical challenge of

    hydroinformatics due to socioinstitutional arrangements it

    may require.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    The current trend toward the conceptualization of water

    systems as cyber-physical infrastructures (Makropoulos and

    Savi´c, 2019) is another convergence point between ongoing

    developments on water systems management and (precision)

    agriculture. This concept oﬀers the opportunity to develop an

    integrated data infrastructure and drive real-time operational

    decisions along with predictive capabilities to improve farm-level

    management and water systems operations (Wolfert et al., 2014,

    2017; Capalbo et al., 2017). However, the volume and variety

    of data involved in precision agriculture, acceptedly named

    “big data,” are far more complex than those in water systems.

    Cyber-physical conﬁgurations enabled by the IoT paradigm

    and Cloud Computing technologies hold an opportunity to

    transform the entire food supply chain into smart webs of

    connected, context-sensitive, uniquely-identiﬁable, remotely-

    controlled things that are context-sensitive and can be identiﬁed

    and controlled remotely (Wolfert et al., 2014). Furthermore, these

    conﬁgurations can be viewed as an extension of either of the two

    generations of data acquisition systems proposed above. They

    set the stage for a more advanced farm management technology

    ecosystem enabling end-to-end support for the FAIR (Findable,

    Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles (Wilkinson

    et al., 2016) and also the implementation of the Digital Twin

    concept (Ding et al., 2019).

    The practical implementation or, at the very least, a prototype

    of these conﬁgurations is indeed challenging (Wolfert et al.,

    2014, 2017), but a lean and agile prototyping approach can shed

    enough light to move the development forward while opening

    up pathways to many opportunities. From a technical point of

    view, implementations with a focus on “big data” management

    may play a preponderant role in engineering the aforementioned

    whole-system data model (SADaM) as the “big data” paradigm

    hauls a growing emphasis on metadata for data provenance

    (Janssen et al., 2017; Wolfert et al., 2017; Coble et al., 2018).

    From a socioinstitutional point of view, the adoption of the “big

    data” approach will certainly highlight factors and conditions

    that may inﬂuence the uptake of these new approaches to farm

    management. The complexity of repatriating and processing

    large private and public datasets is perceived as a possible cause

    of the deceiving adoption of precision agriculture technologies

    (Lawes and Robertson, 2011). In this regard, Wolfert et al.

    (2017) noticed signiﬁcant shifts in roles and power relations

    among diﬀerent players composing the agricultural “big data”

    landscape. But, this landscape, as described, does not hitherto

    contain any knowledge provider in the “hydroinformatics”

    sense as deﬁned by Abbott and Jonoski (2001), Abbott and

    Vojinovic (2010a). Nevertheless, owing to the entwined nature

    of knowledge and power, we anticipate the growing dynamics

    in those power relations will mutate into the Michel Foucault’s

    problematics of “power/knowledge” structures. Fortunately, the

    three-part conceptual framework by Abbott and Jonoski (2001),

    discussed earlier on, has been proposed to speciﬁcally invert these

    structures through an inversion in knowledge relations. Realizing

    a smoothly-working prototype of this proposed example will

    certainly bring around many business opportunities which is

    a basic tenet of hydroinformatics (Abbott, 1999; Abbott and

    Jonoski, 2001).

    Beyond the relevance gap, a speciﬁc, but determinant,

    component of stakeholders engagement that remains a serious

    stumbling factor to the theoretical and conceptual frameworks

    mentioned above when applied in agri-food sustainability

    transitions is the penetration of innovative knowledge into the

    mainstream agricultural regime (Ingram, 2015). For instance, the

    most prominent transition framework applied on agricultural

    sociotechnical

    transitions,

    namely

    Multi-Level

    Perspective

    (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2010), suﬀers from a variety of

    inadequacies highlighted in Hassink et al. (2018) and Ingram

    (2015). Consequently, it is increasingly being complemented

    with other frameworks focusing on human-related and social

    factors (El Bilali, 2018) which is a symptom of the inaptitude

    of the broad range of existing frameworks to eﬀectively tackle

    agricultural sustainability transitions. From a hydroinformatics

    stand-point, we are tempted to consider this strong resistance of

    mainstream agricultural regime to niche knowledge as a situation

    embodying

    the

    same

    problematics

    of

    “power/knowledge”

    mentioned above. Accordingly, for having overcome resistance

    in organizations strongly stratiﬁed (again, in the sociotechnical

    sense) as highlighted with two examples in the introduction,

    hydroinformatics is in a unique position to “crack” mainstream

    agricultural regime strata, by analogy to the hydraulic fracturing

    technique for natural gas extraction. In this regard, Abbott

    (1999) suggested that the problem be tackled through (and

    we quote) “the provision of knowledge to very many persons

    over electronic networks [sociotechnical environments], and

    [more importantly, the provision] of capabilities for people to

    express their fears, concerns and aspirations over these same

    networks, and thence to interact and organize themselves.” Thus,

    this is a further opportunity for agricultural hydroinformatics

    to play an underpinning role in facilitating the creation of

    sociotechnical environments in which the transformations or

    transitions necessary to achieve sustainable agricultural systems

    can be catalyzed.

    4.4. Streamlined Agricultural Knowledge

    Management Workﬂows

    The data heterogeneity problem in data sources discussed above

    has led to a number of scattered standards development eﬀorts,

    including data management standards and data vocabularies

    (White et al., 2013), ﬁeld devices communication (e.g., CANbus,

    ModBus; Suprem et al., 2013; Ojha et al., 2015), and thesaurus-

    and ontology-based developments (Janssen et al., 2017; Kamilaris

    et al., 2017). However, a superﬁcial examination of some of them

    reveals that they suﬀer from several shortcomings, including

    incompleteness and inadequate description of variable names

    (e.g., use of abbreviations) and physical units which increases the

    mental workload necessary to work with them.

    Data heterogeneity resolution at the cyber-infrastructure level

    is a particular area wherein the hydroinformatics community

    has made signiﬁcant practical advances (Horsburgh et al., 2008,

    2016; Beran and Piasecki, 2009; Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev,

    2014). A major example is the CUAHSI’s Hydrologic Information

    System (HIS), developed as a cyberinfrastructure to support the

    management and dissemination of ﬁxed-point ﬁeld observations

    Frontiers in Water | www.frontiersin.org

    13

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    (Horsburgh et al., 2008). The system has seen widespread

    adoption in enabling the interoperability of observations

    through the development and standardized use of the ODM

    discussed above. Thus, data heterogeneity resolution at both

    the instrumentation and cyber-infrastructure levels represents

    the last piece of the opportunities puzzle for hydroinformatics

    to fully play its role of a technology inﬂuencer. In this context,

    agricultural hydroinformatics is a prime candidate to develop

    fully streamlined agricultural knowledge management workﬂows

    that adhere to the architecture presented in Figure 3. Such an

    architecture represents an instance of the anticipated knowledge

    chain concept in the form of a set of linked steps by which

    data are processed into information, knowledge and ﬁnally

    wisdom as used in decision-making processes discussed by

    Janssen et al. (2017).

    We highlight that special attention needs to be paid to the

    treatment of the units in knowledge management workﬂows,

    which may further complicate the integration of datasets.

    Celicourt and Piasecki (2016) have already developed a unit-

    of-measurements management and conversion tool named

    “HydroUnits” based on the units Controlled Vocabularies

    developed by CUAHSI. Thus, we are aware of the deﬁciencies

    and opportunities to improve this existing set of units. The

    improvement would include, for example, compliance with the

    Uniﬁed Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) to achieve greater

    interoperability (Schadow and McDonald, 2013). In addition, the

    CUAHSI units certainly need to be revised and augmented to

    become what we may call “AgroUnits.” This latter may ultimately

    serve to improve the deﬁciencies of existing ontologies used

    in agriculture.

    The development of agricultural knowledge management

    workﬂows would be an important step toward the next

    generation of FMIS as water resources management support is

    identiﬁed as a key bottleneck that hinders farm eﬃciency (Kruize

    et al., 2013). In addition, it creates the opportunity to incorporate

    support for whole-farm-system data provenance capture and

    preservation, in addition to traceability along the whole food

    system chain. This holds the beneﬁts of helping companies,

    governments, and farmers in the food chain to make informed

    decisions (Janssen et al., 2017).

    5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

    Agricultural production sustainability has become a critical, but

    challenging approach to meet food demands of the growing

    global

    population.

    This

    requires

    major

    transformations

    in

    agricultural

    practices

    through

    technological,

    social,

    and

    institutional

    innovations.

    Water

    resources

    planning,

    management and usage at the ﬁeld, farm, river basin, regional,

    and national scales represent a pivotal strategy to underpin these

    transformations. In this context, we have introduced a blueprint

    for a new interdisciplinary ﬁeld of research in agriculture

    named agricultural hydroinformatics. It is intended to employ

    hydroinformatics approaches to promote a holistic approach to

    agricultural water and knowledge management by considering

    the economic, engineering, social, hydrologic, environmental,

    and even political factors that inﬂuence agricultural water

    resources planning, management, and usage. Furthermore, it

    must foster adoption of technologies as a path forward to achieve

    sustainable agriculture in light of the anticipated increase in

    agricultural water demand due to climate change impacts and

    global population growth.

    We have introduced a new general conceptual framework that

    stems from the particularities of the sociotechnical dimension

    of using hydroinformatics in agriculture. The framework is

    designed to support, not only integrated agricultural resources

    and assets management, but also agricultural sustainability in

    general. It can also be used as a simple tool to gauge the degree

    of integration of (agricultural) water resources management

    programs or initiatives as it depicts the components (e.g., soil,

    water, land, crop, people) that may need to be considered. It also

    enables the development of an entirely integrated but discipline-

    delineated knowledge management workﬂows for agricultural

    production consisting of raw data, metadata-annotated data,

    storage and dissemination, models, and decision support system.

    We acknowledge that this blueprint for the proposed

    framework is freshly introduced and therefore, it has not yet

    been vetted by the hydroinformatics and agricultural research

    communities. Although it is developed to be as generic as

    possible, we believe it may evolve in many ways and under

    many circumstances. For example, the framework may evolve

    by integrating new ﬁelds of research, disciplines and practices

    as they emerge. The introduction of new ﬁelds and practices

    may lead to splitting a component or aggregation of two or

    more components of the framework. Sociohydrology is a typical

    example of an emerging ﬁeld of research that may lead to some

    transformations of the framework. These anticipated mutations,

    therefore, will give rise to more specialized as well as more

    mature and either more specialized or more generic versions

    of the framework. Multidisciplinary forms of intra- and inter-

    universities collaborative eﬀorts as well as development of new

    curricula to train agricultural hydroinformaticists will play an

    important role in paving the way for this new ﬁeld of research

    and framework to gain momentum. This is challenging, as

    the topics to be covered may range from information and

    decision theories to social sciences to legal sciences to ethics

    and philosophy of science; to name but a few. These initiatives

    will serve as a ground work for agricultural hydroinformatics

    to make a more signiﬁcant impact in driving agricultural

    sustainability transitions.

    Some major development must also occur in various

    technology-related research areas through collaboration between

    universities, research centers and technology companies applying

    the business dimension of hydroinformatics. These include, for

    example, the development of self-managed in-situ sensors, farm

    machinery and unmanned automated vehicles (UAVs) systems

    that are easy to deploy and require as little human intervention as

    possible. An important aspect of this self-management capability

    includes, for example, the embedding of artiﬁcial intelligence

    algorithms to enable sensing and control systems to perform and

    record automated signal and data quality control procedures.

    Another aspect is the automated management of both raw

    and processed data through the development of standardized

    14

    December 2020 | Volume 2 | Article 586516

    Celicourt et al.

    Agricultural Hydroinformatics

    data models with provision for suﬃcient ancillary information

    to facilitate data interpretation, retrieval and integration. A

    third and critical aspect is the involvement of stakeholders

    including farmers throughout the research and development

    processes to tackle the knowledge and technology relevance

    issue and facilitate the adoption of resulting technologies. The

    phenomenological dimension of hydroinformatics will play a

    signiﬁcant role here. This latter aspect may be instrumental in

    gauging the level of system intelligence needed at the farm level

    and the cloud level.

    Lastly, the transformation in the role of farmers, agricultural

    technologists, and scientists from knowers to consumers of

    knowledge represents a milestone for agriculture to enter the

    postmodern era and for agricultural hydroinformatics to become

    a postmodern technology. Therefore, research and development

    eﬀorts must be conjugated toward a knowledge self-management

    system prototype as described in the paper to reverse the

    growing power/knowledge relationships related to innovative

    technologies adoption, and concepts such as big data and

    knowledge-intensive agriculture. This would be a turning point

    toward the co-creation of knowledge to the beneﬁts of all

    categories of farmers.

    It is when these ideas are turned into practical applications

    through

    the

    establishment

    of

    appropriate

    and

    adequate

    sociotechnical arrangements, as well as the provision of

    personalized and customized services with tangible beneﬁts, that

    agricultural hydroinformatics will fully play its role as a blueprint

    for the adoption of information technologies in agriculture to

    the beneﬁt of all farmers.

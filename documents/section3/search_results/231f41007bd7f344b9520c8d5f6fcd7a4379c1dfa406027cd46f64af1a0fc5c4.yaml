    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    The problem of real-time irrigation scheduling under limited water supply is considered.
    The goal is to develop an irrigation operation policy which maximizes crop yields
    and is responsive to current season changes in weather and other variables. Because
    irrigation decisions are sequential and dependent on crop and soil water status,
    and also because crop yields can only be known at the end of the season, the decisions
    are arrived at by a two-stage process. In the first or the design stage, irrigations
    are planned for the entire season at weekly intervals using historical data and
    an optimal irrigation scheduling model. In the second stage, the decisions for
    the subsequent weeks are revised each week after updating the status of the system
    with real time data up to that week and solving the irrigation optimization model
    once again for the new conditions. Thus, each week an irrigation decision is made,
    the entire planning horizon is kept in view. The procedure is illustrated by application
    to a case study. References (13) N.H. Rao Field test of a simple soil water balance

    Water Management Citation Excerpt : However, the above deterministic optimization
    models had difficulties in handling various uncertain inputs existing in the agricultural
    water management problems, such as water inflow, water requirement targets and
    crop prices. In order to tackle the above inputs uncertainties, a number of fuzzy
    mathematical programming, interval parameter programming, and stochastic mathematical
    programming methods were proposed for agricultural water management (Alaya et
    al., 2003; Du et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2012a,b; Li et al.,
    2011; Lu et al., 2012; Kaviani et al., 2015; Mujumdar and Ramesh, 1997; Rao et

    1996; Yang et al., 2005; Zeng et al., 2010). Among these methods, interval stochastic
    programming is effective for solving problems where the related input data are
    uncertain but could be expressed as interval values or probability distributions.

    complicated by uncertainty in rainfall which none of the methods have considered
    and actual weather data are used instead of forecasts to test the method. Some
    works use dynamic programming to optimize inter-seasonal and intra-seasonal water
    allocations subject to seasonal water limitations (Bras and Cordova (1981); Dudley
    et al. (1971); Yaron and Dinar (1982); Rao et al. (1992); Protopapas and Georgakakos
    (1990); Sunantara and Ramirez (1997)). Nonetheless, getting no feedback on crop
    soil conditions during the calculation stages, could lead to large propagation
    errors. Show abstract Land and water management planning for increasing farm income

    1992; Naadimuthu et al., 1999; Shangguan et al., 2002; Karamouz et al., 2004;
    Li et al., 2011), genetic algorithms (Holland, 1975; Oliveira and Loucks, 1997;

    Safavi et al., 2009; Nicklow et al., 2010), and artificial neural networks (Rogers
    and Dowla, 1994; Rao et al., 2006; Safavi et al., 2010) have also been used for
    planning and management of land and water resources under specific conditions.
    The optimal allocation of resources in real field conditions is more challenging

    Get rights and content Abstract The projected increases in World population and
    need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions
    in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground
    Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or
    completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge
    from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground
    sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of
    growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art
    communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and
    communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in
    the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported.
    Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified. Previous

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are
    intended to use for permanent storage of the data collected, real-time processing
    of the field condition, crop related decision making, and integration with other
    databases (e.g., weather, soil). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The indoor testbed [133]. Moreover, a testbed
    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard
    [6]. Senet operates two public cloud-based networks, Managed Network Services
    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field
    mapping for precision agriculture. Research challenges in IOUT are presented in

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    Metrics 31 Jul 2023 Status: a revised version of this preprint is currently under
    review for the journal HESS. Comparison of four machine learning models for forecasting
    daily reference evaporation based on public weather forecast data Yunfeng Liang,
    Dongpu Feng, and Zhaojun Sun Abstract. Real-time accurate prediction of daily
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is critical for real-time irrigation decisions
    and water resource management. Although many public weather forecast-based machine
    learning models have been successfully used for daily ETo prediction, these models
    are developed with long-term historical daily observed meteorological data. The
    use of training and testing samples from different data sources can lead to the
    selection of the best model, and the performance of the best model for predicting
    daily ETo is not ideal. In this study, based on Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) 56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equations, four machine learning models (multilayer
    perceptron (MLPo), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoosto), light gradient boosting
    machine (LightGBMo), and gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost1o))
    were trained and validated with daily observed meteorological data from 1995–2015
    and 2016–2019, respectively, and five machine learning models (MLPp, XGBoostp,
    LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) were trained and validated with daily public
    weather forecast data with a 1-day lead time (2014–2018 and 2019, respectively).
    Based on public weather forecast and daily observed meteorological data (2020–2021),
    the predicted daily ETo performance of nine machine learning models (MLPo, XGBoosto,
    LightGBMo, CatBoost1o, MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) was
    compared. The results show that for all three studied climate zones, the performance
    of the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day
    advance is better than that of the four models developed based on daily observed
    meteorological data with corresponding input combinations, and the mean MAE and
    RMSE ranges for the four models (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost1) in the
    three studied climate zones were reduced by 2.93 %–11.67 % and 2.20 %–9.46 %,
    respectively, and the mean R range was improved by 1.31 %–5.31 %. The top three
    models for the AR climate zone were XGBoostp, LightGBMp, and MLPp, the top three
    models for the SAR climate zone were MLPp, XGBoostp, and LightGBMp, and the top
    three models for the SHZ climate zone were XGBoostp, MLPp, and LightGBMp. In addition,
    the prediction performance for daily ETo is found to be highest in winter and
    lowest in summer in all three climate zones. Wspd from public weather forecasts
    was the most important source of daily ETo error in model predictions for the
    AR climate zone, followed by SDun, Tmax, and Tmin, while SDun from public weather
    forecasts was the most important source of daily ETo error in model predictions
    for the SAR (SHZ) climate zone, followed by Wspd, Tmax, and Tmin (Tmax, Wspd,
    and Tmin). How to cite. Liang, Y., Feng, D., and Sun, Z.: Comparison of four machine

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Water is becoming scarcer. The unmonitored control
    and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate
    global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth
    and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table
    and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In
    this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages
    ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while
    enhancing crops’ yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that
    leverages cost-effectiveness . Commercial solutions are costly and thus become
    impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around
    three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation
    of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring
    using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration
    promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in
    water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and
    quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution
    has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have
    shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption
    (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE

    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.

    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    \ (ET) data for scheduling irrigations on vegetable farms is\nchallenging due\
    \ to imprecise crop coefﬁcients, time consuming computations, and the need to\n\
    simultaneously manage many ﬁelds. Meanwhile, the adoption of soil moisture monitoring\
    \ in\nvegetables has historically been limited by sensor accuracy and cost, as\
    \ well as labor required for\ninstallation, removal, and collection of readings.\
    \ With recent improvements in sensor technology,\npublic weather-station networks,\
    \ satellite and aerial imaging, wireless communications, and cloud\ncomputing,\
    \ many of the difﬁculties in using ET data and soil moisture sensors for irrigation\n\
    scheduling of vegetables can now be addressed. Web and smartphone applications\
    \ have been\ndeveloped that automate many of the calculations involved in ET-based\
    \ irrigation scheduling.\nSoil moisture sensor data can be collected through wireless\
    \ networks and accessed using web browser\nor smartphone apps. Energy balance\
    \ methods of crop ET estimation, such as eddy covariance\nand Bowen ratio, provide\
    \ research options for further developing and evaluating crop coefﬁcient\nguidelines\
    \ of vegetables, while recent advancements in surface renewal instrumentation\
    \ have led\nto a relatively low-cost tool for monitoring crop water requirement\
    \ in commercial farms. Remote\nsensing of crops using satellite, manned aircraft,\
    \ and UAV platforms may also provide useful tools\nfor vegetable growers to evaluate\
    \ crop development, plant stress, water consumption, and irrigation\nsystem performance.\n\

    1.1. Water Scarcity and Commercial Vegetable Production\nMost economically important\
    \ vegetable production regions of the world have Mediterranean,\nsemi-arid, or\
    \ desert climates in which supplemental irrigation is required to maximize yield\
    \ and\nquality. Efﬁcient irrigation management has become a major concern for\
    \ vegetable farmers in these\nareas as water supplies have become more restricted\
    \ and environmental impairments to ground and\nsurface water from agricultural\
    \ run-off and drainage has received more attention from regulatory\nagencies.\
    \ Agricultural water resources have become increasingly stressed in the vegetable\
    \ producing\nregions of Australia, Southern Europe, Chile, the Middle East, North\
    \ Africa, China, and the western\nUnited States. California has been under severe\
    \ drought conditions for four years since 2012 [1,2],\nand ground water supplies\
    \ have been depleted to historically low levels on the central coast, where\n\
    most of the salad vegetables are grown for the US and export markets. Lowering\
    \ of the ground\nwater table below sea-level through agricultural pumping has\
    \ caused salt water to intrude into\ncoastal aquifers and threatened the sustainability\
    \ of thousands of hectares of prime farmland used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28;\
    \ doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020028\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 28\n2 of 20\nfor vegetable production [3]. Australia also experienced\
    \ a severe decade-long drought during the\nearly 2000’s that impacted vegetable\
    \ farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin in New South Wales and\nQueensland [4].\
    \ The vegetable production regions of Chile [5] and Spain [6] have also experienced\n\
    recurring multiyear droughts.\nSince many vegetables require high rates of nitrogen\
    \ fertilizer and have shallow root systems,\nleaching of nitrate during the irrigation\
    \ season and during periods of heavy precipitation has resulted\nin nitrate contamination\
    \ of aquifers in many key vegetable production regions [7–9]. Irrigation run-off\n\
    from vegetable ﬁelds also contaminates surface water bodies such as rivers, creeks,\
    \ estuaries, and lakes\nwith nutrients and pesticides [10–12]. Growers in California\
    \ and Europe must report on the amount\nof fertilizer nitrogen that they apply\
    \ to their crops to comply with environmental regulations [13,14].\nThey are also\
    \ required to implement best practices to minimize nitrate losses, which will\
    \ require\nimproving irrigation management.\n1.2. Challenges for Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ in Modern Vegetable Operations\nVegetable production poses several unique challenges\
    \ in managing irrigation water efﬁciently.\nOne of the major challenges for growers\
    \ is the number of ﬁelds that must be concurrently managed\nin a medium to large\
    \ size vegetable operation. Fields sizes for vegetable crops tend to be small\n\
    (<5 ha) relative to agronomic crops, especially ﬁelds planted with leafy green,\
    \ crucifer, and other\nsalad vegetables. Large vegetable growing operations in\
    \ the Salinas valley of California manage\n1–2 thousand ha of vegetables, with\
    \ an average ﬁeld size of just 4 ha. Small ﬁelds permit intensive\nmanagement,\
    \ allowing plantings to be staggered so that a steady supply of vegetables can\
    \ be delivered\nto buyers and shippers. However, smaller ﬁeld sizes means that\
    \ farming decisions must be coordinated\nfor many ﬁelds that may vary with respect\
    \ to maturity, soil texture, cultural practices, microclimate,\nor other site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions.\nIn addition to ﬁeld size, the diversity of vegetables and number\
    \ of crop rotations per season\nincreases management complexity. Most diversiﬁed\
    \ operations will produce more than 30 types of\nvegetables, each with unique\
    \ nutrient and water requirements. Many vegetables are grown over short\ncropping\
    \ cycles. Leafy green salad mixes like leaf and crisphead lettuce, for instance,\
    \ reach maturity\nover just 30–65 day intervals during the summer. As a result,\
    \ farmers in Mediterranean climates often\ngrow two to three rotations of vegetable\
    \ crops per year. Fields often are intensively tilled between\ncrops to remove\
    \ compacted zones caused by trafﬁc from harvest machinery and to prepare raised\
    \ beds\nfor seeding or transplanting the next crop. These activities require that\
    \ crews retrieve drip tape or\nsprinkler pipe after each crop is harvested.\n\
    Another irrigation scheduling challenge is the number of ﬁeld operations that\
    \ must be coordinated\nduring a crop cycle. Fields are typically sprayed to protect\
    \ against insect and disease pests several\ntimes per crop cycle, and must be\
    \ periodically cultivated to control weeds. Fertilizer applications\nare made\
    \ several times during the growth cycle to satisfy the nutrient requirements of\
    \ vegetables.\nIrrigations must be timed to accommodate access for tractor and\
    \ hoeing crews so that activities can\nbe completed on schedule. There may be\
    \ several extended periods when a vegetable crop cannot be\nirrigated to permit\
    \ the soil to dry sufﬁciently to allow tractor access. Irrigation equipment, such\
    \ as\nsprinkler and mainline pipes, may need to be moved before each pass of a\
    \ tractor through a ﬁeld.\nIrrigation scheduling is also complicated by the numerous\
    \ methods that vegetable growers use\nto supply water to their crops. Depending\
    \ on the crop type, plant density, development stage, water\nsource, and ﬁeld\
    \ and soil characteristics, growers may choose to irrigate using overhead sprinklers,\n\
    drip, furrow, or a combination of methods. In California, leafy green vegetables\
    \ harvested for salad\nmixes are seeded at high densities (8.5 million plants\
    \ per hectare) [15] on 2 m wide raised beds and are\nirrigated almost exclusively\
    \ with sprinklers. Small seeded vegetables such as crisphead and romaine\nlettuce\
    \ are typically germinated with sprinklers, and after several weeks, irrigated\
    \ with surface drip\nuntil harvest. Celery transplants may be established using\
    \ overhead sprinklers, then drip irrigated,\nand occasionally ﬂood irrigated to\
    \ rewet the shoulders of raised beds.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n3 of 20\nSince\
    \ vegetable production is frequently characterized by short crop cycles, intensive\
    \ crop\nrotations, and numerous small ﬁelds at different stages of maturity, farm\
    \ managers are challenged\nto schedule and coordinate all the ﬁeld activities\
    \ while taking time to carefully schedule irrigations\nto optimize water use.\
    \ Consequently, many farm managers may follow predetermined irrigation\nschedules\
    \ to simplify water management and make small adjustments during the cropping\
    \ season\ndepending on their observations of the crop, soil, and weather conditions.\
    \ Usually the amount of\nwater applied to high value vegetables exceeds crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) to avoid water stress.\nIn the Salinas Valley of California, for example,\
    \ applied water amounts on broccoli, cauliﬂower, and\ncabbage averaged >200% of\
    \ the estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) requirement [16]. While these\n\
    applications rates may avoid water stress so that yield and quality are maximized,\
    \ over-irrigating may\nstrain water supplies and result in the leaching of nitrate\
    \ and/or generate run-off that degrades the\nquality of receiving surface water\
    \ bodies.\nConsidering the numerous challenges and limitations of managing vegetables,\
    \ growers, farm\nmanagers, and irrigators need convenient methods to schedule\
    \ irrigations so that they can better\ndetermine how much water to apply to match\
    \ the requirements of their crops. During the past few\ndecades, signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ and lower costs for wireless communications, computing power,\nsensor technology,\
    \ and aerial and satellite imagery have increased the potential to develop accurate\n\
    and intuitive approaches for scheduling irrigations in vegetables.\n2. Advances\
    \ in Soil Moisture Sensor Technology\n2.1. Recent Developments in Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensing\nThe monitoring of soil moisture has long been a standard way to determine\
    \ when crops need to\nbe irrigated. Growers and farm managers typically evaluate\
    \ soil moisture by probing with a shovel or\nauger or monitoring with sensors.\
    \ Sensors for volumetric moisture content and soil water tension have\nbeen commercially\
    \ available for more than 40 years but were originally used more in research than\
    \ for\ncommercial crop production. Volumetric soil moisture sensors provide readings\
    \ in units of m3·m−3,\nand tension-based sensors readings are typically in units\
    \ of kPa, where a greater absolute value\ncorresponds to drier soil conditions\
    \ [17]. In the past, the primary barriers to more widespread use of\nsoil moisture\
    \ sensors in irrigation management have included both cost as well as labor required\
    \ for the\ninstallation, removal, and collection of readings [18]. In recent years,\
    \ there has been a proliferation of\ncommercially available soil moisture monitoring\
    \ systems for agriculture. Many sensors interface with\ndataloggers and wireless\
    \ communication systems to provide near real-time status of soil moisture from\n\
    several depths and locations within a ﬁeld. Data are automatically uploaded by\
    \ radio or cell phone\ncommunications to cloud-based computer servers and are\
    \ accessible through apps on smartphones\nand tablet computers. These communication\
    \ advancements greatly improve the convenience of\naccessing data and can be conﬁgured\
    \ to provide timely alerts when crops require irrigation. Many of\nthese wireless\
    \ communication systems for soil moisture sensors also support on-farm weather\
    \ stations,\ndigital ﬂow meters, and control valves, which facilitates the monitoring\
    \ of irrigation system operations.\nSoil moisture sensors have also evolved during\
    \ the last few decades in terms of size, cost,\nand accuracy. Electromagnetic\
    \ (EM) soil moisture sensors, used to determine volumetric soil moisture\ncontent,\
    \ include time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) and capacitance sensors. These were once\
    \ bulky and\nexpensive instruments. With improvements in electronic manufacturing\
    \ and better designs, current\nEM sensors (Figure 1A,B) are generally much smaller,\
    \ cheaper, and more accurate than earlier models.\nSome versions are integrated\
    \ with soil temperature and salinity sensors (e.g., Model 5TE, Decagon\nDevices\
    \ Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Others are integrated with dataloggers and radio communications\n\
    (e.g., Model gStake, gThrive Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) to facilitate ﬁeld installation\
    \ and removal.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n4 of 20\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n\

    \  \nTension‐based soil moisture sensors have been considered the best method to determine if a crop \n\
    needs  water  since  most  vegetables  experience  reductions  in  yield  and \
    \ quality  under  prolonged \nperiods  of  high  soil  water  tensions.  Tension \
    \ thresholds  that  optimize  production  have  been \ndetermined for many vegetable species [17,19], including broccoli [20], cabbage[21], cauliflower [22], \n\
    lettuce [23,24], potato[25], and tomato [26]. An advantage of tension thresholds is that they are less \n\
    influenced by soil texture than volumetric moisture thresholds. Tensiometers can accurately measure \n\
    soil water tension in a range of 0–85 kPa using a mechanical vacuum gauge attached to a water filled \n\
    tube with a porous ceramic cup [17] (Figure 1C). Tensiometers must be installed without air gaps \n\
    between the ceramic cup and soil to function properly. To reduce labor for collecting readings, several \n\
    recent models have sensitive electronic pressure transducers that measure vacuum pressure and can \n\
    be interfaced to dataloggers and wireless communication services (Figure 1D,E) so that data may be \n\
    monitored remotely (Figure 2) (e.g. Hortau Inc., Lévis, QC, Canada). Though tensiometers do not \n\
    need  calibration,  they  usually  require  periodic  maintenance  to  assure \
    \ that  they  are  functioning \nproperly. Entrapped air that develops at high tensions must be replaced with de‐aired water. Adding \n\
    a weak solution of algaecide or bleach can prevent biological growth inside the tensiometer tube, \n\
    which may potentially clog the ceramic cup [26]. \nGranular matrix sensors (GMS) (Figure 1F) indirectly measure soil water tension using electrical \n\
    resistance  and  are  often  used  as  an  alternative  to  tensiometers  (e.g. \

    Tension-based soil moisture sensors have been considered the best method to determine\
    \ if a crop\nneeds water since most vegetables experience reductions in yield\
    \ and quality under prolonged periods\nof high soil water tensions. Tension thresholds\
    \ that optimize production have been determined for\nmany vegetable species [17,19],\
    \ including broccoli [20], cabbage [21], cauliﬂower [22], lettuce [23,24],\npotato\
    \ [25], and tomato [26]. An advantage of tension thresholds is that they are less\
    \ inﬂuenced by\nsoil texture than volumetric moisture thresholds. Tensiometers\
    \ can accurately measure soil water\ntension in a range of 0–85 kPa using a mechanical\
    \ vacuum gauge attached to a water ﬁlled tube with\na porous ceramic cup [17]\
    \ (Figure 1C). Tensiometers must be installed without air gaps between the\nceramic\
    \ cup and soil to function properly. To reduce labor for collecting readings,\
    \ several recent\nmodels have sensitive electronic pressure transducers that measure\
    \ vacuum pressure and can be\ninterfaced to dataloggers and wireless communication\
    \ services (Figure 1D,E) so that data may be\nmonitored remotely (Figure 2) (e.g.,\
    \ Hortau Inc., Lévis, QC, Canada). Though tensiometers do not need\ncalibration,\
    \ they usually require periodic maintenance to assure that they are functioning\
    \ properly.\nEntrapped air that develops at high tensions must be replaced with\
    \ de-aired water. Adding a weak\nsolution of algaecide or bleach can prevent biological\
    \ growth inside the tensiometer tube, which may\npotentially clog the ceramic\
    \ cup [26].\nGranular matrix sensors (GMS) (Figure 1F) indirectly measure soil\
    \ water tension using electrical\nresistance and are often used as an alternative\
    \ to tensiometers (e.g., Model watermark 200SS, Irrometer\nHorticulturae 2017,\
    \ 3, 28\n5 of 20\nCompany Inc., Riverside, CA, USA). Most GMS can be interfaced\
    \ to dataloggers and wireless\ncommunications [26]. An advantage of GMS compared\
    \ to tensiometers is that they do not require\nregular servicing. These sensors\
    \ retain sensitivity at higher soil moisture tensions (up to 200 kPa) but\nare\
    \ less accurate at low soil moisture tensions (0–15 kPa) than tensiometers [17,26].\
    \ GMS readings are\nalso affected by ﬂuctuations in soil temperature [17]. Another\
    \ limitation of GMS is that the response\ntime to wetting and drying cycles is\
    \ slower compared to tensiometers [26,27].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n5 of 20 \n\
    \ \nIrrometer  Company  Inc.,  Riverside,  CA,  USA).  Most  GMS  can  be  interfaced \
    \ to  dataloggers  and \nwireless communications [26]. An advantage of GMS compared to tensiometers is that they do not \n\
    require regular servicing. These sensors retain sensitivity at higher soil moisture tensions (up to 200 \n\
    kPa) but are less accurate at low soil moisture tensions (0–15 kPa) than tensiometers [17,26]. GMS \n\
    readings are also affected by fluctuations in soil temperature [17]. Another limitation of GMS is that \n\
    the response time to wetting and drying cycles is slower compared to tensiometers [26,27]. \

    Capacitance soil moisture sensors were generally found to be more reliable for automated irrigation \n\
    scheduling  than  tensiometers  and  GMS.  As  discussed  earlier,  tensiometers \
    \ require  regular \nmaintenance, and the GMS response to changes in soil moisture was too slow to use these sensors for \n\
    triggering irrigations. While these studies have demonstrated the potential for water savings in small \n\
    plots, automated irrigation scheduling may have several limitations in commercial vegetable fields. \n\
    The  optimal  volumetric  soil  moisture  threshold  for  triggering  an  irrigation \

    \ irrigation scheduling application.\nA number of studies have evaluated automated\
    \ irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture\nreadings for improving the water\
    \ use efﬁciency of vegetables irrigated with drip tape. Automatic\ncontrollers\
    \ used in these studies irrigated crops for short durations several times per\
    \ day when soils\ndried below a predetermined threshold [28,29]. Some control\
    \ systems have relied on tension based\nsensors [26,28], while others have used\
    \ volumetric soil moisture sensors [28,30–34] to determine\nwhen to irrigate.\
    \ The use of TDR soil moisture sensors for triggering irrigations in sub-surface\n\
    drip irrigated sweet corn resulted in an 11% savings in water use with similar\
    \ yields compared to\na standard sprinkler irrigated treatment [30]. Small plot\
    \ trials have demonstrated water savings,\nreduced nitrate leaching, and improvements\
    \ in yield in drip irrigated fresh market tomatoes, bell\npeppers, and zucchini\
    \ squash using capacitance soil moisture sensors to trigger irrigations [31–35].\n\
    Using tensiometers, Mũnoz-Carpena et al. [26] were able to reduce water use in\
    \ fresh market tomato\nby 67% compared to the grower standard practice without\
    \ signiﬁcant reductions in marketable yield.\nMost of the water savings were during\
    \ the early crop stages when evapotranspiration rates were\nlow. Capacitance soil\
    \ moisture sensors were generally found to be more reliable for automated\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling than tensiometers and GMS. As discussed earlier, tensiometers require\
    \ regular\nmaintenance, and the GMS response to changes in soil moisture was too\
    \ slow to use these sensors\nfor triggering irrigations. While these studies have\
    \ demonstrated the potential for water savings in\nsmall plots, automated irrigation\
    \ scheduling may have several limitations in commercial vegetable\nﬁelds. The\
    \ optimal volumetric soil moisture threshold for triggering an irrigation would\
    \ need to be\nempirically determined for different soil types. Pressurized water\
    \ would need to be continuously\navailable to accommodate frequent short irrigations.\
    \ In large ﬁelds, short irrigation cycles could lead\nto signiﬁcant drainage at\
    \ the lower end of a ﬁeld when drip lines depressurize.\n2.2. Limitations of Soil\
    \ Moisture Sensors for Irrigation Scheduling in Vegetables\nWhile much progress\
    \ has been made in improving the accuracy and utility of soil moisture\nsensors,\
    \ several factors still limit their use for irrigation scheduling of vegetables.\
    \ Though costs for\nindividual sensors may be less than in the past, the addition\
    \ of dataloggers, cell phone modems,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n6 of 20\nand\
    \ radio communications, which facilitate real-time monitoring, has added to the\
    \ total costs. Labor\nfor installation and removal of sensors remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ cost, especially in vegetable crops with\nshort production cycles. Considering\
    \ labor and capital costs, many growers elect to use soil moisture\nmonitoring\
    \ equipment in a small percentage of their vegetable ﬁelds.\nThough soil moisture\
    \ sensors are useful for determining when to irrigate vegetables,\nthey are less\
    \ useful for estimating how much water to apply. Soil moisture tension readings\
    \ must\nbe converted to volumetric moisture to estimate soil water depletion since\
    \ a previous irrigation\nor rain event.\nVolumetric soil moisture sensors may\
    \ also need calibration.\nMost capacitance\nsensors use the manufacturer’s calibration\
    \ equations to convert readings to volumetric water content.\nClay content, organic\
    \ matter, salinity, bulk density, and temperature can affect the accuracy of\n\
    capacitance sensors [36–40]. The effect of these factors on water content readings\
    \ can vary in different\nsoil types. For example, Kargas and Soulis [38] evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of the 10HS capacitance\nsensor, and found that temperature had\
    \ a larger effect on soil water content readings in clay than\ncourse textured\
    \ soils. They concluded that calibration for speciﬁc soil types was needed to\
    \ achieve\naccurate readings.\nEven with accurate sensors, spatial variability\
    \ can limit the reliability of soil moisture estimates if\nreadings are collected\
    \ from only a few locations, especially if soil hydraulic properties vary within\n\
    a ﬁeld or the irrigation system applies water unevenly. Soil maps can be useful\
    \ for guiding the\nplacement of soil moisture sensors in locations that represent\
    \ the dominant soil properties of ﬁelds.\nIn drip-irrigated ﬁelds, determining\
    \ the optimal location to accurately monitor soil moisture depletion\ncan be particularly\
    \ challenging. Soil moisture is typically higher under drip tape than adjacent\n\
    to the plants, where root activity is concentrated. Placing sensors too close\
    \ to a drip line may\nlead to under-irrigating a crop, and placing sensors too\
    \ far away may result in over-irrigating [41].\nThrough computer modeling experiments,\
    \ Soulis et al. [42] concluded that the optimal positioning\nof soil moisture\
    \ sensors in drip-irrigated crops was inﬂuenced by soil hydraulic properties,\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration rate, and the conﬁguration of the irrigation system.\
    \ An additional consideration is\nthe ideal depth at which to place sensors relative\
    \ to the crop root zone. Broccoli roots can reach depths\ngreater than 1.2 m at\
    \ maturity [16], while roots of many leafy greens such as spinach may reach less\n\
    than 0.5 m by harvest [43].\n3. ET-Based Approaches to Scheduling Irrigations\
    \ in Vegetables\nWater\nrequirements\nof\nvegetable\ncrops\ncan\nalso\nbe\ndetermined\n\
    from\nestimates\nof\ncrop evapotranspiration (ETc).\nUsing Penman-Monteith [44,45],\
    \ or similar equations [46],\nevapotranspiration (ET0) of a well-watered reference\
    \ crop, such as grass, or alfalfa, is commonly\nestimated from measurements of\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar\nradiation [47]. The\
    \ evapotranspiration of a well-watered vegetable crop can be estimated relative\
    \ to a\nreference crop by multiplying ET0 by a crop coefﬁcient (Kc). Crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for most major vegetable\ncrops were summarized by Allen et al. [48], Guerra\
    \ et al. [49], and Grattan et al. [50].\nNetworks of public weather stations to\
    \ monitor reference ET have been established in many\nvegetable production regions\
    \ of the world where irrigation is commonly used. The California Irrigation\n\
    and Information System (CIMIS) is operated by the Department of Water Resources\
    \ in California and\nconsists of more than 145 weather stations sited on reference\
    \ crops throughout the state. ET0 and other\nmeteorological data, including precipitation,\
    \ air and soil temperature, wind speed, solar radiation,\nand relative humidity,\
    \ are available for users to download from the state operated website. Similar\n\
    networks have been developed for other states including Arizona (AZMET), Colorado\
    \ (CoAgMet),\nFlorida (FAWN), Nevada (NICENET), Oklahoma (MesoNet), Oregon (AgriMet),\
    \ and Washington\n(AgWeatherNet). Most European countries also have weather station\
    \ networks that provide daily ET0\ndata through public websites (e.g., Spain [51],\
    \ Italy [52]). In addition, CIMIS offers a satellite based\nproduct that estimates\
    \ ET0 at a 2 km resolution based on data from the Geostationary Operational\n\
    Environmental Satellite [53].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n7 of 20\nMany commercial\
    \ companies also offer affordable weather stations (e.g., ET107, Campbell Sci.\
    \ Inc.,\nLogan, UT, USA; WatchDog 2900ET Weather Station, Spectrum Technologies,\
    \ Aurora, IL, USA; HOBO\nU30-NRC Weather Station, Onset Computer Corp. Bourne,\
    \ MA, USA) that can be used to estimate\nET0 on a farm. These systems offer a\
    \ way to monitor ET0 in regions not covered by a public network,\nor for farms\
    \ that are not located reasonably near an established station. However, in practice,\
    \ few\ngrowers site or maintain stations in accordance with World Meteorological\
    \ Organization standards for\nreference evapotranspiration measurements. Many\
    \ growers site weather stations near trees, buildings,\nor parking lots, which\
    \ limits the fetch and can inﬂuence the micro-climate, and potentially bias\n\
    estimates of ET0. Stations are infrequently sited on a suitable well-watered reference\
    \ crop. Most\nfarmers do not allocate time to regularly maintain and calibrate\
    \ meteorological instrumentation on\ntheir stations. Commercially available atmometers\
    \ (ETgage Co., Loveland, CO, USA) can be used to\nmonitor ET0 but must also be\
    \ sited over a reference crop.\nAlthough ET0 data have been useful for water agencies\
    \ to estimate the seasonal water use of crops\nat a regional scale, growers have\
    \ generally considered this approach to be impractical for scheduling\nirrigations\
    \ in vegetable systems. A major difﬁculty is that the Kc value can change daily\
    \ as vegetables\ngrow and leaf area increases. During the establishment phase,\
    \ when crop foliage covers a small\npercentage of the soil surface, ET is mostly\
    \ from soil evaporation rather than from crop transpiration.\nFor many vegetable\
    \ crops, such as leafy greens and brassicas, the canopy cover is less than 10%\
    \ until\nhalfway through the crop cycle. The Kc during this early stage will depend\
    \ on factors inﬂuencing\nevaporative losses from the soil, such as method and\
    \ frequency of irrigations, and soil physical\nproperties [48]. Later, in the\
    \ rapid growth phase, Kc values increase daily as the canopy cover develops\n\
    and covers the soil.\nSolutions for calculating a daily Kc for lettuce were proposed\
    \ by Gallardo et al. [54] in which soil\nevaporation from unshaded soil (E) is\
    \ estimated separately from the water lost by transpiration and soil\nevaporation\
    \ under the crop canopy (T). Using this approach, Kc is proportional to the fractional\
    \ cover\n(Fc) of the leaf canopy shading the soil, and E is related to the hydraulic\
    \ properties of the soil and the\ntime since the crop was irrigated. The general\
    \ approach is consistent with Allen et al. [48,55], who also\nproposed separating\
    \ the Kc of crops that have a signiﬁcant period of minimal canopy cover into dual\n\
    components consisting of a basal crop coefﬁcient (Kcb) that represents water loss\
    \ by transpiration and\nan evaporation coefﬁcient (Ke), representing loss from\
    \ soil evaporation. Direct relationships between\nFc and Kcb have been reported\
    \ for several crops such as broccoli [56], wheat [57], cotton [58], sugar\nbeets\
    \ [58], and grapes [59].\nBoth Gallardo et al. [54] and Allen et al. [48] describe\
    \ calculations for estimating soil evaporation,\nwhich divide Ke into stage 1\
    \ and stage 2 periods. Stage 1 occurs immediately following an irrigation\nor\
    \ rain event that saturates the soil to ﬁeld capacity. During stage 1, water loss\
    \ is limited by the\nenergy available for evaporation. Stage 2 occurs after the\
    \ soil is visibly dry and water loss is limited\nby soil hydraulic properties.\
    \ The Stage 2 rate of evaporation diminishes with time as the soil water\ncontent\
    \ declines.\n4. Software for ET Based Scheduling of Vegetables\n4.1. Overview\
    \ of Sofware Tools\nEven with publicly available ET0 data and accurate Kc models,\
    \ the implementation of ET-based\nirrigation scheduling at the scale of a commercial\
    \ vegetable farm may be difﬁcult for growers. Daily ET0\nvalues need to be retrieved\
    \ from a location representative of the ﬁeld of interest. An estimate of canopy\n\
    cover is needed to determine the average Kc for each irrigation event. Soil evaporation\
    \ calculations\nrequire knowledge of the soil properties of the ﬁeld, irrigation\
    \ method, and interval between irrigations\nor rainfall events. To convert crop\
    \ ET into an irrigation recommendation, the application rate and\ndistribution\
    \ uniformity of the irrigation system, and in some cases the leaching fraction,\
    \ also needs to\nbe integrated into the calculations.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3,\
    \ 28\n8 of 20\nRecognizing that most growers have limited time to dedicate to\
    \ making decisions on water\nmanagement, several universities and public institutions\
    \ have developed computer programs to\nfacilitate ET based scheduling. Spreadsheet\
    \ and Windows-based irrigation scheduling programs,\nsuch as CROPWAT [60], KanSched\
    \ 2.0, Basic Irrigation Scheduling (BIS) [61], and consumptive\nuse program (CUP)\
    \ [62] automate the irrigation scheduling calculations but require users to\n\
    retrieve and enter daily ET0 values.\nSince separate spreadsheet ﬁles maybe needed\
    \ for each\ncrop, these programs may be difﬁcult to implement in large growing\
    \ operations that manage\nmany ﬁelds. Washington Irrigation Scheduling Expert\
    \ (WISE) [63,64] is a downloadable JavaScript\napplication that runs on personal\
    \ computers. More recently developed web-based applications\nsuch as Irrigation\
    \ Scheduler mobile (Washington State University) [65], Irrigation Management\n\
    Online (Oregon State University) [66], Wateright (Fresno State University) [67,68],\
    \ and CropManage\n(University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural\
    \ Resources) [69,70] were developed to\nautomatically retrieve ET0 data from weather\
    \ station networks such as AgWeatherNet and CIMIS\nand support irrigation scheduling\
    \ of multiple ﬁelds. These applications are accessed through web\nbrowsers, some\
    \ of which automatically resize the user interface to smartphone screens. Colorado\n\
    State University WISE Irrigation Scheduler [71] and SmartIrrigation (University\
    \ of Florida, University\nof Georgia) [72–74] have similar capabilities but can\
    \ operate exclusively on smartphones through\ndownloadable applications. Outside\
    \ of the United States, several public agencies have developed\nonline irrigation\
    \ scheduling services including IRRINET in Italy [75], ISS-ITAP in Spain [76],\
    \ IRRISA\nin France [77], and IrriSatSMS [78] in Australia. In addition, a growing\
    \ number of ET-based software\ntools are commercially available.\nTwo examples\
    \ are Probe Schedule (IRRinet LLC, Dalles, OR,\nUSA) and Irrigation Advisor (PowWow\
    \ Energy Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA). Further details of these\ncommercial products\
    \ are not provided here since they are proprietary and usually not documented\
    \ in\nthe scientiﬁc literature.\nMost online irrigation scheduling tools have\
    \ cloud-based databases that retain information\nassociated with each planting,\
    \ such as soil type, planting and harvest dates, weather station name,\nand irrigation\
    \ system application rate, so that the user does not need to reenter critical\
    \ information\nfor each irrigation event. After entering the information required\
    \ to initiate a new planting, users\ncan quickly look up how long to irrigate\
    \ their crops. Some scheduling software provides weekly or\ndaily summaries of\
    \ how much water to apply (e.g., IrrigationScheduler, Wateright, SmartIrrigation,\n\
    etc.), while others such as CropManage enable the user to input speciﬁc dates\
    \ for each irrigation [70].\nThe online format facilitates automated retrieval\
    \ of current and forecasted weather data in advance\nof planned irrigation events,\
    \ so that growers can be alerted when a ﬁeld will need water. In addition\nto\
    \ linking with weather station networks, decision support tools can also incorporate\
    \ other online\nservices such as UC Davis SoilWeb for identifying the soil physical\
    \ properties of a ﬁeld using the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database [79]\nor Google Maps, which can be\
    \ customized for determining the longitude and latitude of a ﬁeld or\nviewing\
    \ locations of nearby weather stations. CropManage can also be customized to automatically\n\
    retrieve ﬂowmeter and soil moisture data from internet-accessible dataloggers.\n\
    While many of these irrigation-scheduling programs will provide recommendations\
    \ for multiple\ncommodities, few have been developed or tested speciﬁcally for\
    \ vegetables. Most irrigation scheduling\napplications use single Kc values for\
    \ the four crop growth stages described by Doorenbos and Pruitt [80]\nto simplify\
    \ calculations of ETc. CropManage was initially developed for vegetable irrigation\
    \ and\nemploys a dual crop coefﬁcient approach for estimating crop ET similar\
    \ to Gallardo et al. (1996),\nas described in Johnson et al. [81] and Smith et\
    \ al. [16]. The vegetable crops currently supported\ninclude broccoli, cabbage,\
    \ cauliﬂower, lettuce, and spinach. Since the user enters the date of each\nirrigation\
    \ event, CropManage adjusts watering recommendations for the frequency and method\
    \ of\nirrigation. Empirical models of fractional cover are included for each supported\
    \ vegetable crop so that\nthe user can customize the Kcb curves for a speciﬁc\
    \ season, bed width, and planting conﬁguration.\nReplicated ﬁeld trials demonstrated\
    \ that the CropManage irrigation recommendations using the ET\nHorticulturae 2017,\
    \ 3, 28\n9 of 20\nbased algorithm with a dual crop coefﬁcient optimized water\
    \ use and yield in crisp head lettuce and\nbroccoli [81].\n4.2. Achieving Widescale\
    \ Adoption of Irrigation Software\nDespite signiﬁcant progress in developing ET-based\
    \ irrigation scheduling software for commercial\nvegetable farms, many challenges\
    \ exist that will need to be addressed to achieve large-scale adoption\nby growers.\
    \ Although public ET weather station networks have been established in many vegetable\n\
    producing regions of the US and Europe, they are less common in other regions\
    \ such as India, China,\nand Latin America. In areas where ET0 data are available,\
    \ the density or siting of weather stations may\nnot provide sufﬁcient resolution\
    \ to fully capture regional variation in microclimates. In these instances,\n\
    growers may choose to install and operate their own weather stations, as described\
    \ above.\nAnother challenge is to deliver accurate irrigation recommendations\
    \ without requiring users\nto provide excessive details about their crop, irrigation\
    \ system, and ﬁeld conditions. Morrison [82]\nfound that time constraints and\
    \ concerns about data entry errors were factors that deterred grower\nadoption\
    \ of the irrigation scheduling software. Irrigation scheduling apps also need\
    \ to be intuitive for\nirrigators and farm managers to use in the ﬁeld. The user-interface\
    \ displayed on smartphones and\ntablet computers must be easy to read and to understand,\
    \ while providing sufﬁcient detail for the\nuser to verify that the values for\
    \ ET0, Kc, and other variables used in the scheduling calculations are\naccurate.\
    \ Also, since the principal language of many irrigators in the western US is Spanish,\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling applications need to support multiple languages.\nThe\
    \ cost of computer programming services is also a major barrier to developing\
    \ and maintaining\nirrigation scheduling software. As software has become more\
    \ sophisticated, and needs to be compatible\nwith personal and tablet computers\
    \ and smartphones, the complexity and consequently costs of\ndevelopment have\
    \ increased. Software products will incur annual costs associated with updating\n\
    to new technology, introducing new features, and troubleshooting identiﬁed errors.\
    \ Most publicly\navailable irrigation scheduling applications were initially developed\
    \ under research grants, and need\neither continued grant funding or income generated\
    \ from user subscriptions to support updating\nand maintenance costs. Several\
    \ online irrigation scheduling services that were initially funded by the\nEuropean\
    \ Union became inactive after grants ended [83]. It may be cost-effective for\
    \ institutions to\ncollaborate on the development of software products that are\
    \ sufﬁciently ﬂexible to be customized\nfor different growing regions and commodities.\
    \ SmartIrrigation is an example of such collaboration\nbetween the University\
    \ of Florida and University of Georgia. There also may be opportunities for public\n\
    agencies, commodity boards, and commercial companies to partner on the development\
    \ of commercial\nirrigation scheduling software. For instance, SureHarvest Inc.\
    \ (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) recently\ndeveloped an online irrigation-scheduling tool\
    \ for almonds in collaboration with the University of\nCalifornia and the Almond\
    \ Board of California.\n5. Field Measurements of Crop ET\nField measurements of\
    \ crop ET are needed to develop and verify crop coefﬁcients as well as\nto investigate\
    \ the interaction of water stress on crop yield and quality. Several reviews detail\
    \ the\nadvantages and disadvantages of various methods of measuring crop ET [84,85].\
    \ Weighing lysimeters\nhave often been used to measure crop water use [85,86].\
    \ While considered the most accurate ET\nmeasurement method, the expense of these\
    \ instruments limits their use to research stations and\nconstrains the range\
    \ of sites, crops, and management practices that can reasonably be evaluated.\n\
    Energy balance methods such as Bowen ratio [85], eddy covariance [85], and surface\
    \ renewal [87] are\nmore affordable alternatives to lysimetry for evaluating crop\
    \ ET and can be deployed in commercial\nﬁelds for evaluating crop water use under\
    \ a wide range of growing conditions. Instrumentation\ncosts for these methods\
    \ can exceed $10,000 USD per station, which has limited their use primarily\n\
    to research studies. Energy balance methods involve monitoring of net radiation,\
    \ soil heat ﬂux,\nand sensible heat ﬂux to estimate the latent heat ﬂux (Wm−2),\
    \ which can be converted to water ﬂux\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n10 of 20\nor\
    \ evapotranspiration rate through the latent heat of vaporization. Generally,\
    \ the sensors used for\nenergy balance measurements have become more reliable,\
    \ cheaper, and more accurate in recent years.\nThe capabilities of dataloggers\
    \ used for operating the instrumentation have also improved, with\nmore memory\
    \ and faster computation speeds, while post-processing software modules have become\n\
    more accessible. Energy balance methods have been used for evaluating the water\
    \ use of vegetable\ncrops in commercial ﬁelds, including artichokes, broccoli,\
    \ beans, lettuce, onions, and processing\ntomatoes [50,88–92]. These methods have\
    \ been useful for reevaluating existing crop coefﬁcients, as\nproduction practices\
    \ and varieties have improved during recent years [93]. However, considering the\n\
    diversity of vegetables and production methods, relatively few ET studies have\
    \ been published using\nthese techniques during the last decade. Surface renewal,\
    \ which uses thermocouples to measure rapid\nchanges in air temperature, has greatly\
    \ reduced the costs of estimating sensible heat ﬂux and may\nbe well suited to\
    \ vegetable ﬁelds due to a smaller fetch requirement compared to eddy covariance.\n\
    Advances in surface renewal methodology [94] have culminated in a commercial service\
    \ that provides\ngrowers with ET estimates and irrigation recommendations via\
    \ a web application (Tule Technology\nInc., Oakland, CA, USA). However, this tool\
    \ has primarily been used in perennial crops such as trees,\ngrapes, and strawberries.\n\
    6. Satellite-Based Crop ET Determination\n6.1. Energy Balance\nResearchers have\
    \ developed satellite-based energy balance models to estimate ET at\nvarious spatial\
    \ and temporal scales (e.g., reviews of Courault et al. [95]; Kalma et al. [96];\n\
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al. [97]). The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL)\
    \ and the Mapping\nEvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration\
    \ (METRIC) are two widely used\napproaches [98,99]. Optical and thermal band data\
    \ from Landsat or other satellites is used to help\nparameterize the energy balance\
    \ equation [100]. At the moment of satellite overpass, latent heat\nﬂux (LE) is\
    \ retrieved through the calculation of surface energy balance that is based on\
    \ radiative,\naerodynamic, and energy balance physics. LE is converted to ET for\
    \ the corresponding hour and\nsubsequently to reference ET fraction (ETrF) by\
    \ comparison with the measured reference ET for the\nhour. Finally, daily (2)\
    \ ET is derived as the product of ETrF and reference ET for the day, under the\n\
    assumption that ETrF approximates the average daylight evaporative fraction. The\
    \ energy balance\napproach accounts for the effects of ET reduction in water-stressed\
    \ crops, due to stomatal regulation\nand increased ET due to bare-soil evaporation.\
    \ Linear or spline interpolation can be used to estimate\nETrF (hence daily ET)\
    \ between satellite overpasses, which occur every eight days in the case of\n\
    Landsat, assuming clear-sky conditions. Manual intervention is used to calibrate\
    \ the sensible heat\nﬂux computation by identifying portions of the image (hot\
    \ and cold ‘anchor’ pixels) that represent\nextreme ET conditions, where ET can\
    \ be estimated and assigned a priori. In a typical agricultural\nsituation, cold\
    \ pixels are associated with well-irrigated agricultural ﬁelds with high Fc and\
    \ hot pixels\nwith bare dry ﬁelds. Overall the ET retrieval error for the satellite-based\
    \ energy balance is typically\n5–15%, when estimates are produced by an experienced\
    \ operator, and rises to 30–40% when operated\nby non-specialists or novices to\
    \ the ﬁelds of hydrologic science, environmental physics, remote sensing,\nor\
    \ agricultural systems [85]. An automated calibration method has been recently\
    \ developed to facilitate\nand improve operation by non-specialists [101].\n6.2.\
    \ Vegetation Index\nHybrid approaches estimate fractional cover (Fc) from remote\
    \ sensing and use ground-based ET0\ndata. Fc is a good indicator of light interception,\
    \ which is a strong driver of ETc [48]. Weighing lysimeter\nobservations by Bryla\
    \ et al. [102] revealed a strong relationship between Fc and ETc for vegetable\n\
    crops in California’s San Joaquin Valley, and the potential for using satellite-based\
    \ Fc to estimate ETc\nin vegetable crops was demonstrated by Johnson and Trout\
    \ [103]. Fc can be estimated from various\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n11 of 20\n\
    spectral visible-region bands, where chlorophyll absorption dominates, combined\
    \ with near-infrared\n(NIR), where vegetation is highly reﬂective. A common formulation\
    \ is the normalized difference\nvegetation index, or NDVI, which is derived as\
    \ (NIR − red)/(NIR + red) [104]. Trout et al. [105] and\nJohnson and Trout [103]\
    \ found a strong relationship between NDVI and Fc for vegetables and other\ncrop\
    \ types in California’s San Joaquin Valley. NDVI began to lose sensitivity above\
    \ 80 percent cover, a\npoint generally regarded as effective full cover for water\
    \ management applications [106]. As above,\ninterpolation can be applied to estimate\
    \ NDVI, and hence ETc, for days between satellite overpasses\nas needed.\n7. Satellite\
    \ Based Irrigation Management Services\n7.1. Prototype Systems\nBy furnishing\
    \ ﬁeld scale estimates of Fc, a key factor for estimating Kcb and basal ETc (ETcb),\n\
    optical remote sensing may potentially improve the accuracy of ET estimates in\
    \ vegetables. Several\nsatellite-based models have been developed for irrigation\
    \ management. An early proof-of-capability\nsatellite demonstration on wheat and\
    \ corn was undertaken by the DEMETER project in Europe,\nwhich involved timely\
    \ delivery of Landsat-based crop coefﬁcients to agricultural end-users, with\n\
    available online visualization and analysis capabilities [107].\nMore recently,\
    \ the fully-automated Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) [108] uses\n\
    atmospherically corrected Landsat data to map NDVI, Fc, and Kcb for multiple crop\
    \ types, including\nvegetables across about eight million acres of California\
    \ irrigated farmland [109]. These variables are\nupdated every eight days at 30\
    \ m spatial resolution (cloud cover and data availability permitting) from\n2010\
    \ to the present. The SIMS uses daily 2 km ET0 statewide grids produced by the\
    \ California Irrigation\nManagement Information System [53] to generate basal\
    \ crop ET. Web data services allow users to\ndisplay annual time-series graphs\
    \ and download data for any given location (Figure 3). An application\nprogramming\
    \ interface (API) enables on-demand transfer of SIMS data products to support\
    \ external\nirrigation advisory services such as CropManage and also allows the\
    \ user and other software tools to\nspecify the crop type via the API and retrieve\
    \ crop-speciﬁc Kcb data from SIMS. Where information is\navailable on applied\
    \ water, an FAO56 based soil water balance model can be used to adjust for soil\n\
    evaporation and crop stress and to retrospectively derive agricultural water use\
    \ fractions at the ﬁeld\nscale for the evaluation of irrigation management and\
    \ system performance [110].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n11 of 20 \n[106]. As above, interpolation can be applied to estimate NDVI, and hence ETc, for days between \n\
    satellite overpasses as needed. \n7. Satellite Based Irrigation Management Services \
    \  \n7.1. Prototype Systems \nBy furnishing field scale estimates of Fc, a key factor for estimating Kcb and basal ETc (ETcb), \n\
    optical remote sensing may potentially improve the accuracy of ET estimates in vegetables. Several \n\
    satellite‐based models have been developed for irrigation management. An early proof‐of‐capability \n\
    satellite  demonstration  on  wheat  and  corn  was  undertaken  by  the  DEMETER \
    \ project  in  Europe, \nwhich involved timely delivery of Landsat‐based crop coefficients to agricultural end‐users, with \n\
    available online visualization and analysis capabilities [107].   \nMore recently, the fully‐automated Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) [108] uses \n\
    atmospherically corrected Landsat data to map NDVI, Fc, and Kcb for multiple crop types, including \n\
    vegetables across about eight million acres of California irrigated farmland [109]. These variables are \n\
    updated every eight days at 30 m spatial resolution (cloud cover and data availability permitting) \n\
    from 2010 to the present. The SIMS uses daily 2 km ET0 statewide grids produced by the California \n\
    Irrigation Management Information System [53] to generate basal crop ET. Web data services allow \n\
    users to display annual time‐series graphs and download data for any given location (Figure 3). An \n\
    application  programming  interface  (API)  enables  on‐demand  transfer  of \
    \ SIMS  data  products  to \nsupport external irrigation advisory services such as CropManage and also allows the user and other \n\
    software tools to specify the crop type via the API and retrieve crop‐specific Kcb data from SIMS. \n\
    Where information is available on applied water, an FAO56 based soil water balance model can be \n\
    used to adjust for soil evaporation and crop stress and to retrospectively derive agricultural water \n\
    use fractions at the field scale for the evaluation of irrigation management and system performance \n\
    [110].   \n \nFigure 3. SIMS map of fractional cover of vegetable crops near Salinas, California as of mid‐July 2016. \n\
    IrriSAT [111] is a weather based irrigation management and benchmarking technology that uses \n\
    satellite remote sensing to generate crop water management information in Australia, primarily for \n\
    grape and cotton growers at present [112,113]. As with SIMS, Landsat is used to estimate Kc at a 30 \n\
    m resolution. Unlike SIMS, Kc is derived directly from a single linear relationship with satellite NDVI. \n\
    Daily crop water use is determined as the product of Kc and ET0 observations from nearby weather \n\
    Figure 3. SIMS map of fractional cover of vegetable crops near Salinas, California\
    \ as of mid-July 2016.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n12 of 20\nIrriSAT [111] is\
    \ a weather based irrigation management and benchmarking technology that uses\n\
    satellite remote sensing to generate crop water management information in Australia,\
    \ primarily for\ngrape and cotton growers at present [112,113]. As with SIMS,\
    \ Landsat is used to estimate Kc at a\n30 m resolution. Unlike SIMS, Kc is derived\
    \ directly from a single linear relationship with satellite\nNDVI. Daily crop\
    \ water use is determined as the product of Kc and ET0 observations from nearby\n\
    weather stations, and a seven-day ET0 forecast is also produced. The delivery\
    \ platform, which is built\non the Google App Engine helps irrigators track soil\
    \ moisture and better manage irrigation schedules.\nIn addition, IrriSAT facilitates\
    \ the calculation of seasonal agronomic performance metrics, including\nthe irrigation\
    \ water use index and gross production water use index.\nAdditional satellite-based\
    \ services have been implemented Europe and Australia [114]. These\ninclude IRRISAT-Italy\
    \ (as distinct from IrriSAT-Australia described above), EO4Water (Austria),\n\
    and IrriEye (southern Australia). These services generally involve the use of\
    \ optical DEIMOS 20 m\nsatellite imagery to generate and deliver leaf area index\
    \ with derived Kc and related map overlays\nwithin a browsing and querying toolbox\
    \ [115]. Personalized irrigation guidance regarding crop water\nrequirement is\
    \ dispensed through a secure website, SMS, and email. End-users are able to provide\n\
    evaluative feedback. A variety of crops are being tested, including vegetables,\
    \ sugar beet, corn, alfalfa,\nand orchards.\nEarth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux\
    \ (EEFlux) [116] is a METRIC implementation on the Google\nEarth Engine cloud\
    \ computing platform [117]. Landsat scenes from 1984 to the present are combined\n\
    with gridded weather data to allow the analysis of most land areas worldwide.\
    \ The products\ninclude maps of ET, associated energy balance ﬂux components,\
    \ and land cover. A time-series\ncan be constructed by processing several scenes\
    \ and interpolating between image dates. Automated\nimage calibration for anchor\
    \ pixels is offered in a Level 1 version to accommodate operation by\nnon-experts,\
    \ with some sacriﬁce in accuracy. A Level 2 version, which allows custom calibration\
    \ by\nthe operator, requires an annual license fee. EEFlux is a general tool that\
    \ operates on both agricultural\nand non-agricultural land cover types.\n7.2.\
    \ Satellite Remote Sensing Considerations for Irrigation Scheduling\nSatellite\
    \ observation is recognized as a useful tool that will continue to support crop\
    \ coefﬁcient\ndevelopment and ET monitoring for new types and varieties of crops,\
    \ as facilitated by the wider\navailability of gridded weather data and continued\
    \ advancement in convenient and user-friendly\nmapping technologies [118]. The\
    \ use of public domain satellites with open-data policies, i.e., the data\nsource\
    \ is available at no charge, is an advantage of this approach, as is the capability\
    \ to collect data\nfor many ﬁelds simultaneously. Vegetable crops, however, do\
    \ present some unique challenges for\nsatellite-based evaluation. The frequency\
    \ of satellite overpasses, presence of cloud cover, and added\ntime needed to\
    \ perform custom atmospheric correction (e.g., Vermote and Saleous [119]) may\n\
    limit the use of remote sensing for real time irrigation scheduling of fast-growing\
    \ vegetable crops.\nAs more satellite platforms become available, such as the\
    \ European Space Agency Sentinel-2 system,\nthe observation interval between images\
    \ may soon decrease to four to ﬁve days for NDVI-based ET\nmodels. Also, upon\
    \ further testing, it may be shown that use of a simpliﬁed atmospheric correction\n\
    approach (e.g., Tasumi et al. [120]) may be adequate for application in some or\
    \ most regions. Where\nreal-time irrigation scheduling operations are unsupported,\
    \ remote sensing may still prove useful\nfor the retrospective evaluation of irrigation\
    \ system performance or compilation of water use metrics.\nAnother challenge is\
    \ the typically small ﬁeld size for vegetables as noted above (4–5 ha), which\
    \ is near\nthe minimum land area recommended for evaluation by Landsat or other\
    \ public Earth observation\nsatellites. An additional challenge is posed by leaf\
    \ color, especially for crops such as red lettuce\nthat depart widely from the\
    \ green-leaf norm. A recent study has also shown that while NDVI was\nstrongly\
    \ related to Fc in both leafy greens (r2 = 0.88) and cole crops (r2 = 0.93), the\
    \ relationships were\ndifferent [121]. Thus, the development of customized relationships\
    \ between NDVI and Fc by crop\ncategory is recommended to increase the accuracy\
    \ of Fc estimates.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n13 of 20\n8. Remote Sensing Using\
    \ Manned Aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)\nThe use of manned aircraft\
    \ and UAVs for monitoring vegetables has become a viable alternative or\ncomplement\
    \ to satellite observation. Image resolution is generally much ﬁner than that\
    \ of Landsat or\nother open-data satellites, and passes over ﬁelds can be scheduled\
    \ on a more frequent and ﬂexible basis.\nHowever, data calibration to assure image\
    \ consistency in support of time-series observations may be\nlacking. Several\
    \ commercial companies offer NDVI and thermal spectrum images at <1 m resolution\n\
    taken at weekly intervals using small planes in California and elsewhere (e.g.,\
    \ CERESimaging Inc.,\nOakland, CA, USA; TerrAvion Inc., San Leandro, CA, USA).\
    \ Images can be accessed from the web\ngenerally within 24 h of collection.\n\
    The high resolution of these scenes can provide enhanced\ninformation about within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability in crop growth and water stress and for determining\nFc\
    \ used to parameterize ET equations. Patterns can show when a crop is under-irrigated\
    \ such as in\nFigure 4, where the NDVI values for a romaine lettuce crop are lowest\
    \ midway between sprinkler\nlines, presumably caused by poor irrigation distribution\
    \ uniformity.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n13 of 20 \nresolution  taken  at  weekly \
    \ intervals  using  small  planes  in  California  and  elsewhere  (e.g. \nCERESimaging \

    \ can  be \naccessed from the web generally within 24 h of collection. The high resolution of these scenes can \n\
    provide enhanced information about within‐field spatial variability in crop growth and water stress \n\
    and for determining Fc used to parameterize ET equations. Patterns can show when a crop is under‐\n\
    irrigated such as in Figure 4, where the NDVI values for a romaine lettuce crop are lowest midway \n\
    between sprinkler lines, presumably caused by poor irrigation distribution uniformity. \n\
     \nFigure 4. NDVI image of a romaine lettuce field irrigated with sprinklers on lateral pipes (a) spaced \n\

    values were low. Photo credit: CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA. \nThe acquisition costs of UAVs and the training needed for mission planning, flight operation, \n\
    and  image  processing  have  diminished  significantly  during  recent  years. \
    \ A  number  of  studies \ndescribe the use of UAVs for monitoring water stress [122,123] and vegetative cover [124,125] of \n\
    crops, though few have specifically focused on vegetables. Due to the ease of operation, arranging \n\
    flights at specific times and locations with UAVs may be simpler than with manned aircraft, which \n\
    usually need to image a minimal number of fields to justify flight costs. This flexibility may be useful \n\
    in vegetables when timely field scouting is needed to make decisions or diagnose a problem with a \n\
    fast‐growing crop. UAVs can fly at very low altitudes and carry sensor packages that can provide \n\
    high‐resolution imagery in the order of a few centimeters. A disadvantage of UAV operation, in the \n\
    case of an owned system, would be a higher up‐front cost than the engagement of a manned aircraft \n\
    provider and additional time required for data retrieval and image processing. \

    \ CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA.\nThe acquisition costs of UAVs and the\
    \ training needed for mission planning, ﬂight operation,\nand image processing\
    \ have diminished signiﬁcantly during recent years. A number of studies describe\n\
    the use of UAVs for monitoring water stress [122,123] and vegetative cover [124,125]\
    \ of crops, though\nfew have speciﬁcally focused on vegetables. Due to the ease\
    \ of operation, arranging ﬂights at speciﬁc\ntimes and locations with UAVs may\
    \ be simpler than with manned aircraft, which usually need to\nimage a minimal\
    \ number of ﬁelds to justify ﬂight costs. This ﬂexibility may be useful in vegetables\n\
    when timely ﬁeld scouting is needed to make decisions or diagnose a problem with\
    \ a fast-growing\ncrop. UAVs can ﬂy at very low altitudes and carry sensor packages\
    \ that can provide high-resolution\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n14 of 20\nimagery\
    \ in the order of a few centimeters. A disadvantage of UAV operation, in the case\
    \ of an owned\nsystem, would be a higher up-front cost than the engagement of\
    \ a manned aircraft provider and\nadditional time required for data retrieval\
    \ and image processing.\n9. Conclusions\nWater scarcity will most likely continue\
    \ to be a signiﬁcant problem in many of the important\nvegetable production regions\
    \ of the world [126]. Improving water use efﬁciency through more\naccurate scheduling\
    \ of irrigation can conserve water and address water quality impacts associated\n\
    with commercial vegetable operations. However, irrigation scheduling in vegetables\
    \ presents some\nunique challenges due to the diversity of crop types, intensive\
    \ rotations, and number of ﬁelds\nthat must be managed, as well as competing cultural\
    \ operations that are involved in growing\nmarketable crops. Advances in soil\
    \ moisture sensors, wireless communications, ET measurements,\nremote sensing,\
    \ computer technology, and cloud computing offer many potential opportunities\n\
    to develop robust irrigation advisory tools to help farmers accurately determine\
    \ and meet crop\nwater needs. While much progress has already been made in soil\
    \ moisture sensing and ET-based\nirrigation scheduling, achieving wide-scale adoption\
    \ in the vegetable industry will require continued\ninnovation. Continued collaboration\
    \ between public research institutions, universities, commodity\nboards, and commercial\
    \ ﬁrms will likely be needed to develop simple-to-use tools that will be broadly\n\
    accepted by vegetable growers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors wish to thank Forrest\

    THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT REQUEST OF AUTHOR.] Economic as well as water shortage
    pressure on agricultural use of water has placed added emphasis on efficient irrigation
    management. Center pivot technology has made great improvement with variable rate
    irrigation (VRI) technology to vary water application spatially and temporally
    to maximize the economic and environmental return. Proper management of VRI systems
    depends on correctly matching the pivot application to specific field temporal
    and areal conditions. There is need for a tool to accurately and inexpensively
    define dynamic management zones, to sense within-field variability in real time,
    and control variable rate water application so that producers are more willing
    to adopt and utilize the advantages of VRI systems. This study included tests
    of the center pivot system uniformity performance in 2014 at Delta Research Center
    in Portageville, MO. The goal of this research was to develop MOPivot software
    with an algorithm to determine unique management areas under center pivot systems
    based on system design and limitations. The MOPivot tool automates prescriptions
    for VRI center pivot based on non-uniform water needs while avoiding potential
    runoff and deep percolation. The software was validated for use in real-time irrigation
    management in 2018 for VRI control system of a Valley 8000 center pivot planted
    to corn. The water balance model was used to manage irrigation scheduling. Field
    data, together with soil moisture sensor measurement of soil water content, were
    used to develop the regression model of remote sensing-based crop coefficient
    (Kc). Remote sensing vegetation index in conjunction with GDD and crop growth
    stages in regression models showed high correlation with Kc. Validation of those
    regression models was done using Centralia, MO, field data in 2016. The MOPivot
    successfully created prescriptions to match system capacity of the management
    zone based on system limitations for center pivot management. Along with GIS data
    sources, MOPivot effectively provides readily available graphical prescription
    maps, which can be edited and directly uploaded to a center pivot control panel.
    The modeled Kc compared well with FAO Kc. By combining GDD and crop growth in
    the models, these models would account for local weather conditions and stage
    of crop during growing season as time index in estimating Kc. These models with
    Fraction of growth (FrG) and cumulative growing degree days (cGDD) had a higher
    coefficient of efficiency, higher Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency and
    higher Willmott index of agreement. Future work should include improvement in
    the MOPivot software with different crops and aerial remote sensing imagery to
    generate dynamic prescriptions during the season to support irrigation scheduling
    for real-time monitoring of field conditions. URI https://hdl.handle.net/10355/79549

    2 \n \nAbstract: Real-time accurate prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) is critical for \n1 \nreal-time irrigation decisions and water resource\
    \ management. Although many public weather \n2 \nforecast-based machine learning\
    \ models have been successfully used for daily ETo prediction, these \n3 \nmodels\
    \ are developed with long-term historical daily observed meteorological data.\
    \ The use of \n4 \ntraining and testing samples from different data sources can\
    \ lead to the selection of the best model, \n5 \nand the performance of the best\
    \ model for predicting daily ETo is not ideal. In this study, based on \n6 \n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equations, four\
    \ machine \n7 \nlearning models (multilayer perceptron (MLPo), extreme gradient\
    \ boosting (XGBoosto), light \n8 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBMo), and\
    \ gradient boosting with categorical features support \n9 \n(CatBoost1o)) were\
    \ trained and validated with daily observed meteorological data from 1995-2015\
    \ \n10 \nand 2016-2019, respectively, and five machine learning models (MLPp,\
    \ XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n11 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) were trained and validated\
    \ with daily public weather forecast data with \n12 \na 1-day lead time (2014-2018\
    \ and 2019, respectively). Based on public weather forecast and daily \n13 \n\
    observed meteorological data (2020-2021), the predicted daily ETo performance\
    \ of nine machine \n14 \nlearning models (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n15 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) was compared. The\
    \ results show that for all three studied climate zones, \n16 \nthe performance\
    \ of the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ \n17 \nadvance is better than that of the four models developed based on daily\
    \ observed meteorological \n18 \ndata with corresponding input combinations, and\
    \ the mean MAE and RMSE ranges for the four \n19 \nmodels (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,\
    \ and CatBoost1) in the three studied climate zones were \n20 \nreduced by 2.93%-11.67%\
    \ and 2.20%-9.46%, respectively, and the mean R range was improved by \n21 \n\
    1.31%-5.31%. The top three models for the AR climate zone were XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n22 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion started:\

    \ models for the SAR climate zone were MLPp, XGBoostp, and LightGBMp, and \n23\
    \ \nthe top three models for the SHZ climate zone were XGBoostp, MLPp, and LightGBMp.\
    \ In addition, \n24 \nthe prediction performance for daily ETo is found to be\
    \ highest in winter and lowest in summer in \n25 \nall three climate zones. Wspd\
    \ from public weather forecasts was the most important source of daily \n26 \n\
    ETo error in model predictions for the AR climate zone, followed by SDun, Tmax,\
    \ and Tmin, while \n27 \nSDun from public weather forecasts was the most important\
    \ source of daily ETo error in model \n28 \npredictions for the SAR (SHZ) climate\
    \ zone, followed by Wspd, Tmax, and Tmin (Tmax, Wspd, and \n29 \nTmin). \n30 \n\

    \ \n35 \nCrop water demand is the most important part of water transfer and energy\
    \ conversion in the \n36 \nsoil‒plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC), and it is an\
    \ important process in the field water cycle. \n37 \nAccurately estimating crop\
    \ water demand is the basis for designing crop irrigation systems, \n38 \ndetermining\
    \ regional irrigation water use, and facilitating effective basin planning, regional\
    \ water \n39 \nplanning, and drainage and irrigation project planning, design,\
    \ and management. However, directly \n40 \nmeasuring crop water demand is time-consuming\
    \ and expensive, significantly limiting practical \n41 \napplications (Irmak et\
    \ al., 2003; Martınez-Cob et al., 2015; Silva et al. 2019a; Fan et al., 2021a).\
    \ \n42 \nThus, crop water demand is usually measured using an indirect method,\
    \ i.e., reference \n43 \nevapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by the crop coefficient.\
    \ Predicting ETo is more valuable than \n44 \nestimating ETo (Yang et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang et al., 2019a), and accurate ETo prediction is the key to crop \n45 \n\

    \ prerequisite for real-time irrigation forecasting, which has \n46 \nimportant\
    \ reference value and significance for real-time irrigation decisions (Luo et\
    \ al., 2014; Perera \n47 \net al. 2014; Ballesteros et al., 2016). \n48 \nDepending\
    \ on the method and input data, ETo prediction methods can be divided into direct\
    \ and \n49 \nindirect methods (Perera et al., 2014). Since daily ETo data mainly\
    \ vary with weather and are only \n50 \ninfluenced by future weather variables,\
    \ direct methods that use long-term historical weather data to \n51 \npredict\
    \ ETo are not applicable to short-term daily ETo prediction. For indirect ETo\
    \ prediction \n52 \nmethods that use weather forecast data, numerical weather\
    \ forecasts that provide all the variables of \n53 \nthe Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization 56 Penman–Monteith (FAO 56 PM) equation have been used \n54 \n\
    in predicting daily ETo (Silva et al., 2010; Pelosi et al., 2016), and used in\
    \ predicting daily ETo with \n55 \na 1-10 day lead time (Perera et al. 2014; Medina\
    \ et al., 2018; Vanella et al., 2020). However, \n56 \nnumerical forecast products\
    \ in China are only available to professionals (e.g., registered users in \n57\
    \ \nacademia and research) and are not accessible to nonprofessionals. In addition,\
    \ these products \n58 \nrequire preprocessing (Fan et al., 2021b) or postprocessing\
    \ (Medina et al., 2020) by professionals \n59 \nto improve the reliability of\
    \ the output data. \n60 \nIn China, the China Weather Network, hosted by the Public\
    \ Meteorological Service Center of \n61 \nthe China Meteorological Administration,\
    \ is a public service-based meteorological portal for society \n62 \nand the public.\
    \ The China Weather Network covers more than 100,000 sites in provinces, cities,\

    \ Cai et \n71 \nal., 2009), used to forecast daily ETo with a lead time of 1-3\
    \ days (Liu et al., 2020), and used to \n72 \nforecast daily ETo with a lead time\
    \ of 1-7 days (Yang et al., 2016). The results of these studies \n73 \nindicate\
    \ that the errors in daily ETo predicted with the variables transformed with information\
    \ from \n74 \npublic weather forecasts and the FAO 56 PM equation are mainly caused\
    \ by errors arising from the \n75 \nprocess of converting qualitative wind scale\
    \ and weather type information in public weather \n76 \nforecasts into wind speed\
    \ and sunshine hour information, respectively. \n77 \nThus, some studies have\
    \ included measured or precalculated variable data and public weather \n78 \n\
    forecast data as inputs for their models to predict daily ETo. An example of such\
    \ studies include \n79 \nusing temperature data from weather forecasts and actual\
    \ incident net solar radiation (Rs) values \n80 \noccurring in each advance period\
    \ and four artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms \n81 \n(generalized\
    \ feedforward (GFF), linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and \n\
    82 \nprobabilistic neural network (PNN)) to forecast ETo in Dallas, Texas, USA,\
    \ 1-15 days in advance \n83 \n(Traore et al., 2016). Additionally, temperature\
    \ data from public weather forecasts, measured \n84 \nsunshine hours, precalculated\
    \ weather type correction factors (Wt, only four weather type correction \n85\
    \ \nfactors, i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast and rainy, are defined) and a combined\
    \ model of bi-directional \n86 \nlong short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and ANN were\
    \ used to predict daily ETo 1-7 days ahead for \n87 \nthree stations in Ningxia,\
    \ China (Yin et al., 2020). However, since short-term daily ETo is mainly \n88\
    \ \ngoverned by weather conditions, introducing additional measured or precalculated\
    \ variable data as \n89 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ predict daily ETo may not be applicable for real-time irrigation decisions.\
    \ In addition, in \n90 \nthese studies, machine learning models were trained and\
    \ validated with long-term historical \n91 \nmeteorological data and tested with\
    \ public weather forecast data (with a maximum data duration of \n92 \n2 years).\
    \ Thus, the data sources in these studies were different (e.g., in China, the\
    \ source of historical \n93 \nmeteorological data is the National Meteorological\
    \ Information Center of China, while the source \n94 \nof public weather forecasts\
    \ is the Public Weather Service Center of the China Meteorological \n95 \nAdministration).\
    \ Moreover, there have been no comparison studies between training and validating\
    \ \n96 \nmachine learning models with historical meteorological data and public\
    \ weather forecast data. \n97 \nHowever, the use of samples from different data\
    \ sources may affect the daily ETo performance of \n98 \nmachine learning models.\
    \ \n99 \nIn recent years, three integrated learning models, extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), light \n100 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and gradient boosting\
    \ with categorical features support \n101 \n(CatBoost), based on a boosting algorithm\
    \ with a decision tree as the base learner and greedy ideas \n102 \nfor decision\
    \ tree growth, have been widely used to estimate daily ETo. Among them, CatBoost\
    \ can \n103 \ndirectly handle categorical data, such as public weather forecasts\
    \ of wind scale and weather type. \n104 \nFan et al. (2018) recommended using\
    \ the XGBoost and GBDT models with limited climate data to \n105 \npredict daily\
    \ ETo under different climatic conditions in China. Fan et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ \n106 \nLightGBM generally outperformed the other two soft computing models\
    \ and four empirical models \n107 \nin estimating daily ETo with data from 49\
    \ weather stations in humid subtropical China using local \n108 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and cross-station meteorological data. Zhou et al. (2020) strongly recommended\
    \ \n109 \nthe use of CatBoost and LightGBM models for estimating daily ETo under\
    \ different climatic \n110 \nconditions in China. Huang et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ the CatBoost algorithm has great potential for \n111 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    7 \n \ndaily ETo estimation in humid regions of China. Zhang et al. (2020) also\
    \ showed that CatBoost is \n112 \nconsidered the best choice for estimating ETo\
    \ in arid and semiarid regions of northern China. These \n113 \nstudies showed\
    \ that all three models estimated daily ETo with better accuracy and stability\
    \ than \n114 \nthose of other models. However, studies on the prediction of daily\
    \ ETo with these three models have \n115 \nnot been reported. The objectives of\
    \ this study are as follows: (1) to first develop four machine \n116 \nlearning\
    \ models using daily observed meteorological data and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a \n117 \n1-day lead time, respectively, and then to test and compare\
    \ the performance of the developed models \n118 \nin both cases using public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-7 day lead time; (2) to explore the use of \n119 \ncategorical\
    \ data (public weather forecasts of wind scale and weather type) as direct input\
    \ into \n120 \nCatBoost for daily ETo prediction; and (3) to compare the seasonal\
    \ variation in predicted daily ETo \n121 \nperformance of the five machine learning\
    \ models and recommend the best daily ETo prediction \n122 \nmodel for all four\
    \ seasons at nine stations in three different climates. \n123 \n2. Materials and\

    10 \n \nThe two main types of integrated learning algorithms are bagging-based\
    \ algorithms and \n166 \nboosting-based algorithms. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost\
    \ are improved implementations of \n167 \nthe GBDT algorithm and belong to the\
    \ boosting algorithm family. Among them, XGBoost was \n168 \nproposed by Chen\
    \ et al. (2016), and its official open source documentation is available at \n\
    169 \nhttp://xgboost.readthedocs.io. LightGBM was proposed by Ke et al. (2017),\
    \ and its official open \n170 \nsource documentation is available at http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io.\
    \ CatBoost was proposed by \n171 \nProkhorenkova et al. (2017), and its official\
    \ open source documentation is available at \n172 \nhttps://catboost.ai/en/docs/.\
    \ The base learners of all three algorithms are decision trees, but the tree \n\
    173 \nfeatures and the process of generation differ in many ways. For example,\
    \ XGBoost uses a levelwise \n174 \ndecision tree growth strategy, LightGBM uses\
    \ a leafwise decision tree growth strategy with depth \n175 \nrestrictions, and\
    \ CatBoost uses a fully symmetric decision tree as the base learner. \n176 \n\
    For categorical features, CatBoost only needs to declare the categorical signs\
    \ to enable direct \n177 \nfeature processing (Prokhorenkova et al. 2017; Dorogush\
    \ et al. 2018). LightGBM associates each \n178 \ncategorical feature fetch with\
    \ a bucket (bin) and thus automatically processes the features without \n179 \n\
    preprocessing using one-hot encoding. XGBoost cannot process the categorical features\
    \ directly. \n180 \nThis model is used after preprocessing the categorical features\
    \ by various encoding methods such \n181 \nas tag encoding, mean encoding, or\
    \ one-hot encoding. \n182 \nThe concept of deep learning was introduced by Hinton\
    \ et al. (2006). A multilayer perceptron \n183 \n(MLP) with multiple hidden layers\
    \ is a deep learning structure. MLP with one or two hidden layers \n184 \nhas\
    \ been successfully used for ETo estimation or prediction. Landeras et al. (2008)\
    \ used an artificial \n185 \nneural network (ANN) with 1 hidden layer to estimate\
    \ the daily ETo for Alava, Basque Country in \n186 \nnorthern Spain and obtained\
    \ better results than those from 10 locally calibrated empirical and \n187 \n\

    \ their variants. Ferreira et al. (2019) estimated daily ETo for all of \n188\
    \ \nBrazil using the first four days of data, and an ANN (model structure 16-50-50-1)\
    \ was the best \n189 \nchoice among temperature- and relative humidity-based models.\
    \ The ANN with two hidden layers \n190 \nused by Elbeltagi et al. (2022) is a\
    \ suitable alternative to estimate the daily ETo for the \n191 \nmeteorological\
    \ station in Debrecen, Hungary, based on limited meteorological data. Luo et al.\
    \ (2015) \n192 \nused an MLP with two hidden layers and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a 1-7 day lead time to \n193 \npredict the daily ETo for Gaoyou station\
    \ in Jiangsu Province, China, with acceptable prediction \n194 \nperformance.\
    \ Traore et al. (2016) showed that an MLP model with two hidden layers and a \n\
    195 \ncombination of Tmax, Tmin, and Rs inputs had the best ETo prediction performance\
    \ for Dallas, Texas, \n196 \nUSA. These studies used trial-and-error methods to\
    \ determine the numbers of hidden layers and \n197 \nneurons per hidden layer.\
    \ These methods are time-consuming and may not always yield the best \n198 \n\
    hyperparameters. In this study, an MLP with multiple hidden layers is compared\
    \ with three machine \n199 \nlearning models, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.\
    \ The MLP with multiple hidden layers is \n200 \nimplemented using Google's TensorFlow\

    \ outperformed CatBoost2 performance with the C5, C6, \n548 \nC8, C7 and C9 input\

    \ combinations outperformed CatBoost2 with the C5, C6, C8, C7, and C9 input \n\
    553 \ncombinations. These results show that although the CatBoost2 model outperformed\
    \ the CatBoost1p \n554 \nmodel with some input combinations in the training and\
    \ validation periods, the CatBoost1p model \n555 \noutperformed the CatBoost2\
    \ model with all input combinations in the testing period. Thus, adding \n556\
    \ \ncategory data such as wind scale (WS) and weather type (WT1 and WT2) directly\
    \ to the input \n557 \ncombinations of the CatBoost2 model did not improve the\
    \ performance of the model in terms of \n558 \npredicting daily ETo in the testing\
    \ period. This may be due to the poor stability of the CatBoost2 \n559 \nmodel\
    \ and the poor performance of wind scale and weather type predictions in the public\
    \ weather \n560 \nforecasts for the 1-7 days ahead period. \n561 \nThe optimal\

    \ and \n564 \nvalidated with 1-day ahead public weather forecast data for the\
    \ three climate zones are shown in \n565 \nTable 15. In all climate zones except\
    \ for SAR and SHZ, where the best input combination for \n566 \nCatBoost1p was\
    \ C3 (8.33%), the best input combination for each of the eight machine learning\
    \ \n567 \nmodels (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o, MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n568 \nCatBoost1p) were either C1 (20.83%), C2 (29.17%), or C4 (41.67%).\
    \ Consistent with previous \n569 \nfindings (Yang et al., 2019a), the results\
    \ indicate that the inclusion of SDun in the input \n570 \ncombinations improves\
    \ the performance of machine learning models in predicting daily ETo (Perera \n\
    571 \net al., 2014; Traore et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b;\
    \ Yin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., \n572 \n2020; Dong et al., 2021; Zhao et al.,\
    \ 2022), while the inclusion of Wspd leads to a decrease in the \n573 \nperformance.\
    \ Therefore, SDun and Wspd should be included in the input combinations of machine\
    \ \n574 \nlearning models cautiously. In addition, the model information obtained\
    \ using the optimal input \n575 \ncombination for each of the machine learning\
    \ models (MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, \n576 \nand CatBoost2) trained\
    \ and validated with 1-day ahead public weather forecast data is shown in \n577\
    \ \nTable 16. It is shown that the daily ETo performance predicted by MLP models\
    \ with 2-3 hidden \n578 \nlayers is better than that with 1 hidden layer (Luo\

    615 \nThe performance metrics of four models developed based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data \n616 \nand five models developed based on public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-day lead time to predict \n617 \ndaily ETo with a 1-7\
    \ day lead time for the three climate zones are shown in Figures 4 and 5. First,\
    \ \n618 \nthe daily ETo prediction performance of the nine models for the three\
    \ climate zones, AR, SAR, and \n619 \nSHZ, decreased with increasing lead time,\
    \ which is due to the decrease in forecast performance of \n620 \npublic weather\
    \ forecasting variables with increasing lead time, which is consistent with previous\
    \ \n621 \nstudies (Perera et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014 and 2015; Traore et al.,\
    \ 2016; Yang et al., 2016, 2019a, \n622 \n2019b; Traore et al., 2017; Li et al.,\
    \ 2018; Yin et al., 2020). In addition, for all three climate zones, \n623 \n\
    the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day lead\
    \ time to predict \n624 \ndaily ETo 1-7 days ahead outperformed the four models\
    \ developed based on daily observed \n625 \nmeteorological data with corresponding\
    \ input combinations (except for the 1-day ahead prediction \n626 \nperformance\
    \ of MLPp, XGBoostp, and CatBoost1p for the SHZ climate zone). Second, the RM\
    \ \n627 \nvalues of the nine models for the AR climate zone varied in the range\
    \ of 0.92-1.07. Three models, \n628 \nMLPp, XGBoostp and LightGBMo, slightly overestimated\
    \ (2.90%-6.58%) the daily ETo, while \n629 \nLightGBMp, CatBoost1p, CatBoost2,\

    \ climate zones, the four models \n640 \ndeveloped based on 1-day ahead public\
    \ weather forecast data generally outperformed the four \n641 \nmodels developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data with corresponding input \n642 \n\
    combinations for all metrics. In addition, the prediction performance of all models\
    \ exhibited a \n643 \ndecrease in the following order for the three climate zones:\
    \ AR, SHZ, and SAR. This result is mainly \n644 \nbecause the prediction performance\
    \ of models developed based on public weather forecasts for the \n645 \nAR climate\
    \ zone is better than that for the SAR and SHZ climate zones. For the AR climate\

    \ have different field irrigation seasons according to crop type \n686 \nand location\
    \ (Perera et al., 2014). In addition, the sensitivity of weather variables varies\
    \ with season \n687 \nand the microclimate of the studied site location (Vanella\
    \ et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a strong \n688 \nneed to evaluate the seasonality\
    \ of the ETo forecast performance. Tables 18-20 show the mean \n689 \nstatistics\
    \ of the performance indicators for the 1-7 day lead time ETo forecasts using\
    \ the five models \n690 \ndeveloped based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-day lead time for the three climatic zones \n691 \nfor all seasons of 2020-2021.\
    \ First, during all four seasons, the daily ETo prediction performance of \n692\
    \ \nall five models was better in the AR climate zone than in the SAR and SHZ\
    \ climate zones (excluding \n693 \nCatBoost2 in the spring and MLP in the fall\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, and all five models in the \n694 \nwinter in the SHZ\
    \ climate zone). This is mainly because the prediction performance of models using\
    \ \n695 \nthe public weather forecast variables in the AR climate zone outperform\
    \ those in the SAR and SHZ \n696 \nclimate zones overall. \n697 \nSecond, the\
    \ order of the seasonal MAE and RMSE values for daily ETo prediction using the\
    \ five \n698 \nmodels in the AR climate zone are as follows: winter, spring, fall,\
    \ and summer. In addition, the \n699 \nseasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ are lower than the annual average, except for the \n700 \nMLPp and LightGBMp\
    \ models for station TX in the SAR climate zone and the MLPp and XGBoost \n701\

    \ the other three models in the SAR and SHZ climate zones are as follows: winter,\
    \ fall, spring, \n703 \nand summer. The seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ and fall in the SAR climate zone \n704 \nare lower than the annual average,\
    \ and the seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter in the \n705 \nSHZ climate\
    \ zone are lower than the annual average. These results are consistent with results\
    \ in \n706 \nprevious studies (Perera et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Fan et\
    \ al., 2021b). The seasonal R values of \n707 \nETo for all model prediction days\
    \ in all three climate zones were lower than the annual average, \n708 \nwith\
    \ the smallest R values observed during summer. The maximum seasonal R values\
    \ in the AR \n709 \nclimate zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp, LightGBMp, and\
    \ CatBoost1p) and fall (MLPp and \n710 \nCatBoost2), those in the SAR climate\
    \ zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp and LightGBMp) and fall \n711 \n(MLPp, CatBoost1p,\
    \ and CatBoost2), and those for the SHZ climate zone occurred in spring \n712\
    \ \n(XGBoostp) and fall (MLPp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2). The seasonal\
    \ RM values \n713 \nof daily ETo prediction using the five machine learning models\
    \ in the three climate zones were less \n714 \nthan 1 in spring and summer and\
    \ greater than 1 in fall and winter, indicating that daily ETo was \n715 \nunderestimated\
    \ in spring and summer (except for XGBoostp in summer in the AR climate zone,\
    \ \n716 \nwhich was overestimated by 2.93%) and overestimated in fall and winter\
    \ (except for CatBoost1p in \n717 \nwinter in the SHZ climate zone and CatBoost2,\
    \ which were underestimated by 7.75% and 2.05%, \n718 \nrespectively). \n719 \n\

    \ \n751 \nFor all three climate zones, the performance of the four models developed\
    \ based on public \n752 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day lead time was better\
    \ than the performance of the four models \n753 \ndeveloped based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data. To reliably and accurately analyse the \n754 \nweather\
    \ forecast variables that cause daily ETo forecast errors, the models developed\
    \ based on daily \n755 \nobserved meteorological data were chosen to evaluate\
    \ the impact of weather variables from public \n756 \nweather forecasts on the\
    \ daily ETo forecasting performance. In this study, each of the four observed\
    \ \n757 \nweather variables (Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd) was replaced in sequence\
    \ with their corresponding \n758 \nforecast values with a 1-7 day lead time. This\
    \ allowed for the identification of cases where a large \n759 \nchange in the\
    \ forecasted daily ETo indicates an error in the prediction resulting from the\

    \ by Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd in the public \n762 \nweather forecast 1-7 days\
    \ ahead in turn to form the following new combinations: SC1 (Tmax, Tmin, \n763\

    \ and Wspd), and SC4 \n764 \n(Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd), all of which were composed\
    \ of day-by-day observations for the \n765 \ncombination denoted SC (Tmax, Tmin,\
    \ SDun, and Wspd). The statistics of the mean values for the 1-\n766 \n7 day lead\

    \ \n767 \nCatBoost1o) for the three climate zones with the SC-SC4 input combination\
    \ are shown in Tables 21-\n768 \n23. \n769 \nFirst, for all models (except the\
    \ LightGBM model at station ZW and the CatBoost1 model at \n770 \nstation HN),\
    \ the contribution of the public weather forecast variables to the error in the\
    \ predicted \n771 \ndaily ETo decreased in the order of Wspd, SDun, Tmax, and\
    \ Tmin for the AR (arid zone) climate zone,  \n772 \nwhich is consistent with\
    \ previous findings (Yang et al. 2016). Second, for all models (except the \n\
    773 \nMLP model at station YAC, the CatBoost1 model at station TX, the MLP model\
    \ at station XJ, the \n774 \nXGBoost model, and the LightGBM model), the contributions\
    \ of the public weather forecast \n775 \nvariables to the errors in the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, Wspd, Tmax, and \n776 \nTmin and SDun,\
    \ Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin for the SAR (semiarid) and SHZ (semihumid zone) climate\

    \ \n779 \nThese results indicate that for the study sites in the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the main source \n780 \nof error in daily ETo prediction is Wspd\

    \ the weather type of public weather forecasts contributes the most to the predicted\
    \ \n783 \ndaily ETo errors. First, the spatial variability of Wspd and DSun (Rs)\
    \ due to the topography, elevation, \n784 \ndistance, and cloudiness of the location\
    \ of the study site (Yuan et al., 2015; Fick and Hijmasn, 2017; \n785 \nLi and\
    \ Zha, 2018; Fan et al., 2021b) makes Wspd and DSun (Rs) the most difficult parameters\
    \ to \n786 \nforecast accurately (Yang et al., 2016, Ballesteros et al., 2016);\
    \ second, according to Cai et al. (2007), \n787 \nit is appropriate to estimate\
    \ Wspd from wind scale predicted by public weather forecasts, but this \n788 \n\
    estimation error is larger for arid regions with a high range of wind speed values.\
    \ George et al. (1985) \n789 \nreported that the largest difference between predicted\
    \ and measured reference crop \n790 \nevapotranspiration came from erroneous predictions\
    \ of mean wind speed. Li and Beswick (2005) \n791 \nalso reported that wind speed\
    \ is a more serious source of error than solar radiation in estimating ETo. \n\
    792 \nIn a study by Popova et al. (2005), it was noted that the effect of wind\
    \ speed on ETo results was \n793 \nrelatively small except in arid and windy areas.\
    \ \n794 \nAs shown in Table 3, SDun was estimated using the sunshine hour coefficients\
    \ derived from the \n795 \n2004 measured solar radiation data from Daxing District,\
    \ Beijing, using Equation (3). It was found \n796 \nthat applying the sunshine\
    \ hour coefficients derived from one region to other regions with different \n\
    797 \nclimate types will result in different degrees of error due to the climatic\
    \ differences between regions. \n798 \nPerera et al. (2014) found that the largest\
    \ source of error between predicted and observed ETo is the \n799 \npredictive\
    \ performance of daily incoming solar radiation, followed by air temperature,\
    \ dew point \n800 \ntemperature, and wind speed for all advanced periods. Pelosi\
    \ et al. (2016) indicated that the solar \n801 \nradiation forecast error has\
    \ the greatest impact on the ETo forecast performance, followed by relative \n\
    802 \nhumidity and wind speed. The results of Medina et al. (2018) also indicated\
    \ that the errors in solar \n803 \nradiation forecasts have the greatest impact\
    \ on ETo forecasts, followed by errors in wind forecasts. \n804 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    52 \n \nIn this study, public weather forecasts with a 1-7 day lead time were\
    \ used to compare the \n829 \nperformance of five models developed based on public\
    \ weather forecast data with a 1-day lead time \n830 \nand four models developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data in predicting daily ETo at \n831\
    \ \nnine stations in three climatic regions of Ningxia, China. The forecast performance\
    \ of weather \n832 \nvariables in public weather forecasting (2014-2021) and daily\
    \ ETo predicted by these nine models \n833 \nwere analysed and evaluated on a\
    \ daily scale, and the forecast performance of the weather variables \n834 \n\
    in the public weather forecast (2020-2021) and daily ETo predicted by the five\
    \ models developed \n835 \nbased on the public weather forecast with a 1-day lead\
    \ time were analysed and evaluated in terms \n836 \nof seasonality. The optimal\
    \ input combination for each machine learning model was determined, \n837 \nand\
    \ the weather forecast variables contributing to the error in the model predicted\
    \ daily ETo were \n838 \nidentified. The main conclusions of this study are as\
    \ follows: \n839 \nFirst, for the three climate zones, the performance of the\
    \ four models developed based on public \n840 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ lead time was better than that of the four models developed based \n841 \non\
    \ daily observation meteorological data with corresponding input combinations.\
    \ When category \n842 \ndata such as wind scale (WS) and weather type (WT1 and\
    \ WT2) were added directly to the input \n843 \ncombinations of the CatBoost2\
    \ model, the performance of this model in predicting daily ETo was \n844 \nlower\
    \ than that of the CatBoost1p model in the testing period; that is, the performance\
    \ of the \n845 \nCatBoost2 model in terms of predicting daily ETo did not improve\
    \ during the testing period. \n846 \nSecond, the performance of the five models,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p and \n847 \nCatBoost2, in terms of daily\
    \ ETo prediction, was highest in winter and the lowest in summer for all \n848\
    \ \nthree climate zones. In terms of predicting daily ETo with a 1-7 day lead\
    \ time in all seasons, \n849 \nXGBoostp with C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input,\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input and LightGBMp \n850 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    53 \n \nwith C1 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ fall and winter in the AR \n851 \nclimate zone, respectively. LightGBMp with\
    \ C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n852 \nC3 as input and\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ \n853 \nfall and winter in the SAR climate zone, respectively. XGBoostp with\
    \ C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n854 \nC3 as input and LightGBMp with C1 as input\
    \ are recommended as the best models for spring and \n855 \nsummer, fall and winter\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, respectively. \n856 \nFinally, for the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the contribution of the weather variables in the \n857 \npublic\
    \ weather forecast to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order\
    \ of Wspd, SDun, \n858 \nTmax, and Tmin; for the SAR climate zone (semiarid zone),\
    \ the contribution of the weather variables \n859 \nin the public weather forecast\
    \ to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, \n860\
    \ \nWspd, Tmax, and Tmin; and for the SHZ climate zone (semihumid zone), the contribution\
    \ of the \n861 \nweather variables in the public weather forecast to the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of \n862 \nSDun, Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin. \n863\
    \ \nIn addition, in terms of the daily scale performance of weather variables\
    \ in public weather \n864 \nforecasts, the forecast performance follows a decreasing\
    \ order of Tmin>Tmax>SDun>Wspd. In the \n865 \nseasonal analysis (2020-2021) of\
    \ the weather variable forecast performance for three climate zones, \n866 \n\
    the average performance for Tmax is in the order of summer (fall) > fall (summer)\
    \ > winter > spring. \n867 \nFor Tmin, the order is fall (summer) > summer (fall)\
    \ > winter (spring) > spring (winter), and for \n868 \nSDun, the order is winter\
    \ > spring > fall > summer. Thus, the average performance of the forecasts \n\
    869 \ndecreases sequentially. \n870 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    2 \n \nAbstract: Real-time accurate prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) is critical for \n1 \nreal-time irrigation decisions and water resource\
    \ management. Although many public weather \n2 \nforecast-based machine learning\
    \ models have been successfully used for daily ETo prediction, these \n3 \nmodels\
    \ are developed with long-term historical daily observed meteorological data.\
    \ The use of \n4 \ntraining and testing samples from different data sources can\
    \ lead to the selection of the best model, \n5 \nand the performance of the best\
    \ model for predicting daily ETo is not ideal. In this study, based on \n6 \n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equations, four\
    \ machine \n7 \nlearning models (multilayer perceptron (MLPo), extreme gradient\
    \ boosting (XGBoosto), light \n8 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBMo), and\
    \ gradient boosting with categorical features support \n9 \n(CatBoost1o)) were\
    \ trained and validated with daily observed meteorological data from 1995-2015\
    \ \n10 \nand 2016-2019, respectively, and five machine learning models (MLPp,\
    \ XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n11 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) were trained and validated\
    \ with daily public weather forecast data with \n12 \na 1-day lead time (2014-2018\
    \ and 2019, respectively). Based on public weather forecast and daily \n13 \n\
    observed meteorological data (2020-2021), the predicted daily ETo performance\
    \ of nine machine \n14 \nlearning models (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n15 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) was compared. The\
    \ results show that for all three studied climate zones, \n16 \nthe performance\
    \ of the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ \n17 \nadvance is better than that of the four models developed based on daily\
    \ observed meteorological \n18 \ndata with corresponding input combinations, and\
    \ the mean MAE and RMSE ranges for the four \n19 \nmodels (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,\
    \ and CatBoost1) in the three studied climate zones were \n20 \nreduced by 2.93%-11.67%\
    \ and 2.20%-9.46%, respectively, and the mean R range was improved by \n21 \n\
    1.31%-5.31%. The top three models for the AR climate zone were XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n22 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion started:\

    \ models for the SAR climate zone were MLPp, XGBoostp, and LightGBMp, and \n23\
    \ \nthe top three models for the SHZ climate zone were XGBoostp, MLPp, and LightGBMp.\
    \ In addition, \n24 \nthe prediction performance for daily ETo is found to be\
    \ highest in winter and lowest in summer in \n25 \nall three climate zones. Wspd\
    \ from public weather forecasts was the most important source of daily \n26 \n\
    ETo error in model predictions for the AR climate zone, followed by SDun, Tmax,\
    \ and Tmin, while \n27 \nSDun from public weather forecasts was the most important\
    \ source of daily ETo error in model \n28 \npredictions for the SAR (SHZ) climate\
    \ zone, followed by Wspd, Tmax, and Tmin (Tmax, Wspd, and \n29 \nTmin). \n30 \n\

    \ Tree-based \n32 \nassembly algorithms, Irrigation season \n33 \n \n34 \n1. Introduction\
    \ \n35 \nCrop water demand is the most important part of water transfer and energy\
    \ conversion in the \n36 \nsoil‒plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC), and it is an\
    \ important process in the field water cycle. \n37 \nAccurately estimating crop\
    \ water demand is the basis for designing crop irrigation systems, \n38 \ndetermining\
    \ regional irrigation water use, and facilitating effective basin planning, regional\
    \ water \n39 \nplanning, and drainage and irrigation project planning, design,\
    \ and management. However, directly \n40 \nmeasuring crop water demand is time-consuming\
    \ and expensive, significantly limiting practical \n41 \napplications (Irmak et\
    \ al., 2003; Martınez-Cob et al., 2015; Silva et al. 2019a; Fan et al., 2021a).\
    \ \n42 \nThus, crop water demand is usually measured using an indirect method,\
    \ i.e., reference \n43 \nevapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by the crop coefficient.\
    \ Predicting ETo is more valuable than \n44 \nestimating ETo (Yang et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang et al., 2019a), and accurate ETo prediction is the key to crop \n45 \n\

    \ prerequisite for real-time irrigation forecasting, which has \n46 \nimportant\
    \ reference value and significance for real-time irrigation decisions (Luo et\
    \ al., 2014; Perera \n47 \net al. 2014; Ballesteros et al., 2016). \n48 \nDepending\
    \ on the method and input data, ETo prediction methods can be divided into direct\
    \ and \n49 \nindirect methods (Perera et al., 2014). Since daily ETo data mainly\
    \ vary with weather and are only \n50 \ninfluenced by future weather variables,\
    \ direct methods that use long-term historical weather data to \n51 \npredict\
    \ ETo are not applicable to short-term daily ETo prediction. For indirect ETo\
    \ prediction \n52 \nmethods that use weather forecast data, numerical weather\
    \ forecasts that provide all the variables of \n53 \nthe Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization 56 Penman–Monteith (FAO 56 PM) equation have been used \n54 \n\
    in predicting daily ETo (Silva et al., 2010; Pelosi et al., 2016), and used in\
    \ predicting daily ETo with \n55 \na 1-10 day lead time (Perera et al. 2014; Medina\
    \ et al., 2018; Vanella et al., 2020). However, \n56 \nnumerical forecast products\
    \ in China are only available to professionals (e.g., registered users in \n57\
    \ \nacademia and research) and are not accessible to nonprofessionals. In addition,\
    \ these products \n58 \nrequire preprocessing (Fan et al., 2021b) or postprocessing\
    \ (Medina et al., 2020) by professionals \n59 \nto improve the reliability of\
    \ the output data. \n60 \nIn China, the China Weather Network, hosted by the Public\
    \ Meteorological Service Center of \n61 \nthe China Meteorological Administration,\
    \ is a public service-based meteorological portal for society \n62 \nand the public.\
    \ The China Weather Network covers more than 100,000 sites in provinces, cities,\
    \ \n63 \ntowns, and tourist attractions across the country and provides real-time\
    \ meteorological services, \n64 \nincluding weather forecasts, current conditions,\
    \ indices, air quality information, and many other \n65 \nelements, with a minimum\
    \ time resolution of 5 minutes and a maximum forecast time of 40 days. It \n66\
    \ \nalso provides user location-based forecasting services on mobile sites. Public\
    \ weather forecasts \n67 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ four variables: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind scale and weather\
    \ type. \n68 \nIn recent years, public weather forecasts have been widely used\
    \ in ETo forecasting. For example, \n69 \ninformation from public weather forecasts\
    \ has been converted into variables required to calculate \n70 \nETo using the\
    \ FAO-56 PM equation, and then used to forecast in daily ETo (Cai et al., 2007;\
    \ Cai et \n71 \nal., 2009), used to forecast daily ETo with a lead time of 1-3\
    \ days (Liu et al., 2020), and used to \n72 \nforecast daily ETo with a lead time\
    \ of 1-7 days (Yang et al., 2016). The results of these studies \n73 \nindicate\
    \ that the errors in daily ETo predicted with the variables transformed with information\
    \ from \n74 \npublic weather forecasts and the FAO 56 PM equation are mainly caused\
    \ by errors arising from the \n75 \nprocess of converting qualitative wind scale\
    \ and weather type information in public weather \n76 \nforecasts into wind speed\
    \ and sunshine hour information, respectively. \n77 \nThus, some studies have\
    \ included measured or precalculated variable data and public weather \n78 \n\
    forecast data as inputs for their models to predict daily ETo. An example of such\
    \ studies include \n79 \nusing temperature data from weather forecasts and actual\
    \ incident net solar radiation (Rs) values \n80 \noccurring in each advance period\
    \ and four artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms \n81 \n(generalized\
    \ feedforward (GFF), linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and \n\
    82 \nprobabilistic neural network (PNN)) to forecast ETo in Dallas, Texas, USA,\
    \ 1-15 days in advance \n83 \n(Traore et al., 2016). Additionally, temperature\
    \ data from public weather forecasts, measured \n84 \nsunshine hours, precalculated\
    \ weather type correction factors (Wt, only four weather type correction \n85\
    \ \nfactors, i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast and rainy, are defined) and a combined\
    \ model of bi-directional \n86 \nlong short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and ANN were\
    \ used to predict daily ETo 1-7 days ahead for \n87 \nthree stations in Ningxia,\
    \ China (Yin et al., 2020). However, since short-term daily ETo is mainly \n88\
    \ \ngoverned by weather conditions, introducing additional measured or precalculated\
    \ variable data as \n89 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ predict daily ETo may not be applicable for real-time irrigation decisions.\
    \ In addition, in \n90 \nthese studies, machine learning models were trained and\
    \ validated with long-term historical \n91 \nmeteorological data and tested with\
    \ public weather forecast data (with a maximum data duration of \n92 \n2 years).\
    \ Thus, the data sources in these studies were different (e.g., in China, the\
    \ source of historical \n93 \nmeteorological data is the National Meteorological\
    \ Information Center of China, while the source \n94 \nof public weather forecasts\
    \ is the Public Weather Service Center of the China Meteorological \n95 \nAdministration).\
    \ Moreover, there have been no comparison studies between training and validating\
    \ \n96 \nmachine learning models with historical meteorological data and public\
    \ weather forecast data. \n97 \nHowever, the use of samples from different data\
    \ sources may affect the daily ETo performance of \n98 \nmachine learning models.\
    \ \n99 \nIn recent years, three integrated learning models, extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), light \n100 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and gradient boosting\
    \ with categorical features support \n101 \n(CatBoost), based on a boosting algorithm\
    \ with a decision tree as the base learner and greedy ideas \n102 \nfor decision\
    \ tree growth, have been widely used to estimate daily ETo. Among them, CatBoost\
    \ can \n103 \ndirectly handle categorical data, such as public weather forecasts\
    \ of wind scale and weather type. \n104 \nFan et al. (2018) recommended using\
    \ the XGBoost and GBDT models with limited climate data to \n105 \npredict daily\
    \ ETo under different climatic conditions in China. Fan et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ \n106 \nLightGBM generally outperformed the other two soft computing models\
    \ and four empirical models \n107 \nin estimating daily ETo with data from 49\
    \ weather stations in humid subtropical China using local \n108 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and cross-station meteorological data. Zhou et al. (2020) strongly recommended\
    \ \n109 \nthe use of CatBoost and LightGBM models for estimating daily ETo under\
    \ different climatic \n110 \nconditions in China. Huang et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ the CatBoost algorithm has great potential for \n111 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    7 \n \ndaily ETo estimation in humid regions of China. Zhang et al. (2020) also\
    \ showed that CatBoost is \n112 \nconsidered the best choice for estimating ETo\
    \ in arid and semiarid regions of northern China. These \n113 \nstudies showed\
    \ that all three models estimated daily ETo with better accuracy and stability\
    \ than \n114 \nthose of other models. However, studies on the prediction of daily\
    \ ETo with these three models have \n115 \nnot been reported. The objectives of\
    \ this study are as follows: (1) to first develop four machine \n116 \nlearning\
    \ models using daily observed meteorological data and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a \n117 \n1-day lead time, respectively, and then to test and compare\
    \ the performance of the developed models \n118 \nin both cases using public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-7 day lead time; (2) to explore the use of \n119 \ncategorical\

    10 \n \nThe two main types of integrated learning algorithms are bagging-based\
    \ algorithms and \n166 \nboosting-based algorithms. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost\
    \ are improved implementations of \n167 \nthe GBDT algorithm and belong to the\
    \ boosting algorithm family. Among them, XGBoost was \n168 \nproposed by Chen\
    \ et al. (2016), and its official open source documentation is available at \n\
    169 \nhttp://xgboost.readthedocs.io. LightGBM was proposed by Ke et al. (2017),\
    \ and its official open \n170 \nsource documentation is available at http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io.\
    \ CatBoost was proposed by \n171 \nProkhorenkova et al. (2017), and its official\
    \ open source documentation is available at \n172 \nhttps://catboost.ai/en/docs/.\
    \ The base learners of all three algorithms are decision trees, but the tree \n\
    173 \nfeatures and the process of generation differ in many ways. For example,\
    \ XGBoost uses a levelwise \n174 \ndecision tree growth strategy, LightGBM uses\
    \ a leafwise decision tree growth strategy with depth \n175 \nrestrictions, and\
    \ CatBoost uses a fully symmetric decision tree as the base learner. \n176 \n\
    For categorical features, CatBoost only needs to declare the categorical signs\
    \ to enable direct \n177 \nfeature processing (Prokhorenkova et al. 2017; Dorogush\
    \ et al. 2018). LightGBM associates each \n178 \ncategorical feature fetch with\
    \ a bucket (bin) and thus automatically processes the features without \n179 \n\
    preprocessing using one-hot encoding. XGBoost cannot process the categorical features\
    \ directly. \n180 \nThis model is used after preprocessing the categorical features\
    \ by various encoding methods such \n181 \nas tag encoding, mean encoding, or\
    \ one-hot encoding. \n182 \nThe concept of deep learning was introduced by Hinton\
    \ et al. (2006). A multilayer perceptron \n183 \n(MLP) with multiple hidden layers\
    \ is a deep learning structure. MLP with one or two hidden layers \n184 \nhas\
    \ been successfully used for ETo estimation or prediction. Landeras et al. (2008)\
    \ used an artificial \n185 \nneural network (ANN) with 1 hidden layer to estimate\
    \ the daily ETo for Alava, Basque Country in \n186 \nnorthern Spain and obtained\
    \ better results than those from 10 locally calibrated empirical and \n187 \n\

    \ their variants. Ferreira et al. (2019) estimated daily ETo for all of \n188\
    \ \nBrazil using the first four days of data, and an ANN (model structure 16-50-50-1)\
    \ was the best \n189 \nchoice among temperature- and relative humidity-based models.\
    \ The ANN with two hidden layers \n190 \nused by Elbeltagi et al. (2022) is a\
    \ suitable alternative to estimate the daily ETo for the \n191 \nmeteorological\
    \ station in Debrecen, Hungary, based on limited meteorological data. Luo et al.\
    \ (2015) \n192 \nused an MLP with two hidden layers and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a 1-7 day lead time to \n193 \npredict the daily ETo for Gaoyou station\
    \ in Jiangsu Province, China, with acceptable prediction \n194 \nperformance.\
    \ Traore et al. (2016) showed that an MLP model with two hidden layers and a \n\
    195 \ncombination of Tmax, Tmin, and Rs inputs had the best ETo prediction performance\
    \ for Dallas, Texas, \n196 \nUSA. These studies used trial-and-error methods to\
    \ determine the numbers of hidden layers and \n197 \nneurons per hidden layer.\
    \ These methods are time-consuming and may not always yield the best \n198 \n\
    hyperparameters. In this study, an MLP with multiple hidden layers is compared\
    \ with three machine \n199 \nlearning models, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.\
    \ The MLP with multiple hidden layers is \n200 \nimplemented using Google's TensorFlow\
    \ deep learning framework. See Figure 2 for details. \n201 \n2.2.3. Input combinations\

    \ is \n206 \nobtained by combining with Equation (3) (Allen et al., 1998, Cai\

    \ \n271 \nkeras.api._v2.keras 2.8.0. The machine learning models were trained\
    \ and tested on an Intel(R) \n272 \nCore(TM) i7-10750H CPU with 2.60 GHz-5.0 GHz,\
    \ 16.0 GB RAM, and an NVIDIA Quadro® \n273 \nP620 graphics card on a graphics\

    \ analysis \n276 \nTo evaluate the performance of public weather forecast data\
    \ and the performance of nine \n277 \nmachine learning algorithms for predicting\
    \ ETo, four statistical indicators, the mean absolute error \n278 \n(MAE), root\
    \ mean square error (RMSE), the ratio of means(RM), and correlation coefficient\
    \ (R), \n279 \nwere selected. The MAE is the mean of the absolute error and reflects\
    \ the actual error between the \n280 \npredicted and observed values, the RMSE\
    \ measures the deviation between the predicted and \n281 \nobserved values, and\
    \ R reflects the degree of correlation between the predicted and observed values.\
    \ \n282 \nThe smaller the values of the MAE and RMSE are, the better, and the\
    \ closer to 1 the value of R is, \n283 \nthe better. The RM is expressed as the\
    \ ratio of the mean of the predicted value to the mean of the \n284 \nobserved\
    \ value. The RM value can be greater than or less than 1, reflecting the \n285\
    \ \noverestimation/underestimation of the predicted value to the observed value,\

    19 \n \nrespectively, and overestimated by 2.82% for SHZ (this is mainly due to\
    \ the poor forecasts of \n335 \nweather types at the XJ station, resulting in\
    \ an overestimation of 9.45% for this station). Finally, \n336 \nduring the model\

    \ 14.87% (SAR), and 3.86% (SHZ). \n339 \nThe SDun forecast performance decreased\

    \ of previous studies in China (Yang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b; Liu et\
    \ al., \n341 \n2020). The poor SDun prediction performance compared with that\
    \ of the temperature forecast may \n342 \nbe due to the large errors in the conversion\
    \ of weather types from public weather forecasts to SDun \n343 \n(Cai et al.,\

    \ respectively, and Wspd was overestimated by 81.56% (AR), 50.69% (SAR) \n347\
    \ \nand 89.01% (SHZ). During the model validation period (2019), the mean MAE,\
    \ RMSE, R and RM \n348 \nvalues of the 1-day ahead Wspd ranged from 2.77-2.84\
    \ m s-1, 3.51-3.75 m s-1, 0.13-0.15 and 1.65-\n349 \n2.39, respectively, and Wspd\
    \ was overestimated by 92.81% (AR), 65.38% (SAR) and 138.51% \n350 \n(SHZ). The\
    \ mean MAE, RMSE, R, and RM values of Wspd with a 1-7 day lead time ranged from\

    \ for the three climate zones \n352 \nduring the model testing period (2020-2021),\
    \ and Wspd was overestimated by 47.53% (AR), 17.82% \n353 \n(SAR), and 36.86%\
    \ (SHZ). It can be seen that the worst predictions among the four variables of\
    \ the \n354 \npublic weather forecasts were those for Wspd, which may be caused\
    \ by the poor forecasting of wind \n355 \nscale in the public weather forecast\

    \ Consistent with previous \n569 \nfindings (Yang et al., 2019a), the results\
    \ indicate that the inclusion of SDun in the input \n570 \ncombinations improves\
    \ the performance of machine learning models in predicting daily ETo (Perera \n\

    \ Therefore, SDun and Wspd should be included in the input combinations of machine\

    \ \n618 \nthe daily ETo prediction performance of the nine models for the three\
    \ climate zones, AR, SAR, and \n619 \nSHZ, decreased with increasing lead time,\
    \ which is due to the decrease in forecast performance of \n620 \npublic weather\
    \ forecasting variables with increasing lead time, which is consistent with previous\
    \ \n621 \nstudies (Perera et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014 and 2015; Traore et al.,\
    \ 2016; Yang et al., 2016, 2019a, \n622 \n2019b; Traore et al., 2017; Li et al.,\
    \ 2018; Yin et al., 2020). In addition, for all three climate zones, \n623 \n\
    the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day lead\
    \ time to predict \n624 \ndaily ETo 1-7 days ahead outperformed the four models\
    \ developed based on daily observed \n625 \nmeteorological data with corresponding\
    \ input combinations (except for the 1-day ahead prediction \n626 \nperformance\
    \ of MLPp, XGBoostp, and CatBoost1p for the SHZ climate zone). Second, the RM\
    \ \n627 \nvalues of the nine models for the AR climate zone varied in the range\
    \ of 0.92-1.07. Three models, \n628 \nMLPp, XGBoostp and LightGBMo, slightly overestimated\
    \ (2.90%-6.58%) the daily ETo, while \n629 \nLightGBMp, CatBoost1p, CatBoost2,\

    \ the daily ETo. \n636 \nTable 17 shows the 1-7 day ahead ETo prediction performance\
    \ comparison utilizing the best \n637 \ninput combinations in the testing period\

    \ data and the five models developed based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-\n639 \nday lead time for the three climate zones. Overall, for all three\
    \ climate zones, the four models \n640 \ndeveloped based on 1-day ahead public\
    \ weather forecast data generally outperformed the four \n641 \nmodels developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data with corresponding input \n642 \n\
    combinations for all metrics. In addition, the prediction performance of all models\
    \ exhibited a \n643 \ndecrease in the following order for the three climate zones:\
    \ AR, SHZ, and SAR. This result is mainly \n644 \nbecause the prediction performance\
    \ of models developed based on public weather forecasts for the \n645 \nAR climate\
    \ zone is better than that for the SAR and SHZ climate zones. For the AR climate\

    \ five models developed based on public weather forecast \n684 \ndata with a 1-day\
    \ lead time to predict daily ETo \n685 \nIrrigated areas in the studied sites\
    \ have different field irrigation seasons according to crop type \n686 \nand location\
    \ (Perera et al., 2014). In addition, the sensitivity of weather variables varies\
    \ with season \n687 \nand the microclimate of the studied site location (Vanella\
    \ et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a strong \n688 \nneed to evaluate the seasonality\
    \ of the ETo forecast performance. Tables 18-20 show the mean \n689 \nstatistics\
    \ of the performance indicators for the 1-7 day lead time ETo forecasts using\
    \ the five models \n690 \ndeveloped based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-day lead time for the three climatic zones \n691 \nfor all seasons of 2020-2021.\
    \ First, during all four seasons, the daily ETo prediction performance of \n692\
    \ \nall five models was better in the AR climate zone than in the SAR and SHZ\
    \ climate zones (excluding \n693 \nCatBoost2 in the spring and MLP in the fall\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, and all five models in the \n694 \nwinter in the SHZ\
    \ climate zone). This is mainly because the prediction performance of models using\
    \ \n695 \nthe public weather forecast variables in the AR climate zone outperform\
    \ those in the SAR and SHZ \n696 \nclimate zones overall. \n697 \nSecond, the\
    \ order of the seasonal MAE and RMSE values for daily ETo prediction using the\
    \ five \n698 \nmodels in the AR climate zone are as follows: winter, spring, fall,\
    \ and summer. In addition, the \n699 \nseasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ are lower than the annual average, except for the \n700 \nMLPp and LightGBMp\
    \ models for station TX in the SAR climate zone and the MLPp and XGBoost \n701\
    \ \nmodels for station XJ in the SHZ climate zone. The order of the seasonal MAE\
    \ and RMSE values \n702 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ the other three models in the SAR and SHZ climate zones are as follows: winter,\
    \ fall, spring, \n703 \nand summer. The seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ and fall in the SAR climate zone \n704 \nare lower than the annual average,\
    \ and the seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter in the \n705 \nSHZ climate\
    \ zone are lower than the annual average. These results are consistent with results\
    \ in \n706 \nprevious studies (Perera et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Fan et\
    \ al., 2021b). The seasonal R values of \n707 \nETo for all model prediction days\
    \ in all three climate zones were lower than the annual average, \n708 \nwith\
    \ the smallest R values observed during summer. The maximum seasonal R values\
    \ in the AR \n709 \nclimate zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp, LightGBMp, and\
    \ CatBoost1p) and fall (MLPp and \n710 \nCatBoost2), those in the SAR climate\
    \ zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp and LightGBMp) and fall \n711 \n(MLPp, CatBoost1p,\
    \ and CatBoost2), and those for the SHZ climate zone occurred in spring \n712\
    \ \n(XGBoostp) and fall (MLPp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2). The seasonal\
    \ RM values \n713 \nof daily ETo prediction using the five machine learning models\
    \ in the three climate zones were less \n714 \nthan 1 in spring and summer and\
    \ greater than 1 in fall and winter, indicating that daily ETo was \n715 \nunderestimated\
    \ in spring and summer (except for XGBoostp in summer in the AR climate zone,\
    \ \n716 \nwhich was overestimated by 2.93%) and overestimated in fall and winter\
    \ (except for CatBoost1p in \n717 \nwinter in the SHZ climate zone and CatBoost2,\
    \ which were underestimated by 7.75% and 2.05%, \n718 \nrespectively). \n719 \n\
    Finally, when considering all the metrics, for the AR climate zone, XGBoostp,\
    \ MLPp, CatBoost2, \n720 \nand LightGBMp showed the best performance in predicting\
    \ 1-7 day ahead seasonal ET values \n721 \nduring spring, summer, fall, and winter,\
    \ respectively, with MLPp (spring), XGBoostp (summer), \n722 \nLightGBMp (fall),\
    \ and CatBoost2 (winter) being the second best performers. For the SAR climate\

    \ \n751 \nFor all three climate zones, the performance of the four models developed\
    \ based on public \n752 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day lead time was better\
    \ than the performance of the four models \n753 \ndeveloped based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data. To reliably and accurately analyse the \n754 \nweather\
    \ forecast variables that cause daily ETo forecast errors, the models developed\
    \ based on daily \n755 \nobserved meteorological data were chosen to evaluate\
    \ the impact of weather variables from public \n756 \nweather forecasts on the\
    \ daily ETo forecasting performance. In this study, each of the four observed\
    \ \n757 \nweather variables (Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd) was replaced in sequence\
    \ with their corresponding \n758 \nforecast values with a 1-7 day lead time. This\
    \ allowed for the identification of cases where a large \n759 \nchange in the\
    \ forecasted daily ETo indicates an error in the prediction resulting from the\

    \ the contribution of the public weather forecast variables to the error in the\
    \ predicted \n771 \ndaily ETo decreased in the order of Wspd, SDun, Tmax, and\
    \ Tmin for the AR (arid zone) climate zone,  \n772 \nwhich is consistent with\
    \ previous findings (Yang et al. 2016). Second, for all models (except the \n\
    773 \nMLP model at station YAC, the CatBoost1 model at station TX, the MLP model\
    \ at station XJ, the \n774 \nXGBoost model, and the LightGBM model), the contributions\
    \ of the public weather forecast \n775 \nvariables to the errors in the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, Wspd, Tmax, and \n776 \nTmin and SDun,\
    \ Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin for the SAR (semiarid) and SHZ (semihumid zone) climate\

    \ \n779 \nThese results indicate that for the study sites in the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the main source \n780 \nof error in daily ETo prediction is Wspd\

    \ the weather type of public weather forecasts contributes the most to the predicted\
    \ \n783 \ndaily ETo errors. First, the spatial variability of Wspd and DSun (Rs)\
    \ due to the topography, elevation, \n784 \ndistance, and cloudiness of the location\
    \ of the study site (Yuan et al., 2015; Fick and Hijmasn, 2017; \n785 \nLi and\
    \ Zha, 2018; Fan et al., 2021b) makes Wspd and DSun (Rs) the most difficult parameters\
    \ to \n786 \nforecast accurately (Yang et al., 2016, Ballesteros et al., 2016);\
    \ second, according to Cai et al. (2007), \n787 \nit is appropriate to estimate\
    \ Wspd from wind scale predicted by public weather forecasts, but this \n788 \n\
    estimation error is larger for arid regions with a high range of wind speed values.\
    \ George et al. (1985) \n789 \nreported that the largest difference between predicted\
    \ and measured reference crop \n790 \nevapotranspiration came from erroneous predictions\
    \ of mean wind speed. Li and Beswick (2005) \n791 \nalso reported that wind speed\
    \ is a more serious source of error than solar radiation in estimating ETo. \n\
    792 \nIn a study by Popova et al. (2005), it was noted that the effect of wind\
    \ speed on ETo results was \n793 \nrelatively small except in arid and windy areas.\
    \ \n794 \nAs shown in Table 3, SDun was estimated using the sunshine hour coefficients\
    \ derived from the \n795 \n2004 measured solar radiation data from Daxing District,\
    \ Beijing, using Equation (3). It was found \n796 \nthat applying the sunshine\
    \ hour coefficients derived from one region to other regions with different \n\
    797 \nclimate types will result in different degrees of error due to the climatic\
    \ differences between regions. \n798 \nPerera et al. (2014) found that the largest\
    \ source of error between predicted and observed ETo is the \n799 \npredictive\
    \ performance of daily incoming solar radiation, followed by air temperature,\
    \ dew point \n800 \ntemperature, and wind speed for all advanced periods. Pelosi\
    \ et al. (2016) indicated that the solar \n801 \nradiation forecast error has\
    \ the greatest impact on the ETo forecast performance, followed by relative \n\
    802 \nhumidity and wind speed. The results of Medina et al. (2018) also indicated\
    \ that the errors in solar \n803 \nradiation forecasts have the greatest impact\
    \ on ETo forecasts, followed by errors in wind forecasts. \n804 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    52 \n \nIn this study, public weather forecasts with a 1-7 day lead time were\
    \ used to compare the \n829 \nperformance of five models developed based on public\
    \ weather forecast data with a 1-day lead time \n830 \nand four models developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data in predicting daily ETo at \n831\
    \ \nnine stations in three climatic regions of Ningxia, China. The forecast performance\
    \ of weather \n832 \nvariables in public weather forecasting (2014-2021) and daily\
    \ ETo predicted by these nine models \n833 \nwere analysed and evaluated on a\
    \ daily scale, and the forecast performance of the weather variables \n834 \n\
    in the public weather forecast (2020-2021) and daily ETo predicted by the five\
    \ models developed \n835 \nbased on the public weather forecast with a 1-day lead\
    \ time were analysed and evaluated in terms \n836 \nof seasonality. The optimal\
    \ input combination for each machine learning model was determined, \n837 \nand\
    \ the weather forecast variables contributing to the error in the model predicted\
    \ daily ETo were \n838 \nidentified. The main conclusions of this study are as\
    \ follows: \n839 \nFirst, for the three climate zones, the performance of the\
    \ four models developed based on public \n840 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ lead time was better than that of the four models developed based \n841 \non\
    \ daily observation meteorological data with corresponding input combinations.\
    \ When category \n842 \ndata such as wind scale (WS) and weather type (WT1 and\
    \ WT2) were added directly to the input \n843 \ncombinations of the CatBoost2\
    \ model, the performance of this model in predicting daily ETo was \n844 \nlower\
    \ than that of the CatBoost1p model in the testing period; that is, the performance\
    \ of the \n845 \nCatBoost2 model in terms of predicting daily ETo did not improve\
    \ during the testing period. \n846 \nSecond, the performance of the five models,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p and \n847 \nCatBoost2, in terms of daily\
    \ ETo prediction, was highest in winter and the lowest in summer for all \n848\
    \ \nthree climate zones. In terms of predicting daily ETo with a 1-7 day lead\
    \ time in all seasons, \n849 \nXGBoostp with C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input,\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input and LightGBMp \n850 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    53 \n \nwith C1 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ fall and winter in the AR \n851 \nclimate zone, respectively. LightGBMp with\
    \ C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n852 \nC3 as input and\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ \n853 \nfall and winter in the SAR climate zone, respectively. XGBoostp with\
    \ C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n854 \nC3 as input and LightGBMp with C1 as input\
    \ are recommended as the best models for spring and \n855 \nsummer, fall and winter\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, respectively. \n856 \nFinally, for the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the contribution of the weather variables in the \n857 \npublic\
    \ weather forecast to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order\
    \ of Wspd, SDun, \n858 \nTmax, and Tmin; for the SAR climate zone (semiarid zone),\
    \ the contribution of the weather variables \n859 \nin the public weather forecast\
    \ to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, \n860\
    \ \nWspd, Tmax, and Tmin; and for the SHZ climate zone (semihumid zone), the contribution\
    \ of the \n861 \nweather variables in the public weather forecast to the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of \n862 \nSDun, Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin. \n863\
    \ \nIn addition, in terms of the daily scale performance of weather variables\
    \ in public weather \n864 \nforecasts, the forecast performance follows a decreasing\
    \ order of Tmin>Tmax>SDun>Wspd. In the \n865 \nseasonal analysis (2020-2021) of\
    \ the weather variable forecast performance for three climate zones, \n866 \n\
    the average performance for Tmax is in the order of summer (fall) > fall (summer)\
    \ > winter > spring. \n867 \nFor Tmin, the order is fall (summer) > summer (fall)\
    \ > winter (spring) > spring (winter), and for \n868 \nSDun, the order is winter\
    \ > spring > fall > summer. Thus, the average performance of the forecasts \n\
    869 \ndecreases sequentially. \n870 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    2 \n \nAbstract: Real-time accurate prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) is critical for \n1 \nreal-time irrigation decisions and water resource\
    \ management. Although many public weather \n2 \nforecast-based machine learning\
    \ models have been successfully used for daily ETo prediction, these \n3 \nmodels\
    \ are developed with long-term historical daily observed meteorological data.\
    \ The use of \n4 \ntraining and testing samples from different data sources can\
    \ lead to the selection of the best model, \n5 \nand the performance of the best\
    \ model for predicting daily ETo is not ideal. In this study, based on \n6 \n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equations, four\
    \ machine \n7 \nlearning models (multilayer perceptron (MLPo), extreme gradient\
    \ boosting (XGBoosto), light \n8 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBMo), and\
    \ gradient boosting with categorical features support \n9 \n(CatBoost1o)) were\
    \ trained and validated with daily observed meteorological data from 1995-2015\
    \ \n10 \nand 2016-2019, respectively, and five machine learning models (MLPp,\
    \ XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n11 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) were trained and validated\
    \ with daily public weather forecast data with \n12 \na 1-day lead time (2014-2018\
    \ and 2019, respectively). Based on public weather forecast and daily \n13 \n\
    observed meteorological data (2020-2021), the predicted daily ETo performance\
    \ of nine machine \n14 \nlearning models (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n15 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) was compared. The\
    \ results show that for all three studied climate zones, \n16 \nthe performance\
    \ of the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ \n17 \nadvance is better than that of the four models developed based on daily\
    \ observed meteorological \n18 \ndata with corresponding input combinations, and\
    \ the mean MAE and RMSE ranges for the four \n19 \nmodels (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,\
    \ and CatBoost1) in the three studied climate zones were \n20 \nreduced by 2.93%-11.67%\
    \ and 2.20%-9.46%, respectively, and the mean R range was improved by \n21 \n\
    1.31%-5.31%. The top three models for the AR climate zone were XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n22 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion started:\

    \ models for the SAR climate zone were MLPp, XGBoostp, and LightGBMp, and \n23\
    \ \nthe top three models for the SHZ climate zone were XGBoostp, MLPp, and LightGBMp.\
    \ In addition, \n24 \nthe prediction performance for daily ETo is found to be\
    \ highest in winter and lowest in summer in \n25 \nall three climate zones. Wspd\
    \ from public weather forecasts was the most important source of daily \n26 \n\
    ETo error in model predictions for the AR climate zone, followed by SDun, Tmax,\
    \ and Tmin, while \n27 \nSDun from public weather forecasts was the most important\
    \ source of daily ETo error in model \n28 \npredictions for the SAR (SHZ) climate\
    \ zone, followed by Wspd, Tmax, and Tmin (Tmax, Wspd, and \n29 \nTmin). \n30 \n\

    \ Tree-based \n32 \nassembly algorithms, Irrigation season \n33 \n \n34 \n1. Introduction\
    \ \n35 \nCrop water demand is the most important part of water transfer and energy\
    \ conversion in the \n36 \nsoil‒plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC), and it is an\
    \ important process in the field water cycle. \n37 \nAccurately estimating crop\
    \ water demand is the basis for designing crop irrigation systems, \n38 \ndetermining\
    \ regional irrigation water use, and facilitating effective basin planning, regional\
    \ water \n39 \nplanning, and drainage and irrigation project planning, design,\
    \ and management. However, directly \n40 \nmeasuring crop water demand is time-consuming\
    \ and expensive, significantly limiting practical \n41 \napplications (Irmak et\
    \ al., 2003; Martınez-Cob et al., 2015; Silva et al. 2019a; Fan et al., 2021a).\
    \ \n42 \nThus, crop water demand is usually measured using an indirect method,\
    \ i.e., reference \n43 \nevapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by the crop coefficient.\
    \ Predicting ETo is more valuable than \n44 \nestimating ETo (Yang et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang et al., 2019a), and accurate ETo prediction is the key to crop \n45 \n\

    \ prerequisite for real-time irrigation forecasting, which has \n46 \nimportant\
    \ reference value and significance for real-time irrigation decisions (Luo et\
    \ al., 2014; Perera \n47 \net al. 2014; Ballesteros et al., 2016). \n48 \nDepending\
    \ on the method and input data, ETo prediction methods can be divided into direct\
    \ and \n49 \nindirect methods (Perera et al., 2014). Since daily ETo data mainly\
    \ vary with weather and are only \n50 \ninfluenced by future weather variables,\
    \ direct methods that use long-term historical weather data to \n51 \npredict\
    \ ETo are not applicable to short-term daily ETo prediction. For indirect ETo\
    \ prediction \n52 \nmethods that use weather forecast data, numerical weather\
    \ forecasts that provide all the variables of \n53 \nthe Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization 56 Penman–Monteith (FAO 56 PM) equation have been used \n54 \n\
    in predicting daily ETo (Silva et al., 2010; Pelosi et al., 2016), and used in\
    \ predicting daily ETo with \n55 \na 1-10 day lead time (Perera et al. 2014; Medina\
    \ et al., 2018; Vanella et al., 2020). However, \n56 \nnumerical forecast products\
    \ in China are only available to professionals (e.g., registered users in \n57\
    \ \nacademia and research) and are not accessible to nonprofessionals. In addition,\
    \ these products \n58 \nrequire preprocessing (Fan et al., 2021b) or postprocessing\
    \ (Medina et al., 2020) by professionals \n59 \nto improve the reliability of\
    \ the output data. \n60 \nIn China, the China Weather Network, hosted by the Public\
    \ Meteorological Service Center of \n61 \nthe China Meteorological Administration,\
    \ is a public service-based meteorological portal for society \n62 \nand the public.\
    \ The China Weather Network covers more than 100,000 sites in provinces, cities,\
    \ \n63 \ntowns, and tourist attractions across the country and provides real-time\
    \ meteorological services, \n64 \nincluding weather forecasts, current conditions,\
    \ indices, air quality information, and many other \n65 \nelements, with a minimum\
    \ time resolution of 5 minutes and a maximum forecast time of 40 days. It \n66\
    \ \nalso provides user location-based forecasting services on mobile sites. Public\
    \ weather forecasts \n67 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ four variables: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind scale and weather\
    \ type. \n68 \nIn recent years, public weather forecasts have been widely used\
    \ in ETo forecasting. For example, \n69 \ninformation from public weather forecasts\
    \ has been converted into variables required to calculate \n70 \nETo using the\
    \ FAO-56 PM equation, and then used to forecast in daily ETo (Cai et al., 2007;\
    \ Cai et \n71 \nal., 2009), used to forecast daily ETo with a lead time of 1-3\
    \ days (Liu et al., 2020), and used to \n72 \nforecast daily ETo with a lead time\
    \ of 1-7 days (Yang et al., 2016). The results of these studies \n73 \nindicate\
    \ that the errors in daily ETo predicted with the variables transformed with information\
    \ from \n74 \npublic weather forecasts and the FAO 56 PM equation are mainly caused\
    \ by errors arising from the \n75 \nprocess of converting qualitative wind scale\
    \ and weather type information in public weather \n76 \nforecasts into wind speed\
    \ and sunshine hour information, respectively. \n77 \nThus, some studies have\
    \ included measured or precalculated variable data and public weather \n78 \n\
    forecast data as inputs for their models to predict daily ETo. An example of such\
    \ studies include \n79 \nusing temperature data from weather forecasts and actual\
    \ incident net solar radiation (Rs) values \n80 \noccurring in each advance period\
    \ and four artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms \n81 \n(generalized\
    \ feedforward (GFF), linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and \n\
    82 \nprobabilistic neural network (PNN)) to forecast ETo in Dallas, Texas, USA,\
    \ 1-15 days in advance \n83 \n(Traore et al., 2016). Additionally, temperature\
    \ data from public weather forecasts, measured \n84 \nsunshine hours, precalculated\
    \ weather type correction factors (Wt, only four weather type correction \n85\
    \ \nfactors, i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast and rainy, are defined) and a combined\
    \ model of bi-directional \n86 \nlong short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and ANN were\
    \ used to predict daily ETo 1-7 days ahead for \n87 \nthree stations in Ningxia,\
    \ China (Yin et al., 2020). However, since short-term daily ETo is mainly \n88\
    \ \ngoverned by weather conditions, introducing additional measured or precalculated\
    \ variable data as \n89 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ predict daily ETo may not be applicable for real-time irrigation decisions.\
    \ In addition, in \n90 \nthese studies, machine learning models were trained and\
    \ validated with long-term historical \n91 \nmeteorological data and tested with\
    \ public weather forecast data (with a maximum data duration of \n92 \n2 years).\
    \ Thus, the data sources in these studies were different (e.g., in China, the\
    \ source of historical \n93 \nmeteorological data is the National Meteorological\
    \ Information Center of China, while the source \n94 \nof public weather forecasts\
    \ is the Public Weather Service Center of the China Meteorological \n95 \nAdministration).\
    \ Moreover, there have been no comparison studies between training and validating\
    \ \n96 \nmachine learning models with historical meteorological data and public\
    \ weather forecast data. \n97 \nHowever, the use of samples from different data\
    \ sources may affect the daily ETo performance of \n98 \nmachine learning models.\
    \ \n99 \nIn recent years, three integrated learning models, extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), light \n100 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and gradient boosting\
    \ with categorical features support \n101 \n(CatBoost), based on a boosting algorithm\
    \ with a decision tree as the base learner and greedy ideas \n102 \nfor decision\
    \ tree growth, have been widely used to estimate daily ETo. Among them, CatBoost\
    \ can \n103 \ndirectly handle categorical data, such as public weather forecasts\
    \ of wind scale and weather type. \n104 \nFan et al. (2018) recommended using\
    \ the XGBoost and GBDT models with limited climate data to \n105 \npredict daily\
    \ ETo under different climatic conditions in China. Fan et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ \n106 \nLightGBM generally outperformed the other two soft computing models\
    \ and four empirical models \n107 \nin estimating daily ETo with data from 49\
    \ weather stations in humid subtropical China using local \n108 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and cross-station meteorological data. Zhou et al. (2020) strongly recommended\
    \ \n109 \nthe use of CatBoost and LightGBM models for estimating daily ETo under\
    \ different climatic \n110 \nconditions in China. Huang et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ the CatBoost algorithm has great potential for \n111 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    7 \n \ndaily ETo estimation in humid regions of China. Zhang et al. (2020) also\
    \ showed that CatBoost is \n112 \nconsidered the best choice for estimating ETo\
    \ in arid and semiarid regions of northern China. These \n113 \nstudies showed\
    \ that all three models estimated daily ETo with better accuracy and stability\
    \ than \n114 \nthose of other models. However, studies on the prediction of daily\
    \ ETo with these three models have \n115 \nnot been reported. The objectives of\
    \ this study are as follows: (1) to first develop four machine \n116 \nlearning\
    \ models using daily observed meteorological data and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a \n117 \n1-day lead time, respectively, and then to test and compare\
    \ the performance of the developed models \n118 \nin both cases using public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-7 day lead time; (2) to explore the use of \n119 \ncategorical\
    \ data (public weather forecasts of wind scale and weather type) as direct input\
    \ into \n120 \nCatBoost for daily ETo prediction; and (3) to compare the seasonal\
    \ variation in predicted daily ETo \n121 \nperformance of the five machine learning\
    \ models and recommend the best daily ETo prediction \n122 \nmodel for all four\
    \ seasons at nine stations in three different climates. \n123 \n2. Materials and\

    10 \n \nThe two main types of integrated learning algorithms are bagging-based\
    \ algorithms and \n166 \nboosting-based algorithms. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost\
    \ are improved implementations of \n167 \nthe GBDT algorithm and belong to the\
    \ boosting algorithm family. Among them, XGBoost was \n168 \nproposed by Chen\
    \ et al. (2016), and its official open source documentation is available at \n\
    169 \nhttp://xgboost.readthedocs.io. LightGBM was proposed by Ke et al. (2017),\
    \ and its official open \n170 \nsource documentation is available at http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io.\
    \ CatBoost was proposed by \n171 \nProkhorenkova et al. (2017), and its official\
    \ open source documentation is available at \n172 \nhttps://catboost.ai/en/docs/.\
    \ The base learners of all three algorithms are decision trees, but the tree \n\
    173 \nfeatures and the process of generation differ in many ways. For example,\
    \ XGBoost uses a levelwise \n174 \ndecision tree growth strategy, LightGBM uses\
    \ a leafwise decision tree growth strategy with depth \n175 \nrestrictions, and\
    \ CatBoost uses a fully symmetric decision tree as the base learner. \n176 \n\
    For categorical features, CatBoost only needs to declare the categorical signs\
    \ to enable direct \n177 \nfeature processing (Prokhorenkova et al. 2017; Dorogush\
    \ et al. 2018). LightGBM associates each \n178 \ncategorical feature fetch with\
    \ a bucket (bin) and thus automatically processes the features without \n179 \n\
    preprocessing using one-hot encoding. XGBoost cannot process the categorical features\
    \ directly. \n180 \nThis model is used after preprocessing the categorical features\
    \ by various encoding methods such \n181 \nas tag encoding, mean encoding, or\
    \ one-hot encoding. \n182 \nThe concept of deep learning was introduced by Hinton\
    \ et al. (2006). A multilayer perceptron \n183 \n(MLP) with multiple hidden layers\
    \ is a deep learning structure. MLP with one or two hidden layers \n184 \nhas\
    \ been successfully used for ETo estimation or prediction. Landeras et al. (2008)\
    \ used an artificial \n185 \nneural network (ANN) with 1 hidden layer to estimate\
    \ the daily ETo for Alava, Basque Country in \n186 \nnorthern Spain and obtained\
    \ better results than those from 10 locally calibrated empirical and \n187 \n\

    \ their variants. Ferreira et al. (2019) estimated daily ETo for all of \n188\
    \ \nBrazil using the first four days of data, and an ANN (model structure 16-50-50-1)\
    \ was the best \n189 \nchoice among temperature- and relative humidity-based models.\
    \ The ANN with two hidden layers \n190 \nused by Elbeltagi et al. (2022) is a\
    \ suitable alternative to estimate the daily ETo for the \n191 \nmeteorological\
    \ station in Debrecen, Hungary, based on limited meteorological data. Luo et al.\
    \ (2015) \n192 \nused an MLP with two hidden layers and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a 1-7 day lead time to \n193 \npredict the daily ETo for Gaoyou station\
    \ in Jiangsu Province, China, with acceptable prediction \n194 \nperformance.\
    \ Traore et al. (2016) showed that an MLP model with two hidden layers and a \n\
    195 \ncombination of Tmax, Tmin, and Rs inputs had the best ETo prediction performance\
    \ for Dallas, Texas, \n196 \nUSA. These studies used trial-and-error methods to\
    \ determine the numbers of hidden layers and \n197 \nneurons per hidden layer.\
    \ These methods are time-consuming and may not always yield the best \n198 \n\
    hyperparameters. In this study, an MLP with multiple hidden layers is compared\
    \ with three machine \n199 \nlearning models, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.\
    \ The MLP with multiple hidden layers is \n200 \nimplemented using Google's TensorFlow\
    \ deep learning framework. See Figure 2 for details. \n201 \n2.2.3. Input combinations\

    \ Tmax forecasts. The forecast performance of Tmin and Tmax decreased with increasing\

    \ previous studies in China (Luo \n324 \net al., 2014 and 2015; Xiong et al.,\

    19 \n \nrespectively, and overestimated by 2.82% for SHZ (this is mainly due to\
    \ the poor forecasts of \n335 \nweather types at the XJ station, resulting in\
    \ an overestimation of 9.45% for this station). Finally, \n336 \nduring the model\
    \ testing period (2020-2021), the mean MAE, RMSE, R, and RM values for the 1-\n\
    337 \n7 day lead time predictions ranged from 3.36-3.79 h, 4.13-4.62 h, 0.13-0.17,\

    \ 14.87% (SAR), and 3.86% (SHZ). \n339 \nThe SDun forecast performance decreased\
    \ with increasing forecasting period. This result is \n340 \nconsistent with results\
    \ of previous studies in China (Yang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b; Liu et\
    \ al., \n341 \n2020). The poor SDun prediction performance compared with that\
    \ of the temperature forecast may \n342 \nbe due to the large errors in the conversion\
    \ of weather types from public weather forecasts to SDun \n343 \n(Cai et al.,\
    \ 2007; Yang et al., 2016; Traore et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b; Liu et al.\

    \ RM values of the 1-day ahead Wspd \n345 \nduring the model training period (2014-2018)\

    \ respectively, and Wspd was overestimated by 81.56% (AR), 50.69% (SAR) \n347\
    \ \nand 89.01% (SHZ). During the model validation period (2019), the mean MAE,\
    \ RMSE, R and RM \n348 \nvalues of the 1-day ahead Wspd ranged from 2.77-2.84\
    \ m s-1, 3.51-3.75 m s-1, 0.13-0.15 and 1.65-\n349 \n2.39, respectively, and Wspd\
    \ was overestimated by 92.81% (AR), 65.38% (SAR) and 138.51% \n350 \n(SHZ). The\
    \ mean MAE, RMSE, R, and RM values of Wspd with a 1-7 day lead time ranged from\
    \ \n351 \n1.28-1.41 m s-1, 2.02-2.10 m s-1, 0.03-0.06, and 1.18-1.48, respectively,\
    \ for the three climate zones \n352 \nduring the model testing period (2020-2021),\
    \ and Wspd was overestimated by 47.53% (AR), 17.82% \n353 \n(SAR), and 36.86%\
    \ (SHZ). It can be seen that the worst predictions among the four variables of\
    \ the \n354 \npublic weather forecasts were those for Wspd, which may be caused\
    \ by the poor forecasting of wind \n355 \nscale in the public weather forecast\
    \ and the error in converting wind scale to wind speed (Cai et al., \n356 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    \ and \n568 \nCatBoost1p) were either C1 (20.83%), C2 (29.17%), or C4 (41.67%).\
    \ Consistent with previous \n569 \nfindings (Yang et al., 2019a), the results\
    \ indicate that the inclusion of SDun in the input \n570 \ncombinations improves\
    \ the performance of machine learning models in predicting daily ETo (Perera \n\
    571 \net al., 2014; Traore et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b;\

    \ Therefore, SDun and Wspd should be included in the input combinations of machine\

    615 \nThe performance metrics of four models developed based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data \n616 \nand five models developed based on public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-day lead time to predict \n617 \ndaily ETo with a 1-7\
    \ day lead time for the three climate zones are shown in Figures 4 and 5. First,\
    \ \n618 \nthe daily ETo prediction performance of the nine models for the three\
    \ climate zones, AR, SAR, and \n619 \nSHZ, decreased with increasing lead time,\
    \ which is due to the decrease in forecast performance of \n620 \npublic weather\
    \ forecasting variables with increasing lead time, which is consistent with previous\
    \ \n621 \nstudies (Perera et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014 and 2015; Traore et al.,\
    \ 2016; Yang et al., 2016, 2019a, \n622 \n2019b; Traore et al., 2017; Li et al.,\
    \ 2018; Yin et al., 2020). In addition, for all three climate zones, \n623 \n\
    the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day lead\
    \ time to predict \n624 \ndaily ETo 1-7 days ahead outperformed the four models\
    \ developed based on daily observed \n625 \nmeteorological data with corresponding\
    \ input combinations (except for the 1-day ahead prediction \n626 \nperformance\
    \ of MLPp, XGBoostp, and CatBoost1p for the SHZ climate zone). Second, the RM\
    \ \n627 \nvalues of the nine models for the AR climate zone varied in the range\
    \ of 0.92-1.07. Three models, \n628 \nMLPp, XGBoostp and LightGBMo, slightly overestimated\
    \ (2.90%-6.58%) the daily ETo, while \n629 \nLightGBMp, CatBoost1p, CatBoost2,\
    \ MLPo, XGBoosto and CatBoost1o slightly underestimated \n630 \n(2.69%-7.71%)\
    \ the daily ETo. The RM values for the nine models varied in the range of 0.90-1.00\

    \ zone, and all models slightly underestimated (0.18%-9.56%) the daily ETo \n\
    632 \n(except LightGBMp, which slightly overestimated (0.12%) the daily ETo 6-days\
    \ ahead, and MLPo, \n633 \nwhich slightly overestimated (0.02%) the daily ETo\
    \ 7-days ahead. The RM values for the 9 models \n634 \nvaried in the range of\
    \ 0.90-1.02 for the SHZ climate zone. MLPp slightly overestimated (0.13%-\n635\
    \ \n1.64%) the daily ETo, and all other models slightly underestimated (0.02%-9.94%)\
    \ the daily ETo. \n636 \nTable 17 shows the 1-7 day ahead ETo prediction performance\
    \ comparison utilizing the best \n637 \ninput combinations in the testing period\
    \ for the four models developed based on daily observed \n638 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and the five models developed based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-\n639 \nday lead time for the three climate zones. Overall, for all three\
    \ climate zones, the four models \n640 \ndeveloped based on 1-day ahead public\
    \ weather forecast data generally outperformed the four \n641 \nmodels developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data with corresponding input \n642 \n\
    combinations for all metrics. In addition, the prediction performance of all models\
    \ exhibited a \n643 \ndecrease in the following order for the three climate zones:\
    \ AR, SHZ, and SAR. This result is mainly \n644 \nbecause the prediction performance\
    \ of models developed based on public weather forecasts for the \n645 \nAR climate\
    \ zone is better than that for the SAR and SHZ climate zones. For the AR climate\
    \ zone, \n646 \nthe mean MAE and RMSE ranges of the four models (MLP, XGBoost,\

    \ five models developed based on public weather forecast \n684 \ndata with a 1-day\
    \ lead time to predict daily ETo \n685 \nIrrigated areas in the studied sites\
    \ have different field irrigation seasons according to crop type \n686 \nand location\
    \ (Perera et al., 2014). In addition, the sensitivity of weather variables varies\
    \ with season \n687 \nand the microclimate of the studied site location (Vanella\
    \ et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a strong \n688 \nneed to evaluate the seasonality\
    \ of the ETo forecast performance. Tables 18-20 show the mean \n689 \nstatistics\
    \ of the performance indicators for the 1-7 day lead time ETo forecasts using\
    \ the five models \n690 \ndeveloped based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-day lead time for the three climatic zones \n691 \nfor all seasons of 2020-2021.\
    \ First, during all four seasons, the daily ETo prediction performance of \n692\
    \ \nall five models was better in the AR climate zone than in the SAR and SHZ\
    \ climate zones (excluding \n693 \nCatBoost2 in the spring and MLP in the fall\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, and all five models in the \n694 \nwinter in the SHZ\
    \ climate zone). This is mainly because the prediction performance of models using\
    \ \n695 \nthe public weather forecast variables in the AR climate zone outperform\
    \ those in the SAR and SHZ \n696 \nclimate zones overall. \n697 \nSecond, the\
    \ order of the seasonal MAE and RMSE values for daily ETo prediction using the\
    \ five \n698 \nmodels in the AR climate zone are as follows: winter, spring, fall,\
    \ and summer. In addition, the \n699 \nseasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ are lower than the annual average, except for the \n700 \nMLPp and LightGBMp\
    \ models for station TX in the SAR climate zone and the MLPp and XGBoost \n701\
    \ \nmodels for station XJ in the SHZ climate zone. The order of the seasonal MAE\
    \ and RMSE values \n702 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ the other three models in the SAR and SHZ climate zones are as follows: winter,\
    \ fall, spring, \n703 \nand summer. The seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ and fall in the SAR climate zone \n704 \nare lower than the annual average,\
    \ and the seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter in the \n705 \nSHZ climate\
    \ zone are lower than the annual average. These results are consistent with results\
    \ in \n706 \nprevious studies (Perera et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Fan et\
    \ al., 2021b). The seasonal R values of \n707 \nETo for all model prediction days\
    \ in all three climate zones were lower than the annual average, \n708 \nwith\
    \ the smallest R values observed during summer. The maximum seasonal R values\
    \ in the AR \n709 \nclimate zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp, LightGBMp, and\
    \ CatBoost1p) and fall (MLPp and \n710 \nCatBoost2), those in the SAR climate\
    \ zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp and LightGBMp) and fall \n711 \n(MLPp, CatBoost1p,\
    \ and CatBoost2), and those for the SHZ climate zone occurred in spring \n712\
    \ \n(XGBoostp) and fall (MLPp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2). The seasonal\
    \ RM values \n713 \nof daily ETo prediction using the five machine learning models\
    \ in the three climate zones were less \n714 \nthan 1 in spring and summer and\
    \ greater than 1 in fall and winter, indicating that daily ETo was \n715 \nunderestimated\
    \ in spring and summer (except for XGBoostp in summer in the AR climate zone,\
    \ \n716 \nwhich was overestimated by 2.93%) and overestimated in fall and winter\
    \ (except for CatBoost1p in \n717 \nwinter in the SHZ climate zone and CatBoost2,\
    \ which were underestimated by 7.75% and 2.05%, \n718 \nrespectively). \n719 \n\
    Finally, when considering all the metrics, for the AR climate zone, XGBoostp,\
    \ MLPp, CatBoost2, \n720 \nand LightGBMp showed the best performance in predicting\
    \ 1-7 day ahead seasonal ET values \n721 \nduring spring, summer, fall, and winter,\
    \ respectively, with MLPp (spring), XGBoostp (summer), \n722 \nLightGBMp (fall),\
    \ and CatBoost2 (winter) being the second best performers. For the SAR climate\

    \ \n751 \nFor all three climate zones, the performance of the four models developed\
    \ based on public \n752 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day lead time was better\
    \ than the performance of the four models \n753 \ndeveloped based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data. To reliably and accurately analyse the \n754 \nweather\
    \ forecast variables that cause daily ETo forecast errors, the models developed\
    \ based on daily \n755 \nobserved meteorological data were chosen to evaluate\
    \ the impact of weather variables from public \n756 \nweather forecasts on the\
    \ daily ETo forecasting performance. In this study, each of the four observed\
    \ \n757 \nweather variables (Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd) was replaced in sequence\
    \ with their corresponding \n758 \nforecast values with a 1-7 day lead time. This\
    \ allowed for the identification of cases where a large \n759 \nchange in the\
    \ forecasted daily ETo indicates an error in the prediction resulting from the\

    \ by Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd in the public \n762 \nweather forecast 1-7 days\

    \ the contribution of the public weather forecast variables to the error in the\
    \ predicted \n771 \ndaily ETo decreased in the order of Wspd, SDun, Tmax, and\
    \ Tmin for the AR (arid zone) climate zone,  \n772 \nwhich is consistent with\
    \ previous findings (Yang et al. 2016). Second, for all models (except the \n\
    773 \nMLP model at station YAC, the CatBoost1 model at station TX, the MLP model\
    \ at station XJ, the \n774 \nXGBoost model, and the LightGBM model), the contributions\
    \ of the public weather forecast \n775 \nvariables to the errors in the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, Wspd, Tmax, and \n776 \nTmin and SDun,\

    \ \n779 \nThese results indicate that for the study sites in the AR climate zone\

    \ the weather type of public weather forecasts contributes the most to the predicted\
    \ \n783 \ndaily ETo errors. First, the spatial variability of Wspd and DSun (Rs)\
    \ due to the topography, elevation, \n784 \ndistance, and cloudiness of the location\
    \ of the study site (Yuan et al., 2015; Fick and Hijmasn, 2017; \n785 \nLi and\
    \ Zha, 2018; Fan et al., 2021b) makes Wspd and DSun (Rs) the most difficult parameters\
    \ to \n786 \nforecast accurately (Yang et al., 2016, Ballesteros et al., 2016);\
    \ second, according to Cai et al. (2007), \n787 \nit is appropriate to estimate\
    \ Wspd from wind scale predicted by public weather forecasts, but this \n788 \n\
    estimation error is larger for arid regions with a high range of wind speed values.\
    \ George et al. (1985) \n789 \nreported that the largest difference between predicted\
    \ and measured reference crop \n790 \nevapotranspiration came from erroneous predictions\
    \ of mean wind speed. Li and Beswick (2005) \n791 \nalso reported that wind speed\
    \ is a more serious source of error than solar radiation in estimating ETo. \n\
    792 \nIn a study by Popova et al. (2005), it was noted that the effect of wind\
    \ speed on ETo results was \n793 \nrelatively small except in arid and windy areas.\
    \ \n794 \nAs shown in Table 3, SDun was estimated using the sunshine hour coefficients\
    \ derived from the \n795 \n2004 measured solar radiation data from Daxing District,\
    \ Beijing, using Equation (3). It was found \n796 \nthat applying the sunshine\
    \ hour coefficients derived from one region to other regions with different \n\
    797 \nclimate types will result in different degrees of error due to the climatic\
    \ differences between regions. \n798 \nPerera et al. (2014) found that the largest\
    \ source of error between predicted and observed ETo is the \n799 \npredictive\
    \ performance of daily incoming solar radiation, followed by air temperature,\
    \ dew point \n800 \ntemperature, and wind speed for all advanced periods. Pelosi\
    \ et al. (2016) indicated that the solar \n801 \nradiation forecast error has\
    \ the greatest impact on the ETo forecast performance, followed by relative \n\
    802 \nhumidity and wind speed. The results of Medina et al. (2018) also indicated\
    \ that the errors in solar \n803 \nradiation forecasts have the greatest impact\
    \ on ETo forecasts, followed by errors in wind forecasts. \n804 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    52 \n \nIn this study, public weather forecasts with a 1-7 day lead time were\
    \ used to compare the \n829 \nperformance of five models developed based on public\
    \ weather forecast data with a 1-day lead time \n830 \nand four models developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data in predicting daily ETo at \n831\
    \ \nnine stations in three climatic regions of Ningxia, China. The forecast performance\
    \ of weather \n832 \nvariables in public weather forecasting (2014-2021) and daily\
    \ ETo predicted by these nine models \n833 \nwere analysed and evaluated on a\
    \ daily scale, and the forecast performance of the weather variables \n834 \n\
    in the public weather forecast (2020-2021) and daily ETo predicted by the five\
    \ models developed \n835 \nbased on the public weather forecast with a 1-day lead\
    \ time were analysed and evaluated in terms \n836 \nof seasonality. The optimal\
    \ input combination for each machine learning model was determined, \n837 \nand\
    \ the weather forecast variables contributing to the error in the model predicted\
    \ daily ETo were \n838 \nidentified. The main conclusions of this study are as\
    \ follows: \n839 \nFirst, for the three climate zones, the performance of the\
    \ four models developed based on public \n840 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ lead time was better than that of the four models developed based \n841 \non\

    \ WT2) were added directly to the input \n843 \ncombinations of the CatBoost2\
    \ model, the performance of this model in predicting daily ETo was \n844 \nlower\
    \ than that of the CatBoost1p model in the testing period; that is, the performance\
    \ of the \n845 \nCatBoost2 model in terms of predicting daily ETo did not improve\
    \ during the testing period. \n846 \nSecond, the performance of the five models,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p and \n847 \nCatBoost2, in terms of daily\
    \ ETo prediction, was highest in winter and the lowest in summer for all \n848\
    \ \nthree climate zones. In terms of predicting daily ETo with a 1-7 day lead\
    \ time in all seasons, \n849 \nXGBoostp with C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input,\

    53 \n \nwith C1 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ fall and winter in the AR \n851 \nclimate zone, respectively. LightGBMp with\
    \ C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n852 \nC3 as input and\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ \n853 \nfall and winter in the SAR climate zone, respectively. XGBoostp with\
    \ C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n854 \nC3 as input and LightGBMp with C1 as input\
    \ are recommended as the best models for spring and \n855 \nsummer, fall and winter\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, respectively. \n856 \nFinally, for the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the contribution of the weather variables in the \n857 \npublic\
    \ weather forecast to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order\
    \ of Wspd, SDun, \n858 \nTmax, and Tmin; for the SAR climate zone (semiarid zone),\
    \ the contribution of the weather variables \n859 \nin the public weather forecast\
    \ to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, \n860\
    \ \nWspd, Tmax, and Tmin; and for the SHZ climate zone (semihumid zone), the contribution\
    \ of the \n861 \nweather variables in the public weather forecast to the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of \n862 \nSDun, Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin. \n863\
    \ \nIn addition, in terms of the daily scale performance of weather variables\
    \ in public weather \n864 \nforecasts, the forecast performance follows a decreasing\
    \ order of Tmin>Tmax>SDun>Wspd. In the \n865 \nseasonal analysis (2020-2021) of\
    \ the weather variable forecast performance for three climate zones, \n866 \n\
    the average performance for Tmax is in the order of summer (fall) > fall (summer)\
    \ > winter > spring. \n867 \nFor Tmin, the order is fall (summer) > summer (fall)\
    \ > winter (spring) > spring (winter), and for \n868 \nSDun, the order is winter\
    \ > spring > fall > summer. Thus, the average performance of the forecasts \n\

    2 \n \nAbstract: Real-time accurate prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) is critical for \n1 \nreal-time irrigation decisions and water resource\
    \ management. Although many public weather \n2 \nforecast-based machine learning\
    \ models have been successfully used for daily ETo prediction, these \n3 \nmodels\
    \ are developed with long-term historical daily observed meteorological data.\
    \ The use of \n4 \ntraining and testing samples from different data sources can\
    \ lead to the selection of the best model, \n5 \nand the performance of the best\
    \ model for predicting daily ETo is not ideal. In this study, based on \n6 \n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equations, four\
    \ machine \n7 \nlearning models (multilayer perceptron (MLPo), extreme gradient\
    \ boosting (XGBoosto), light \n8 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBMo), and\
    \ gradient boosting with categorical features support \n9 \n(CatBoost1o)) were\
    \ trained and validated with daily observed meteorological data from 1995-2015\
    \ \n10 \nand 2016-2019, respectively, and five machine learning models (MLPp,\
    \ XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n11 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) were trained and validated\
    \ with daily public weather forecast data with \n12 \na 1-day lead time (2014-2018\
    \ and 2019, respectively). Based on public weather forecast and daily \n13 \n\
    observed meteorological data (2020-2021), the predicted daily ETo performance\
    \ of nine machine \n14 \nlearning models (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n15 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) was compared. The\
    \ results show that for all three studied climate zones, \n16 \nthe performance\
    \ of the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ \n17 \nadvance is better than that of the four models developed based on daily\
    \ observed meteorological \n18 \ndata with corresponding input combinations, and\
    \ the mean MAE and RMSE ranges for the four \n19 \nmodels (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,\
    \ and CatBoost1) in the three studied climate zones were \n20 \nreduced by 2.93%-11.67%\
    \ and 2.20%-9.46%, respectively, and the mean R range was improved by \n21 \n\
    1.31%-5.31%. The top three models for the AR climate zone were XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n22 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion started:\

    \ \n35 \nCrop water demand is the most important part of water transfer and energy\
    \ conversion in the \n36 \nsoil‒plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC), and it is an\
    \ important process in the field water cycle. \n37 \nAccurately estimating crop\
    \ water demand is the basis for designing crop irrigation systems, \n38 \ndetermining\
    \ regional irrigation water use, and facilitating effective basin planning, regional\
    \ water \n39 \nplanning, and drainage and irrigation project planning, design,\
    \ and management. However, directly \n40 \nmeasuring crop water demand is time-consuming\
    \ and expensive, significantly limiting practical \n41 \napplications (Irmak et\
    \ al., 2003; Martınez-Cob et al., 2015; Silva et al. 2019a; Fan et al., 2021a).\
    \ \n42 \nThus, crop water demand is usually measured using an indirect method,\
    \ i.e., reference \n43 \nevapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by the crop coefficient.\
    \ Predicting ETo is more valuable than \n44 \nestimating ETo (Yang et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang et al., 2019a), and accurate ETo prediction is the key to crop \n45 \n\

    \ prerequisite for real-time irrigation forecasting, which has \n46 \nimportant\
    \ reference value and significance for real-time irrigation decisions (Luo et\
    \ al., 2014; Perera \n47 \net al. 2014; Ballesteros et al., 2016). \n48 \nDepending\
    \ on the method and input data, ETo prediction methods can be divided into direct\
    \ and \n49 \nindirect methods (Perera et al., 2014). Since daily ETo data mainly\
    \ vary with weather and are only \n50 \ninfluenced by future weather variables,\
    \ direct methods that use long-term historical weather data to \n51 \npredict\
    \ ETo are not applicable to short-term daily ETo prediction. For indirect ETo\
    \ prediction \n52 \nmethods that use weather forecast data, numerical weather\
    \ forecasts that provide all the variables of \n53 \nthe Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization 56 Penman–Monteith (FAO 56 PM) equation have been used \n54 \n\
    in predicting daily ETo (Silva et al., 2010; Pelosi et al., 2016), and used in\
    \ predicting daily ETo with \n55 \na 1-10 day lead time (Perera et al. 2014; Medina\
    \ et al., 2018; Vanella et al., 2020). However, \n56 \nnumerical forecast products\
    \ in China are only available to professionals (e.g., registered users in \n57\
    \ \nacademia and research) and are not accessible to nonprofessionals. In addition,\
    \ these products \n58 \nrequire preprocessing (Fan et al., 2021b) or postprocessing\
    \ (Medina et al., 2020) by professionals \n59 \nto improve the reliability of\
    \ the output data. \n60 \nIn China, the China Weather Network, hosted by the Public\
    \ Meteorological Service Center of \n61 \nthe China Meteorological Administration,\
    \ is a public service-based meteorological portal for society \n62 \nand the public.\
    \ The China Weather Network covers more than 100,000 sites in provinces, cities,\
    \ \n63 \ntowns, and tourist attractions across the country and provides real-time\
    \ meteorological services, \n64 \nincluding weather forecasts, current conditions,\
    \ indices, air quality information, and many other \n65 \nelements, with a minimum\
    \ time resolution of 5 minutes and a maximum forecast time of 40 days. It \n66\

    \ four variables: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind scale and weather\
    \ type. \n68 \nIn recent years, public weather forecasts have been widely used\
    \ in ETo forecasting. For example, \n69 \ninformation from public weather forecasts\
    \ has been converted into variables required to calculate \n70 \nETo using the\
    \ FAO-56 PM equation, and then used to forecast in daily ETo (Cai et al., 2007;\
    \ Cai et \n71 \nal., 2009), used to forecast daily ETo with a lead time of 1-3\
    \ days (Liu et al., 2020), and used to \n72 \nforecast daily ETo with a lead time\
    \ of 1-7 days (Yang et al., 2016). The results of these studies \n73 \nindicate\
    \ that the errors in daily ETo predicted with the variables transformed with information\
    \ from \n74 \npublic weather forecasts and the FAO 56 PM equation are mainly caused\
    \ by errors arising from the \n75 \nprocess of converting qualitative wind scale\
    \ and weather type information in public weather \n76 \nforecasts into wind speed\
    \ and sunshine hour information, respectively. \n77 \nThus, some studies have\
    \ included measured or precalculated variable data and public weather \n78 \n\
    forecast data as inputs for their models to predict daily ETo. An example of such\
    \ studies include \n79 \nusing temperature data from weather forecasts and actual\
    \ incident net solar radiation (Rs) values \n80 \noccurring in each advance period\
    \ and four artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms \n81 \n(generalized\
    \ feedforward (GFF), linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and \n\
    82 \nprobabilistic neural network (PNN)) to forecast ETo in Dallas, Texas, USA,\
    \ 1-15 days in advance \n83 \n(Traore et al., 2016). Additionally, temperature\
    \ data from public weather forecasts, measured \n84 \nsunshine hours, precalculated\
    \ weather type correction factors (Wt, only four weather type correction \n85\
    \ \nfactors, i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast and rainy, are defined) and a combined\
    \ model of bi-directional \n86 \nlong short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and ANN were\
    \ used to predict daily ETo 1-7 days ahead for \n87 \nthree stations in Ningxia,\
    \ China (Yin et al., 2020). However, since short-term daily ETo is mainly \n88\
    \ \ngoverned by weather conditions, introducing additional measured or precalculated\
    \ variable data as \n89 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ predict daily ETo may not be applicable for real-time irrigation decisions.\
    \ In addition, in \n90 \nthese studies, machine learning models were trained and\
    \ validated with long-term historical \n91 \nmeteorological data and tested with\
    \ public weather forecast data (with a maximum data duration of \n92 \n2 years).\
    \ Thus, the data sources in these studies were different (e.g., in China, the\
    \ source of historical \n93 \nmeteorological data is the National Meteorological\
    \ Information Center of China, while the source \n94 \nof public weather forecasts\
    \ is the Public Weather Service Center of the China Meteorological \n95 \nAdministration).\
    \ Moreover, there have been no comparison studies between training and validating\
    \ \n96 \nmachine learning models with historical meteorological data and public\
    \ weather forecast data. \n97 \nHowever, the use of samples from different data\
    \ sources may affect the daily ETo performance of \n98 \nmachine learning models.\
    \ \n99 \nIn recent years, three integrated learning models, extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), light \n100 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and gradient boosting\
    \ with categorical features support \n101 \n(CatBoost), based on a boosting algorithm\
    \ with a decision tree as the base learner and greedy ideas \n102 \nfor decision\
    \ tree growth, have been widely used to estimate daily ETo. Among them, CatBoost\
    \ can \n103 \ndirectly handle categorical data, such as public weather forecasts\
    \ of wind scale and weather type. \n104 \nFan et al. (2018) recommended using\
    \ the XGBoost and GBDT models with limited climate data to \n105 \npredict daily\
    \ ETo under different climatic conditions in China. Fan et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ \n106 \nLightGBM generally outperformed the other two soft computing models\
    \ and four empirical models \n107 \nin estimating daily ETo with data from 49\
    \ weather stations in humid subtropical China using local \n108 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and cross-station meteorological data. Zhou et al. (2020) strongly recommended\
    \ \n109 \nthe use of CatBoost and LightGBM models for estimating daily ETo under\
    \ different climatic \n110 \nconditions in China. Huang et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ the CatBoost algorithm has great potential for \n111 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    7 \n \ndaily ETo estimation in humid regions of China. Zhang et al. (2020) also\
    \ showed that CatBoost is \n112 \nconsidered the best choice for estimating ETo\
    \ in arid and semiarid regions of northern China. These \n113 \nstudies showed\
    \ that all three models estimated daily ETo with better accuracy and stability\
    \ than \n114 \nthose of other models. However, studies on the prediction of daily\
    \ ETo with these three models have \n115 \nnot been reported. The objectives of\
    \ this study are as follows: (1) to first develop four machine \n116 \nlearning\
    \ models using daily observed meteorological data and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a \n117 \n1-day lead time, respectively, and then to test and compare\
    \ the performance of the developed models \n118 \nin both cases using public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-7 day lead time; (2) to explore the use of \n119 \ncategorical\
    \ data (public weather forecasts of wind scale and weather type) as direct input\
    \ into \n120 \nCatBoost for daily ETo prediction; and (3) to compare the seasonal\
    \ variation in predicted daily ETo \n121 \nperformance of the five machine learning\
    \ models and recommend the best daily ETo prediction \n122 \nmodel for all four\
    \ seasons at nine stations in three different climates. \n123 \n2. Materials and\

    10 \n \nThe two main types of integrated learning algorithms are bagging-based\
    \ algorithms and \n166 \nboosting-based algorithms. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost\
    \ are improved implementations of \n167 \nthe GBDT algorithm and belong to the\
    \ boosting algorithm family. Among them, XGBoost was \n168 \nproposed by Chen\
    \ et al. (2016), and its official open source documentation is available at \n\
    169 \nhttp://xgboost.readthedocs.io. LightGBM was proposed by Ke et al. (2017),\
    \ and its official open \n170 \nsource documentation is available at http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io.\
    \ CatBoost was proposed by \n171 \nProkhorenkova et al. (2017), and its official\
    \ open source documentation is available at \n172 \nhttps://catboost.ai/en/docs/.\
    \ The base learners of all three algorithms are decision trees, but the tree \n\
    173 \nfeatures and the process of generation differ in many ways. For example,\
    \ XGBoost uses a levelwise \n174 \ndecision tree growth strategy, LightGBM uses\
    \ a leafwise decision tree growth strategy with depth \n175 \nrestrictions, and\
    \ CatBoost uses a fully symmetric decision tree as the base learner. \n176 \n\
    For categorical features, CatBoost only needs to declare the categorical signs\
    \ to enable direct \n177 \nfeature processing (Prokhorenkova et al. 2017; Dorogush\
    \ et al. 2018). LightGBM associates each \n178 \ncategorical feature fetch with\
    \ a bucket (bin) and thus automatically processes the features without \n179 \n\
    preprocessing using one-hot encoding. XGBoost cannot process the categorical features\
    \ directly. \n180 \nThis model is used after preprocessing the categorical features\
    \ by various encoding methods such \n181 \nas tag encoding, mean encoding, or\
    \ one-hot encoding. \n182 \nThe concept of deep learning was introduced by Hinton\
    \ et al. (2006). A multilayer perceptron \n183 \n(MLP) with multiple hidden layers\
    \ is a deep learning structure. MLP with one or two hidden layers \n184 \nhas\

    \ better results than those from 10 locally calibrated empirical and \n187 \n\

    \ their variants. Ferreira et al. (2019) estimated daily ETo for all of \n188\
    \ \nBrazil using the first four days of data, and an ANN (model structure 16-50-50-1)\
    \ was the best \n189 \nchoice among temperature- and relative humidity-based models.\
    \ The ANN with two hidden layers \n190 \nused by Elbeltagi et al. (2022) is a\
    \ suitable alternative to estimate the daily ETo for the \n191 \nmeteorological\
    \ station in Debrecen, Hungary, based on limited meteorological data. Luo et al.\
    \ (2015) \n192 \nused an MLP with two hidden layers and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a 1-7 day lead time to \n193 \npredict the daily ETo for Gaoyou station\
    \ in Jiangsu Province, China, with acceptable prediction \n194 \nperformance.\
    \ Traore et al. (2016) showed that an MLP model with two hidden layers and a \n\
    195 \ncombination of Tmax, Tmin, and Rs inputs had the best ETo prediction performance\
    \ for Dallas, Texas, \n196 \nUSA. These studies used trial-and-error methods to\
    \ determine the numbers of hidden layers and \n197 \nneurons per hidden layer.\
    \ These methods are time-consuming and may not always yield the best \n198 \n\
    hyperparameters. In this study, an MLP with multiple hidden layers is compared\

    \ Consistent with previous \n569 \nfindings (Yang et al., 2019a), the results\
    \ indicate that the inclusion of SDun in the input \n570 \ncombinations improves\
    \ the performance of machine learning models in predicting daily ETo (Perera \n\

    \ Therefore, SDun and Wspd should be included in the input combinations of machine\

    615 \nThe performance metrics of four models developed based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data \n616 \nand five models developed based on public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-day lead time to predict \n617 \ndaily ETo with a 1-7\
    \ day lead time for the three climate zones are shown in Figures 4 and 5. First,\
    \ \n618 \nthe daily ETo prediction performance of the nine models for the three\
    \ climate zones, AR, SAR, and \n619 \nSHZ, decreased with increasing lead time,\
    \ which is due to the decrease in forecast performance of \n620 \npublic weather\
    \ forecasting variables with increasing lead time, which is consistent with previous\
    \ \n621 \nstudies (Perera et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014 and 2015; Traore et al.,\
    \ 2016; Yang et al., 2016, 2019a, \n622 \n2019b; Traore et al., 2017; Li et al.,\
    \ 2018; Yin et al., 2020). In addition, for all three climate zones, \n623 \n\
    the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day lead\
    \ time to predict \n624 \ndaily ETo 1-7 days ahead outperformed the four models\
    \ developed based on daily observed \n625 \nmeteorological data with corresponding\
    \ input combinations (except for the 1-day ahead prediction \n626 \nperformance\
    \ of MLPp, XGBoostp, and CatBoost1p for the SHZ climate zone). Second, the RM\
    \ \n627 \nvalues of the nine models for the AR climate zone varied in the range\
    \ of 0.92-1.07. Three models, \n628 \nMLPp, XGBoostp and LightGBMo, slightly overestimated\
    \ (2.90%-6.58%) the daily ETo, while \n629 \nLightGBMp, CatBoost1p, CatBoost2,\
    \ MLPo, XGBoosto and CatBoost1o slightly underestimated \n630 \n(2.69%-7.71%)\
    \ the daily ETo. The RM values for the nine models varied in the range of 0.90-1.00\

    \ the daily ETo. \n636 \nTable 17 shows the 1-7 day ahead ETo prediction performance\

    \ data and the five models developed based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-\n639 \nday lead time for the three climate zones. Overall, for all three\
    \ climate zones, the four models \n640 \ndeveloped based on 1-day ahead public\
    \ weather forecast data generally outperformed the four \n641 \nmodels developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data with corresponding input \n642 \n\
    combinations for all metrics. In addition, the prediction performance of all models\
    \ exhibited a \n643 \ndecrease in the following order for the three climate zones:\
    \ AR, SHZ, and SAR. This result is mainly \n644 \nbecause the prediction performance\
    \ of models developed based on public weather forecasts for the \n645 \nAR climate\
    \ zone is better than that for the SAR and SHZ climate zones. For the AR climate\

    \ have different field irrigation seasons according to crop type \n686 \nand location\
    \ (Perera et al., 2014). In addition, the sensitivity of weather variables varies\
    \ with season \n687 \nand the microclimate of the studied site location (Vanella\
    \ et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a strong \n688 \nneed to evaluate the seasonality\
    \ of the ETo forecast performance. Tables 18-20 show the mean \n689 \nstatistics\
    \ of the performance indicators for the 1-7 day lead time ETo forecasts using\
    \ the five models \n690 \ndeveloped based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-day lead time for the three climatic zones \n691 \nfor all seasons of 2020-2021.\
    \ First, during all four seasons, the daily ETo prediction performance of \n692\
    \ \nall five models was better in the AR climate zone than in the SAR and SHZ\
    \ climate zones (excluding \n693 \nCatBoost2 in the spring and MLP in the fall\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, and all five models in the \n694 \nwinter in the SHZ\
    \ climate zone). This is mainly because the prediction performance of models using\
    \ \n695 \nthe public weather forecast variables in the AR climate zone outperform\
    \ those in the SAR and SHZ \n696 \nclimate zones overall. \n697 \nSecond, the\
    \ order of the seasonal MAE and RMSE values for daily ETo prediction using the\
    \ five \n698 \nmodels in the AR climate zone are as follows: winter, spring, fall,\
    \ and summer. In addition, the \n699 \nseasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ are lower than the annual average, except for the \n700 \nMLPp and LightGBMp\
    \ models for station TX in the SAR climate zone and the MLPp and XGBoost \n701\

    \ the other three models in the SAR and SHZ climate zones are as follows: winter,\
    \ fall, spring, \n703 \nand summer. The seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ and fall in the SAR climate zone \n704 \nare lower than the annual average,\
    \ and the seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter in the \n705 \nSHZ climate\

    \ in \n706 \nprevious studies (Perera et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Fan et\

    \ in all three climate zones were lower than the annual average, \n708 \nwith\
    \ the smallest R values observed during summer. The maximum seasonal R values\

    \ of weather variable forecasts from public weather forecasts on daily ETo forecasts\
    \ \n751 \nFor all three climate zones, the performance of the four models developed\
    \ based on public \n752 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day lead time was better\
    \ than the performance of the four models \n753 \ndeveloped based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data. To reliably and accurately analyse the \n754 \nweather\
    \ forecast variables that cause daily ETo forecast errors, the models developed\
    \ based on daily \n755 \nobserved meteorological data were chosen to evaluate\
    \ the impact of weather variables from public \n756 \nweather forecasts on the\
    \ daily ETo forecasting performance. In this study, each of the four observed\
    \ \n757 \nweather variables (Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd) was replaced in sequence\
    \ with their corresponding \n758 \nforecast values with a 1-7 day lead time. This\
    \ allowed for the identification of cases where a large \n759 \nchange in the\
    \ forecasted daily ETo indicates an error in the prediction resulting from the\
    \ forecasted \n760 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ et al., 2018; Fan \n761 \net al., 2021b). Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd were replaced\
    \ by Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd in the public \n762 \nweather forecast 1-7 days\
    \ ahead in turn to form the following new combinations: SC1 (Tmax, Tmin, \n763\
    \ \nSDun, and Wspd), SC2 (Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd), SC3 (Tmax, Tmin, SDun,\
    \ and Wspd), and SC4 \n764 \n(Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd), all of which were composed\
    \ of day-by-day observations for the \n765 \ncombination denoted SC (Tmax, Tmin,\
    \ SDun, and Wspd). The statistics of the mean values for the 1-\n766 \n7 day lead\
    \ time ETo performance metrics using four models (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, and\
    \ \n767 \nCatBoost1o) for the three climate zones with the SC-SC4 input combination\
    \ are shown in Tables 21-\n768 \n23. \n769 \nFirst, for all models (except the\
    \ LightGBM model at station ZW and the CatBoost1 model at \n770 \nstation HN),\
    \ the contribution of the public weather forecast variables to the error in the\
    \ predicted \n771 \ndaily ETo decreased in the order of Wspd, SDun, Tmax, and\
    \ Tmin for the AR (arid zone) climate zone,  \n772 \nwhich is consistent with\
    \ previous findings (Yang et al. 2016). Second, for all models (except the \n\
    773 \nMLP model at station YAC, the CatBoost1 model at station TX, the MLP model\
    \ at station XJ, the \n774 \nXGBoost model, and the LightGBM model), the contributions\
    \ of the public weather forecast \n775 \nvariables to the errors in the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, Wspd, Tmax, and \n776 \nTmin and SDun,\
    \ Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin for the SAR (semiarid) and SHZ (semihumid zone) climate\
    \ \n777 \nzones, which is consistent with the results of previous studies (Pelosi\
    \ et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; \n778 \nMedina et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2021b).\
    \ \n779 \nThese results indicate that for the study sites in the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the main source \n780 \nof error in daily ETo prediction is Wspd\
    \ transformed from the wind scale in public weather forecasts. \n781 \nFor the\

    \ the weather type of public weather forecasts contributes the most to the predicted\
    \ \n783 \ndaily ETo errors. First, the spatial variability of Wspd and DSun (Rs)\
    \ due to the topography, elevation, \n784 \ndistance, and cloudiness of the location\
    \ of the study site (Yuan et al., 2015; Fick and Hijmasn, 2017; \n785 \nLi and\
    \ Zha, 2018; Fan et al., 2021b) makes Wspd and DSun (Rs) the most difficult parameters\
    \ to \n786 \nforecast accurately (Yang et al., 2016, Ballesteros et al., 2016);\
    \ second, according to Cai et al. (2007), \n787 \nit is appropriate to estimate\
    \ Wspd from wind scale predicted by public weather forecasts, but this \n788 \n\
    estimation error is larger for arid regions with a high range of wind speed values.\
    \ George et al. (1985) \n789 \nreported that the largest difference between predicted\
    \ and measured reference crop \n790 \nevapotranspiration came from erroneous predictions\
    \ of mean wind speed. Li and Beswick (2005) \n791 \nalso reported that wind speed\
    \ is a more serious source of error than solar radiation in estimating ETo. \n\
    792 \nIn a study by Popova et al. (2005), it was noted that the effect of wind\
    \ speed on ETo results was \n793 \nrelatively small except in arid and windy areas.\
    \ \n794 \nAs shown in Table 3, SDun was estimated using the sunshine hour coefficients\
    \ derived from the \n795 \n2004 measured solar radiation data from Daxing District,\
    \ Beijing, using Equation (3). It was found \n796 \nthat applying the sunshine\
    \ hour coefficients derived from one region to other regions with different \n\
    797 \nclimate types will result in different degrees of error due to the climatic\
    \ differences between regions. \n798 \nPerera et al. (2014) found that the largest\
    \ source of error between predicted and observed ETo is the \n799 \npredictive\
    \ performance of daily incoming solar radiation, followed by air temperature,\
    \ dew point \n800 \ntemperature, and wind speed for all advanced periods. Pelosi\
    \ et al. (2016) indicated that the solar \n801 \nradiation forecast error has\
    \ the greatest impact on the ETo forecast performance, followed by relative \n\
    802 \nhumidity and wind speed. The results of Medina et al. (2018) also indicated\
    \ that the errors in solar \n803 \nradiation forecasts have the greatest impact\
    \ on ETo forecasts, followed by errors in wind forecasts. \n804 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    \ variables to the daily ETo \n805 \nerror in all studied climate zones, such\
    \ as the temperate continental zone (TCZ)/temperate monsoon \n806 \nzone (TMZ),\

    52 \n \nIn this study, public weather forecasts with a 1-7 day lead time were\
    \ used to compare the \n829 \nperformance of five models developed based on public\
    \ weather forecast data with a 1-day lead time \n830 \nand four models developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data in predicting daily ETo at \n831\
    \ \nnine stations in three climatic regions of Ningxia, China. The forecast performance\
    \ of weather \n832 \nvariables in public weather forecasting (2014-2021) and daily\
    \ ETo predicted by these nine models \n833 \nwere analysed and evaluated on a\
    \ daily scale, and the forecast performance of the weather variables \n834 \n\
    in the public weather forecast (2020-2021) and daily ETo predicted by the five\
    \ models developed \n835 \nbased on the public weather forecast with a 1-day lead\
    \ time were analysed and evaluated in terms \n836 \nof seasonality. The optimal\
    \ input combination for each machine learning model was determined, \n837 \nand\
    \ the weather forecast variables contributing to the error in the model predicted\
    \ daily ETo were \n838 \nidentified. The main conclusions of this study are as\
    \ follows: \n839 \nFirst, for the three climate zones, the performance of the\
    \ four models developed based on public \n840 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ lead time was better than that of the four models developed based \n841 \non\
    \ daily observation meteorological data with corresponding input combinations.\
    \ When category \n842 \ndata such as wind scale (WS) and weather type (WT1 and\
    \ WT2) were added directly to the input \n843 \ncombinations of the CatBoost2\
    \ model, the performance of this model in predicting daily ETo was \n844 \nlower\
    \ than that of the CatBoost1p model in the testing period; that is, the performance\
    \ of the \n845 \nCatBoost2 model in terms of predicting daily ETo did not improve\
    \ during the testing period. \n846 \nSecond, the performance of the five models,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p and \n847 \nCatBoost2, in terms of daily\
    \ ETo prediction, was highest in winter and the lowest in summer for all \n848\
    \ \nthree climate zones. In terms of predicting daily ETo with a 1-7 day lead\
    \ time in all seasons, \n849 \nXGBoostp with C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input,\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input and LightGBMp \n850 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    53 \n \nwith C1 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ fall and winter in the AR \n851 \nclimate zone, respectively. LightGBMp with\
    \ C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n852 \nC3 as input and\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ \n853 \nfall and winter in the SAR climate zone, respectively. XGBoostp with\
    \ C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n854 \nC3 as input and LightGBMp with C1 as input\
    \ are recommended as the best models for spring and \n855 \nsummer, fall and winter\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, respectively. \n856 \nFinally, for the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the contribution of the weather variables in the \n857 \npublic\
    \ weather forecast to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order\
    \ of Wspd, SDun, \n858 \nTmax, and Tmin; for the SAR climate zone (semiarid zone),\
    \ the contribution of the weather variables \n859 \nin the public weather forecast\
    \ to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, \n860\
    \ \nWspd, Tmax, and Tmin; and for the SHZ climate zone (semihumid zone), the contribution\
    \ of the \n861 \nweather variables in the public weather forecast to the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of \n862 \nSDun, Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin. \n863\
    \ \nIn addition, in terms of the daily scale performance of weather variables\
    \ in public weather \n864 \nforecasts, the forecast performance follows a decreasing\
    \ order of Tmin>Tmax>SDun>Wspd. In the \n865 \nseasonal analysis (2020-2021) of\
    \ the weather variable forecast performance for three climate zones, \n866 \n\
    the average performance for Tmax is in the order of summer (fall) > fall (summer)\
    \ > winter > spring. \n867 \nFor Tmin, the order is fall (summer) > summer (fall)\
    \ > winter (spring) > spring (winter), and for \n868 \nSDun, the order is winter\
    \ > spring > fall > summer. Thus, the average performance of the forecasts \n\
    869 \ndecreases sequentially. \n870 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    2 \n \nAbstract: Real-time accurate prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) is critical for \n1 \nreal-time irrigation decisions and water resource\
    \ management. Although many public weather \n2 \nforecast-based machine learning\
    \ models have been successfully used for daily ETo prediction, these \n3 \nmodels\
    \ are developed with long-term historical daily observed meteorological data.\
    \ The use of \n4 \ntraining and testing samples from different data sources can\
    \ lead to the selection of the best model, \n5 \nand the performance of the best\
    \ model for predicting daily ETo is not ideal. In this study, based on \n6 \n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equations, four\
    \ machine \n7 \nlearning models (multilayer perceptron (MLPo), extreme gradient\
    \ boosting (XGBoosto), light \n8 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBMo), and\
    \ gradient boosting with categorical features support \n9 \n(CatBoost1o)) were\
    \ trained and validated with daily observed meteorological data from 1995-2015\
    \ \n10 \nand 2016-2019, respectively, and five machine learning models (MLPp,\
    \ XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n11 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) were trained and validated\
    \ with daily public weather forecast data with \n12 \na 1-day lead time (2014-2018\
    \ and 2019, respectively). Based on public weather forecast and daily \n13 \n\
    observed meteorological data (2020-2021), the predicted daily ETo performance\
    \ of nine machine \n14 \nlearning models (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n15 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) was compared. The\
    \ results show that for all three studied climate zones, \n16 \nthe performance\
    \ of the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ \n17 \nadvance is better than that of the four models developed based on daily\
    \ observed meteorological \n18 \ndata with corresponding input combinations, and\
    \ the mean MAE and RMSE ranges for the four \n19 \nmodels (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,\
    \ and CatBoost1) in the three studied climate zones were \n20 \nreduced by 2.93%-11.67%\
    \ and 2.20%-9.46%, respectively, and the mean R range was improved by \n21 \n\
    1.31%-5.31%. The top three models for the AR climate zone were XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n22 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion started:\

    \ models for the SAR climate zone were MLPp, XGBoostp, and LightGBMp, and \n23\
    \ \nthe top three models for the SHZ climate zone were XGBoostp, MLPp, and LightGBMp.\
    \ In addition, \n24 \nthe prediction performance for daily ETo is found to be\
    \ highest in winter and lowest in summer in \n25 \nall three climate zones. Wspd\
    \ from public weather forecasts was the most important source of daily \n26 \n\
    ETo error in model predictions for the AR climate zone, followed by SDun, Tmax,\
    \ and Tmin, while \n27 \nSDun from public weather forecasts was the most important\
    \ source of daily ETo error in model \n28 \npredictions for the SAR (SHZ) climate\
    \ zone, followed by Wspd, Tmax, and Tmin (Tmax, Wspd, and \n29 \nTmin). \n30 \n\

    \ \n35 \nCrop water demand is the most important part of water transfer and energy\
    \ conversion in the \n36 \nsoil‒plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC), and it is an\
    \ important process in the field water cycle. \n37 \nAccurately estimating crop\
    \ water demand is the basis for designing crop irrigation systems, \n38 \ndetermining\
    \ regional irrigation water use, and facilitating effective basin planning, regional\
    \ water \n39 \nplanning, and drainage and irrigation project planning, design,\
    \ and management. However, directly \n40 \nmeasuring crop water demand is time-consuming\
    \ and expensive, significantly limiting practical \n41 \napplications (Irmak et\
    \ al., 2003; Martınez-Cob et al., 2015; Silva et al. 2019a; Fan et al., 2021a).\
    \ \n42 \nThus, crop water demand is usually measured using an indirect method,\
    \ i.e., reference \n43 \nevapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by the crop coefficient.\
    \ Predicting ETo is more valuable than \n44 \nestimating ETo (Yang et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang et al., 2019a), and accurate ETo prediction is the key to crop \n45 \n\

    \ prerequisite for real-time irrigation forecasting, which has \n46 \nimportant\
    \ reference value and significance for real-time irrigation decisions (Luo et\
    \ al., 2014; Perera \n47 \net al. 2014; Ballesteros et al., 2016). \n48 \nDepending\
    \ on the method and input data, ETo prediction methods can be divided into direct\
    \ and \n49 \nindirect methods (Perera et al., 2014). Since daily ETo data mainly\
    \ vary with weather and are only \n50 \ninfluenced by future weather variables,\
    \ direct methods that use long-term historical weather data to \n51 \npredict\
    \ ETo are not applicable to short-term daily ETo prediction. For indirect ETo\
    \ prediction \n52 \nmethods that use weather forecast data, numerical weather\
    \ forecasts that provide all the variables of \n53 \nthe Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization 56 Penman–Monteith (FAO 56 PM) equation have been used \n54 \n\
    in predicting daily ETo (Silva et al., 2010; Pelosi et al., 2016), and used in\
    \ predicting daily ETo with \n55 \na 1-10 day lead time (Perera et al. 2014; Medina\
    \ et al., 2018; Vanella et al., 2020). However, \n56 \nnumerical forecast products\
    \ in China are only available to professionals (e.g., registered users in \n57\
    \ \nacademia and research) and are not accessible to nonprofessionals. In addition,\
    \ these products \n58 \nrequire preprocessing (Fan et al., 2021b) or postprocessing\
    \ (Medina et al., 2020) by professionals \n59 \nto improve the reliability of\
    \ the output data. \n60 \nIn China, the China Weather Network, hosted by the Public\
    \ Meteorological Service Center of \n61 \nthe China Meteorological Administration,\
    \ is a public service-based meteorological portal for society \n62 \nand the public.\
    \ The China Weather Network covers more than 100,000 sites in provinces, cities,\
    \ \n63 \ntowns, and tourist attractions across the country and provides real-time\
    \ meteorological services, \n64 \nincluding weather forecasts, current conditions,\
    \ indices, air quality information, and many other \n65 \nelements, with a minimum\
    \ time resolution of 5 minutes and a maximum forecast time of 40 days. It \n66\
    \ \nalso provides user location-based forecasting services on mobile sites. Public\

    \ four variables: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind scale and weather\
    \ type. \n68 \nIn recent years, public weather forecasts have been widely used\
    \ in ETo forecasting. For example, \n69 \ninformation from public weather forecasts\
    \ has been converted into variables required to calculate \n70 \nETo using the\
    \ FAO-56 PM equation, and then used to forecast in daily ETo (Cai et al., 2007;\
    \ Cai et \n71 \nal., 2009), used to forecast daily ETo with a lead time of 1-3\
    \ days (Liu et al., 2020), and used to \n72 \nforecast daily ETo with a lead time\
    \ of 1-7 days (Yang et al., 2016). The results of these studies \n73 \nindicate\
    \ that the errors in daily ETo predicted with the variables transformed with information\
    \ from \n74 \npublic weather forecasts and the FAO 56 PM equation are mainly caused\
    \ by errors arising from the \n75 \nprocess of converting qualitative wind scale\
    \ and weather type information in public weather \n76 \nforecasts into wind speed\
    \ and sunshine hour information, respectively. \n77 \nThus, some studies have\
    \ included measured or precalculated variable data and public weather \n78 \n\
    forecast data as inputs for their models to predict daily ETo. An example of such\
    \ studies include \n79 \nusing temperature data from weather forecasts and actual\
    \ incident net solar radiation (Rs) values \n80 \noccurring in each advance period\
    \ and four artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms \n81 \n(generalized\
    \ feedforward (GFF), linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and \n\
    82 \nprobabilistic neural network (PNN)) to forecast ETo in Dallas, Texas, USA,\
    \ 1-15 days in advance \n83 \n(Traore et al., 2016). Additionally, temperature\
    \ data from public weather forecasts, measured \n84 \nsunshine hours, precalculated\
    \ weather type correction factors (Wt, only four weather type correction \n85\
    \ \nfactors, i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast and rainy, are defined) and a combined\
    \ model of bi-directional \n86 \nlong short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and ANN were\
    \ used to predict daily ETo 1-7 days ahead for \n87 \nthree stations in Ningxia,\
    \ China (Yin et al., 2020). However, since short-term daily ETo is mainly \n88\
    \ \ngoverned by weather conditions, introducing additional measured or precalculated\
    \ variable data as \n89 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ predict daily ETo may not be applicable for real-time irrigation decisions.\
    \ In addition, in \n90 \nthese studies, machine learning models were trained and\
    \ validated with long-term historical \n91 \nmeteorological data and tested with\
    \ public weather forecast data (with a maximum data duration of \n92 \n2 years).\
    \ Thus, the data sources in these studies were different (e.g., in China, the\
    \ source of historical \n93 \nmeteorological data is the National Meteorological\
    \ Information Center of China, while the source \n94 \nof public weather forecasts\
    \ is the Public Weather Service Center of the China Meteorological \n95 \nAdministration).\
    \ Moreover, there have been no comparison studies between training and validating\
    \ \n96 \nmachine learning models with historical meteorological data and public\
    \ weather forecast data. \n97 \nHowever, the use of samples from different data\
    \ sources may affect the daily ETo performance of \n98 \nmachine learning models.\
    \ \n99 \nIn recent years, three integrated learning models, extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), light \n100 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and gradient boosting\
    \ with categorical features support \n101 \n(CatBoost), based on a boosting algorithm\
    \ with a decision tree as the base learner and greedy ideas \n102 \nfor decision\
    \ tree growth, have been widely used to estimate daily ETo. Among them, CatBoost\
    \ can \n103 \ndirectly handle categorical data, such as public weather forecasts\
    \ of wind scale and weather type. \n104 \nFan et al. (2018) recommended using\
    \ the XGBoost and GBDT models with limited climate data to \n105 \npredict daily\
    \ ETo under different climatic conditions in China. Fan et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ \n106 \nLightGBM generally outperformed the other two soft computing models\
    \ and four empirical models \n107 \nin estimating daily ETo with data from 49\
    \ weather stations in humid subtropical China using local \n108 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and cross-station meteorological data. Zhou et al. (2020) strongly recommended\
    \ \n109 \nthe use of CatBoost and LightGBM models for estimating daily ETo under\
    \ different climatic \n110 \nconditions in China. Huang et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ the CatBoost algorithm has great potential for \n111 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    7 \n \ndaily ETo estimation in humid regions of China. Zhang et al. (2020) also\
    \ showed that CatBoost is \n112 \nconsidered the best choice for estimating ETo\
    \ in arid and semiarid regions of northern China. These \n113 \nstudies showed\
    \ that all three models estimated daily ETo with better accuracy and stability\
    \ than \n114 \nthose of other models. However, studies on the prediction of daily\
    \ ETo with these three models have \n115 \nnot been reported. The objectives of\
    \ this study are as follows: (1) to first develop four machine \n116 \nlearning\
    \ models using daily observed meteorological data and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a \n117 \n1-day lead time, respectively, and then to test and compare\
    \ the performance of the developed models \n118 \nin both cases using public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-7 day lead time; (2) to explore the use of \n119 \ncategorical\
    \ data (public weather forecasts of wind scale and weather type) as direct input\
    \ into \n120 \nCatBoost for daily ETo prediction; and (3) to compare the seasonal\
    \ variation in predicted daily ETo \n121 \nperformance of the five machine learning\
    \ models and recommend the best daily ETo prediction \n122 \nmodel for all four\
    \ seasons at nine stations in three different climates. \n123 \n2. Materials and\

    10 \n \nThe two main types of integrated learning algorithms are bagging-based\
    \ algorithms and \n166 \nboosting-based algorithms. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost\
    \ are improved implementations of \n167 \nthe GBDT algorithm and belong to the\
    \ boosting algorithm family. Among them, XGBoost was \n168 \nproposed by Chen\
    \ et al. (2016), and its official open source documentation is available at \n\
    169 \nhttp://xgboost.readthedocs.io. LightGBM was proposed by Ke et al. (2017),\
    \ and its official open \n170 \nsource documentation is available at http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io.\
    \ CatBoost was proposed by \n171 \nProkhorenkova et al. (2017), and its official\
    \ open source documentation is available at \n172 \nhttps://catboost.ai/en/docs/.\
    \ The base learners of all three algorithms are decision trees, but the tree \n\
    173 \nfeatures and the process of generation differ in many ways. For example,\
    \ XGBoost uses a levelwise \n174 \ndecision tree growth strategy, LightGBM uses\
    \ a leafwise decision tree growth strategy with depth \n175 \nrestrictions, and\
    \ CatBoost uses a fully symmetric decision tree as the base learner. \n176 \n\
    For categorical features, CatBoost only needs to declare the categorical signs\
    \ to enable direct \n177 \nfeature processing (Prokhorenkova et al. 2017; Dorogush\
    \ et al. 2018). LightGBM associates each \n178 \ncategorical feature fetch with\
    \ a bucket (bin) and thus automatically processes the features without \n179 \n\
    preprocessing using one-hot encoding. XGBoost cannot process the categorical features\
    \ directly. \n180 \nThis model is used after preprocessing the categorical features\
    \ by various encoding methods such \n181 \nas tag encoding, mean encoding, or\
    \ one-hot encoding. \n182 \nThe concept of deep learning was introduced by Hinton\
    \ et al. (2006). A multilayer perceptron \n183 \n(MLP) with multiple hidden layers\
    \ is a deep learning structure. MLP with one or two hidden layers \n184 \nhas\
    \ been successfully used for ETo estimation or prediction. Landeras et al. (2008)\
    \ used an artificial \n185 \nneural network (ANN) with 1 hidden layer to estimate\
    \ the daily ETo for Alava, Basque Country in \n186 \nnorthern Spain and obtained\
    \ better results than those from 10 locally calibrated empirical and \n187 \n\

    \ their variants. Ferreira et al. (2019) estimated daily ETo for all of \n188\
    \ \nBrazil using the first four days of data, and an ANN (model structure 16-50-50-1)\
    \ was the best \n189 \nchoice among temperature- and relative humidity-based models.\
    \ The ANN with two hidden layers \n190 \nused by Elbeltagi et al. (2022) is a\
    \ suitable alternative to estimate the daily ETo for the \n191 \nmeteorological\
    \ station in Debrecen, Hungary, based on limited meteorological data. Luo et al.\
    \ (2015) \n192 \nused an MLP with two hidden layers and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a 1-7 day lead time to \n193 \npredict the daily ETo for Gaoyou station\
    \ in Jiangsu Province, China, with acceptable prediction \n194 \nperformance.\
    \ Traore et al. (2016) showed that an MLP model with two hidden layers and a \n\
    195 \ncombination of Tmax, Tmin, and Rs inputs had the best ETo prediction performance\
    \ for Dallas, Texas, \n196 \nUSA. These studies used trial-and-error methods to\
    \ determine the numbers of hidden layers and \n197 \nneurons per hidden layer.\
    \ These methods are time-consuming and may not always yield the best \n198 \n\
    hyperparameters. In this study, an MLP with multiple hidden layers is compared\
    \ with three machine \n199 \nlearning models, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.\
    \ The MLP with multiple hidden layers is \n200 \nimplemented using Google's TensorFlow\

    \ learning models (MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) trained\
    \ and \n564 \nvalidated with 1-day ahead public weather forecast data for the\
    \ three climate zones are shown in \n565 \nTable 15. In all climate zones except\
    \ for SAR and SHZ, where the best input combination for \n566 \nCatBoost1p was\
    \ C3 (8.33%), the best input combination for each of the eight machine learning\
    \ \n567 \nmodels (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o, MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n568 \nCatBoost1p) were either C1 (20.83%), C2 (29.17%), or C4 (41.67%).\
    \ Consistent with previous \n569 \nfindings (Yang et al., 2019a), the results\
    \ indicate that the inclusion of SDun in the input \n570 \ncombinations improves\
    \ the performance of machine learning models in predicting daily ETo (Perera \n\
    571 \net al., 2014; Traore et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b;\
    \ Yin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., \n572 \n2020; Dong et al., 2021; Zhao et al.,\
    \ 2022), while the inclusion of Wspd leads to a decrease in the \n573 \nperformance.\
    \ Therefore, SDun and Wspd should be included in the input combinations of machine\
    \ \n574 \nlearning models cautiously. In addition, the model information obtained\
    \ using the optimal input \n575 \ncombination for each of the machine learning\
    \ models (MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, \n576 \nand CatBoost2) trained\
    \ and validated with 1-day ahead public weather forecast data is shown in \n577\
    \ \nTable 16. It is shown that the daily ETo performance predicted by MLP models\
    \ with 2-3 hidden \n578 \nlayers is better than that with 1 hidden layer (Luo\
    \ et al., 2015; Traore et al., 2016; Ferreira et al., \n579 \n2019). \n580 \n\

    615 \nThe performance metrics of four models developed based on daily observed\

    \ \n618 \nthe daily ETo prediction performance of the nine models for the three\
    \ climate zones, AR, SAR, and \n619 \nSHZ, decreased with increasing lead time,\
    \ which is due to the decrease in forecast performance of \n620 \npublic weather\
    \ forecasting variables with increasing lead time, which is consistent with previous\
    \ \n621 \nstudies (Perera et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014 and 2015; Traore et al.,\

    the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day lead\
    \ time to predict \n624 \ndaily ETo 1-7 days ahead outperformed the four models\

    \ input combinations (except for the 1-day ahead prediction \n626 \nperformance\
    \ of MLPp, XGBoostp, and CatBoost1p for the SHZ climate zone). Second, the RM\
    \ \n627 \nvalues of the nine models for the AR climate zone varied in the range\
    \ of 0.92-1.07. Three models, \n628 \nMLPp, XGBoostp and LightGBMo, slightly overestimated\

    \ 0.90-1.02 for the SHZ climate zone. MLPp slightly overestimated (0.13%-\n635\
    \ \n1.64%) the daily ETo, and all other models slightly underestimated (0.02%-9.94%)\
    \ the daily ETo. \n636 \nTable 17 shows the 1-7 day ahead ETo prediction performance\
    \ comparison utilizing the best \n637 \ninput combinations in the testing period\
    \ for the four models developed based on daily observed \n638 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and the five models developed based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-\n639 \nday lead time for the three climate zones. Overall, for all three\
    \ climate zones, the four models \n640 \ndeveloped based on 1-day ahead public\
    \ weather forecast data generally outperformed the four \n641 \nmodels developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data with corresponding input \n642 \n\
    combinations for all metrics. In addition, the prediction performance of all models\
    \ exhibited a \n643 \ndecrease in the following order for the three climate zones:\
    \ AR, SHZ, and SAR. This result is mainly \n644 \nbecause the prediction performance\
    \ of models developed based on public weather forecasts for the \n645 \nAR climate\
    \ zone is better than that for the SAR and SHZ climate zones. For the AR climate\

    \ five models developed based on public weather forecast \n684 \ndata with a 1-day\
    \ lead time to predict daily ETo \n685 \nIrrigated areas in the studied sites\
    \ have different field irrigation seasons according to crop type \n686 \nand location\
    \ (Perera et al., 2014). In addition, the sensitivity of weather variables varies\
    \ with season \n687 \nand the microclimate of the studied site location (Vanella\
    \ et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a strong \n688 \nneed to evaluate the seasonality\
    \ of the ETo forecast performance. Tables 18-20 show the mean \n689 \nstatistics\
    \ of the performance indicators for the 1-7 day lead time ETo forecasts using\
    \ the five models \n690 \ndeveloped based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-day lead time for the three climatic zones \n691 \nfor all seasons of 2020-2021.\
    \ First, during all four seasons, the daily ETo prediction performance of \n692\
    \ \nall five models was better in the AR climate zone than in the SAR and SHZ\
    \ climate zones (excluding \n693 \nCatBoost2 in the spring and MLP in the fall\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, and all five models in the \n694 \nwinter in the SHZ\
    \ climate zone). This is mainly because the prediction performance of models using\
    \ \n695 \nthe public weather forecast variables in the AR climate zone outperform\
    \ those in the SAR and SHZ \n696 \nclimate zones overall. \n697 \nSecond, the\
    \ order of the seasonal MAE and RMSE values for daily ETo prediction using the\
    \ five \n698 \nmodels in the AR climate zone are as follows: winter, spring, fall,\
    \ and summer. In addition, the \n699 \nseasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ are lower than the annual average, except for the \n700 \nMLPp and LightGBMp\
    \ models for station TX in the SAR climate zone and the MLPp and XGBoost \n701\
    \ \nmodels for station XJ in the SHZ climate zone. The order of the seasonal MAE\

    \ the other three models in the SAR and SHZ climate zones are as follows: winter,\
    \ fall, spring, \n703 \nand summer. The seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ and fall in the SAR climate zone \n704 \nare lower than the annual average,\
    \ and the seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter in the \n705 \nSHZ climate\
    \ zone are lower than the annual average. These results are consistent with results\
    \ in \n706 \nprevious studies (Perera et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Fan et\
    \ al., 2021b). The seasonal R values of \n707 \nETo for all model prediction days\
    \ in all three climate zones were lower than the annual average, \n708 \nwith\
    \ the smallest R values observed during summer. The maximum seasonal R values\
    \ in the AR \n709 \nclimate zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp, LightGBMp, and\
    \ CatBoost1p) and fall (MLPp and \n710 \nCatBoost2), those in the SAR climate\
    \ zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp and LightGBMp) and fall \n711 \n(MLPp, CatBoost1p,\
    \ and CatBoost2), and those for the SHZ climate zone occurred in spring \n712\
    \ \n(XGBoostp) and fall (MLPp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2). The seasonal\
    \ RM values \n713 \nof daily ETo prediction using the five machine learning models\
    \ in the three climate zones were less \n714 \nthan 1 in spring and summer and\
    \ greater than 1 in fall and winter, indicating that daily ETo was \n715 \nunderestimated\
    \ in spring and summer (except for XGBoostp in summer in the AR climate zone,\
    \ \n716 \nwhich was overestimated by 2.93%) and overestimated in fall and winter\
    \ (except for CatBoost1p in \n717 \nwinter in the SHZ climate zone and CatBoost2,\
    \ which were underestimated by 7.75% and 2.05%, \n718 \nrespectively). \n719 \n\
    Finally, when considering all the metrics, for the AR climate zone, XGBoostp,\
    \ MLPp, CatBoost2, \n720 \nand LightGBMp showed the best performance in predicting\
    \ 1-7 day ahead seasonal ET values \n721 \nduring spring, summer, fall, and winter,\

    \ of weather variable forecasts from public weather forecasts on daily ETo forecasts\
    \ \n751 \nFor all three climate zones, the performance of the four models developed\
    \ based on public \n752 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day lead time was better\
    \ than the performance of the four models \n753 \ndeveloped based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data. To reliably and accurately analyse the \n754 \nweather\
    \ forecast variables that cause daily ETo forecast errors, the models developed\
    \ based on daily \n755 \nobserved meteorological data were chosen to evaluate\
    \ the impact of weather variables from public \n756 \nweather forecasts on the\
    \ daily ETo forecasting performance. In this study, each of the four observed\
    \ \n757 \nweather variables (Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd) was replaced in sequence\
    \ with their corresponding \n758 \nforecast values with a 1-7 day lead time. This\
    \ allowed for the identification of cases where a large \n759 \nchange in the\

    \ by Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd in the public \n762 \nweather forecast 1-7 days\
    \ ahead in turn to form the following new combinations: SC1 (Tmax, Tmin, \n763\

    \ and Wspd), and SC4 \n764 \n(Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd), all of which were composed\
    \ of day-by-day observations for the \n765 \ncombination denoted SC (Tmax, Tmin,\

    \ \n767 \nCatBoost1o) for the three climate zones with the SC-SC4 input combination\
    \ are shown in Tables 21-\n768 \n23. \n769 \nFirst, for all models (except the\
    \ LightGBM model at station ZW and the CatBoost1 model at \n770 \nstation HN),\
    \ the contribution of the public weather forecast variables to the error in the\
    \ predicted \n771 \ndaily ETo decreased in the order of Wspd, SDun, Tmax, and\
    \ Tmin for the AR (arid zone) climate zone,  \n772 \nwhich is consistent with\
    \ previous findings (Yang et al. 2016). Second, for all models (except the \n\
    773 \nMLP model at station YAC, the CatBoost1 model at station TX, the MLP model\
    \ at station XJ, the \n774 \nXGBoost model, and the LightGBM model), the contributions\
    \ of the public weather forecast \n775 \nvariables to the errors in the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, Wspd, Tmax, and \n776 \nTmin and SDun,\
    \ Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin for the SAR (semiarid) and SHZ (semihumid zone) climate\

    \ \n779 \nThese results indicate that for the study sites in the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the main source \n780 \nof error in daily ETo prediction is Wspd\

    \ the weather type of public weather forecasts contributes the most to the predicted\
    \ \n783 \ndaily ETo errors. First, the spatial variability of Wspd and DSun (Rs)\
    \ due to the topography, elevation, \n784 \ndistance, and cloudiness of the location\
    \ of the study site (Yuan et al., 2015; Fick and Hijmasn, 2017; \n785 \nLi and\
    \ Zha, 2018; Fan et al., 2021b) makes Wspd and DSun (Rs) the most difficult parameters\
    \ to \n786 \nforecast accurately (Yang et al., 2016, Ballesteros et al., 2016);\
    \ second, according to Cai et al. (2007), \n787 \nit is appropriate to estimate\
    \ Wspd from wind scale predicted by public weather forecasts, but this \n788 \n\
    estimation error is larger for arid regions with a high range of wind speed values.\
    \ George et al. (1985) \n789 \nreported that the largest difference between predicted\
    \ and measured reference crop \n790 \nevapotranspiration came from erroneous predictions\
    \ of mean wind speed. Li and Beswick (2005) \n791 \nalso reported that wind speed\
    \ is a more serious source of error than solar radiation in estimating ETo. \n\
    792 \nIn a study by Popova et al. (2005), it was noted that the effect of wind\
    \ speed on ETo results was \n793 \nrelatively small except in arid and windy areas.\
    \ \n794 \nAs shown in Table 3, SDun was estimated using the sunshine hour coefficients\
    \ derived from the \n795 \n2004 measured solar radiation data from Daxing District,\
    \ Beijing, using Equation (3). It was found \n796 \nthat applying the sunshine\
    \ hour coefficients derived from one region to other regions with different \n\
    797 \nclimate types will result in different degrees of error due to the climatic\
    \ differences between regions. \n798 \nPerera et al. (2014) found that the largest\
    \ source of error between predicted and observed ETo is the \n799 \npredictive\
    \ performance of daily incoming solar radiation, followed by air temperature,\
    \ dew point \n800 \ntemperature, and wind speed for all advanced periods. Pelosi\
    \ et al. (2016) indicated that the solar \n801 \nradiation forecast error has\
    \ the greatest impact on the ETo forecast performance, followed by relative \n\
    802 \nhumidity and wind speed. The results of Medina et al. (2018) also indicated\
    \ that the errors in solar \n803 \nradiation forecasts have the greatest impact\
    \ on ETo forecasts, followed by errors in wind forecasts. \n804 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    52 \n \nIn this study, public weather forecasts with a 1-7 day lead time were\
    \ used to compare the \n829 \nperformance of five models developed based on public\
    \ weather forecast data with a 1-day lead time \n830 \nand four models developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data in predicting daily ETo at \n831\
    \ \nnine stations in three climatic regions of Ningxia, China. The forecast performance\
    \ of weather \n832 \nvariables in public weather forecasting (2014-2021) and daily\
    \ ETo predicted by these nine models \n833 \nwere analysed and evaluated on a\
    \ daily scale, and the forecast performance of the weather variables \n834 \n\
    in the public weather forecast (2020-2021) and daily ETo predicted by the five\
    \ models developed \n835 \nbased on the public weather forecast with a 1-day lead\
    \ time were analysed and evaluated in terms \n836 \nof seasonality. The optimal\
    \ input combination for each machine learning model was determined, \n837 \nand\
    \ the weather forecast variables contributing to the error in the model predicted\
    \ daily ETo were \n838 \nidentified. The main conclusions of this study are as\
    \ follows: \n839 \nFirst, for the three climate zones, the performance of the\
    \ four models developed based on public \n840 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ lead time was better than that of the four models developed based \n841 \non\
    \ daily observation meteorological data with corresponding input combinations.\
    \ When category \n842 \ndata such as wind scale (WS) and weather type (WT1 and\
    \ WT2) were added directly to the input \n843 \ncombinations of the CatBoost2\
    \ model, the performance of this model in predicting daily ETo was \n844 \nlower\
    \ than that of the CatBoost1p model in the testing period; that is, the performance\
    \ of the \n845 \nCatBoost2 model in terms of predicting daily ETo did not improve\
    \ during the testing period. \n846 \nSecond, the performance of the five models,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p and \n847 \nCatBoost2, in terms of daily\
    \ ETo prediction, was highest in winter and the lowest in summer for all \n848\
    \ \nthree climate zones. In terms of predicting daily ETo with a 1-7 day lead\
    \ time in all seasons, \n849 \nXGBoostp with C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input,\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input and LightGBMp \n850 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    53 \n \nwith C1 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ fall and winter in the AR \n851 \nclimate zone, respectively. LightGBMp with\
    \ C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n852 \nC3 as input and\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ \n853 \nfall and winter in the SAR climate zone, respectively. XGBoostp with\
    \ C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n854 \nC3 as input and LightGBMp with C1 as input\
    \ are recommended as the best models for spring and \n855 \nsummer, fall and winter\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, respectively. \n856 \nFinally, for the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the contribution of the weather variables in the \n857 \npublic\
    \ weather forecast to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order\
    \ of Wspd, SDun, \n858 \nTmax, and Tmin; for the SAR climate zone (semiarid zone),\
    \ the contribution of the weather variables \n859 \nin the public weather forecast\
    \ to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, \n860\
    \ \nWspd, Tmax, and Tmin; and for the SHZ climate zone (semihumid zone), the contribution\
    \ of the \n861 \nweather variables in the public weather forecast to the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of \n862 \nSDun, Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin. \n863\
    \ \nIn addition, in terms of the daily scale performance of weather variables\
    \ in public weather \n864 \nforecasts, the forecast performance follows a decreasing\
    \ order of Tmin>Tmax>SDun>Wspd. In the \n865 \nseasonal analysis (2020-2021) of\
    \ the weather variable forecast performance for three climate zones, \n866 \n\
    the average performance for Tmax is in the order of summer (fall) > fall (summer)\
    \ > winter > spring. \n867 \nFor Tmin, the order is fall (summer) > summer (fall)\
    \ > winter (spring) > spring (winter), and for \n868 \nSDun, the order is winter\
    \ > spring > fall > summer. Thus, the average performance of the forecasts \n\
    869 \ndecreases sequentially. \n870 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    2 \n \nAbstract: Real-time accurate prediction of daily reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) is critical for \n1 \nreal-time irrigation decisions and water resource\
    \ management. Although many public weather \n2 \nforecast-based machine learning\
    \ models have been successfully used for daily ETo prediction, these \n3 \nmodels\
    \ are developed with long-term historical daily observed meteorological data.\
    \ The use of \n4 \ntraining and testing samples from different data sources can\
    \ lead to the selection of the best model, \n5 \nand the performance of the best\
    \ model for predicting daily ETo is not ideal. In this study, based on \n6 \n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 56 Penman–Monteith (PM) equations, four\
    \ machine \n7 \nlearning models (multilayer perceptron (MLPo), extreme gradient\
    \ boosting (XGBoosto), light \n8 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBMo), and\
    \ gradient boosting with categorical features support \n9 \n(CatBoost1o)) were\
    \ trained and validated with daily observed meteorological data from 1995-2015\
    \ \n10 \nand 2016-2019, respectively, and five machine learning models (MLPp,\
    \ XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n11 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) were trained and validated\
    \ with daily public weather forecast data with \n12 \na 1-day lead time (2014-2018\
    \ and 2019, respectively). Based on public weather forecast and daily \n13 \n\
    observed meteorological data (2020-2021), the predicted daily ETo performance\
    \ of nine machine \n14 \nlearning models (MLPo, XGBoosto, LightGBMo, CatBoost1o,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, \n15 \nCatBoost1p, and CatBoost2) was compared. The\
    \ results show that for all three studied climate zones, \n16 \nthe performance\
    \ of the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ \n17 \nadvance is better than that of the four models developed based on daily\
    \ observed meteorological \n18 \ndata with corresponding input combinations, and\
    \ the mean MAE and RMSE ranges for the four \n19 \nmodels (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,\
    \ and CatBoost1) in the three studied climate zones were \n20 \nreduced by 2.93%-11.67%\
    \ and 2.20%-9.46%, respectively, and the mean R range was improved by \n21 \n\
    1.31%-5.31%. The top three models for the AR climate zone were XGBoostp, LightGBMp,\
    \ and \n22 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion started:\

    \ models for the SAR climate zone were MLPp, XGBoostp, and LightGBMp, and \n23\
    \ \nthe top three models for the SHZ climate zone were XGBoostp, MLPp, and LightGBMp.\
    \ In addition, \n24 \nthe prediction performance for daily ETo is found to be\
    \ highest in winter and lowest in summer in \n25 \nall three climate zones. Wspd\
    \ from public weather forecasts was the most important source of daily \n26 \n\
    ETo error in model predictions for the AR climate zone, followed by SDun, Tmax,\
    \ and Tmin, while \n27 \nSDun from public weather forecasts was the most important\
    \ source of daily ETo error in model \n28 \npredictions for the SAR (SHZ) climate\
    \ zone, followed by Wspd, Tmax, and Tmin (Tmax, Wspd, and \n29 \nTmin). \n30 \n\

    \ Tree-based \n32 \nassembly algorithms, Irrigation season \n33 \n \n34 \n1. Introduction\
    \ \n35 \nCrop water demand is the most important part of water transfer and energy\
    \ conversion in the \n36 \nsoil‒plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC), and it is an\
    \ important process in the field water cycle. \n37 \nAccurately estimating crop\
    \ water demand is the basis for designing crop irrigation systems, \n38 \ndetermining\
    \ regional irrigation water use, and facilitating effective basin planning, regional\
    \ water \n39 \nplanning, and drainage and irrigation project planning, design,\
    \ and management. However, directly \n40 \nmeasuring crop water demand is time-consuming\
    \ and expensive, significantly limiting practical \n41 \napplications (Irmak et\
    \ al., 2003; Martınez-Cob et al., 2015; Silva et al. 2019a; Fan et al., 2021a).\
    \ \n42 \nThus, crop water demand is usually measured using an indirect method,\
    \ i.e., reference \n43 \nevapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by the crop coefficient.\
    \ Predicting ETo is more valuable than \n44 \nestimating ETo (Yang et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang et al., 2019a), and accurate ETo prediction is the key to crop \n45 \n\

    \ prerequisite for real-time irrigation forecasting, which has \n46 \nimportant\
    \ reference value and significance for real-time irrigation decisions (Luo et\
    \ al., 2014; Perera \n47 \net al. 2014; Ballesteros et al., 2016). \n48 \nDepending\
    \ on the method and input data, ETo prediction methods can be divided into direct\
    \ and \n49 \nindirect methods (Perera et al., 2014). Since daily ETo data mainly\
    \ vary with weather and are only \n50 \ninfluenced by future weather variables,\
    \ direct methods that use long-term historical weather data to \n51 \npredict\
    \ ETo are not applicable to short-term daily ETo prediction. For indirect ETo\
    \ prediction \n52 \nmethods that use weather forecast data, numerical weather\
    \ forecasts that provide all the variables of \n53 \nthe Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization 56 Penman–Monteith (FAO 56 PM) equation have been used \n54 \n\
    in predicting daily ETo (Silva et al., 2010; Pelosi et al., 2016), and used in\
    \ predicting daily ETo with \n55 \na 1-10 day lead time (Perera et al. 2014; Medina\
    \ et al., 2018; Vanella et al., 2020). However, \n56 \nnumerical forecast products\
    \ in China are only available to professionals (e.g., registered users in \n57\
    \ \nacademia and research) and are not accessible to nonprofessionals. In addition,\
    \ these products \n58 \nrequire preprocessing (Fan et al., 2021b) or postprocessing\
    \ (Medina et al., 2020) by professionals \n59 \nto improve the reliability of\
    \ the output data. \n60 \nIn China, the China Weather Network, hosted by the Public\
    \ Meteorological Service Center of \n61 \nthe China Meteorological Administration,\
    \ is a public service-based meteorological portal for society \n62 \nand the public.\
    \ The China Weather Network covers more than 100,000 sites in provinces, cities,\
    \ \n63 \ntowns, and tourist attractions across the country and provides real-time\
    \ meteorological services, \n64 \nincluding weather forecasts, current conditions,\
    \ indices, air quality information, and many other \n65 \nelements, with a minimum\
    \ time resolution of 5 minutes and a maximum forecast time of 40 days. It \n66\
    \ \nalso provides user location-based forecasting services on mobile sites. Public\
    \ weather forecasts \n67 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ four variables: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind scale and weather\
    \ type. \n68 \nIn recent years, public weather forecasts have been widely used\
    \ in ETo forecasting. For example, \n69 \ninformation from public weather forecasts\
    \ has been converted into variables required to calculate \n70 \nETo using the\
    \ FAO-56 PM equation, and then used to forecast in daily ETo (Cai et al., 2007;\
    \ Cai et \n71 \nal., 2009), used to forecast daily ETo with a lead time of 1-3\
    \ days (Liu et al., 2020), and used to \n72 \nforecast daily ETo with a lead time\
    \ of 1-7 days (Yang et al., 2016). The results of these studies \n73 \nindicate\
    \ that the errors in daily ETo predicted with the variables transformed with information\
    \ from \n74 \npublic weather forecasts and the FAO 56 PM equation are mainly caused\
    \ by errors arising from the \n75 \nprocess of converting qualitative wind scale\
    \ and weather type information in public weather \n76 \nforecasts into wind speed\
    \ and sunshine hour information, respectively. \n77 \nThus, some studies have\
    \ included measured or precalculated variable data and public weather \n78 \n\
    forecast data as inputs for their models to predict daily ETo. An example of such\
    \ studies include \n79 \nusing temperature data from weather forecasts and actual\
    \ incident net solar radiation (Rs) values \n80 \noccurring in each advance period\
    \ and four artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms \n81 \n(generalized\
    \ feedforward (GFF), linear regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and \n\
    82 \nprobabilistic neural network (PNN)) to forecast ETo in Dallas, Texas, USA,\
    \ 1-15 days in advance \n83 \n(Traore et al., 2016). Additionally, temperature\
    \ data from public weather forecasts, measured \n84 \nsunshine hours, precalculated\
    \ weather type correction factors (Wt, only four weather type correction \n85\
    \ \nfactors, i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast and rainy, are defined) and a combined\
    \ model of bi-directional \n86 \nlong short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and ANN were\
    \ used to predict daily ETo 1-7 days ahead for \n87 \nthree stations in Ningxia,\
    \ China (Yin et al., 2020). However, since short-term daily ETo is mainly \n88\
    \ \ngoverned by weather conditions, introducing additional measured or precalculated\
    \ variable data as \n89 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ predict daily ETo may not be applicable for real-time irrigation decisions.\
    \ In addition, in \n90 \nthese studies, machine learning models were trained and\
    \ validated with long-term historical \n91 \nmeteorological data and tested with\
    \ public weather forecast data (with a maximum data duration of \n92 \n2 years).\
    \ Thus, the data sources in these studies were different (e.g., in China, the\
    \ source of historical \n93 \nmeteorological data is the National Meteorological\
    \ Information Center of China, while the source \n94 \nof public weather forecasts\
    \ is the Public Weather Service Center of the China Meteorological \n95 \nAdministration).\
    \ Moreover, there have been no comparison studies between training and validating\
    \ \n96 \nmachine learning models with historical meteorological data and public\
    \ weather forecast data. \n97 \nHowever, the use of samples from different data\
    \ sources may affect the daily ETo performance of \n98 \nmachine learning models.\
    \ \n99 \nIn recent years, three integrated learning models, extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), light \n100 \ngradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and gradient boosting\
    \ with categorical features support \n101 \n(CatBoost), based on a boosting algorithm\
    \ with a decision tree as the base learner and greedy ideas \n102 \nfor decision\
    \ tree growth, have been widely used to estimate daily ETo. Among them, CatBoost\
    \ can \n103 \ndirectly handle categorical data, such as public weather forecasts\
    \ of wind scale and weather type. \n104 \nFan et al. (2018) recommended using\
    \ the XGBoost and GBDT models with limited climate data to \n105 \npredict daily\
    \ ETo under different climatic conditions in China. Fan et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ \n106 \nLightGBM generally outperformed the other two soft computing models\
    \ and four empirical models \n107 \nin estimating daily ETo with data from 49\
    \ weather stations in humid subtropical China using local \n108 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and cross-station meteorological data. Zhou et al. (2020) strongly recommended\
    \ \n109 \nthe use of CatBoost and LightGBM models for estimating daily ETo under\
    \ different climatic \n110 \nconditions in China. Huang et al. (2019) showed that\
    \ the CatBoost algorithm has great potential for \n111 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    7 \n \ndaily ETo estimation in humid regions of China. Zhang et al. (2020) also\
    \ showed that CatBoost is \n112 \nconsidered the best choice for estimating ETo\
    \ in arid and semiarid regions of northern China. These \n113 \nstudies showed\
    \ that all three models estimated daily ETo with better accuracy and stability\
    \ than \n114 \nthose of other models. However, studies on the prediction of daily\
    \ ETo with these three models have \n115 \nnot been reported. The objectives of\
    \ this study are as follows: (1) to first develop four machine \n116 \nlearning\
    \ models using daily observed meteorological data and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a \n117 \n1-day lead time, respectively, and then to test and compare\
    \ the performance of the developed models \n118 \nin both cases using public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-7 day lead time; (2) to explore the use of \n119 \ncategorical\
    \ data (public weather forecasts of wind scale and weather type) as direct input\
    \ into \n120 \nCatBoost for daily ETo prediction; and (3) to compare the seasonal\
    \ variation in predicted daily ETo \n121 \nperformance of the five machine learning\
    \ models and recommend the best daily ETo prediction \n122 \nmodel for all four\
    \ seasons at nine stations in three different climates. \n123 \n2. Materials and\

    10 \n \nThe two main types of integrated learning algorithms are bagging-based\
    \ algorithms and \n166 \nboosting-based algorithms. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost\
    \ are improved implementations of \n167 \nthe GBDT algorithm and belong to the\
    \ boosting algorithm family. Among them, XGBoost was \n168 \nproposed by Chen\
    \ et al. (2016), and its official open source documentation is available at \n\
    169 \nhttp://xgboost.readthedocs.io. LightGBM was proposed by Ke et al. (2017),\
    \ and its official open \n170 \nsource documentation is available at http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io.\
    \ CatBoost was proposed by \n171 \nProkhorenkova et al. (2017), and its official\
    \ open source documentation is available at \n172 \nhttps://catboost.ai/en/docs/.\
    \ The base learners of all three algorithms are decision trees, but the tree \n\
    173 \nfeatures and the process of generation differ in many ways. For example,\
    \ XGBoost uses a levelwise \n174 \ndecision tree growth strategy, LightGBM uses\
    \ a leafwise decision tree growth strategy with depth \n175 \nrestrictions, and\
    \ CatBoost uses a fully symmetric decision tree as the base learner. \n176 \n\
    For categorical features, CatBoost only needs to declare the categorical signs\
    \ to enable direct \n177 \nfeature processing (Prokhorenkova et al. 2017; Dorogush\
    \ et al. 2018). LightGBM associates each \n178 \ncategorical feature fetch with\
    \ a bucket (bin) and thus automatically processes the features without \n179 \n\
    preprocessing using one-hot encoding. XGBoost cannot process the categorical features\
    \ directly. \n180 \nThis model is used after preprocessing the categorical features\
    \ by various encoding methods such \n181 \nas tag encoding, mean encoding, or\
    \ one-hot encoding. \n182 \nThe concept of deep learning was introduced by Hinton\
    \ et al. (2006). A multilayer perceptron \n183 \n(MLP) with multiple hidden layers\
    \ is a deep learning structure. MLP with one or two hidden layers \n184 \nhas\
    \ been successfully used for ETo estimation or prediction. Landeras et al. (2008)\
    \ used an artificial \n185 \nneural network (ANN) with 1 hidden layer to estimate\
    \ the daily ETo for Alava, Basque Country in \n186 \nnorthern Spain and obtained\
    \ better results than those from 10 locally calibrated empirical and \n187 \n\

    \ their variants. Ferreira et al. (2019) estimated daily ETo for all of \n188\
    \ \nBrazil using the first four days of data, and an ANN (model structure 16-50-50-1)\
    \ was the best \n189 \nchoice among temperature- and relative humidity-based models.\
    \ The ANN with two hidden layers \n190 \nused by Elbeltagi et al. (2022) is a\
    \ suitable alternative to estimate the daily ETo for the \n191 \nmeteorological\
    \ station in Debrecen, Hungary, based on limited meteorological data. Luo et al.\
    \ (2015) \n192 \nused an MLP with two hidden layers and public weather forecast\
    \ data with a 1-7 day lead time to \n193 \npredict the daily ETo for Gaoyou station\
    \ in Jiangsu Province, China, with acceptable prediction \n194 \nperformance.\
    \ Traore et al. (2016) showed that an MLP model with two hidden layers and a \n\
    195 \ncombination of Tmax, Tmin, and Rs inputs had the best ETo prediction performance\
    \ for Dallas, Texas, \n196 \nUSA. These studies used trial-and-error methods to\
    \ determine the numbers of hidden layers and \n197 \nneurons per hidden layer.\
    \ These methods are time-consuming and may not always yield the best \n198 \n\
    hyperparameters. In this study, an MLP with multiple hidden layers is compared\
    \ with three machine \n199 \nlearning models, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.\
    \ The MLP with multiple hidden layers is \n200 \nimplemented using Google's TensorFlow\
    \ deep learning framework. See Figure 2 for details. \n201 \n2.2.3. Input combinations\

    \ previous studies in China (Luo \n324 \net al., 2014 and 2015; Xiong et al.,\

    19 \n \nrespectively, and overestimated by 2.82% for SHZ (this is mainly due to\
    \ the poor forecasts of \n335 \nweather types at the XJ station, resulting in\
    \ an overestimation of 9.45% for this station). Finally, \n336 \nduring the model\
    \ testing period (2020-2021), the mean MAE, RMSE, R, and RM values for the 1-\n\

    \ 14.87% (SAR), and 3.86% (SHZ). \n339 \nThe SDun forecast performance decreased\
    \ with increasing forecasting period. This result is \n340 \nconsistent with results\
    \ of previous studies in China (Yang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b; Liu et\
    \ al., \n341 \n2020). The poor SDun prediction performance compared with that\
    \ of the temperature forecast may \n342 \nbe due to the large errors in the conversion\
    \ of weather types from public weather forecasts to SDun \n343 \n(Cai et al.,\
    \ 2007; Yang et al., 2016; Traore et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b; Liu et al.\

    \ RM values of the 1-day ahead Wspd \n345 \nduring the model training period (2014-2018)\

    \ respectively, and Wspd was overestimated by 81.56% (AR), 50.69% (SAR) \n347\
    \ \nand 89.01% (SHZ). During the model validation period (2019), the mean MAE,\
    \ RMSE, R and RM \n348 \nvalues of the 1-day ahead Wspd ranged from 2.77-2.84\
    \ m s-1, 3.51-3.75 m s-1, 0.13-0.15 and 1.65-\n349 \n2.39, respectively, and Wspd\
    \ was overestimated by 92.81% (AR), 65.38% (SAR) and 138.51% \n350 \n(SHZ). The\
    \ mean MAE, RMSE, R, and RM values of Wspd with a 1-7 day lead time ranged from\
    \ \n351 \n1.28-1.41 m s-1, 2.02-2.10 m s-1, 0.03-0.06, and 1.18-1.48, respectively,\
    \ for the three climate zones \n352 \nduring the model testing period (2020-2021),\
    \ and Wspd was overestimated by 47.53% (AR), 17.82% \n353 \n(SAR), and 36.86%\
    \ (SHZ). It can be seen that the worst predictions among the four variables of\
    \ the \n354 \npublic weather forecasts were those for Wspd, which may be caused\
    \ by the poor forecasting of wind \n355 \nscale in the public weather forecast\
    \ and the error in converting wind scale to wind speed (Cai et al., \n356 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    \ Consistent with previous \n569 \nfindings (Yang et al., 2019a), the results\
    \ indicate that the inclusion of SDun in the input \n570 \ncombinations improves\
    \ the performance of machine learning models in predicting daily ETo (Perera \n\

    615 \nThe performance metrics of four models developed based on daily observed\
    \ meteorological data \n616 \nand five models developed based on public weather\
    \ forecast data with a 1-day lead time to predict \n617 \ndaily ETo with a 1-7\
    \ day lead time for the three climate zones are shown in Figures 4 and 5. First,\
    \ \n618 \nthe daily ETo prediction performance of the nine models for the three\
    \ climate zones, AR, SAR, and \n619 \nSHZ, decreased with increasing lead time,\
    \ which is due to the decrease in forecast performance of \n620 \npublic weather\
    \ forecasting variables with increasing lead time, which is consistent with previous\
    \ \n621 \nstudies (Perera et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2014 and 2015; Traore et al.,\
    \ 2016; Yang et al., 2016, 2019a, \n622 \n2019b; Traore et al., 2017; Li et al.,\
    \ 2018; Yin et al., 2020). In addition, for all three climate zones, \n623 \n\
    the four models developed based on public weather forecast data with a 1-day lead\
    \ time to predict \n624 \ndaily ETo 1-7 days ahead outperformed the four models\
    \ developed based on daily observed \n625 \nmeteorological data with corresponding\
    \ input combinations (except for the 1-day ahead prediction \n626 \nperformance\
    \ of MLPp, XGBoostp, and CatBoost1p for the SHZ climate zone). Second, the RM\
    \ \n627 \nvalues of the nine models for the AR climate zone varied in the range\
    \ of 0.92-1.07. Three models, \n628 \nMLPp, XGBoostp and LightGBMo, slightly overestimated\
    \ (2.90%-6.58%) the daily ETo, while \n629 \nLightGBMp, CatBoost1p, CatBoost2,\
    \ MLPo, XGBoosto and CatBoost1o slightly underestimated \n630 \n(2.69%-7.71%)\
    \ the daily ETo. The RM values for the nine models varied in the range of 0.90-1.00\

    \ ahead, and MLPo, \n633 \nwhich slightly overestimated (0.02%) the daily ETo\
    \ 7-days ahead. The RM values for the 9 models \n634 \nvaried in the range of\
    \ 0.90-1.02 for the SHZ climate zone. MLPp slightly overestimated (0.13%-\n635\
    \ \n1.64%) the daily ETo, and all other models slightly underestimated (0.02%-9.94%)\
    \ the daily ETo. \n636 \nTable 17 shows the 1-7 day ahead ETo prediction performance\
    \ comparison utilizing the best \n637 \ninput combinations in the testing period\
    \ for the four models developed based on daily observed \n638 \nmeteorological\
    \ data and the five models developed based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-\n639 \nday lead time for the three climate zones. Overall, for all three\
    \ climate zones, the four models \n640 \ndeveloped based on 1-day ahead public\
    \ weather forecast data generally outperformed the four \n641 \nmodels developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data with corresponding input \n642 \n\
    combinations for all metrics. In addition, the prediction performance of all models\
    \ exhibited a \n643 \ndecrease in the following order for the three climate zones:\
    \ AR, SHZ, and SAR. This result is mainly \n644 \nbecause the prediction performance\
    \ of models developed based on public weather forecasts for the \n645 \nAR climate\
    \ zone is better than that for the SAR and SHZ climate zones. For the AR climate\

    \ five models developed based on public weather forecast \n684 \ndata with a 1-day\
    \ lead time to predict daily ETo \n685 \nIrrigated areas in the studied sites\
    \ have different field irrigation seasons according to crop type \n686 \nand location\
    \ (Perera et al., 2014). In addition, the sensitivity of weather variables varies\
    \ with season \n687 \nand the microclimate of the studied site location (Vanella\
    \ et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a strong \n688 \nneed to evaluate the seasonality\
    \ of the ETo forecast performance. Tables 18-20 show the mean \n689 \nstatistics\
    \ of the performance indicators for the 1-7 day lead time ETo forecasts using\
    \ the five models \n690 \ndeveloped based on public weather forecast data with\
    \ a 1-day lead time for the three climatic zones \n691 \nfor all seasons of 2020-2021.\
    \ First, during all four seasons, the daily ETo prediction performance of \n692\
    \ \nall five models was better in the AR climate zone than in the SAR and SHZ\
    \ climate zones (excluding \n693 \nCatBoost2 in the spring and MLP in the fall\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, and all five models in the \n694 \nwinter in the SHZ\
    \ climate zone). This is mainly because the prediction performance of models using\
    \ \n695 \nthe public weather forecast variables in the AR climate zone outperform\
    \ those in the SAR and SHZ \n696 \nclimate zones overall. \n697 \nSecond, the\
    \ order of the seasonal MAE and RMSE values for daily ETo prediction using the\
    \ five \n698 \nmodels in the AR climate zone are as follows: winter, spring, fall,\
    \ and summer. In addition, the \n699 \nseasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ are lower than the annual average, except for the \n700 \nMLPp and LightGBMp\
    \ models for station TX in the SAR climate zone and the MLPp and XGBoost \n701\
    \ \nmodels for station XJ in the SHZ climate zone. The order of the seasonal MAE\
    \ and RMSE values \n702 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ the other three models in the SAR and SHZ climate zones are as follows: winter,\
    \ fall, spring, \n703 \nand summer. The seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter\
    \ and fall in the SAR climate zone \n704 \nare lower than the annual average,\
    \ and the seasonal MAE and RMSE values during winter in the \n705 \nSHZ climate\
    \ zone are lower than the annual average. These results are consistent with results\
    \ in \n706 \nprevious studies (Perera et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Fan et\
    \ al., 2021b). The seasonal R values of \n707 \nETo for all model prediction days\
    \ in all three climate zones were lower than the annual average, \n708 \nwith\
    \ the smallest R values observed during summer. The maximum seasonal R values\
    \ in the AR \n709 \nclimate zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp, LightGBMp, and\
    \ CatBoost1p) and fall (MLPp and \n710 \nCatBoost2), those in the SAR climate\
    \ zone occurred in spring (XGBoostp and LightGBMp) and fall \n711 \n(MLPp, CatBoost1p,\
    \ and CatBoost2), and those for the SHZ climate zone occurred in spring \n712\
    \ \n(XGBoostp) and fall (MLPp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p, and CatBoost2). The seasonal\
    \ RM values \n713 \nof daily ETo prediction using the five machine learning models\
    \ in the three climate zones were less \n714 \nthan 1 in spring and summer and\
    \ greater than 1 in fall and winter, indicating that daily ETo was \n715 \nunderestimated\
    \ in spring and summer (except for XGBoostp in summer in the AR climate zone,\
    \ \n716 \nwhich was overestimated by 2.93%) and overestimated in fall and winter\
    \ (except for CatBoost1p in \n717 \nwinter in the SHZ climate zone and CatBoost2,\
    \ which were underestimated by 7.75% and 2.05%, \n718 \nrespectively). \n719 \n\
    Finally, when considering all the metrics, for the AR climate zone, XGBoostp,\
    \ MLPp, CatBoost2, \n720 \nand LightGBMp showed the best performance in predicting\
    \ 1-7 day ahead seasonal ET values \n721 \nduring spring, summer, fall, and winter,\
    \ respectively, with MLPp (spring), XGBoostp (summer), \n722 \nLightGBMp (fall),\
    \ and CatBoost2 (winter) being the second best performers. For the SAR climate\
    \ \n723 \nzone, LightGBMp, MLPp, CatBoost1p and CatBoost2 showed the best performance\
    \ in predicting \n724 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ \n751 \nFor all three climate zones, the performance of the four models developed\
    \ based on public \n752 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day lead time was better\
    \ than the performance of the four models \n753 \ndeveloped based on daily observed\

    \ forecast variables that cause daily ETo forecast errors, the models developed\
    \ based on daily \n755 \nobserved meteorological data were chosen to evaluate\
    \ the impact of weather variables from public \n756 \nweather forecasts on the\
    \ daily ETo forecasting performance. In this study, each of the four observed\
    \ \n757 \nweather variables (Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd) was replaced in sequence\
    \ with their corresponding \n758 \nforecast values with a 1-7 day lead time. This\
    \ allowed for the identification of cases where a large \n759 \nchange in the\

    \ by Tmax, Tmin, SDun, and Wspd in the public \n762 \nweather forecast 1-7 days\

    \ are shown in Tables 21-\n768 \n23. \n769 \nFirst, for all models (except the\
    \ LightGBM model at station ZW and the CatBoost1 model at \n770 \nstation HN),\
    \ the contribution of the public weather forecast variables to the error in the\
    \ predicted \n771 \ndaily ETo decreased in the order of Wspd, SDun, Tmax, and\
    \ Tmin for the AR (arid zone) climate zone,  \n772 \nwhich is consistent with\
    \ previous findings (Yang et al. 2016). Second, for all models (except the \n\
    773 \nMLP model at station YAC, the CatBoost1 model at station TX, the MLP model\
    \ at station XJ, the \n774 \nXGBoost model, and the LightGBM model), the contributions\
    \ of the public weather forecast \n775 \nvariables to the errors in the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, Wspd, Tmax, and \n776 \nTmin and SDun,\
    \ Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin for the SAR (semiarid) and SHZ (semihumid zone) climate\

    \ \n779 \nThese results indicate that for the study sites in the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the main source \n780 \nof error in daily ETo prediction is Wspd\

    \ the weather type of public weather forecasts contributes the most to the predicted\
    \ \n783 \ndaily ETo errors. First, the spatial variability of Wspd and DSun (Rs)\
    \ due to the topography, elevation, \n784 \ndistance, and cloudiness of the location\
    \ of the study site (Yuan et al., 2015; Fick and Hijmasn, 2017; \n785 \nLi and\
    \ Zha, 2018; Fan et al., 2021b) makes Wspd and DSun (Rs) the most difficult parameters\
    \ to \n786 \nforecast accurately (Yang et al., 2016, Ballesteros et al., 2016);\
    \ second, according to Cai et al. (2007), \n787 \nit is appropriate to estimate\
    \ Wspd from wind scale predicted by public weather forecasts, but this \n788 \n\
    estimation error is larger for arid regions with a high range of wind speed values.\
    \ George et al. (1985) \n789 \nreported that the largest difference between predicted\
    \ and measured reference crop \n790 \nevapotranspiration came from erroneous predictions\
    \ of mean wind speed. Li and Beswick (2005) \n791 \nalso reported that wind speed\
    \ is a more serious source of error than solar radiation in estimating ETo. \n\
    792 \nIn a study by Popova et al. (2005), it was noted that the effect of wind\
    \ speed on ETo results was \n793 \nrelatively small except in arid and windy areas.\
    \ \n794 \nAs shown in Table 3, SDun was estimated using the sunshine hour coefficients\
    \ derived from the \n795 \n2004 measured solar radiation data from Daxing District,\
    \ Beijing, using Equation (3). It was found \n796 \nthat applying the sunshine\
    \ hour coefficients derived from one region to other regions with different \n\
    797 \nclimate types will result in different degrees of error due to the climatic\
    \ differences between regions. \n798 \nPerera et al. (2014) found that the largest\
    \ source of error between predicted and observed ETo is the \n799 \npredictive\
    \ performance of daily incoming solar radiation, followed by air temperature,\
    \ dew point \n800 \ntemperature, and wind speed for all advanced periods. Pelosi\
    \ et al. (2016) indicated that the solar \n801 \nradiation forecast error has\
    \ the greatest impact on the ETo forecast performance, followed by relative \n\
    802 \nhumidity and wind speed. The results of Medina et al. (2018) also indicated\
    \ that the errors in solar \n803 \nradiation forecasts have the greatest impact\
    \ on ETo forecasts, followed by errors in wind forecasts. \n804 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    52 \n \nIn this study, public weather forecasts with a 1-7 day lead time were\
    \ used to compare the \n829 \nperformance of five models developed based on public\
    \ weather forecast data with a 1-day lead time \n830 \nand four models developed\
    \ based on daily observed meteorological data in predicting daily ETo at \n831\
    \ \nnine stations in three climatic regions of Ningxia, China. The forecast performance\
    \ of weather \n832 \nvariables in public weather forecasting (2014-2021) and daily\
    \ ETo predicted by these nine models \n833 \nwere analysed and evaluated on a\
    \ daily scale, and the forecast performance of the weather variables \n834 \n\
    in the public weather forecast (2020-2021) and daily ETo predicted by the five\
    \ models developed \n835 \nbased on the public weather forecast with a 1-day lead\
    \ time were analysed and evaluated in terms \n836 \nof seasonality. The optimal\
    \ input combination for each machine learning model was determined, \n837 \nand\
    \ the weather forecast variables contributing to the error in the model predicted\
    \ daily ETo were \n838 \nidentified. The main conclusions of this study are as\
    \ follows: \n839 \nFirst, for the three climate zones, the performance of the\
    \ four models developed based on public \n840 \nweather forecast data with a 1-day\
    \ lead time was better than that of the four models developed based \n841 \non\
    \ daily observation meteorological data with corresponding input combinations.\
    \ When category \n842 \ndata such as wind scale (WS) and weather type (WT1 and\
    \ WT2) were added directly to the input \n843 \ncombinations of the CatBoost2\
    \ model, the performance of this model in predicting daily ETo was \n844 \nlower\
    \ than that of the CatBoost1p model in the testing period; that is, the performance\
    \ of the \n845 \nCatBoost2 model in terms of predicting daily ETo did not improve\
    \ during the testing period. \n846 \nSecond, the performance of the five models,\
    \ MLPp, XGBoostp, LightGBMp, CatBoost1p and \n847 \nCatBoost2, in terms of daily\
    \ ETo prediction, was highest in winter and the lowest in summer for all \n848\
    \ \nthree climate zones. In terms of predicting daily ETo with a 1-7 day lead\
    \ time in all seasons, \n849 \nXGBoostp with C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input,\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input and LightGBMp \n850 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    53 \n \nwith C1 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ fall and winter in the AR \n851 \nclimate zone, respectively. LightGBMp with\
    \ C2 as input, MLPp with C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n852 \nC3 as input and\
    \ CatBoost2 with C8 as input are recommended as the best models for spring, summer,\
    \ \n853 \nfall and winter in the SAR climate zone, respectively. XGBoostp with\
    \ C4 as input, CatBoost1p with \n854 \nC3 as input and LightGBMp with C1 as input\
    \ are recommended as the best models for spring and \n855 \nsummer, fall and winter\
    \ in the SHZ climate zone, respectively. \n856 \nFinally, for the AR climate zone\
    \ (arid zone), the contribution of the weather variables in the \n857 \npublic\
    \ weather forecast to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order\
    \ of Wspd, SDun, \n858 \nTmax, and Tmin; for the SAR climate zone (semiarid zone),\
    \ the contribution of the weather variables \n859 \nin the public weather forecast\
    \ to the error in the predicted daily ETo decreased in the order of SDun, \n860\
    \ \nWspd, Tmax, and Tmin; and for the SHZ climate zone (semihumid zone), the contribution\
    \ of the \n861 \nweather variables in the public weather forecast to the predicted\
    \ daily ETo decreased in the order of \n862 \nSDun, Tmax, Wspd, and Tmin. \n863\
    \ \nIn addition, in terms of the daily scale performance of weather variables\
    \ in public weather \n864 \nforecasts, the forecast performance follows a decreasing\
    \ order of Tmin>Tmax>SDun>Wspd. In the \n865 \nseasonal analysis (2020-2021) of\
    \ the weather variable forecast performance for three climate zones, \n866 \n\
    the average performance for Tmax is in the order of summer (fall) > fall (summer)\
    \ > winter > spring. \n867 \nFor Tmin, the order is fall (summer) > summer (fall)\
    \ > winter (spring) > spring (winter), and for \n868 \nSDun, the order is winter\
    \ > spring > fall > summer. Thus, the average performance of the forecasts \n\
    869 \ndecreases sequentially. \n870 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-158\n\

    Reclamation suitability evaluation is the basis for determining the reuse direction
    of damaged land. Most scholars’ studies have focused on the improvement and innovation
    of evaluation models and methods, while the analysis of restrictive factors is
    rarely involved. This paper evaluates the reclamation suitability of damaged land
    around Longchi coal mine by the integrated index method and the analysis of restrictive
    factors is carried out by the difference-product method. The result shows damaged
    land around the Longchi coal mine is most suitable for being reclaimed as woodland.
    The main restrictive factors are the degree of contamination of the soil and water
    and the irrigation conditions. This study provides a basis for the rational reutilization
    and improvement options of damaged land around Long Chi coal mine. The study also
    verifies that the combination of the integrated index method and the difference-product

    2020 Introduction Mineral resources exploitation plays an important role in promoting
    economic development, but it also causes enormous damage to the land (Zipper et
    al. 2011). In the USA alone, from 1930 to 2000, coal mining altered 2.5 million
    ha of natural landscape, most of that land originally being forested landscapes
    (MacDonald et al. 2015; Ali et al. 2017). According to the Queensland Resources
    Council, there will be as much as 120,000 ha of land disturbed from mining by
    2020 in central Queensland, Australia (Slezak and Robertson 2016; Khan et al.
    2017). Estimates of the amount of land damaged by coal mining in China are as
    high as 1 million ha in 2012 (Hu 2009; Hashemi 2017). Such damage exacerbates
    the conflict between human activity and preservation of land (Wang et al. 2013;
    Ye 2012; Hamad et al. 2017). Land reclamation is an effective way to alleviating
    this contradiction. And suitability evaluation is the foundation and prerequisite
    of land reclamation. It provides the basis for decision-making regarding the reutilization
    direction of reclaimed land, the selection of improvement measures, and land use
    planning (Bagherzadeh and Daneshvar 2014; Qu et al. 2013; Cheng et al. 2017; Song
    2014; Adugna and Alemu 2017). Scholars carried out a number of fruitful explorations
    and studies in this field. H Soltanmohammadi used the ELECTRE (Elimination Et
    Choix Traduisant la Realite) method combined with the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy
    Process) to evaluate the reclamation suitability of damaged land for farmland,
    forestry land, and industrial land (Soltanmohammadi et al. 2008). S. M. Moosavirad
    proposed an improved method based on the limit conditions method, the index sum
    method, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, and the Artificial Neural Networks
    method and applied it to the Gol-e-Gohar Iron Ore Mine of Sirjan, Kerman, Iran
    (Moosavirad and Behnia 2017). Zhang Zizhao constructed two mixed models using
    Q clustering analysis, Bayes discriminant analysis, Fisher discriminant analysis,
    and resubstitution analysis and applied them to evaluate the reclamation suitability
    of damaged land for grassland (Zhang et al. 2015, 2016). Ma Cong’an designed an
    expert system that can provide a reclamation suitability evaluation for opencast
    mines according to different types of mined sites based on C Language Integrated
    Production System (Ma et al. 2006). Chen Qiujing evaluated the suitability of
    damaged mined land using an evaluation model based on the extension method (Chen
    et al. 2006; Shahidah et al. 2017). However, most scholars’ studies have focused
    on the improvement and innovation of evaluation models and methods, and the analysis
    of restrictive factors is rarely involved, while the analysis of restrictive factors
    is an important basis for the selection of improvement measures for the land (Farasat
    et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2015). Taking the Longchi coal mine of Yunnan province
    in China as an example, this paper evaluates the reclamation suitability of the
    damaged mined land by a two-stage evaluation system which not only gives the result
    of suitable reclamation direction but also points out the factors restricting
    the degree of suitability, using the integrated index method and the difference-product
    method. The purpose is to provide theoretical support for damaged land reclamation
    decision-making and improvement options. Material and methods General situation
    of study area and data sources The Longchi coal mine is located in the northwest
    part of Luoping County, Yunnan Province (Fig. 1). It has a typical subtropical
    plateau mountain monsoon climate with abundant rainfall. The main soil types are
    red soil and yellow soil. The loam thickness is between 0.5 and 1.5 m, and the
    organic matter content is approximately 2.8% with high natural fertility. The
    main crops are rice, wheat, corn, etc. Fig. 1 Location map of Longchi coal mine
    and the study area Full size image The total area of damaged land is 500.60 hm2,
    of which the area containing mining production facilities and mine buildings is
    2.95 hm2, the dump and tailing pond area is 0.10 hm2, and the ground subsidence
    area is 497.65 hm2. The research area of this paper includes mainly the dump area,
    tailing pond area, and ground subsidence area, which comprise a total area of
    497.75 hm2. The geologic, geomorphic, hydrologic, and economic data are obtained
    from the department of land and resources of Luoping County, the water conservancy
    department, the agriculture and forestry department, the meteorological department,
    and Luoping County’s statistical yearbook for the preceding 3 years. The land
    damage data are obtained mainly through forecasting using subsidence prediction
    software and on-the-spot investigation. The data were imported into ArcGIS 10.2,
    the coordinates of the projection were unified, the data were adjusted to the
    correct position by the spatial correction toolbar, and the score for each evaluation
    unit was obtained by the overlay analysis, distance analysis, and attribute analysis
    features of ArcToolbox. Finally, based on the evaluation criteria of suitability
    for arable land, woodland, and grassland, the research area was divided into four
    levels—the highly suitable area, the generally suitable area, the barely suitable
    area, and the inappropriate area—using the natural discontinuity classification
    method. Construction of evaluation index system and determination of weights The
    characteristics of damaged mined land were taken into account, and the paired
    comparison method was used to select the evaluation indexes for the arable land,
    woodland, and grassland reclamation directions. After consulting with experts
    in land reclamation, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and land management,
    nine independent and complementary indexes were selected, including percentage
    of organic matter in the soil, degree of damage to the land, management radius
    of arable land, irrigation conditions, drainage conditions, present land use status,
    altitude, surface slope, and degree of pollution of the soil and water. The quantitative
    criteria of the indexes are determined by referring to the technology standards
    of land suitability evaluation, land reclamation, and the related literature (Table
    1). Table 1 Scoring criteria of reclamation suitability evaluation indexes of
    damaged land around Longchi coal mine Full size table The weights of the evaluation
    indexes were the average values calculated according to the judgment matrices
    set by experts in each evaluation direction (Table 2). Table 2 Weights of reclamation
    suitability evaluation indexes of damaged land around Longchi coal mine Full size
    table Division of evaluation units At present, the commonly used suitability evaluation
    units are soil types, land resource types, polygons in the present land use status
    map, the administrative management unit, the grid unit, and the homogeneous unit
    formed by the multi-factor superposition method (Qu et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2015;
    Yang 2016; Zhang et al. 2010; Qian et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2016; Cai et al. 2011).
    Due to the nature of mining, it is common to use the homogeneous unit formed by
    the multi-factor superposition method. In this paper, the maps of the soil organic
    matter percentage, the irrigation conditions, the present land use status, the
    degree of damage, the surface slope, the drainage conditions, the management radius
    of the cultivated land, etc., were superposed. Although the evaluation units obtained
    by the multi-factor superposition method are homogeneous, the areas of parts of
    the evaluation units are small and have no physical meaning. Therefore, the homogeneous
    units with smaller areas are merged into the most similar units based on the Euclidean
    distance between the evaluation units. Finally, 124 units suitable for land suitability
    evaluation were obtained. The internal properties of the evaluation units are
    relatively homogeneous or similar, and each unit is different and comparable,
    which can objectively reflect the difference of the land in a certain period and
    space. The scores of the units after merging were calculated according to Eq.
    (1). $$ F=\frac{F_i\times {S}_i+{F}_j\times {S}_j}{S_1+{S}_j} $$ (1) where F is
    the total score of the unit after merging; Fi and Fj are the total score of evaluation
    units i and j, respectively, before merging; and Si and Sj are areas of evaluation
    units i and j, respectively, before merging. Evaluation model Comprehensive analysis
    of the evaluation indexes shows no prominent restrictive factors and no obvious
    correlation between the evaluation indexes; therefore, the integrated index method
    can be used for evaluation because it takes full account of the importance of
    each index and quantifies the indexes (Li et al. 2013; Afzal and Rizwan 2017).
    The total score of each evaluation unit is calculated according to Eq. (2). Then,
    the degree of suitability for each evaluation direction of the research area can
    be appraised. $$ {F}_{ik}=\sum \limits_{j=1}^n{a}_{ik t}{b}_{ik t} $$ (2) where,
    Fik is the total score of evaluation unit ἰ for evaluation direction ḳ, aἰkt is
    the score of index t of evaluation unit ἰ for evaluation direction ḳ, and bἰkt
    is the weight of index t of evaluation unit ἰ for evaluation direction ḳ. Analysis
    method of restrictive factors of barely suitable area and inappropriate area The
    degree of suitability for each reclamation direction is the result of the interaction
    of the participating evaluation factors. The inappropriateness of the barely suitable
    areas and the inappropriate areas is due mainly to one or more factors that are
    not suitable for the evaluation direction, which are called the main restrictive
    factors. In this paper, the difference-product method, which takes the score and
    importance of each factor into account, is used to analyze the restrictive factors
    of the barely suitable areas and inappropriate areas. The factor with the smallest
    relative value is often seen as the main restrictive factor of the evaluation
    unit, and Eq. (3) is as follows (Liu et al. 2016): $$ {S}_{ikt}=\left({a}_{ikt}-\overline
    {F_k}\right)\times {b}_{ikt} $$ (3) where \( \overline {F_k} \) is the minimum
    score value among all the evaluation units of the generally suitable area for
    evaluation direction k, and Sἰkt is the relative score value of index t of unit
    ἰ for direction k compared with \( \overline {F_k} \). To facilitate the statistical
    analysis, the total relative score values of the participating evaluation factors
    for barely suitable areas and inappropriate areas were calculated by Eq. (4),
    and the factors with a total score less than − 1 were selected as the main restrictive
    factors of the area. $$ {Z}_{kt}=\frac{\sum \limits_{i=0}^n\left({q}_i\times {S}_{ikt}\right)}{\sum
    \limits_{i=0}^n{q}_i} $$ (4) where Zkt is the total relative score value of index
    t for evaluation direction k, and qi is the area of evaluation unit ἰ. Results
    and analyses Analyses of the suitable reclamation direction Figure 2a–c and Table
    3 are the spatial distribution map and statistical results of suitability grades
    of damaged land reclaimed to arable land, woodland, and grassland around the Longchi
    coal mine. The score ranges of highly suitable areas, generally suitable areas,
    barely suitable areas and inappropriate areas in each evaluation direction are
    not the same. The values of the score ranges in the woodland evaluation direction
    are the highest, followed by the score ranges of arable land, and the score ranges
    in the grassland evaluation direction are lowest. The proportions of highly suitable
    area and generally suitable area in the woodland evaluation direction are greater
    than those of arable land and grassland. In contrast, the proportion of the inappropriate
    area in the woodland evaluation direction is smaller than that of arable land
    and grassland, and that of the grassland evaluation direction is the largest.
    The proportion of the barely suitable area in the woodland evaluation direction
    is the greatest, while the proportion of the inappropriate areas in the arable
    land and grassland evaluation direction is the greatest. Fig. 2 Spatial distribution

    land around the Longchi coal mine Full size table Analyses of suitable grades
    in each evaluation direction Figure 3 is the distribution map of the evaluation
    units’ scores. For the same evaluation unit, the suitability score for woodland
    is higher than that for arable land and grassland, and the suitability score for
    grassland is the lowest. Crops, trees, and grass have different requirements in
    terms of natural factors and environmental conditions, which are the main reasons
    that the same evaluation unit has different scores for different evaluation directions
    (Cai and Zhang 2015; Sun et al. 2014; Gao and Zhang 2015). Woodland has a higher
    ecological ability to fix water and nutrition and resist natural disasters, and
    it has strong adaptability (Zhang et al. 2017). Arable land is an artificial ecosystem
    with strong human participation enhancing the ability to obtain nutrition and
    resist natural disasters (Zhang et al. 2014). Fig. 3 The distribution map of the
    evaluation units’ scores for the Longchi coal mine Full size image Analyses of
    the impact of degree of damage to the land on each evaluation direction The degree
    of damage of mined land greatly restricts its reclamation direction. Table 4 shows
    the total relative score values of the degree of damage for each evaluation direction,
    as calculated by Eq. (4). It can be seen that the relative score values of the
    degree of damage are relatively small and have obvious restrictions in the barely
    suitable areas and inappropriate areas of arable land and grassland but have no
    obvious restrictions in the corresponding areas of woodland. Studies have shown
    that woodland has a far better effect on damaged land than grassland and arable
    land (Wang et al. 2012; Peng et al. 2005). From the microscopic view, the effect
    of woodland is significantly higher than that of grassland and arable land in
    the restoration of damaged soil configurations; the decrease in pH; and the increase
    in soil bulk density, porosity, and saturated water content. From the macroscopic
    view, woodland plays an important role in ecological security, biodiversity conservation,
    and sustainable economic and social development. Table 4 Total relative score
    values of the degree of damage to the land for the barely suitable areas and inappropriate
    areas of arable land, woodland, and grassland Full size table In conclusion, the
    inappropriate area for woodland around the Longchi coal mine is the smallest.
    The woodland evaluation direction has the highest score ranges for each evaluation
    unit, and the factor of the degree of damage, which reflects the characteristics
    of mined land, has no obvious restrictions for the barely suitable area and inappropriate
    area of woodland. Therefore, the damaged land around the Longchi coal mine is
    most suitable for reclamation as woodland. Analyses of restrictive factors of
    the inappropriate area and barely suitable area in the woodland evaluation direction
    Table 5 shows that the two main restrictive factors of the barely suitable area
    in the woodland evaluation direction are the degree of pollution of the soil and
    water and irrigation conditions. Combined with Fig. 4, it can be seen that the
    relative score value of the degree of pollution of the soil and water in unit
    FID 31 is − 7.2, and that value at all other units is − 1.80. The total relative
    score value of the degree of pollution of the soil and water is − 1.81. The total
    relative score value of the irrigation conditions is − 1.06, but the value varies
    greatly among FID units. In addition, irrigation condition is not a restrictive
    factor in some evaluation units. In evaluation unit FID 21, the relative value
    of the present land use status is − 4.8, indicating that the present land use
    status is an obvious restrictive factor. Table 5 Total relative score values of
    the evaluation indexes of barely suitable area and inappropriate area for woodland
    Full size table Fig. 4 The spatial distribution map of the barely suitable area
    and the relative score values of the evaluation indexes for the woodland evaluation
    direction Full size image As shown in Table 5, the three total relative values
    of the surface slope, irrigation conditions, and degree of pollution of the soil
    and water in the inappropriate area for the woodland evaluation direction are
    − 1.85, − 2.14, and − 1.77, respectively, so they are the main restrictive factors.
    As shown in Fig. 5, the relative value of the degree of pollution of the soil
    and water is − 7.2 at evaluation unit FID 15, and the other evaluation units’
    value is − 1.80. The relative value of the surface slope is − 2.6 at most of the
    evaluation units, with the exception of units FID 0–3, 9, and 16. The relative
    values of the irrigation conditions at evaluation units FID 0 and 15 are 0, and
    all the other evaluation units’ values are − 1.8. In evaluation unit FID 0, the
    relative value of the present land use status is − 4.8, with obvious restrictions.
    Fig. 5 The spatial distribution map of the inappropriate area and the relative
    score values of the evaluation indexes for the woodland evaluation direction Full
    size image Discussions Evaluation index system The selection of evaluation indexes
    plays a decisive role for the suitability evaluation of land reclamation and must
    be considered emphatically. This paper constructs the index system from three
    angles of land quality, infrastructure conditions, and the difficulty degree to
    apply reclamation technology. This is consistent with the study of most scholars
    (Zhang et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016). The percentages of organic matter in soil,
    surface slope, and altitude are the indexes selected from the angle of land quality.
    They are important in reflecting soil conditions and terrain conditions needed
    by the growth of vegetation. Degree of pollution of soil and water and present
    land use status are the key indicators of sustainable land utilization. Infrastructure
    conditions mainly refer to irrigation and drainage conditions. Rational use of
    limited water resources and real-time irrigation and drainage according to the
    living habits and growth rule of vegetation is an important guarantee for the
    healthy growth of vegetation (Yang et al. 2010). Degree of damage to the land
    is the key indicator to reflect the difficulty degree to apply reclamation technology
    and the important basis for determining the compensation liability of land damage.
    The damage easily leads to the loss of soil moisture and soil fertility, damage
    of land structure, a large area of stagnant water, etc. It seriously restricts
    the growth of vegetation (Wang and Liu 2015). In addition, the index of management
    radius is selected for the evaluation direction of cultivated land, this is because
    participation of human being is the basis for the development of field production,
    and related research indicates that the degree of participation of human beings
    for different distances varies (Liu et al. 2014). Evaluation method Suitability
    evaluation is a complex process that involves many factors, and the integrated
    index method illustrates the relations of cause and result abstractly from the
    angle of supply and demand under the circumstance of no obvious restrictive factors
    which makes the complex process simple; therefore, it has been widely used in
    the suitability evaluation of land (Feng et al. 2017; He et al. 2012). The limiting
    factor is the nature of the land which exerts adverse effects on the utilization
    potential of the land. At present, there is no research on the analysis of limiting
    factors in the field of land evaluation. After determining the appropriate grade
    of the land by the integrated index method, this paper attempts to use the difference-product
    method to carry out the analysis of limiting factors. The evaluation process shows
    that the difference-product method has good numerical properties and has good
    connection with the method of integrated index method. It can make quantitative
    reverse analysis of the degree of good or bad effect of each index on the suitability
    of damaged land and make visual analysis of evaluation results combined with images.
    Evaluation results The research result of this paper indicates that damaged land
    around Longchi coal mine are most suitable for reclamation as woodland. Ecological
    condition of damaged land is very fragile, and woodland has many ecological functions
    of conservation of water and soil, windbreak and sand fixation which can easily
    restore the damaged land to the most beneficial use and realize the restoration
    of the structure and function of ecology system such as succession of plant, biodiversity,
    self-sustainability of organisms, etc. Therefore, under the same conditions, the
    suitability degree of damaged land reclaimed as woodland is the highest. Lv Gang’s
    study on the restoration of the vegetation in the dump of Haizhou opencast coal
    mine also showed that woodland was more remarkable than cultivated land and grassland
    for ecological restoration (Lv et al. 2017; Mi et al. 2016; Fu and Liu 2017).
    However, the suitability of damaged land around Longchi coal mine for trees, shrubs,
    or a single species remains to be further discussed. The analysis of restrictive
    factors by difference-product method indicates that degree of pollution of soil
    and water and irrigation conditions are the two main restrictive factors for the
    evaluation direction of woodland. Organisms in soil has the function of fixing
    nitrogen, improving soil configuration, decomposing organic matter, and regulating
    plant growth, while pollution of soil and water easily induce the death of organisms
    sensitive to soil environment (Sun and Li 2014). Zhou cuifan summarized research
    on the hazards of heavy metal pollution in woodlands and find that microbial communities
    in contaminated woodland are scarce (Zhou et al. 2015). Li Bingwen’s study shows
    that irrigation has a significant effect on the survival and growth of woodland
    seedlings (Li et al. 2011). In early stage of tree cultivation, the root system
    is not developed. Its survival rate mainly depends on natural precipitation or
    artificial irrigation. Natural precipitation is seasonal and uncertain. Reasonable
    irrigation at early stage of tree planting can increase survival rate and increase
    the length and density of fine root (Jia et al. 2013). However, it is still necessary
    to further discuss how to reduce the degree of pollution of soil and water and
    improve the irrigation conditions. Conclusions This study conducted a suitability
    evaluation of damaged land around the Longchi coal mine for reclamation as arable
    land, woodland, and grassland and analyzed restrictive factors using the integrated
    index method and the difference-product method based on GIS spatial analysis software.
    The results show that the values of the score ranges of the evaluation indexes
    for the woodland evaluation direction are higher than those for the arable land
    or grassland evaluation direction. In the woodland evaluation direction, the proportions
    of highly suitable area and generally suitable area are larger than those in the
    arable land and grassland evaluation directions. In the same evaluation units,
    the score for the woodland evaluation direction is higher than that for the grassland
    and arable land evaluation directions. Meanwhile, degree of damage is not a restrictive
    factor for the barely suitable area and inappropriate area of woodland. Therefore,
    damaged land around the Longchi coal mine is most suitable for reclamation as
    woodland. The main restrictive factors of the barely suitable area for woodland
    are the degree of contamination of the soil and water and the irrigation conditions,
    and those of the inappropriate area are the degree of contamination of the soil
    and water, the irrigation conditions and the surface slope. The degree of suitability
    of the barely suitable areas and inappropriate areas can be improved by reducing
    the degree of contamination of the soil and water and improving the irrigation
    conditions for this direction. This study provides a basis for the rational reutilization
    of damaged land around Long Chi coal mine. The research of this paper also verifies
    that the integrated index method and the difference-product method work well for
    evaluating the suitability of damaged mined land and for analyzing the factors
    that restrict the degree of suitability in the case of no prominent evaluation
    index. References Adugna O, Alemu D (2017) Evaluation of brush wood with stone

    The technological demands required to successfully practice either targeted \n\
    irrigation control and/or deficit irrigation strategies are currently reliant\
    \ on \nnumerical models which are often underutilised due to their complexity\

    \ from soil \nwater representation models and heterogeneous sensor data sources.\
    \  The system \nuses real-time soil moisture measurements provided by an in situ\
    \ sensor network \nto generate site-specific soil water retention curves. This\
    \ information is then used \nto predict the rate of soil drying. The decision\
    \ to irrigate is made when soil water \ncontent drops below a pre-defined threshold\
    \ and when the probability of rainfall \nis low. A deficit strategy can be incorporated\
    \ by lowering the irrigation “refill” \npoint and setting the fill amount to a\
    \ proportion of field capacity. Computer \nsimulations show how significant water\
    \ savings can be achieved through \nimproved utilisation of rainfall water by\
    \ plants, spatially targeted irrigation \napplication, and precision timing through\

    \ \nAustralia is facing a severe water shortage due to below-average rainfall\
    \ received \nover the past decade.  The agricultural sector is the hardest hit\
    \ by this as \nirrigation accounts for almost 65% of total water use nationally\
    \ [1]. Long-term \nclimate forecasts suggest that this situation is unlikely to\
    \ improve [2].  Therefore \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n\

    the agricultural industry must become increasingly innovatively in its efforts\
    \ to \nuse water more effectively.   Two techniques which have been successfully\
    \ used \nto improve water use efficiency include improved irrigation scheduling\
    \ practices \n[3] and the reduction of water application rates using deficit irrigation\
    \ strategies \n[4]. \n     Optimising the timing of irrigation events involves\
    \ being able to sense when \nthe soil water reaches a threshold level estimated\
    \ either directly using moisture \nsensors, \nor \nindirectly \nthrough \nmeteorological\
    \ \ndata \n(for \nexample \nevapotranspiration – ET).  Incorporation of short-term\
    \ weather forecasts can \nimprove the projected need for irrigation and save water\
    \ by increasing the \namount of rainfall utilised by plants [5].  Solving spatial\
    \ and temporal variation \nin soil water dynamics, however, becomes more demanding\
    \ requiring real-time \nmonitoring capabilities (e.g. soil moisture sensors, hydrologic\
    \ models and \nremote sensing), and/or a high degree of empirical soil physical\
    \ data, both of \nwhich can be very expensive and labour intensive. \n     Where\
    \ water is particularly limiting, further reductions in irrigation water will\
    \ \nbe required. This has been addressed through the concept of deficit irrigation.\
    \  \nDeficit irrigation strategies deliberately allow crops to sustain some degree\
    \ of \nwater deficit and sometimes an associated yield reduction through a significant\
    \ \nreduction of irrigation water.  The classic deficit irrigation strategy involves\
    \ \nsupplying water at levels below full ET throughout the season.  In practice\
    \ this \nhas commonly been achieved by either irrigating at the same frequency\
    \ but \napplying less water during each irrigation event, or maintaining the amount\
    \ of \nwater per irrigation but increasing the interval between irrigations [6].\
    \  Where \nwater accounting has been used, irrigation decisions have generally\
    \ been based \non the ‘trigger level’ concept of available soil water. \n    \
    \ The technological demands required to successfully practice either targeted\
    \ \nirrigation control and/or deficit irrigation strategies are currently reliant\
    \ on \nnumerical models which are often underutilised due to their complexity\
    \ and low \noperational focus [7].  A simple and practical real-time control system\
    \ is \nproposed using a model-data fusion approach, which integrates information\
    \ from \nsoil water representation models and heterogeneous data sources to improve\
    \ \noutput resolution and irrigation decision making. \n     In comparison to\
    \ other numerical models which act more in a simulation \ncapacity for testing\
    \ various water-management/allocation strategies at the basin \nlevel, the model\
    \ presented here is to be applied as a functional monitoring tool \nfor automated\
    \ control at the paddock level. It has the advantage that it can adapt \nthe irrigation\
    \ plans in real-time to meet the desired soil water conditions defined \nby the\
    \ irrigation rules.  Model accuracy increases with observation as the model \n\
    learns soil water flow relationships.  Whilst this initial training period may\
    \ result \nin a degree of inaccuracy, this is outweighed by the fact that the\
    \ model can learn \nsoil physical attributes in situ.  Assigning sensors to similar\
    \ soil spatial zones \nthrough an initial training phase removes some of the high\
    \ labour and expense \ndemands associated with sensor technology.  The low manual\
    \ inputs needed to \nuse this technology and the limited knowledge required to\
    \ interpret the output \nare expected to improve uptake by the broader irrigation\
    \ community. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n© 2008 WIT Press\n\

    \ Management, Technologies and Policies II\n     This paper presents the model-data\
    \ fusion approach to irrigation control and \nhow the technology may be applied\
    \ in practising deficit irrigation.  Whilst field \nvalidation has not yet been\
    \ undertaken, preliminary simulation results suggest \nthat water savings can\
    \ be achieved through consideration of spatial variation and \nshort-term weather\
    \ forecasts into the irrigation decision-making process. \n2 Model data fusion\
    \ in deficit irrigation \nSensor network technologies are proving to be powerful\
    \ tools for monitoring \nreal-time changes in the environment. There is a need\
    \ to aggregate complex data \nfrom heterogeneous sensors, providing a rich, multidimensional\
    \ picture of the \nsystem.  Much work has been done in the field of data fusion\
    \ [8−11], which \ndeals with the functional transformation of data into human\
    \ apprehensible \ninformation.  Studies looking at “situation awareness” focus\
    \ on developing \nmodels based on how humans perceive and comprehend their environment\
    \ and \nsubsequently anticipate potential change [12, 13]. Situation is defined\
    \ as a set of \nenvironmental conditions and system states with which the participant\
    \ is \ninteracting, and can be characterised by a set of information, knowledge,\
    \ and \nresponse options [14]. Situation Awareness consists of three levels of\
    \ mental \nmodels [12]: \n• \nPerception is the process by which a participant\
    \ identifies the status, \nattributes, and dynamics of relevant elements in the\
    \ environment.   \n• \nComprehension is concerned with prioritising and evaluating\
    \ the \ninformation obtained from perception according to their relevance to current\
    \ \ngoals;  \n• \nProjection deals with forecasting future states of elements\
    \ in the \nenvironment based on the awareness achieved in Perception and \nComprehension.\
    \   \n     To provide decision support in the real-time environment, a situation-aware\
    \ \ninformation fusion system must handle problems in association with inflexible\
    \ \nknowledge representation. With respect to the soil hydrologic environment,\
    \ such \ninformation includes the spatial-temporal distribution and evolution\
    \ of soil \nmoisture which are non-deterministic due to complex interactions among\
    \ \nenvironmental factors like soil profile, precipitation, ET, etc. This requires\
    \ a \nsystem with the capability to learn new knowledge and adapt to the environment.\
    \  \nWhat follows is a description of the model-data fusion approach used to develop\
    \ \na simple real-time irrigation control system. \n2.1 A framework for model-data\
    \ fusion \nModel-data fusion is the approach via which an information system learns\
    \ \nenvironmental behavioural models and utilises the learned models to better\
    \ \nrepresent and predict environmental phenomena. Figure 1 shows the framework\
    \ \nof a model-data fusion system. The framework consists of Sensors, Effectors,\
    \ a \nClassifier, a Model Learner, and a Situation Projector; an Environment \n\
    Representation Model which represents soil characteristics, and a Decision \n\

    \ on Ecology and the Environment, Vol 112,\nSustainable Irrigation Management,\
    \ Technologies and Policies II  189\nModel which captures a set of irrigation\
    \ decisions in relation to environmental \nvariables.  \n \n \nFigure 1: \nThe\
    \ framework for a situation-aware model-data fusion system. \n     Sensors are\
    \ data collectors, which continuously observe the environment. \nDuring the learning\
    \ stage, the Model Learner learns a Representation Model of \nthe environment.\
    \ The Representation Model captures empirical relationships \nbetween data inputs\
    \ and outputs. The learnt model is then used by the Classifier \nto identify environmental\
    \ properties in a perception-related process. The \nSituation Projector “comprehends”\
    \ a situation by prioritising information \naccording to how it impacts on the\
    \ current goal.  It also generates a projection (or \nanticipation) based on the\
    \ Environment Representation Model. A Decision \nModel contains strategies to\
    \ fulfil the goal under various circumstances. \nEffectors perform tasks which\
    \ are specified in a decision. The application \ninterface enables a user to view\
    \ information generated at different components so \nas to make decisions (or\
    \ choose a recommendation).  Interactions between model \nand sensed data ground\
    \ the decision making process in a dynamic environment.   \n2.2 Learning the environment\
    \ representation model via in situ sensors \nSoil moisture, rainfall, surface\
    \ run-off, wind, humidity, temperature are some of \nthe important types of data\
    \ that can improve our understanding of the \nenvironment in the context of irrigation.\
    \ The sensors adopted in this research are \nsoil volumetric moisture sensors,\
    \ soil water potential sensors (gypsum blocks), \nsoil temperature sensors and\
    \ an automatic weather station. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line)\

    190  Sustainable Irrigation Management, Technologies and Policies II\n     The\
    \ Environment Representation Model, is a description of environmental \nvariables\
    \ and their interrelationships, and is used for predicting future conditions.\
    \ \nThe environment is represented as three dimensional soil cubes with each cube\
    \ \nrepresenting a finite element of soil behaviour. One aspect of soil behaviour\
    \ of \nsignificant importance is the relationship between volumetric water content\
    \ (θ) \nand water potential (ψ). This relationship forms what is known as the\
    \ soil \nmoisture retention curve, and is commonly used to estimate the water-holding\
    \ \ncapacity of soil horizons within the root-zone.  \n     Within each cube,\
    \ a gypsum block measures soil water potential. Correlated \nwater potential measurements\
    \ between spatially neighbouring cubes enables \nlocalised clusters to be formed.\
    \ Each cluster of cubes with similar water potential \nbehaviour can be assigned\
    \ a volumetric soil moisture sensor. This approach \nreduces the number of expensive\
    \ volumetric sensors that need to be employed \nwithin the field. For each cube,\
    \ the relationship between water potential and \nvolumetric water content is then\
    \ learnt by the Model Learner during a training \nphase where sensor data is collected\
    \ from the field. This scenario is shown in \nFigure 2.  \n \n3D soil cubic representation\n\

    retention characteristics. \n     Direct measurement of retention curves in the\
    \ field, particularly at such fine \nscale, should provide considerable improvement\
    \ to the understanding of soil \nbehaviour compared with indirect, coarser approximations,\
    \ such as the use of \nreference soil types, which fail to take into account soil\
    \ heterogeneity within the \nfield.  Reference data may also be inaccurate due\
    \ to its measurement in a \ndifferent environment (i.e. the laboratory) and under\
    \ different conditions. There \nis considerable discrepancy between the retention\
    \ curve of a particular soil type, \nmeasured in both the laboratory and the field\
    \ [15]. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n© 2008 WIT Press\n\
    WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, Vol 112,\nSustainable Irrigation\
    \ Management, Technologies and Policies II  191\n     Another common approach\
    \ to obtain the retention curve is to use Pedotransfer \n(PTF) functions. PTF\
    \ functions predict the water retention curve from using \nbasic, easily measured\
    \ properties of the soil. Consequently, PTF can be very \ncrude approximations\
    \ and are often only optimised for particular soil types and \nconditions.  \n\
    \     Ideally, the training of retention curves within the field should cover\
    \ \nmeasurements over a significant proportion of the retention curve (i.e. from\
    \ \nsaturation to the permanent wilting point), including the dynamic hysteresis\
    \ \nwithin wetting and drying periods.  However, it is unlikely to be possible\
    \ to \nmeasure the complete range of potential and volumetric observations in\
    \ situ \nduring the training phrase. For unmeasured regions, the curve can be\
    \ predicted \nby using non-linear regression or neural network methods such as\
    \ the Mualem-\nvan Genutchen model [16], to fit the measured data to retention\
    \ curve models \nuntil the relevant conditions have been observed. \n     Retention\
    \ curves are unique for different soil types as they are dependent \nupon the\
    \ physical properties of the soil, such as porosity and particle size. \nTherefore\
    \ deriving retention curves in situ also has the advantage of providing a \ncoarse\
    \ taxonomy of the soil composition of each cube, thus considering spatial \nvariability\
    \ in irrigation decisions. This can be achieved by fitting a model to \nreference\
    \ and field retention curves and then comparing their shape parameters.  \n2.3\
    \ Predicting soil water content \nPredicting how the soil water content changes\
    \ over time becomes an important \nparameter for deciding when to irrigate.  The\
    \ high frequency of data being \ncollected from field sensors offers the potential\
    \ to predict the short term future of \nsoil water content and enables irrigation\
    \ plans to continually adapt to meet the \ntarget objectives. \n     One of the\
    \ challenges in predicting changes in soil water content is that \nwetting and\
    \ drying behaviour is a non-deterministic process which is dependent \nupon a\
    \ number of environmental attributes. Hence, prediction of the soil water \ncontent\
    \ through modelling is complex, as demonstrated by the Hydrus program \n[17].\
    \ Hydrus has not yet been proven to be an applicable solution to support real\
    \ \ntime decision making due to the complexity in the physical modelling.   \n\
    \     We assume that the rate of soil water change can be learnt from previous\
    \ soil \nwater behaviour in the field. A relationship between the rate of soil\
    \ water content \nchange and the other dependent variables such as precipitation\
    \ and ET can be \nlearnt through observation. The benefit of this approach is\
    \ that the system is not \nattempting to learn the physical model itself, but\
    \ instead the relationship between \nsoil water change rate and other dependent\
    \ system attributes. In a sense, it is \nequivalent to the real time learning\
    \ of PTF functions from the field.  \n     With the learned characteristics of\
    \ each soil class, the Classifier can locate \nenvironmental variables in the\
    \ Representation Model (retention curves) and the \nSituation Projector can subsequently\
    \ infer the needs for irrigation by calculating \nthe distance to the refill point\
    \ (θthreshold) for each soil class. Figure 3 illustrates \nthis concept. \n \n\

    \ upon other information \nincluding rain forecasts, ET demand, current water\
    \ allocation and other plant \nrelated factors.  Decision tree learning using\
    \ inductive inference has been the \nmethod adopted for deciding when to irrigate.\
    \ Inductive learning methods \nidentify features that empirically distinguish\
    \ positive from negative observed \ntraining examples. Figure 4 presents the results\
    \ obtained from a decision tree \nlearning algorithm. Each non-leaf node stands\
    \ for a test on an attribute. Edges of \nthe decision tree coming from the nodes\
    \ are values of attributes for that node. \nLeaf nodes are used to represent design\
    \ decisions for selecting a deficit ratio. \nNumbers in parentheses illustrate\
    \ an observation for the class defined in the leaf \nnode. For example, “10.0”\
    \ indicates that there are ten positive observations and \nno negative observations\
    \ for that class.  \n     The decision rules encoded within the model consider\
    \ historical irrigation \ntreatments, and generalises empirical knowledge that\
    \ can be applied to select an \nappropriate irrigation treatment for a specific\
    \ combination of field conditions. \nThree environment variables form the decision\
    \ tree. These variables describe \nwhether a soil cube is at the refill threshold\
    \ point (node “reachRefillPoint”), if it \nis currently raining (node “currentRain”),\
    \ and the probability of expected rain in \n12 hours (node “forecastRain”). Leaf\
    \ nodes illustrate irrigation treatments. \nIrrigation strategies are obtained\
    \ by traversing from root node to a leaf node. For \nexample, some interesting\
    \ rules can be found: \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line) \n© 2008\

    \ tree structure learnt from running a C4.5 [18] algorithm \nfrom WEKA [19] on\
    \ 46 instances of deficit irrigation treatments. \n• \nif the soil cube has reached\
    \ refill point whilst it is not raining, and the \nprobability of the predicted\
    \ rainfall is greater than 0.7, irrigation water \nshould not be applied. Irrigation\
    \ is postponed until the next decision \ntime, for example, in 4 hours; \n• \n\
    if the soil cube has reached refill point whilst it is not raining, and the \n\
    probability of the predicted rainfall is between 0.3−0.7, deficit irrigation \n\
    should be applied to mitigate the risks of water stress on plant growth. \nThe\
    \ pre-defined deficit ratio is applied to the accumulated ET since the \nlast\
    \ irrigation or rainfall event to calculate the irrigation requirements. \n  \
    \   Information fused from various sensors can be used to construct a \nrecommendation.\
    \ The system can also learn and evolve the decision model in \nreal time. For\
    \ example, by monitoring the plant response (e.g. remotely sensed \ncanopy temperature),\
    \ if the pre-defined plant-based thresholds have not been met \nunder the applied\
    \ irrigation deficit ratio, the system can re-adjust to a lower ratio \nwhen similar\
    \ environmental conditions prevail. If required, the irrigation \ndecision model\
    \ can also act autonomously to schedule irrigation events.  \n3 Model simulation\
    \ \nAn irrigation simulator was developed in NetLogo [20] to demonstrate how the\
    \ \nmodel works and contributes to water use efficiency when taking account of\
    \ \nrainfall information. Scenarios of a simulated deficit irrigation model and\
    \ a point \nsensor-triggered irrigation system are discussed.  \n \n www.witpress.com,\

    \ and Policies II\n     The irrigation simulator uses field data including ET\
    \ and rain gathered from \nElliot research farm (North West Tasmania; 41o06′S,\
    \ 145o46′E) during the period \nof 2 November to 21 December, 2007. This data\
    \ is scaled down to fit into the \nsimulation model with essential variances unchanged.\
    \ The simulator consists of \ntwo agent-based models: \n1. A deficit irrigation\
    \ model, which integrates local weather conditions \nand rainfall forecasts to\
    \ decide when and how much to irrigate, and \ntargeted irrigation control, with\
    \ application to only those areas that \nhave reached the refill threshold point;\
    \ \n2. A point sensor-based irrigation model, which only uses threshold soil \n\
    moisture to trigger irrigation with uniformed application. \n     To exemplify\
    \ the effect of different irrigation treatments on water usage, both \nmodels\
    \ run under the same sets of environmental conditions including ET, \nrainfall,\
    \ soil profile characteristics, and boundary conditions such as irrigation \n\
    rate and drainage rate. A 3D soil water diffusion model is used to simulate soil\
    \ \nwater content changes under these conditions. The soil is represented by 3D\
    \ \ncubes, as shown in Figure 3. The simulated soil consists of loam, clay and\
    \ sand \nat different horizons (Figure 5). The soil diffusion model is a simplified\
    \ view of \nthe tendency of water to move from one soil cube to another, based\
    \ on \ndifferences in soil water contents and soil porosities. Considering a soil\
    \ cube and \nits neighbouring cubes, soil water diffusion can be simulated by\
    \ recalculating the \ndistribution soil water between cubes:  \nT i= P i× ∑1\n\
    n T\n∑ 1\nn\nP\n− ET − DR                                      (1) \nwhere  T\
    \ i denotes soil water content unit for cube i \n            i is the cube for\
    \ recalculation \n            n is the number of neighbours for cube i  \n   \
    \         P is the porosity of soil cube i \n            ET stands for water loss\
    \ from evapotranspiration for cube i (only top   \n            level cubes have\
    \ ET) \n            DR denotes water unit loss from drainage for cube i over boundary\
    \ (only \n             the bottom-level cubes consider DR) \n     Eqn. (1) describes\
    \ how soil water diffusion is calculated in the simulator.  \nEnvironmental changes\
    \ can cause the soil water content to re-distribute. Figure 6 \nalso shows an\
    \ example of how to apply Equation 1 to calculate simulated soil \nwater content\
    \ in cube i.  By iterating all soil cubes, the effect of environmental \nconditions\
    \ can be represented through soil water diffusion.    \n     Point sensor-based\
    \ irrigation treatments apply water uniformly to the whole \npaddock. Rainfall\
    \ is affected by the same environmental conditions as irrigation.  \nWater is\
    \ lost through drainage and ET with some water units retained in the soil. \n\
    Figure 6 shows the accumulated irrigation water usage during 50 time units of\
    \ an \nirrigation treatment with a model initialised to pre-defined soil water\
    \ contents.  \n     In this scenario, 6170 units of water have been consumed as\
    \ a result of 21 \nirrigation events. \n \n www.witpress.com, ISSN 1743-3541 (on-line)\

    \ 7 does not occur under a point sensor-based irrigation scenario. This has a\
    \ \ndirect impact on the amounts of water consumed. Because the two scenarios\

    \ the \ndifference between the total soil water contents (shown in Figures 8 and\
    \ 9) is an \nindication of over-irrigation in the point sensor-based strategy.\
    \ That is, assuming \nproduction is fairly constant above the refill threshold\

    \ the extra water applied in the \npoint sensor-based strategy is of no benefit\

    \ fusion framework to support decision-\nmaking in deficit irrigation scheduling.\
    \ The simulation results demonstrate how \nreal-time data collection may be used\
    \ to improve water use efficiency by \nconsidering future rainfall events and\
    \ practicing targeted irrigation application. \nThe simulation model is however\
    \ a reduction of a physical phenomenon. To \nincrease the credibility of the model,\
    \ data obtained from real-time sensors to \nenhance/calibrate the simulation model\
    \ is required. At present, the simulation \nmodel treats drainage as a constant\
    \ boundary condition. It is necessary to include \nbeyond root zone soil moisture\
    \ sensors to approximate deep drainage to further \nimprove the resolution of\
    \ irrigation decisions. \n     The intention is to consider crop yield models,\
    \ multiple-objective \noptimisation and remote sensing in the next phase of research.\
    \   \n     Field quantification is still required to validate this model-data\
    \ fusion \napproach for deficit irrigation.  \nAcknowledgements \nThis work is\

    16 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Irrigation demands fluctuate in response
    to weather variations and a range of irrigation management decisions, which creates
    challenges for water supply system operators. This paper develops a method for
    real-time ensemble forecasting of irrigation demand and applies it to irrigation
    command areas of various sizes for lead times of 1 to 5 days. The ensemble forecasts
    are based on a deterministic time series model coupled with ensemble representations
    of the various inputs to that model. Forecast inputs include past flow, precipitation,
    and potential evapotranspiration. These inputs are variously derived from flow
    observations from a modernized irrigation delivery system; short-term weather
    forecasts derived from numerical weather prediction models and observed weather
    data available from automatic weather stations. The predictive performance for
    the ensemble spread of irrigation demand was quantified using rank histograms,
    the mean continuous rank probability score (CRPS), the mean CRPS reliability and
    the temporal mean of the ensemble root mean squared error (MRMSE). The mean forecast
    was evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency
    (NSE) and bias. The NSE values for evaluation periods ranged between 0.96 (1 day
    lead time, whole study area) and 0.42 (5 days lead time, smallest command area).
    Rank histograms and comparison of MRMSE, mean CRPS, mean CRPS reliability and
    RMSE indicated that the ensemble spread is generally a reliable representation
    of the forecast uncertainty for short lead times but underestimates the uncertainty
    for long lead times. Key Points: This study forecasts probabilistic short-term
    system scale irrigation demand for lead time up to 5 days Measurement/estimation/forecast
    errors for flows, NWP forecasts and observed weather are integrated Rank histograms
    and other indices indicated that a reliable ensemble spread is achieved. 1 Introduction
    Short-term system scale irrigation demand forecasts are extremely useful for system
    operators to make irrigation water distribution decisions, but they are subject
    to uncertainties resulting from input parameters and model structure. Parameter
    and structural uncertainties are inherent in models, as models try to simplify
    the complex reality. Input uncertainties are also important as inputs are subject
    to measurement, estimation or prediction uncertainties. From the irrigation demand
    forecasting prospective, uncertainties in the irrigation demand forecasts can
    result from observation, estimation or prediction uncertainties in biophysical
    (crop-soil-climate interaction), behavioral (farmers and system operators attitude
    that influencing management decisions) and supply (supply source, seasonal allocation,
    permanent entitlement) factors [Zaman et al., 2007]; as well as from the respective
    parameter uncertainties, depending on the specific models used. This research
    makes ensemble forecasts of irrigation demand using a multivariate time-series
    model of short-term (up to 5 days) daily irrigation demand forced by observed
    demands and observed and forecast weather integrating measurement errors, estimation
    errors, and weather forecast uncertainty. Past research has used sophisticated
    and highly complex modelling architectures such as process-based (conceptual)
    and data-driven (statistical) approaches [Alfonso et al., 2011; Pulido-Calvo and
    Gutierrez-Estrada, 2009] to derive irrigation demand forecasts. Typically, process-based
    approaches have been used at field scale and data-driven approaches have been
    used at system scale. Few of these studies have attempted to estimate irrigation
    demand forecast uncertainties. Studies at the system scale have mainly used data-based
    deterministic models to forecast irrigation demand [Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada,
    2009; Pulido-Calvo et al., 2007; Pulido-Calvo et al., 2003]. A few of these studies
    have considered uncertainty, mainly focusing on parameter uncertainties. Both
    bootstrap methods [Ticlavilca et al., 2011] and Bayesian techniques [Alfonso et
    al., 2011] have been used to investigate the irrigation demand forecast uncertainties
    resulting from model parameters. Also, some univariate time series models based
    on previous irrigation flows [Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada, 2009; Pulido-Calvo
    et al., 2003, 2007] have captured the combined uncertainty from inputs and model
    structure by including the associated error model to represent the random error
    component in the irrigation demand forecasts. Many models have used short-term
    weather forecasts to make irrigation decisions, especially precipitation [Azhar
    and Perera, 2011; Cai et al., 2011; Gowing and Ejieji, 2001; Wang and Cai, 2009;
    Wilks and Wolfe, 1998], temperature [Ticlavilca et al., 2011; Wilks and Wolfe,
    1998] and evapotranspiration [Alfonso et al., 2011; Tian and Martinez, 2014].
    Weather forecasts have often been considered for field scale and a few studies
    that we are aware of have incorporated weather forecasts at the system scale [Tian
    and Martinez, 2014]. Field scale models have often used weather forecasts for
    irrigation scheduling (i.e., predict timing and its volume) and weather forecast
    uncertainties were manifest mainly in variations of the irrigation timing [Cai
    et al., 2011; Gowing and Ejieji, 2001; Wang and Cai, 2009; Wilks and Wolfe, 1998].
    These models only used limited forecast information as the quality of the available
    weather forecast at that time was poor at longer lead times (greater than 3 days
    lead times) [Gowing and Ejieji, 2001]. This was seen as a major impediment at
    the time. Alfonso et al. [2011] and Tian and Martinez [2014] forecasted system
    scale irrigation demands, combining stochastic reference evapotranspiration forecasts
    derived from a machine learning algorithm and currently operational Global Ensemble
    Forecast System (GEFS), respectively. Ticlavilca et al. [2011] also combined daily
    maximum and minimum temperature with system scale irrigation demand forecasts
    using a machine learning algorithm. These system scale models were mainly developed
    for arid-zone agriculture and precipitation forecasts were not considered, as
    it is not important for irrigation decisions in those environments [Alfonso et
    al., 2011; Tian and Martinez, 2014; Ticlavilca et al., 2011]. These studies have
    generated system scale stochastic irrigation demand forecasts with prediction
    intervals. In terms of assessing the probabilistic forecasts, all studies provided
    a graphical comparison of observed time series overlain on the forecast prediction
    intervals without a quantitative evaluation. Tian and Martinez [2014] also provided
    relative operating characteristic (ROC) diagrams that suggested, they didn''t
    provide any statistical analysis of the reliability or sharpness of the probabilistic
    forecasts. The maximum lead time for the most of these studies was 2 days or less
    and no study comprehensively integrates input uncertainties into the irrigation
    demand forecast uncertainties. While ensemble techniques have been used elsewhere,
    in hydrology [e.g. Addor et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015; Shrestha et al., 2013a;
    Zappa et al., 2011] and hydrometeorology [e.g. Brown et al., 2010; Ebert et al.,
    2011; Gneiting, 2013; Robertson et al., 2013a; Rossa et al., 2011], no studies
    we are aware of have used both stochastic precipitation and reference evapotranspiration
    forecasts nor have there been studies that combine uncertainties in antecedent
    flows and observed and forecast weather to derive stochastic volumetric irrigation
    demand forecasts at system scale. Ensemble techniques are commonly used to represent
    uncertainty in nonlinear models. In the context of forecasting; ensemble forecasting
    is a form of Monte Carlo analysis that is used to characterize uncertainty in
    model outputs [Toth and Kalnay, 1993]. In principle, this technique can be applied
    for both input and parameter uncertainty depending on the context of the modelling.
    Ensemble forecasting techniques have been widely used in science, engineering,
    medicine and ecology, among other areas. It has been widely used in weather forecasting
    [Ebert, 2001; Ebert et al., 2011; Gneiting, 2013; Gneiting and Raftery, 2005]
    and species distribution modelling [Araújo and New, 2007; Buisson et al., 2010;
    Grenouillet et al., 2011; Thuiller et al., 2009] to capture errors in the initial
    condition and model structure. In the field of water resources engineering, ensemble
    forecasting techniques have also been used extensively in forecasting stream flow
    [Bennett et al., 2014], short-term water demand [Hutton and Kapelan, 2015] and
    floods [Alvarez-Garreton et al., 2014; Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009; Li et al.,
    2014; Schaake, 2006; Schaake et al., 2005]. In these studies, sources of uncertainty
    included in forecast ensembles were uncertainty in inputs (mainly precipitation
    forecasts), state variable (soil moisture), and model structures through model
    parameters. We are unaware of any irrigation demand forecast model that has used
    ensemble forecasting techniques to derive stochastic irrigation demand forecasts.
    The structure of the multivariate time series model used here, which has auto-correlated
    and cross-correlated multivariate inputs, some of which are nonlinearly transformed,
    suggests ensemble forecasting techniques to derive output uncertainties would
    be useful. This technique has advantages in multivariate time series models compared
    with the bootstrap method, which can often distort the cross correlations between
    multivariate inputs and outputs [Khaliq et al., 2009; Rummel et al., 2010], whereas
    ensemble forecasts can preserve the error covariance among input time series which
    is then transferred through the regression structure to the stochastic output.
    However, the outcomes from an ensemble forecasting technique is dependent on the
    quality of the input time series. Therefore, a good quality data set (i.e., fine
    scale, free from bias and complete) is important for generating reliable, unbiased
    output ensembles. Past impediments such as the lack of required data, the expense
    of data acquisition and low data quality are being reduced with the availability
    of irrigation flow data from fully automated irrigation distribution systems,
    short-term weather forecasts from numerical weather predictions (NWP) models and
    observed weather data from automatic weather stations. In particular, the accuracy
    of the weather forecasts is continuously improving and consistent real-time irrigation
    flow data are now available from modernized distribution systems. This provides
    an opportunity to apply ensemble forecasting techniques to generate stochastic
    irrigation demand forecasts. This paper develops ensemble irrigation demand forecasts
    using the irrigation distribution system in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District
    (GMID) in Northern Victoria as a case study. This system has been modernized and
    automated connections provide consistent real-time flow data [NVIRP, 2010a]. Previously,
    Perera et al. [2015a] developed a deterministic model and assessed its performances
    under perfect weather forecasts i.e., using observed weather data. This paper
    uses that model as a basis and both brings real weather forecasts into the analysis
    and develops an ensemble framework to incorporate uncertainties arising from the
    weather forecast data as well as other inputs. In doing this we use data from
    the GMID and numerical weather predictions (NWP) from the Bureau of Meteorology
    (BOM) to develop ensemble irrigation demand forecasts. This is a relatively new
    and high level of data availability compared with many irrigation systems. The
    analysis includes input uncertainties associated with the flow measurement and
    weather measurements and forecasts. The remainder of the paper describes the area
    of study where the methodology has been applied and forecasting performance for
    command area driven stochastic irrigation demand forecasts and conclusions that
    has been drawn.This provides novel understanding about the irrigation demand prediction
    uncertainties like input uncertainties related to biophysical, behavioral and
    supply factors and in turn assists system operators to mitigate the risk associated
    with their routine irrigation distribution decisions. 2 Study Area and Data 2.1
    Study Area The study area and data sources are described in detail in Perera et
    al. [2015a]. The study area is located in the Central Goulburn Irrigation District
    (CGID), Victoria, Australia. Agriculture in the study area is dominated by irrigated
    dairy, pome and stone fruit production, with other agricultural activities related
    to sheep for wool, beef and dairy cattle [RDV, undated]. The main source of water
    supply for the CGID is from Lake Eildon, with delivery via the Goulburn River,
    Goulburn weir, and the Stuart Murray Canal. Water flows from Stuart Murray Canal
    to the CGID through six gravity irrigation distribution channels namely CG1, 2,
    3, 4, 5 and 6. Any excess water in the Stuart Murray Canal is diverted to Waranga
    Basin (Figure 1). The irrigation distribution system in the CGID is highly automated
    and a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system monitors levels
    and flows and controls the regulator gates and meter outlets across the district.
    Irrigation water takes about 4 days to travel from Lake Eildon to the farms in
    this area. The proposed ensemble forecasting methodology was applied to 287 km2
    of irrigated agricultural land supplied by CG 1, 2, 3 and 4. The characteristics
    for each channel are given in Table 1. The irrigation year starts on the 15 of
    August and continues to the 15 of May the following year. The study area is approximately
    110 meters above the Australian height datum (AHD) and the climate is temperate
    with a hot summer (T hot ≥22°C) but without a dry season (Köppen climate type
    Cfa) [Peel et al., 2007]. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Study area–Central

    and Preprocessing 2.2.1 Irrigation Flow Data The irrigation flow data related
    to the regulators and service points were collected from the operational SCADA
    system known as Total Channel ControlTM (TCCTM) that is used by Goulburn-Murray
    Water (GMW). TCCTM is a fully automated open channel delivery system that captures
    flow measurements in real-time at all regulating structures and farm supply points.
    We used the flow data recorded at 1016 supply points for the period 15 August
    2006 to 15 May 2012; which includes 6 irrigation years. The service point delivery
    data were aggregated to a daily time step. The SCADA system records the start
    and end times and flow rates of irrigation order deliveries. Service point flows
    were aggregated across all service points for each individual channel and the
    study area as a whole. This aggregation implicitly assumes that the travel time
    along the local channel or study area is significantly less than a day. The aggregated
    service point flows are denoted IDCGi, ASP. Here “ASP” denotes the Aggregated
    Service Points, and “i” provides spatial aggregation area (where i=1, 2, 3, 4
    or 1234). 2.2.2 Observed Climate Data The observed climate data were obtained
    from two Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) and three daily read rain gauge sites
    operated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) [BoM, 2005] located in
    and around the study area (Figure 1).The characteristics of each weather station
    are given in Table 2. Daily precipitation records were collected from all five
    sites as the area often witnesses localized patchy precipitation events. These
    five sites were established well before the channel automation and record start
    dates vary between 1883 and 1996. The hourly weather variables needed to estimate
    daily reference evapotranspiration–ETO were collected from the AWSs (air temperature,
    dewpoint temperature, wind speed) and satellite imagery (solar radiation) as described
    by Perera et al. [2014, 2015b]. The measurement ranges and accuracies of these
    observed weather variables are given in Table 3. The AWSs and rain gauges nominally
    provide continuous measured weather data; however, there were times within the
    study period when hourly/daily weather data were missing due to various reasons.
    For missing daily precipitation, the aggregated value recorded at the end of missing
    period was uniformly disaggregated over the missing period, while other weather
    variables were infilled from the neighbouring AWS. Table 2. Characteristics of

    for the study area were collected from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology''s
    operational NWP forecasts derived from the Australian Community Climate and Earth
    System Simulator–(ACCESS) [Puri et al., 2013]. The ACCESS systems are nonhydrostatic,
    hybrid vertical level structure, mesoscale assimilation & forecast systems. They
    have been operational since 17 August 2010. The temporal (lead time) and spatial
    resolution for different ACCESS systems vary from +1 to +240 h and 5 to 80 km,
    respectively. The forecast performances for precipitation and mean sea level pressure
    of the ACCESS systems have been comprehensively evaluated [BoM, 2010, 2012; Puri
    et al., 2013] and also its outputs have been extensively used for short-term stream
    flow forecasting [Pagano et al., 2010; Shrestha et al., 2012, 2013b]. We selected
    the ACCESS-G system, which has the largest lead time (+240 h) and the largest
    grid cells (80 km) in order to derive irrigation demand forecasts for longer lead
    times, where the next higher resolution model has a lead time of only 72 h. ACCESS-G
    is run twice a day providing forecasts starting at 10.00 AM and 10.00 PM local
    time (i.e., 0000 and 1200 UTC). The outputs from these runs are available at 03:50
    PM and 03:50 AM (the next day), respectively [BoM, 2010]. We used the 10:00 AM
    local time run and constructed 9 midnight to midnight daily ETO and 09:00 AM to
    09:00 AM daily precipitation forecasts using the 3 hourly NWP forecast outputs
    of precipitation, air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed and incoming
    solar radiation from 17 August 2010 to 1 August 2012. The four grid points surrounding
    the station were linearly interpolated to the AWS location and biases in the forecast
    ETO input variables were corrected following Perera et al. [2014] and precipitation
    forecasts were post-processed following Robertson et al. [2013b]. The ETO forecasts
    have been evaluated in detail by Perera et al. [2014], who found that the root
    mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) values ranged
    over 0.73–1.43 mm d−1 and 0.91–0.01 for 1 and 9 day lead times, respectively.
    Precipitation forecasts have R2 values of 0.65 and 0.55 for 1 and 3 day lead times,
    respectively [BoM, 2010]. 3 Methodology In this paper, the multivariate time series
    model developed previously by Perera et al. [2015a] is used to derive irrigation
    demand forecast ensembles for lead time up to 5 days. In principle, the ensemble
    forecasting approach can include all sources of uncertainties. We undertook some
    preliminary evaluations to decide which uncertainties to incorporate in this analysis
    (not presented). This involved perturbing model inputs and parameters individually
    and collectively and examining the output ensemble spread. It was found that including
    both model input and parameter uncertainty did not significantly change the ensembles
    compared with only including model input uncertainty. Including only parameter
    uncertainty led to very narrow output ensembles. Therefore, the ensemble forecast
    approach used here was simplified by omitting the parameter component. Figure
    2 provides the schematic diagram of the ensemble forecast approach that has been
    adopted and shows the flow of input data through to ensemble irrigation demand
    forecasts along the time line. Steps 1–3 are about characterizing the statistical
    structure of each input time series, including measurement error characterization;
    correction of NWP forecast bias and characterization of NWP forecast uncertainty,
    followed by creation of the input ensembles for each model input. We used different
    perturbation methods in order to account for measurement, observation and forecast
    uncertainties given that the deterministic multivariate time series model is forced
    by observed demands and observed and forecasted weather. The selected perturbation
    methods are discussed in detail later in this section. We post-processed input
    ensembles using the Schaake Shuffle method [Clark et al., 2004] to achieve realistic
    cross-correlations and temporal persistence within each ensemble. Step 4 involves
    preparing past and future forcing variable (water supply deficit) and running
    the deterministic ARMAX models with the various input ensembles. A brief description
    of the deterministic model and its calibration is given in the next section and
    further details can be found in Perera et al. [2015a]. Step 5 summarizes the daily
    ensemble irrigation demand forecasts into a probabilistic irrigation demand forecasts.
    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The schematic diagram of the ensemble
    forecast approach. The various modelling steps above are described in more detail
    in the following methodology sections. The last part of the methodology describes
    the evaluation methods that have been used to quantify the forecast performance
    of ensemble irrigation demand forecast. 3.1 Deterministic Model and its Calibration
    3.1.1 Deterministic Model Structure The model used here is a multivariate time
    series model, which has been previously developed to derived irrigation demand
    forecasts for the same study area [Perera et al., 2015a]. This time series model
    combines bio-physical factors (weather) as the exogenous variable with behavior
    factors captured through the auto-regressive process dependent on immediate past
    irrigation demands. The model is an autoregressive moving average model with an
    exogenous variable-(ARMAX) (equation 1). (1) where, is the daily irrigation demand
    at time t, is the daily exogenous variable at time t, is the number of past irrigation
    demand terms included, is the number of time points at which the exogenous term
    is specified plus 1, is the number of autoregressive error terms, is the number
    of input samples that occur before the input affects the output, also called the
    dead time in the system, are the previous outputs on which the current output
    depends, are the previous and delayed inputs on which the current output depends,
    are the white-noise disturbance values, which is modeled as an independent and
    identically distributed (iid) Gaussian process, with zero mean and variance .
    The exogenous variable (u) is a water supply deficit (WSD) index which reflects
    the effect of atmospheric forcing on irrigation demand as a combination of precipitation
    and ETO. The WSD is estimated using a simple soil water bucket model with two
    parameters. (2) The storage at time t, St, is calculated using a soil water balance,
    (3) where, ETO (mm d−1) is the daily reference crop evapotranspiration, (mm) is
    the soil moisture storage, is the maximum soil moisture storage (mm), P (mm) is
    the precipitation. The bucket capacity (Smax) and the nonlinearity (γ) of actual
    evapotranspiration are determined in the model fitting. WSD is essentially a command
    area average index aiming to represent the pattern of supplemental water that
    would need to be supplied through irrigation. 3.1.2 Deterministic Model Calibration
    A detailed description of the model fitting and selection through cross validation
    is provided in Perera et al. [2015a]. This included developing data transformation
    to remove seasonality and scaling differences in the raw data set. Then, the model
    parameters were estimated in two steps: the first of which determined the order
    of each transfer function and Smax and γ; and the second of which determined the
    lag coefficients. Model selection was guided using the Bayesian information criterion
    (BIC) (4) where, MSE is the mean squared prediction error, d is the number of
    parameters and N is the number of observations. This is essentially a mean squared
    error minimization penalized by parameter number as a measure of model complexity.
    The deterministic model calibration process used a leave-one-year-out cross-validation
    (LOOCV) technique to select the best time series models based on the BIC calibration.
    In the original paper [Perera et al., 2015a] 6 years of data were used (calibration
    on 5 years, validation on 1 year); however, the NWP weather forecasts from ACCESS-G
    are only available the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 irrigation seasons due to changes
    in the Bureau''s NWP systems. Therefore this study focusses on just two of the
    original models; the ones that were validated on the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 irrigation
    seasons. Cross-validations showed that the overall patterns between command areas
    and years were similar. The average performances for RMSE and NSE during calibration,
    among six cross-validation scenarios across 5 command areas ranged from 2.33 ML
    d−1 (CG 1) to 28.5 ML d−1 (CG 1234) and from 0.55(CG 1) to 0.93 (CG 1234) respectively,
    for 1 day lead time [Perera et al., 2015a]. 3.2 Ensemble Generation 3.2.1 Real-Time
    Flow Data The measurement uncertainty for the irrigation flows was estimated from
    the manufacture''s specifications and in-field audits. The measurement uncertainty
    for automated off take regulators and meter outlets is ± 2.5% (95% confidence)
    under laboratory test conditions [Rubicon_Water, 2014]. However, under operational
    conditions, the Total Channel ControlTM (TCCTM) SCADA system was assessed as being
    able to maintain a constant rate of flow as channel level varied. Specifically,
    the field assessment concluded that “the modernised backbone will deliver a uniform
    flow within +/−5% more than 90% of the time" [NVIRP, 2010b]. We have interpreted
    these two sources of information as representing likely bounds on the in-field
    performance of the system and we consider error scenarios between these bounds.
    The above statements imply measurement error standard deviations (as a proportion
    of measured flow) of 0.0304 (±5.0% with 90% confidence) and 0.0128 (±2.5% with
    95% confidence) respectively, assuming a normal distribution. A preliminary evaluation
    (not presented) was carried out to select the measurement uncertainty standard
    deviation for generating ensembles of observed flow. This evaluation considered
    standard deviations of 0.0304, 0.025, 0.02, 0.015 and 0.0128. The results shows
    the standard deviation for measurement error for and meter outlets of 0.02 (i.e.,
    2% of measured flow) generated reasonably reliable 1 day lead time forecast ensembles
    under calibration conditions. This measurement uncertainty is assumed to be a
    constant proportional error across the full range of flows. In addition, the measurement
    errors under laboratory conditions [Rubicon_Water, 2014] and supply error in the
    field [NVIRP, 2010b] need to be generalized across all the automated off take
    regulators and meter outlets as regulators record times of flow rate change and
    meter outlets record the start and end timings and flow rates of irrigation order
    deliveries. The off take regulator and aggregated service point flow ensembles
    were created similarly, perturbing daily irrigation flow time series with an additive
    percentage error. The additive error is assumed to be a white noise. The variance
    is adjusted for the daily aggregated service point (IDCGi, ASP) data, given that
    it is the sum of many individual service points with individual errors that were
    assumed to be independent of each other. Therefore, the irrigation flow ensembles
    for daily aggregated service point (IDCGi, ASP) are derived using equations 5
    and 6. (5) (6) where, is the irrigation demand ensemble for aggregated service,
    is the daily aggregated service point, and is the Gaussian additive noise representing
    measurement error with zero mean and a variance of . The variance derives from
    assuming that the 99% measurement confidence interval is ±5.0% of the measured
    flow. 3.2.2 Observed Weather Variables The errors in the atmospheric forcing variables
    for the WSD are a key component contributing to uncertainties in the irrigation
    demand estimation and forecasting. Estimation uncertainty for the exogenous variable
    WSD results from the precipitation measurement errors and the estimation errors
    of ETO. Given the various nonlinearities in converting weather variables to ETO
    and WSD, a Monte Carlo method is applied to create ensembles for the WSD, where
    precipitation and ETO are perturbed with known error parameters. Precipitation,
    ETO and irrigation flow ensembles were post-processed using the Schaake Shuffle
    method [Clark et al., 2004] and historical records. During the calibration, we
    used a moving window of 100 days (equivalent to the number for ensembles); either
    centred, forward shifted or back shifted, depending on the day of the year. These
    three types of moving window were necessary to given that the irrigation distribution
    operation is inactive for 3 months (15 May to 15 August) of each year, meaning
    there is no irrigation flow data for that period. Similar moving windows were
    used to post-process the irrigation flow ensembles for the evaluation period,
    but the immediate past year''s data were used because observations are unknown
    ahead of time in an operational forecasting context. 3.2.2.1 Precipitation Lognormal
    multiplicative error models have been widely used to generate ensembles for precipitation
    and to simulate precipitation error in hydrologic data assimilation [Alvarez-Garreton
    et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014]. Therefore, we used a lognormal multiplicative
    error to create the ensembles representing measured precipitation: (7) (8) where,
    is the daily precipitation ensemble member, is observed daily precipitation, is
    the multiplicative error, which follows a lognormal distribution with the mean
    of and standard deviation of . To create an unbiased precipitation ensemble, is
    set to 1 set to be 0.25 (25% error). This error represents both gauge errors and
    spatial variability. The assumption of the variance of the precipitation multiplier
    being 25% is agreed with various studies that have been investigated rain gauge
    representativeness errors [Barancourt et al., 1992; Ciach and Krajewski, 1999;
    Villarini et al., 2008] and also consistent with other recent studies [Alvarez-Garreton
    et al., 2014; DeChant and Moradkhani, 2012; Li et al., 2014]. The representativeness
    error of rain gauges for areas of order 250 km2 is quite variable but of this
    order. Perera et al. [2015a] found the performance of the ARMAX model was insensitive
    to choice of individual or combinations of rain gauges in the area, indicating
    that the modelling is likely to have relative low sensitivity to this choice.
    In accordance with the definition of the lognormal probability distribution model,
    the natural logarithm of , denoted as , follows a normal distribution with mean
    and variance given by: (9) (10) 3.2.2.2 Reference Evapotranspiration-ETO ETO was
    calculated based on the guidelines provided by the United Nations Food and Agricultural
    Organization Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (FAO 56) [Allen et al., 1998].
    The daily ETO ensembles were created by perturbing observed weather variables
    (daily mean air temperature; daily mean dew-point temperature, daily mean wind
    speed and incoming shortwave solar radiation) using zero mean additive noise.
    The equations used to calculate the inputs to ETO are given in Table 4, along
    with the corresponding measurement accuracy [BoM, 2005] and the standard deviations
    used in the perturbations. Measurement accuracies were assumed to represent a
    3 standard deviation spread [BoM, 2005] and measurement errors were assumed to
    be independent when calculating the perturbation standard deviations. The perturbation
    standard deviations account for the number of measurements contributing to each
    ETO input. 3.2.3 Forecast Weather Variables To forecast irrigation demand, forecast
    weather is required, which has errors resulting from the NWP weather forecasts.
    NWP models like ACCESS usually contain both systematic biases due to the NWP model
    structure, site elevation, temporal and spatial resolution and interpolation techniques,
    together with noise [Perera et al., 2014; Shrestha et al., 2013b]. In constructing
    irrigation demand ensembles, the NWP weather forecasts should be corrected for
    bias and the noise should also be represented. The error characteristics of the
    forecast precipitation are quite different to the forecast errors for ETO and
    hence they are treated differently here. Forecast precipitation ensembles were
    developed using the approach of Wang et al. [2009], which was developed for ACCESS
    NWP forecasts. This approach uses a simplified version of the Bayesian joint probability
    technique to derive forecast probability distributions for individual sites as
    well as for each lead time [Wang et al., 2009]. A joint probability distribution
    of observations and forecasts is fitted based on past forecast data. Ensemble
    forecasts are then generated from conditional probability distributions based
    on the joint probability distribution conditioned on the NWP forecast for that
    particular day. Space–time correlations are imposed by linking the samples from
    the forecast probability distributions using the Schaake shuffle [Clark et al.,
    2004]. Further detail of the post-processing can be found in Robertson et al.
    [2013b]. While the Wang et al. [2009] method could potentially also be applied
    to ETO forecasts, differences in the distribution characteristics meant this was
    unsuccessful. An alternative approach based on the analysis of Perera et al. [2014]
    where ACCESS-G NWP weather forecasts were used to generate deterministic daily
    ETO forecasts for lead times of 1–9 days. In essence the weather variables input
    to ETO were first bias corrected using a regression between forecast and observed
    data following Perera et al. [2014] and then used to make a deterministic ETO
    forecast. The errors in that deterministic forecast were then examined against
    observed ETO for the relevant climate station. This showed that the ETO forecast
    error is multiplicative. Finally, bias-free ensemble daily ETO forecasts were
    generated using the deterministic daily ETO forecasts and forecast error realizations
    based on the observed multiplicative error and then daily ETO ensemble forecasts
    were post-processed using the Schaake Shuffle method as described above. 3.3 Evaluation
    Methods The reliability of the ensemble in terms of bias and spread is the most
    important attribute of ensemble forecasts as it describes the capability of the
    ensemble spread to represent the real probabilistic uncertainty of the forecast.
    In this paper, the reliability of ensemble irrigation demand forecasts is quantified
    using the temporal mean of the ensemble root mean squared error (MRMSE), the mean
    continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and one of its decomposition the mean
    CRPS reliability [Hersbach, 2000], which are defined in equations 11-13 respectively.
    The MRMSE is derived by calculating the RMSE at each time step using all ensemble
    members and then averaging the RMSEs for the entire period of interest [Li et
    al., 2013, 2015]. The mean CRPS and mean CRPS reliability are calculated following
    step provided by Brown et al. [2010]. The negative orientation of these skill
    scores leads to 0 for a perfect spread and higher skill scores indicates that
    forecasts become more biased or the spread less reliable (or both). The rank histogram
    approach [Hamill, 2001] is also used to evaluate the reliability of ensemble irrigation
    demand forecasts. Rank histograms are generated by repeatedly finding the rank
    of the observation relative to values from the forecast ensemble sorted from lowest
    to highest. The resulting ranks are then plotted into a histogram. If the ensemble
    is reliable, the observations should be evenly spread across the various ensemble
    member ranks. Therefore, a flat rank histogram indicates a reliable ensemble spread;
    a U-shaped (n-shaped) histogram indicates the ensemble spread is too narrow (wide);
    and an asymmetric histogram is a sign of bias. Other attributes such as accuracy,
    sharpness and skill are also important to determine the overall quality of forecasts.
    Therefore, we further quantify the predictive performance of the mean ensemble
    daily irrigation demand forecasts through three additional statistical indices,
    (1) the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the ensemble mean, (2) the Nash-Sutcliffe
    efficiency coefficient (NS) of the ensemble mean and (3) the mean error (BIAS),
    which are described in equations 14-16 respectively. We also looked at the ratio
    between MRMSE and RMSE. This ratio becomes one for a perfect spread, but values
    less than or more than one indicate ensemble forecasts spreads are under or overestimated,
    respectively. All forecast verification scores are normalized using the size of
    the respective command area to make the predictive performance indicators are
    independent from the size of the commend area (NSE is unaffected by this normalization).
    The uncertainties of all of the forecast verification scores are evaluated using
    the bootstrapping technique [Efron and Tibshirani, 1986] and the 5th and 95th
    confidence intervals are provided along with score. The temporal mean of the ensemble
    root mean squared error, MRMSE is: (11) The mean continuous ranked probability

    Forecast Uncertainties The exogenous variable, WSD, acts as a weather forcing
    variable for irrigation demand and it is calculated using precipitation and reference
    evapotranspiration (ETO). The forecast and observed uncertainties in these two
    weather variables contribute to irrigation demand forecast uncertainties. The
    observation uncertainties for the weather variables are instrument and measurement
    network dependent, while the forecast uncertainties depend on the forecast skill
    of the NWP system. The observation uncertainties for weather variables were obtained
    from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology [BoM, 2005]. For the weather forecasts,
    ensemble forecasts were first constructed as outlined in section 15 Detailed evaluations
    of these ensemble forecasts for the study region were then undertaken through
    comparisons with local observations. This section briefly evaluates the forecast
    performance of the precipitation and ETO ensemble forecasts derived from ACCESS-G.
    Table 5 summarizes the statistical indicators related to the forecast performance
    for precipitation and ETO ensemble forecasts and Figures 3 and 4 summarize the
    results for precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively. These stats are
    for the periods of 15 August 2010 to 15 May 2011 and 15 August 2011 to 15 May
    2012 (551 days). The forecast performance for ensemble daily ETO and precipitation
    forecasts declines with increasing lead time, as expected. For precipitation forecasts,
    the MRMSE, mean CRPS and RMSE increase approximately 42%, 32% and 27% respectively
    and mean CRPS reliability remain same, as the lead time increases from 1 to 5
    days. For ETO forecasts the MRMSE, mean CRPS, mean CRPS reliability and RMSE increase
    more than twice for lead time 5 days and indicated spread of ETO ensemble forecasts
    is poor reliable for longer lead times. The NS efficiency coefficient for mean
    precipitation and ETO ranged between 0.51 and 0.20 and between 0.90 and 0.77,
    respectively, for lead times of 1–5 days. The rank histogram and bias shows that
    the ensemble precipitation forecast was slightly negatively biased and that the
    ensemble ETO forecast was slightly positively biased and the uncertainty was overestimated
    for ETO. The results also suggest that the forecast performance for ETO was higher
    than for precipitation. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Time series

    Model Calibration Period The model parameters reported in Perera et al. [2015a]
    are used here. The following results are based on forecasts for the 2010–2011
    and 2011–2012 irrigation seasons. The deterministic model was calibrated to the
    2006–2007, 2007–2008, 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 seasons plus one of 2010–2011 or
    2011–2012. Independent validation results were obtained for each of the 2010–2011
    and 2011–2012 irrigation seasons. Tabulated values below were obtained by calculating
    the calibration (or validation) metrics for each of the two seasons and then averaging
    these. We note that the “calibration period” results correspond to only 1 of the
    5 years contributing to the original model fitting. Table 6 provides the average
    statistical indicators between two calibration scenario for ensemble daily ID
    CG i, ASP forecasts across all 5 command areas and the performance for each individual
    calibration scenario is in supporting information Table S1. These calibration
    periods have 4 years in common, with the fifth year being different between the
    two sets of results and the results in Table 6 only represent the average of those
    fifth year. Only the results relating to the best LOOCV calibration scenario and
    the full study area (i.e., LOOCV-S 1 for CG 1234) are shown graphically as time
    series (Figure 5) and rank histograms (Figure 6). The statistical indicators for
    the two scenarios corresponding to each command area vary significantly due to
    the differences in irrigation flows between years. We start by considering the
    ensemble mean forecast. The NSE between forecast and observed irrigation demand
    ranged between 0.91 (1 day lead time, CG 1234) and 0.31 (5 day lead time, CG 1).
    The highest and lowest NSE values were always found at CG 1234 and CG 1, respectively
    due to differences in the area irrigated and number of supply points. For 5 day
    lead times compared with 1 day lead times, NSE decreased by more than 40% for
    small command areas (CG 1, CG 2 and CG 3) and approximately 25% for larger command
    areas (CG 4 and CG 1234). The bias was highest at CG 1234 and lowest at CG 1 and
    it is proportional to the size of the area irrigated. The bias showed that the
    ensemble daily demand forecasts slightly over predicted the observed flows for
    all command areas and mostly remains approximately same with increased in lead
    time. . Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Time series plot of observed

    (−0.21 to −0.08) a The range shown in brackets is the 5th−95th confidence interval
    from the bootstrapping analysis. The ensemble spread can be evaluated through
    the MRMSE, mean CRPS, mean CRPS reliability, RMSE and the rank histograms. The
    difference between MRMSE and RMSE increased with the increasing command area or
    decreasing lead times. The mean CRPS, mean CRPS reliability and difference between
    these two scores increased with the increasing command area or lead times. These
    facts suggest that reliability of ensemble spread declines with increasing command
    area or lead times. The MRMSE was higher than the corresponding RMSE for all command
    areas and for all lead times. Across the five command areas, MRMSE, mean CRPS,
    mean CRPS reliability and RMSE increase on average by approximately 23%, 53%,
    8% and 73% respectively from 1 day to 5 days lead time. For most cases, these
    statistics and the rank histograms (Figure 6) show that the ensemble spread marginally
    overestimated the forecast error variability for the first day and then tend to
    be flat with increased in lead time, indicating a reliable ensemble spread. During
    the calibration periods, the observed daily IDCG 1234, ASP values were within
    the ensemble daily ID CG i, ASP forecast spread (10th−90th percentile) for 86%,
    83% and 82% of the time with respect to lead time 1, 3 and 5 days. 4.3 Real-Time
    Forecasting With Numerical Weather Prediction Outputs We now examine the results
    for validation conditions using a similar approach to the previous section. With
    the exception of the fitting of uncertainty parameters for the NWP ensembles,
    these demand forecasts are made under operational conditions; that is using observation
    data available from automatic weather stations, the SCADA network of supply points
    and NWP forecast data, all of which would be available at the time of making an
    operational forecast, and with the ARMAX model fitted to independent data. The
    aim is to test the forecast performance of both the ensemble mean and to assess
    how well the ensemble represents the forecast uncertainty. Table 7 provides the
    average statistical indicators between two evaluation scenario for ensemble daily
    IDCG i, ASP forecasts across all 5 command areas and the performance for each
    individual evaluation scenario is in supporting information Table S2. Figure 7
    shows the time series plots of observed and ensemble daily demand forecast for
    evaluation year 2011/2012, while Figure 8 shows the rank histograms and associated
    probabilities. The NSE values ranged between 0.97 (1 day lead time, CG 4) and
    0.22 (5 day lead time, CG 1) and for the whole study area it ranged between 0.97
    and 0.75 for 1 and 5 day lead times, respectively. The bias varied with the evaluation
    year, being positive for 2010/2011 and negative for 2011/2012. This is partly
    reflects the variability of irrigation flow within each year, where the highest
    variability occurred during year 2011/2012. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    The ensemble spread is again examined by using MRMSE, mean CRPS, mean CRPS reliability,
    RMSE and rank histograms. In general all MRMSE, mean CRPS, mean CRPS reliability
    and RMSE decrease with increasing irrigated area reflecting the higher forecast
    performances for larger command areas and the spread of forecast uncertainties
    is not reliable for smaller command areas. The pattern between the MRMSE, mean
    CRPS, mean CRPS reliability and RMSE was similar to calibration period, where
    MRMSE is higher for all command areas and all lead times. The difference between
    MRMSE and RMSE increased and the difference between mean CRPS and mean CRPS reliability
    decreased with the increasing command area and decreasing lead times. Typically
    MRMSE is larger than RMSE values indicating that the ensemble spread is somewhat
    overestimating the forecast uncertainty at system scale, when irrigation flow
    among distribution channels aggregated. The average ratio MRMSE/RMSE across 2
    validation years varies between 1.10 and 4.20 for all command areas for 1 day
    lead time. Ideally this ratio should be one and significant deviations from one
    indicate that the ensemble spread is unreliable. For the small command areas (CG
    1 and CG 2) MRMSE/RMSE varies between 1.16 and 1.44, indicating the ensemble spread
    is slightly overestimated for the smaller command areas and consistently overestimated
    for the larger command areas. The rank histograms for the whole study area show
    that the ensemble is marginally too wide and slightly negative biased for 1 day
    lead time. This negative bias increases with lead time and forecast ensemble spreads
    are slightly under-dispersive for lead times of 3 and 5 days. This is consistent
    with the indications from mean CRPS, mean CRPS reliability and MRMSE versus RMSE;
    however, those statistics are likely to be more sensitive to outliers than the
    rank histograms. During the evaluation periods, the observed daily IDCG 1234,
    ASP values were within the ensemble daily IDCG i, ASP forecasts spread (10th−90th
    percentile) for 86%, 80% and 72% times for lead times of 1,3 and 5 days respectively.
    Overall, these results suggest that the ensemble forecasts give good estimates
    of forecast uncertainty and reliable probabilistic irrigation demand forecasts,
    particularly for the large command areas, but that the ensemble spread does not
    grow quickly enough with time. 5 Discussion The ensemble forecasting techniques
    used here build on those used in forecasting short runoff or stream flow [Addor
    et al., 2011; Bennett et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 2013a; Shrestha et al.,
    2013a; Smiatek et al., 2012]. Those studies have either used stochastic precipitation
    forecasts that have been post-processed or output from NWP models. While, the
    inputs and the techniques are similar for forecasting stream flows and irrigation
    demands, the dynamic responses of the systems are the opposite; with irrigation
    demand decreasing when precipitation increases and evapotranspiration decreases
    and streamflow doing the opposite. In catchments there is also likely to be more
    variation in antecedent conditions prior to precipitation events (antecedent moisture
    tends to be controlled by the application of irrigation in irrigated fields).
    This means that the forecast performance is not directly comparable between streamflow
    and irrigation demand. The forecast performance for the ensemble irrigation demand
    predictions were evaluated for lead times of 1–5 days across the four command
    areas plus the full study area. Both the average forecasts (ensemble means) and
    the uncertainty estimates (ensemble spread) performed well overall. NSEs for forecast
    conditions were up to 0.97 for 1 day lead time and larger command areas and remained
    above 0.65 for 5 day lead times, with the exception of the two smallest command
    areas. There were clear dependencies on lead time and command area. The area dependence
    relates to the amount of averaging between individual irrigation farms while the
    dependence on lead time relates to accumulation of forecast errors over time.
    From the system operators'' perspective, these probabilistic short-term system
    scale irrigation demand forecasts could assist with planning operations, particularly
    those operations such as transferring water from the main storage at Lake Eildon
    to the irrigation command areas. The ensemble approach provides a reliable estimate
    of forecast uncertainty that could be used to inform operational risks. The modelling
    also provides a quantitative link to enable operational weather forecasts to be
    more easily utilized in system operation decisions. From the forecasting context,
    this is the first study to generate probabilistic daily irrigation demand forecasts
    with lead times up to 5 days at the system scale. The results showed that the
    forecasting performance for ensemble daily irrigation demand forecasts were higher
    than most previous studies [Alfonso et al., 2011; Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada,
    2009; Tian and Martinez, 2014; Ticlavilca et al., 2011] and the performance of
    the forecasted ensemble mean is marginally lower than the deterministic forecasts
    derived by Perera et al. [2015a] using the same time series model. The rank histograms
    highlighted that the spreads were slightly over dispersive for lead time 1 and
    then change to slightly under-dispersive as lead time increases. This implies
    the influence of other sources of uncertainty that are not being fully captured
    by input errors. There are a number of influences not explicitly included in the
    model. These include responses to regular (∼ monthly) adjustments in yearly water
    allocation, changes in the price of water in the market, variations in sowing
    date for crops, on-farm storages and stock and domestic (non-irrigation) water
    leading to additional errors. These are in general model structural uncertainties,
    which we have not dealt with this paper. There are some subtle differences in
    the evolution of ensemble spread in different situations. In general, where there
    is a low antecedent flow, the 1 day lead time spread is small and it increases
    with antecedent flow. The low initial spread is due primarily to the multiplicative
    error applied to the observed flows, which has the largest influence on the lead
    one ARMAX outputs. The evolution of the ensemble spread over time is influenced
    by both the initial ensemble spread and the contributions to spread from the error
    component of the ARMAX model and the weather forecasts. The error structure for
    the observe ETo is complicated by its propagation from measurements through the
    Penman-Monteith equation. The inputs to the observed ETO calculation are assumed
    to have additive errors. The precipitation observation error model is multiplicative.
    These choices of measurement error structure reflect the nature of measurement
    errors for the different types of instruments involved. The ensemble evolution
    is influenced by the error structure in the ARMAX model itself and the weather
    forecasts. The ARMAX model has an additive error structure, which is justified
    by the forecast errors from the deterministic ARMAX model [Perera et al., 2015a,
    Figures 8 and 9). The forecast ETO also has an additive error structure, justified
    by error analysis in Perera et al. [2014], Figure 7. The precipitation forecast
    errors are determined by the structure of the Bayesian Joint Probability model
    [Robertson et al., 2013a; Wang et al., 2009]. Of these, the additive errors in
    the ARMAX model have the greatest effect on the ensemble evolution under different
    conditions and they lead to rapid ensemble widening when the initial spread is
    small but slow widening when the initial spread is larger. Figure 9 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Rank histograms (a) Excluding irrigation flow uncertainties
    (b) Excluding observed weather uncertainties and (c) Including irrigation flow
    and observed and forecast weather uncertainties, for observed and ensemble daily
    IDCG 1234, ASP forecasts for lead times of 1, 3, and 5 days during the evaluation
    period 15 August 2011 to 15 May 2012 (275 days). As discussed in the previous
    paragraph, there are a variety of sources of uncertainty incorporated into the
    ensembles, including uncertainty in antecedent conditions (observed flow/demand,
    observed weather) and forecast weather uncertainty. To further understand the
    importance of the antecedent conditions in contributing to the ensemble variability,
    we undertook two additional sets of simulations. The first excluded uncertainty
    in the antecedent flow and the second excluded uncertainty in the antecedent weather.
    Figure 9 shows the resulting rank histograms. The top row of histograms indicates
    that the ensembles become biased when flow uncertainty is excluded. Comparing
    the middle and lower rows in Figure 9 shows that including the impact of antecedent
    weather uncertainty also leads to subtle improvements in the ensemble (less under-dispersion,
    slightly less bias), but the improvements are smaller than the effect of antecedent
    flow. These results suggest that including the antecedent conditions as a source
    of uncertainty is important and that flow is more important than past weather.
    The difference in influence of past flow and past weather is as expected given
    that the ARMAX model weights past flows more heavily than past weather. In this
    paper, the input error terms are assumed to be independently and identically distributed.
    These assumptions are not valid in practice because the time series plots show
    a serial correlation of the irrigation demand forecast error. This might be due
    to structural errors in the model but could also be partly due to serial correlation
    of the ETO forecast error as the serial correlation of the precipitation error
    was corrected using the post-processing approach following Robertson et al. [2013b].
    This serial correlation of irrigation demand forecast error is highly subjective
    for non-stationary time series like previous irrigation flows and accordingly,
    the systematic bias increased with the increase in lead time. However, in the
    face of higher auto-correlation between consecutive observed irrigation flows,
    the serial correlation of ETO forecast error is not significant. Nevertheless,
    ensemble forecasting scheme has provided sufficiently accurate probabilistic irrigation
    demand forecasts that can be useful to the system operators for their routine
    irrigation distribution decisions. 6 Conclusion This paper developed an ensemble
    forecasting scheme to generate a real-time probabilistic short-term system scale
    irrigation demand forecasts. We used a deterministic multivariate time series
    model that was developed previously [Perera et al., 2015a], along with real-time
    data recorded at irrigation regulators; short-term weather forecast derived from
    an NWP model and observed weather variables recorded at automatic weather stations.
    This method was applied to four neighbouring irrigated agricultural areas operating
    under fully automated irrigation distribution system. The observation, estimation
    and forecast uncertainties were guided by the manufacturer''s specification, obtained
    from the literature or calculated. A range of perturbation methods were used to
    generate ensemble for each input that is necessary for the deterministic time
    series models. The spatial and temporal predictive performance for probabilistic
    daily irrigation demand forecast (IDCG i, ASP and IDCG i, OTR) were evaluated
    against observed data recorded at 1016 service points. Averaged over the two evaluation
    periods, the NSE values for IDCG i, ASP across the 5 command areas were in the
    range 0.96 (CG 1234) - 0.63 (CG 1) for 1 day lead time and between 0.76 (CG1234)
    and 0.42 (CG 1) for 5 days lead time. The predictive performance improved as the
    irrigation area served by the channel increased and the temporal predictive performances
    declined with the lead time. The rank histograms showed that the ensemble spread
    was slightly over dispersive for shorter lead time (1–2 days) and slightly under-dispersive
    for longer lead time (3–5 days), suggesting that additional sources of error that
    are not accounted for accumulate over time. This study investigated input uncertainties
    in detail and overlooks the model structural and parameter uncertainties. While
    preliminary trials showed parameter uncertainties have little influence, it would
    be valuable to examine ways of including model structural uncertainty. Nevertheless,
    the ensemble forecasting scheme adopted provides useful information on demand
    forecast uncertainty that would be useful in helping system operator manage the
    risk associated with operational decisions. Acknowledgments The authors wish to

    (UAS) are able to provide data for precision irrigation management. Improvements

    Integration of multi-scale imagery into scientific irrigation scheduling tools
    are needed for technology adoption. Abstract. Several research institutes, laboratories,
    academic programs, and service companies around the United States have been developing
    programs to utilize small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) as an instrument to improve
    the efficiency of in-field water and agronomical management. This article describes
    a decade of efforts on research and development efforts focused on UAS technologies
    and methodologies developed for irrigation management, including the evolution
    of aircraft and sensors in contrast to data from satellites. Federal Aviation
    Administration (FAA) regulations for UAS operation in agriculture have been synthesized
    along with proposed modifications to enhance UAS contributions to irrigated agriculture.
    Although it is feasible to use sUAS technology to produce maps of actual crop
    coefficients, actual crop evapotranspiration, and soil water deficits, for irrigation
    management, the technology and regulations need to evolve further to facilitate
    a successful wide adoption and application. Improvements and standards are needed
    in terms of cameras‘ spectral (bands) ranges, radiometric resolutions and associated
    calibrations, fuel/power technology for longer missions, better imagery processing
    software, and easier FAA approval of higher altitudes flight missions among other
    issues. Furthermore, the sUAS technology would play a larger role in irrigated
    agriculture when integrating multi-scale data (sUAS, ground-based or proximal,
    satellite) and soil water sensors is addressed, including the need for advances
    on processing large amounts of data from multiple and different sources, and integration
    into scientific irrigation scheduling (SIS) systems for convenience of decision
    making. Desirable technological innovations, and features of the next generation
    of UAS platforms, sensors, software, and methods for irrigated agriculture, are
    discussed. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 13 Share Facebook X Email LinkedIn

    \ smartphones, tablets) have be-\ncome commonplace today because they are convenient\
    \ and \neasy to use. They are ideal for disseminating information \non a regular\
    \ basis using real-time data. Programs developed \nfor mobile smart devices are\
    \ typically called “apps.” There \nare many apps available to perform a variety\
    \ of functions, \nand they can be personalized to the user’s needs. \nWe developed\
    \ an app called Smartirrigation Turf to provide \nan easy-to-use mobile tool that\
    \ delivers information to \nimprove irrigation scheduling for urban turf. Using\
    \ the app \ninstead of a set time-based schedule for irrigation, home-\nowners\
    \ and others can provide irrigation amounts to turf \nthat more closely match\
    \ water needs. The app is specifically \ndesigned for users who irrigate their\
    \ turf with an automatic \nirrigation system and typically set it to irrigate\
    \ a fixed \namount on certain days without modifying for weather \nchanges. Using\
    \ the app to modify the irrigation schedule \nwill reduce irrigation costs, nutrient\
    \ leaching, and disease, \nas well as conserve water. \nThis version of the app\
    \ is applicable in Florida and Georgia \nand is compatible with iOS (iPhone, iPad,\
    \ and iPod Touch) \nand Android devices. The app is available to download in \n\
    the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nApp Function\nThis section provides\
    \ a step-by-step guide for using the app \nto obtain information on how to set\
    \ an automatic timer for \nirrigated turf. The Smartirrigation Turf app is designed\
    \ for \nwarm-season turf.\nStep 1. User Registration\nOnce users download the\
    \ app and install it on their device, \nthey can sign in if they have an account,\
    \ or register to create \nan account and start using the app (Figure 1). This\
    \ allows \nthe app to create an irrigation schedule specific to the site \nand\
    \ user. Your registration information is linked to all other \ninput data requested\
    \ by the app. This information is kept \nconfidential and used solely to administer\
    \ the app.\nStep 2. New Location or System\nNext, the irrigation site location\
    \ must be identified (Figure \n2). To do this, a small map with a movable pin\
    \ is used. The \npin is located at your current location by default (using the\
    \ \ndevice’s GPS). You can move the pin by dragging it, if you \nare not located\
    \ at the irrigation system when you are setting \nup the app. Identifying the\
    \ location of the irrigation system \ncorrectly is important because this information\
    \ links the \nsystem to the closest weather data source available.\nUsers may\
    \ also take a photo of the given system for a quick \nvisual reference. This might\

    \ names for irrigation systems, but these may be \neasy to forget.\nOn the same\
    \ screen where the irrigation location is identi-\nfied, users must name the new\
    \ system (Figure 3). The name \nshould be something meaningful to the user, particularly\
    \ \nif multiple systems will be added. Example names might \ninclude “North Yard,”\
    \ “Pool Area,” “Tom’s Backyard,” etc.\nStep 3. Soil Information\nNext, users select\
    \ the soil type from a list that includes sand, \nsandy loam, loam, silt loam,\
    \ clay loam, and clay. Most soils \nin Florida are either sand or sandy loam.\
    \ The most common \nsoils in Georgia are sandy loam or loam.\nThe user also inputs\
    \ the root depth. Root depth refers to the \ndepth of the soil where roots are\
    \ present that are irrigated \nwith the irrigation system. A default value for\
    \ root depth is \nprovided, but it can be adjusted within a reasonable range \n\
    based on user knowledge. The soil type and root depth are \nused to calculate\
    \ soil water-holding capacity. This helps to \nensure that the app-generated schedule\
    \ does not recom-\nmend over-irrigation resulting in leaching or runoff. The \n\
    soil water-holding capacity is the amount of water the soil \ncan hold without\
    \ losing it to drainage. \nStep 4. Adding Zones to the System\nIn this step, users\
    \ enter the irrigation system zones. Users \nmay input multiple zones and give\
    \ each zone unique \ncharacteristics (Figure 4). For each zone, users will need\
    \ a \nname (description), sprinkler type, sprinkler rate, and days \nwhen irrigation\
    \ occurs. This information should match \nFigure 2.  Location selection for new\

    \ of the user’s irrigation system. The sprinkler \ntype can be micro, spray, multi-stream\
    \ spray, gear driven \nrotors, or impact sprinklers. A standard rate is provided\
    \ \nfor each sprinkler type, but the rate is adjustable if the user \nhas better\
    \ information about the system. The standard rate \nfor micro, multi-stream, gear\
    \ driven rotors, and impact \nsprinkler types is 0.5 in/hr. The standard rate\
    \ for the spray \nsprinkler type is 1.5 in/hr. Users select the days of the week\
    \ \nwhen irrigation occurs by touching the day boxes. Blue \ncoloring indicates\
    \ that irrigation occurs on that day.\nMany users may be subject to water restrictions\
    \ that only \nallow irrigation on certain days. This should be considered \nwhen\
    \ entering the days of the week to irrigate. If you are \nunsure of current watering\
    \ restrictions, check with your \ncounty’s UF/IFAS Extension office (http://solutionsforyour-\n\
    life.ufl.edu/map/) or your local water management district.\nStep 5. Irrigation\
    \ Schedule Generated\nAfter finishing the irrigation system and zone input, the\
    \ \nuser should select “save,” and then the user receives an \nirrigation schedule\
    \ for each zone of the system (Figure 5). \nThe schedule is in units of time (hours\
    \ and minutes). This \ninformation is designed so that the user can easily take\
    \ \nthe recommended time schedule and modify his or her \nautomatic irrigation\
    \ system. Once the system is updated \nwith the new schedule, no further action\
    \ is needed until the \napp notifies the user that actions should be taken.\n\
    The app also checks to make sure the irrigation amounts \nrecommended do not exceed\
    \ soil water-holding capacity. \nIf the input data results in this circumstance,\
    \ the user \nwill receive a message that he or she needs to modify the \nnumber\
    \ of irrigation days and/or the irrigation system.\nThe irrigation schedule provided\
    \ by the app is based \non user inputs and site-specific weather data. The app\
    \ \nuses observed weather data from the Florida Automated \nWeather Network (FAWN)\
    \ or Georgia Automated Environ-\nmental Monitoring Network (AEMN) weather station\
    \ that \nis closest to the irrigation system (For more information \nabout FAWN\
    \ and AEMN, visit http://fawn.ifas.uf.edu and \nhttp://georgiaweather.net). Irrigation\
    \ is calculated using \nthe FAO Penman-Monteith method to estimate reference \n\
    evapotranspiration (ETo) with region-specific crop coef-\nficients (Kc) (Zotarelli\
    \ et al. 2010). Crop coefficients used \nare provided in Table 1. This version\
    \ of the tool considers \nirrigation to be equal to ETc where: ETc = Kc * ETo.\n\
    Irrigation schedules are determined by averaging the last \nfive days of reference\
    \ evapotranspiration (ETo) and multi-\nplying by the appropriate crop coefficient.\
    \ Every 15 days a \nnew schedule is determined, and users receive a notification\
    \ \nthat their schedules need to be changed (Figure 6).\nStep 6. Forecast Information\n\
    In addition to providing a real-time irrigation schedule, the \napp also provides\
    \ current conditions, forecasts of tempera-\nture and rainfall probability for\
    \ the next few hours, and \nFigure 4.  Inputting irrigation system information\

    \ \nWeather Service (NWS); for more information about NWS, \nvisit http://weather.gov.\
    \ \nApp users receive notifications if more than 0.4 inches \nof rain occurs 24\
    \ hours prior to irrigation. An example \nnotification for such an event is: “A\
    \ rain event occurred in \n(your location) area. Please check (your irrigation\
    \ zone) \nand skip tomorrow’s irrigation if appropriate.” Notifications \nare\
    \ also sent if the probability of rain is higher than 60% \nfor the next 24 hours.\
    \ An example would be: “There is over \n75% chance of rain for (your system) area\
    \ in the next 24 \nhrs. Adjust irrigation as appropriate” (Figure 8). Historical\
    \ \nnotifications are accessible in the app using the menu \n(Figure 9). Users\
    \ receive notifications to further refine \ntheir irrigation schedules to minimize\
    \ the occurrence of \nirrigation-generated runoff or drainage.\nUsing the App\n\
    Once you install the app and enter information specific to \nyour site, the app\
    \ is working! Use the app schedule to set \nthe timer on the automatic irrigation\
    \ system by zone. Next, \nread app notifications and alter the schedule as needed.\
    \ No \nadditional changes are needed to the app unless there is a \nchange in\
    \ the irrigation system.\nSummary\nThe Smartirrigation Turf app provides an easy\
    \ way to \ndetermine your irrigation schedule for better management \nof turf.\
    \ The irrigation schedule it generates is based on \nreal-time ETo data at a weather\
    \ station near the system \nlocation. Using this app for irrigation is expected\

    \ and machine learning is a hotspot research area in the domain of agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture \nanalytics is a data intensive multidisciplinary problem. Big data\
    \ analytics becomes a key technology to perform analysis \nof voluminous data.\
    \ Irrigation water management is a challenging task for sustainable agriculture.\
    \ It depends on various \nparameters related to climate, soil and weather conditions.\
    \ For accurate estimation of requirement of water for a crop a strong \nmodeling\
    \ is required. This paper aims to review the application of big data based decision\
    \ support system framework for \nsustainable water irrigation management using\
    \ intelligent learning approaches. We examined how such developments can be \n\
    leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, analytics\
    \ and decision support tools for agriculture \nirrigation water system. Moreover,\
    \ water irrigation management need to rapidly adapt state-of-the-art using big\
    \ data technolo-\ngies and ICT information technologies with the focus of developing\
    \ application based on analytical modeling approach. This \nstudy introduces the\
    \ area of research, including a irrigation water management in smart agriculture,\
    \ the crop water model \nrequirement, and the methods of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ decision support system, and research motivation.\n1 Introduction\nWATER-Every\
    \ drop is precious, save it.  Water is the main \nlimiting factor of agricultural\
    \ development in semi-arid and \narid climates. It is a critical input for enhancing\
    \ agricultural \nproductivity. Arthur Keith said that the advancement of agri-\n\
    culture is the first major step for civilized life [1]. Even after \nsix decades\
    \ of planned development, agriculture has played \nan important role in the Indian\
    \ economy. However, the agri-\nculture sector of India has been transformed via\
    \ the effective \ndeployment of Information and Communication Technolo-\ngies\
    \ (ICTs) in traditional to modern practices which pro-\nvide various services\
    \ (such as- IoT agriculture, smart water \nmanagement, soil management, plant\
    \ diseases, crop manage-\nment, geo-spatial image and livestock monitoring).\n\
    In India, the demand of water for the agriculture and \nindustry sectors is continuously\
    \ increasing to fulfill the \nneeds of 1.366 billion people. Central Indian Punjab\
    \ is well-\nknown for its agricultural activities and has occupied a high \npercentage\
    \ of the land area all over India, and its agricultural \nproduction mainly depends\
    \ on irrigation.\nPunjab has 97.95% highest gross irrigation of the total \ncropped\
    \ area [2]. Recently, the achievement of the Green \nRevolution is endangered\
    \ by a significant decline in water \nresources. As a result, water conservation\
    \ and precision agri-\nculture are becoming vital issues in tropical climate areas.\
    \ \nWheat and Maize are the most commonly cultivated crops \nand have high water\
    \ consumption in Punjab, India. The \nmajor challenge in agriculture sustainability\
    \ and dawdling \nis due to climate change; therefore, every drop of freshwater\
    \ \nneeds to be utilize effectively and efficiently.\nTo overcome these challenges,\
    \ the multivariate, complex, \nand unpredictable agricultural ecosystems must\
    \ be well \nunderstood by continuously analyzing, measuring, and mon-\nitoring\
    \ several physical aspects and phenomena [3]. New \ntechnologies and knowledge\
    \ can help in this complex deci-\nsion-making. The fundamental idea is that the\
    \ DSS should \nserve as a farm management tool, supporting farm managers \nin\
    \ making decisions on irrigation, whether to irrigate and, \nif so, which field\
    \ with how much water. Wani et al. [4] pre-\nsented a thorough investigation to\
    \ evaluate the possibility of \nusing Machine Learning models to identify plant\
    \ diseases.\nIn the early twentieth century, irrigation is the most \ncrucial\
    \ practice no doubt and needs effective utilization. \n * Mandeep Kaur Saggi \n\

    \ \n1 3\nFarmers required to predict the need of water for the crops, \nto confirm\
    \ the data provided by agricultural weather stations \nor to get insight the free\
    \ water surface evaporation in lakes \nor dams. Agricultural irrigation scheduling\
    \ is becoming a \nvery important managerial activity whose ultimate purpose \n\
    is to achieve effective and efficient utilization of water. The \nprimary objective\
    \ of good irrigation scheduling is to apply \nthe right amount of water at right\
    \ time.\nIrrigation scheduling improves the water use efficiency \nand focus on\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods \nfor understanding of spatial variations\
    \ of ET. It determine \nirrigation applications such as identifying the water\
    \ balance \ncomponent, integrated various sensing technologies into \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling models and control, new improved \nsensor technology and integrated\
    \ water quality constraints \ninto irrigation scheduling and control [5]. Figure 1\
    \ presents \nthe six identified relevant works, indicating the smart water \n\
    management related research work such as crop water mod-\neling, soil monitoring,\
    \ water quality, drones field monitor-\ning, weather forecasting, and irrigation\
    \ scheduling.\nThe ultimate irrigation potential of India has been esti-\nmated\
    \ to be 139.5 million ha, comprising 58.5 million ha \nfrom major and medium schemes,\
    \ 15 million ha from minor \nirrigation schemes, 66 million ha from groundwater\
    \ exploi-\ntation, and an estimated 77 million ha beyond 2025 from \nfreshwater\
    \ use for irrigation [6]. It is approximated that after \ngaining the full potential\
    \ of the irrigation, nearly 50% of the \ntotal cultivated area will hold out rain-fed.\n\
    Irrigation is the most important factor for escalating the \nagricultural production\
    \ of plants. It is essential to determine \nthe quantity of water to get the optimal\
    \ benefits from the irri-\ngation, which depends on some factors such as the environ-\n\
    ment, type of crop, subsurface geo-hydrological condition, \nand the stage of\
    \ its growth.\nThe questions arise in the irrigation scheduling are as \nfollows:\
    \ (i) How to apply irrigation water?, (ii) How much \nto irrigate?, (iii) When\
    \ to irrigate. Currently, irrigation deci-\nsion-making systems are enforced to\
    \ the agricultural field \naiming for specific crop at a given area [7]. It is\
    \ difficult to \nbe practiced to different crops and areas. Under the grow-\n\
    ing environment, the amount of irrigation is defined as the \ndepth of water required\
    \ to meet the crop water loss through \nevapotranspiration. It can be obtained\
    \ via prediction using \nindirect channels or field measurement techniques. However,\
    \ \nthe amount and timing of water have major impact on qual-\nity of crop and\
    \ its yield. Several methods are applied for the \nirrigation scheduling such\
    \ as pan evaporation, soil moisture \nbasis, leaf water potential, and based on\
    \ growth-stages. The \ndemand of water can be fulfill by full or partial irrigation\
    \ in \nall methods.\n1.1  Motivation\nAs technology rapidly spread in a few decades,\
    \ precision \nagriculture is the key to fostering a new revolution in Irriga-\n\
    tion scheduling. The United Nations statistical data indicate \nthat agriculture\
    \ consumes 70% of the overall use of water \nworldwide, compared with 20% for\
    \ industry and 10% for \ndomestic use [8]. To ensure the proper use of water sup-\n\
    plies in irrigation we need more effective technologies. \nAutomatic irrigation\
    \ scheduling techniques replaced man-\nual irrigation which was based upon crop\
    \ water estimation. \nThe crop evapotranspiration can be determined by weather\
    \ \nparameters such as max–min temperature, humidity, wind \nspeed, solar radiations,\
    \ and even the crop factors such as the \nstage of growth, crop height, and the\
    \ soil properties for the \ndevelopment of irrigation scheduling. The machine\
    \ learning \nand deep learning advanced technologies provide direction \nand motivation\
    \ to propose a novel application on crop water \nmodeling. The influence of several\
    \ factors on crop yields and \ntemperature, precipitation have been found to have\
    \ maxi-\nmum influence on the yields of different crops [9].\n2  Reference Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\n“Evapotranspiration contains two processes, evapo-\nration in which water\
    \ is lost from the soil and plant \nsurface, and transpiration from plant surfaces\
    \ to the \natmosphere” [10].\nFig. 1  Smart water management in smart agriculture\n\
    4457\nA Survey Towards Decision Support System on Smart Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\nThe water irrigation is enforced to match the\
    \ needs of evapo-\ntranspiration of crop. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nneeds to estimate the daily crop evapotranspiration accu-\nrately. Evapotranspiration\
    \ of crops differs significantly over \nthe growing season mainly due to alterations\
    \ in climatic \nconditions and crop cover. It also varies among the crops. \n\
    The information about crop water demand (i.e., ET) is a \ncrucial practical consideration\
    \ in the planning, developing, \nand working of water and irrigation management\
    \ systems. \nFigure 2 presented the concept of ETo.\nTable 1 presented the ET\
    \ that affecting by weather ele-\nment. The reference evapotranspiration is approximated\
    \ \nfrom meteorological data (humidity, temperature, wind \nrun/wind speed, sunshine\
    \ hours/solar radiation) by using \nthe Penman-Monteith equation. However, the\
    \ adjusted pan \nevaporation measurements are also used.\n2.1  Factors Affecting\
    \ ETo\nClimate and weather play crucial role in determining \nlong-term and day-to-day\
    \ activities in the agriculture. The \ndemand of crop water is determined largely\
    \ by weather vari-\nables. Rainfall is the foremost weather variable that affects\
    \ \nthe water resources development planning, irrigation plan-\nning and agricultural\
    \ cropping. The main climatic/weather \ncomponents crucial for agriculture are\
    \ rainfall, maximum/\nminimum temperature, solar radiation, sunshine duration,\
    \ \nhumidity, photo-period or sunshine hour, wind speed, and \nnight temperature\
    \ [11] as depicted in Fig. 3. Table 2 shows \nthe different empirical methods\
    \ with weather parameters for \nestimation of ETo.\nWeather elements controls\
    \ the crop water demand and \ncrop ET. The ET depends upon the different weather\

    \ \n(Allen et al. 1998) [10] is the most dominant as compared \nto others empirical\

    where, ETo is the reference evapotranspiration (mm∕day−1);  \nΔ = slope of saturation\
    \ vapor pressure function (kPa °C−1 ); \nR n = net radiation (MJ m−2day−1 ); 훾\
    \ = psychometric constant \n(kPa °C−1); G = soil heat flux density (MJ m−2day−1\
    \ ); W s = \naverage 24-h wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1) ; T mean = mean \nair\
    \ temperature (°C); e a = actual vapour pressure(kPa); e s \n= saturation vapour\
    \ pressure(kPa); and (es − ea ) = vapour \npressure deficit (kPa).\nHowever, ETo\
    \ can be determined accurately by this \nmethod, large scale meteorological data\
    \ requirement at spe-\ncific spatio-temporal scales (vapor pressure deficit, wind\
    \ \nspeed, minimum and maximum air temperatures, and solar \nradiation) are quite\
    \ often not available in many develop-\ning countries [24]. Thus, the alternate\
    \ models are needed to \nestimate ETo when the available data are either insufficient\
    \ \nor limited. So, it is important to explore a simpler model to \ncalculate\
    \ ETo using fewer weather properties and a reason-\nable precision.\nThe need\
    \ of crop water depends on some factors: crop \ngrowth/stages, crop type and the\
    \ climate are given in detail \n[25]:\n3  Crop Evapotranspiration ETc\n“The crop\
    \ evapotranspiration denoted as ETc,is the \ncrop water requirements or crop water\
    \ need.”\nThe need for crop water is the depth (or quantify of water \nrequired\
    \ to cope with the loss of water through evapotranspi-\nration. In other words,\
    \ water needs to be cultivated optimally \nby different crops. Crop-growth models\
    \ were developed to \nimprove the understanding of crop dynamics and to pre-\n\
    dict crop growth and production under various agronomic \nconditions [35]. The\
    \ continuous monitoring of the soil sta-\ntus water, the conditions of crop growth,\
    \ and its spatial and \ntemporal patterns will help in irrigation and precision\
    \ water \nplanning. Evaporation and transpiration variations in the \nfield and\
    \ grass crops can be integrated into dual crop coeffi-\ncient or single crop coefficient\
    \ (Kc ): a soil evaporation coef-\nficient (Ke ) and a basal crop (Kcb ) and calculated\
    \ by Eq. (2).\n3.1  Climate Based ETc\nThe combination of two different processes\
    \ by which water \nevaporates from the soil surface and transpiration from the\
    \ \nplant is referred as evapotranspiration. It is determined \n(1)\nETo =\n0.408\
    \ ⋅ Δ ⋅ (Rn − G) + 훾 ⋅\n900\nTmean+273 ⋅ u2 ⋅ (es − ea)\nΔ + 훾(1 + 0.34Ws)\n(2)\n\
    (Kc) = (Kcb) + (Ke).\nby climatic factors including solar radiation, temperature,\
    \ \nwind, and humidity as well as environmental factors. The \nevaporation account\
    \ for approximately 10% of the overall \nevapotranspiration and the transpiration\
    \ of crops constitutes \nthe remaining 90%. Hence, there is a need for crop water\
    \ \nin hot, dry, windy, and sunny areas. For the lowest values \nwhen the wind\
    \ is cold, humid, and cloudy, with little to no \nwind. Climate impact on crop\
    \ water requirements is deter-\nmined by reference crop evapotranspiration ETo\
    \ and gener-\nally expressed per unit of time in millimeters., e.g. mm/day, \n\
    mm/month, or mm/season.\n3.1.1  Crop Type\nThe effect of the crop type in daily\
    \ crop water requirements \nis often referred to as a fully grown crop; Plant\
    \ height has \nreached maximum; Plants cover the ground optimally; prob-\nably\
    \ they began to flowering or developing to set grain; The \nwater demand is greatest\
    \ when the crop is fully cultivated. \nTheir water needs are called the “peak\
    \ period”.\nThe type of crop that has also affected the total growing \nduration\
    \ of crop development is known by seasonal crop \nwater need and can be obtained.\
    \ The best possible local \ndata can be obtained on the duration of the total\
    \ seasons of \nthe various plants cultivated in a region. Such data can be \n\
    collected from, for example, the seed supplier, the Exten-\nsion Service, the\
    \ Irrigation Department, or the Ministry of \nAgriculture.\n3.1.2  Growth Stages\
    \ of the Crop\nWhile planting and in the initial stage, evaporation is more \n\
    essential than transpiration. When the crop is fully devel-\noped, the need for\
    \ crop water is estimated to be 50% during \nthe mid-season phase. At the stage\
    \ of development, the crop \ndemand moderately increases from 50% of the maximum\
    \ \ncrop water requirement to the maximum crop water. Thus, \nthe maximum amount\
    \ of crop water is extended to the end \nof crop development stage, which is the\
    \ starting of mid-\nseason stage.\nThe value of K c depends on different factors\
    \ such as can-\nopy cover density, agriculture operations, weather variable, \n\
    type of crop, soil moisture, and growth stage [10]. The idea \nof crop coefficient\
    \ K c is proposed by Jensen [36] and has \nbeen improved by many researchers [37,\
    \ 38].\nHowever, K c method has the capability to determine the \nactual crop\
    \ evapotranspiration ETc precisely. According to \nthe FAO methodology, the four\
    \ growing stages of a crop are \nthe initial stage, crop development stage, mid-season\
    \ stage, \nand end-season stage (Allen et al. 1998) [10]. The crop coef-\nficient\
    \ method can be expressed as follows:\n4460\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\nThe\
    \ two-step crop coefficient K c reference evapotranspi-\nration has been a successful\
    \ method to predict the evapo-\ntranspiration (ET) and crop water requirements.\
    \ The total \ngrowing period is divided into 4 growth stages shown in \nFig. 4\
    \ [39]:\n• The initial stage the period ranges from transplanting or \nsowing\
    \ till crop covers the 10% of ground.\n• The crop development stage the period\
    \ begins at the com-\npletion of the initial stage and remains until the full\
    \ ground \nhas been covered (ground cover 70–80%). It does not cer-\ntainly mean\
    \ that the crop is at its maximum height.\n• The mid-season stage the period begins\
    \ at the completion \nof the crop development stage and remains till maturity;\
    \ it \nconsists grain-setting and flowering.\n• The late-season stage the period\
    \ starts at the completion \nof mid-season stage and remains until the last day\
    \ of the \nharvest; it consists ripening.\nwhere ETc represents the requirement\
    \ of crop water (mm \nd −1 ), ETo the reference crop water requirement (mm d −1\
    \ ), \nand K c the crop coefficient and calculated by Eq. (3). \nBesides, Kingra\
    \ et al. (2004) computed crop water require-\nment for Wheat and transplanted\
    \ Rice at Ludhiana, reported \nthat the Wheat crop used about 315 mm water whereas\
    \ the \nrice crop used about 780 mm water during its growing sea-\nson [40]. Saggi\
    \ et al. [41] collected the K c values as case \nstudy from Punjab agricultural\
    \ University (PAU), Ludhi-\nana and estimated the ETc for two crops. The K c values\
    \ of \nWheat1 crop were 0.4, 1.15 & 0.4 while for Wheat2 were \n0.5, 1.36, 1.42,\
    \ and 0.42 for the initial, mid and last stage of \ngrowth respectively. The length\
    \ of time (days) for four sea-\nsons of Wheat1 were 29, 55, 14 32 days while for\
    \ Wheat2 24, \n46, 35, 42 days. The K c values of Maize crop were 0.7, 0.85, \n\
    1.15 & 1.05 for the initial, mid, and end-stage of growth \n(3)\nETc = Kc × ETo\n\
    respectively. The length of time (days) for four seasons of \nMaize were 35, 18,\
    \ 17, and 15 days used in different stages. \nDetail of selected crops and period\
    \ of data for the study.\n4  Irrigation Scheduling\nIn 1996, Howell explored the\
    \ effects on water use and irri-\ngation scheduling [42]. It is an application\
    \ mechanism that \ncan lead to the effective and efficient use of water. This\
    \ \nefficiency can be enhanced by using advanced methods \nof irrigation. However,\
    \ even in advanced irrigation meth-\nods, irrigation scheduling at the farm level\
    \ is required. It \nis necessary when rainfall is deficient to remunerate for\
    \ \nthe water lost by evapotranspiration. The irrigation water \nneed is described\
    \ as the crop water requirement minus the \nfruitful rainfall. It is defined in\
    \ mm/month or mm/day. The \nmain goal of good irrigation scheduling is to apply\
    \ the cor-\nrect amount of water at the right time, and make sure that \nwater\
    \ is accessible when the crop requires it.\nAccording to predetermined schedules,\
    \ the irrigation \nwater is supplied to the cultivation by keep track of the \n\
    following [43]:\n• The status of soil water;\n• The need of crop water.\nThe purpose\
    \ of our research work is to present, analyze, \nand optimize some measure of\
    \ performance of the crop \nproduction under a set of specified conditions, such\
    \ as the \nlimited or unlimited total volume of water for the growing \nseason.\
    \ The main factors that influence the solution and \nimplementation of the irrigation\
    \ scheduling problem are \nthe characteristics of climate soil, crop, irrigation\
    \ water, \nand irrigation technology.\nJudicious usage of water for crop production\
    \ needs \nknowledge of water quality, soil, weather, crop, and drain-\nage situation.\
    \ The increase in efficiency of pumping sys-\ntems and conveyance need to review.\n\
    The soil types and climatic conditions have a consid-\nerable effect on the major\
    \ practical aspects of irrigation \nsuch as how much amount of water should be\
    \ supplied and \nwhen to a selected crop.\nA time-consuming and complex process\
    \ is a precise \nestimation of the irrigation schedule [25]. However, the \nadvent\
    \ of advanced technology has made it simpler and \nthe water supply can be scheduled\
    \ precisely to meet the \nwater requirements of cultivation. The timing for irriga-\n\
    tion applications can be fixed dates or on flexible dates. \nThe quantity should\
    \ not exceed the crop requirements per \napplication, including the leaching of\
    \ salts; otherwise, \nany excess water would not only reduce the efficiency of\
    \ \nits usage but can hinder the crop development. Standard \nFig. 4  Various\

    \ performance metrics are crop yields \nand net benefits per unit area.\nThe optimal\
    \ irrigation schedule is any schedule that \noptimizes the adopted output measurement\
    \ while meeting \nseveral defined constraints. Any schedule that optimizes \n\
    the adopted measure of performance while satisfying some \nspecified constraints\
    \ is the optimal irrigation schedule.\n4.1  Methods of Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    Different techniques can be apply to the plants with irriga-\ntion water and each\
    \ approach has its benefits and limita-\ntions. In this context, the best approach\
    \ to accommodate \nlocal conditions should be taken into account. Earlier, the\
    \ \nprimary irrigation method is applied via the source of supply \nsuch as a\
    \ bucket watering or a well. Although, it is a time-\nconsuming method.\nMore\
    \ advanced water application methods are used in \nlarger areas where irrigation\
    \ is needed. The suitability of \nseveral irrigation methods, i.e. sprinkler,\
    \ surface, or drip \nirrigation, depends on the following aspects: Natural condi-\n\
    tions, type of crop, type of technology, previous experience \nwith irrigation,\
    \ required labor inputs and costs and benefits.\nSurface irrigation may be categorized\
    \ based on mode of \nwater application as depicted in Fig. 5. [44] and Fig. 6\
    \ shown \nthe different types of irrigation methods. Table 3 presented \nthe different\
    \ types of irrigation methods, advantages and \ntheir applications.\nFig. 5  Irrigation\
    \ methods\nFig. 6  Types of irrigation \nscheduling\n4462\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain\
    \ \n1 3\n4.1.1  Border Irrigation\nSurface irrigation is where the water is applied\
    \ to the sur-\nface of field by gravity flow. The water is applied into small\
    \ \nchannels (furrows) or complete surface is flooded with water \n(basin irrigation)\
    \ or strips of land (borders). Border irriga-\ntion is a modern method of surface\
    \ irrigation. Borders are \nuniformly graded strips of land and long, set apart\
    \ by earth \nbunds. They are also known as border strips. There are sev-\neral\
    \ ways to fed the irrigation water to the border such as by \nusing small gates,\
    \ launching the channel bank, using spiles \nor siphons. A sheet of water is guided\
    \ by the earth bunds and \nflows down the slope of the border. It is mostly suited\
    \ to gen-\nerate long uninterrupted field lengths for facility of machine \noperations\
    \ in the huge mechanized farms. Borders can be up \nto 3-30m wide and at least\
    \ 800m in length depend on several \nfactors. It is less applicable to farms on\
    \ small-scale consist-\ning animal-powered cultivation techniques or hand labor.\n\
    4.1.2  Sprinkler Irrigation\nIt is equivalent to natural rainfall, where water\
    \ is pumped \nusing a pipe system and then rotating sprinkler heads used \nto\
    \ spray onto the crops. Further, the spray is applied into the \nair via sprinklers\
    \ to breaks it into small drops of water that \nfall on the ground. The sprinklers,\
    \ pump supply system, and \noperating conditions must be developed to apply the\
    \ water \nuniformly. It is well suited for the most field, row, and tree \ncrops.\
    \ Water can be sprayed under or over the crop canopy. \nAlthough, large sprinklers\
    \ are not suggested for delicate \ncrops such as lettuce due to the large size\
    \ water drops gen-\nerated by the sprinklers can harm the crops.\n4.1.3  Drip\
    \ Irrigation\nIt involves application of dripping water to the soil from a \n\
    small diameter plastic pipe systems attached with outlets \ncalled emitters or\
    \ drippers at very low rates (2–20 l/h). It is \nalso called as trickle irrigation.\
    \ Water is applied very close \nto plants so that only part of the soil in which\
    \ the roots grow \nis wetted, instead of sprinkler and surface irrigation, which\
    \ \nconsists wetting the complete soil profile [25]. It is well suited \nfor trees,\
    \ vine crops and row crops (vegetables, soft fruit), \nwhere one or more emitters\
    \ can be given for each plant. It is \nconsidered for high-value crops only due\
    \ to high capital costs \nrequired for installation of a drip system.\n4.1.4 \
    \ Need of Irrigation Scheduling\nHydrological, climatologist, and agronomical\
    \ processes play \nan significant part in the development of irrigation agriculture\
    \ \nproduction. These studies were mainly developed to estimate \ndaily, weekly,\
    \ or monthly evapotranspiration. The precise \napproximation of evapotranspiration\
    \ is an important process \nthat plays a key role in crop planning, deployment\
    \ and produc-\ntion of irrigation systems.\nIn recent years, several approaches\
    \ have been developed to \novercome the problems and obstacles that occur with\
    \ smart \nfarming, such as species recognition, yield prediction, disease \ndetection,\
    \ drought, crop productivity problems and irrigation \nmanagement.\nSo, there\
    \ is a great need to explore more research studies \nto enhance the scalability\
    \ of irrigation scheduling based on \nadvanced data analytic and machine learning.\
    \ Some research \nhas been done in the decision support system to improve the\

    \ Irrigation Scheduling Using Machine Learning…\n1 3\n5  Decision Support System\n\
    The idea of a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation \nwater management\
    \ is introduced in the 1970’s to assist \nusers in complex decision- making processes\
    \ and efficient \nuse of irrigation water at the farm level [53].\nDecision support\
    \ system (DSS) has great potential \nin agriculture era, if the water irrigation\
    \ management \nresearch is combined with the modeling approach using \nmachine\
    \ learning analytics and agriculture statistical, \nthe research level will be\
    \ achieved in different levels of \nthe agricultural development sector. The decision\
    \ sup-\nport system for crop water irrigation scheduling based on \ncrop water\
    \ model by estimation of evapotranspiration as \nweather parameter, historical\
    \ dataset, and using of differ-\nent Irrigation water management methods.\nThe\
    \ decision support system is an integrated approach \nto solve complex problems,\
    \ combining the computer cal-\nculation and data storage capacities with human\
    \ language \nand perception, support of mathematical model statistics, \nproviding\
    \ decision-maker. It is known as a primary tool \nin management for better decision\
    \ making and environ-\nmental resources. In 1985, Guariso et al. firstly intro-\n\
    duced the concept of DSS. Various researchers surveyed \nthe advanced use of the\
    \ management of DSS for water \nresources [54]. Today, it is required for the\
    \ on-farm irri-\ngation water management due to its use of the computer \nto relate\
    \ soil, crop, and water quality conditions. It can be \nused for analyzing and\
    \ determining how much water is \nneeded and when it should give next time.\n\
    5.1  Statistics\nThe statistical approach leads to the process of collection,\
    \ \npresentation, analyze, and apply the data to make deci-\nsions, problems solving,\
    \ design products, and processes. It \nis very useful for us to explore the description\
    \ and under-\nstand the variability. Statistical methods contributed for \nmaking\
    \ scientific judgments in the face of variation uncer-\ntainty. Russo et al. (2015)\
    \ Bayesian method is used to esti-\nmate the hydrological properties and irrigation\
    \ needs for \nan under-constrained mass balance model. They presented \nan approach\
    \ Markov chain Montecarlo algorithm to solve \nfor spreading of values for each\
    \ unknown parameter in a \nconceptual mass balance model [55].\n5.2  Machine Learning\n\
    From the last decade, machine learning and data analytics is \na hot-spot research\
    \ area in the domain of agriculture. Among \nthe other definitions, machine learning\
    \ is described as the \nscientific are that allows the machines to learn without\
    \ being \nstrictly programmed [56].\nMachine learning models have demonstrated\
    \ excellent \nresults for crop-based modeling in recent days. There is a \nvariety\
    \ of machine learning models based on prediction \nfor reference crop evapotranspiration.\
    \ The main contri-\nbution of our research prediction, by applying machine-\n\
    learning and data analytics based modeling to predict crop \nevapotranspiration.\n\
    Yamaç and Todorovic [57], revealed the satisfactory out-\nputs of ML with R2 ranged\
    \ from 0.81 to 0.97 [58] by apply-\ning several ML models on the climatic data.\
    \ A comparative \nanalysis was performed by Shiri et al. [59] to estimate the\
    \ \nETo using various intelligent models, namely ANN, ANFIS, \nsupport vector\
    \ machine (SVM), and GEP. In the domain \nof agriculture, big data analytic technologies\
    \ have offered \nnewly predictive models for ETo estimation, e.g. generalized\
    \ \nneuro-fuzzy models [60], artificial neural network (ANN), \n[61], adaptive\
    \ neuro-fuzzy inference system [62], multi-layer \nPerceptrons neural network\
    \ (MLPNN), Zaji and Bonakdari \n[63], extreme learning machine (ELM) Abdullah\
    \ et al. [64], \nmultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and least \n\
    square support vector regression (LSSVM) [65], GRNN \n(2016), ELM, WNN and GANN\
    \ [66]. Moreover, the Auto-\nML technique is found to show excellence in application\
    \ of \nirrigation scheduling where border irrigation and sprinkler \nirrigation\
    \ methods are deployed.\n5.3  Deep Learning\nThe deep learning technique is now\
    \ practical to address mil-\nlions or even billions of weights among neurons for\
    \ better \nunderstanding of behaviors due to current advances in com-\nputational\
    \ power, in terms of software, hardware and parallel \nprocessing. It is accepted\
    \ to have established a revolutionary \nera since it can address the issues that\
    \ have countered AI for \na long time.\nDeep feed-forward neural networks are\
    \ based on multi-\nlayer Perceptrons (MLPs) published by Alexey Ivakhnenko \n\
    and Lapa in 1965 [67]. It can be used to model the com-\nplicated relationship\
    \ between input and output due of its \nhigh hierarchical structure model training,\
    \ construction and \nfeature learning [68]. It has been used in the hydrological\
    \ \nand agricultural fields because of the difficulty of software \ndata availability,\
    \ costs, and complexity, e.g., approximation \nand modeling of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ [42], Wang et al. \n(2018) determined that traditional ML and DL models are\
    \ \nequivalent as a data-driven artificial intelligence method that \ncan be used\
    \ to model the complicated relationship between \ninput and output [68]. However,\
    \ DL has a benefit over tra-\nditional ML, due to wits high hierarchical structure\
    \ model.\n4464\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\n5.4  Big Data Analytics\nBig Data\
    \ is a fascinating new field at the joint of advanced \nanalytics, data science,\
    \ statistics, and machine learning. Big \ndata and analytics have tremendous development\
    \ benefits \nin the agriculture economy. Advanced big data analytics \nhave improved\
    \ the tools and technologies that changed the \nway of real-time applications\
    \ to make better decision pro-\ncessing, high-performance platform to efficiently\
    \ analyze, \ncapturing, storing and managing large scale of big data. In \naddition,\
    \ agriculture practices are becoming increasingly \ndata-derived and data-enabled\
    \ with the recent development \nof 5G, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things\
    \ and big data \ntechnologies [69]. To obtain insights from these data Saggi \n\

    \ In India, ground-water (GW) is an essential \nsource of water supply in agriculture\
    \ and Rice-Wheat crop-\nping system has resulted in significant increase in irrigation\
    \ \nwater need approximately 73% with GW in Punjab. India is \na seventh largest\
    \ subcontinent country by geographical area \nin South Asia, nowadays India ranks\
    \ 2nd worldwide in farm \nproduction and 1st largest country in irrigated land\
    \ area. \nWater conservation and precision agriculture is becoming a \nvital issue\
    \ in the tropical climate areas. Central Indian Pun-\njab is a well-known for\
    \ its agriculture activities and occupied \nhigh percentage of land area in all\
    \ over India.\n6.1  A Bibliometric Perspective of Irrigation \nScheduling\nIn\
    \ this section, the articles from Science direct digital data-\nbase is considered.\
    \ Figure 8 shows the number of papers \npublished from 1995 to 2021 in field of\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning, reference evapotranspiration and crop evapotranspira-\n\
    tion. We have selected only elsevier science direct library \nto find out research\
    \ articles, where we found 34,083 results \nin area of irrigation scheduling,\
    \ 32,775 papers in reference \nevapotranspiration and 14,261 results articles\
    \ in crop evapo-\ntranspiration (crop water need).\nIrrigation scheduling, ETo\
    \ and ETc trends are represented \nby Green, Blue, and Yellow colored lines respectively.\
    \ Fig-\nure 8 shows the article type in which review reports, case \nreports,\
    \ data articles, mini review, and many more articles. \nFigure 8 shows the number\
    \ of top-journal publications. \nSeveral computer simulation techniques and decision\
    \ sup-\nport systems have been developed to estimate ETo , ETc and \nCrop Water\
    \ Requirement (CWR). It is important to identify \nchanges in the hydrological\
    \ cycle when we want to predict \nthe impacts of climate change. However, current\
    \ studies on \nclimate change must be expanded to cover the entire globe. \nThe\
    \ two main components of the global water cycle are \nevaporation and precipitation.\n\
    Methods for measuring evapotranspiration from meteoro-\nlogical data include a\
    \ number of climatology, and the physi-\ncal inputs which is directly estimated\
    \ in weather stations. \nOther parameters are associated with measured data and\
    \ can \nbe obtained by directly or empirical methods. Meteorologi-\ncal data can\
    \ be expressed in several units.\n6.2  Estimation and Forecasting \nof Evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo\nThe application of Evapotranspiration (ETo ) in irrigation \nscheduling\
    \ is divided into different categories for literature \nsection such as statistical,\
    \ machine learning, evolutionary \nmodels, and decision support system [42, 71,\
    \ 72]. We have \npresented a comprehensive review literature for reference \n\
    evapotranspiration as follows:\nFigure 9 presented the process of DSS for crop\
    \ water irri-\ngation scheduling. ETo is an imperative aspect of the hydro-\n\
    logical cycle that is stirring water availability on the earth \nsurface. It is\
    \ one of the significant criteria of accurate quan-\ntification of crop water\
    \ requirement that influence various \nhydrological processes, planing of water\
    \ management and \nresources [62], and requirement of irrigation [73]. Tradition-\n\
    ally, the ETo is estimated at the field scale, but it consumes \nlot of time and\
    \ is difficult to process by complex mathemati-\ncal calculations with various\
    \ climatic variables. Methods \nfor measuring evapotranspiration from meteorological\
    \ data \ninclude a number of climatology, and the field inputs which \nis directly\
    \ estimated in weather stations. Some parameters \nare associated with measured\
    \ data, where as others can be \nobtained directly or through empirical methods.\n\
    6.2.1  Existing Methods Based on Empirical\nSince many years, various researchers\
    \ have established \nreference evapotranspiration ETo estimation with empiri-\n\
    cal methods. There are few categories of ETo estimation \nmethods: Temperature-based,\
    \ Radiation-based, Empirical, \nPan, and many more. Commonly, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith\
    \ \nmethod is applied as the scientific, standard and temperature \nbased method\
    \ to estimate the ETo [10, 74]. FAO-PM has \nbeen extensively adopted because\
    \ to its positive outcomes \nin a variety of climates across the world. However,\
    \ it needs \na significant amount of meteorological data obtained from \nregular\
    \ meteorological observation stations [75].\nTo overcome the existing limitation\
    \ of the FAO-PM \nmodel, various attempts aiming to estimate ETo with limited\
    \ \nobserved data have been made. A large number of studies \nhave focused on\
    \ estimating ETo using empirical methods \nwith limited ground-level data such\
    \ as the Hargreaves and \nSamani equation, Priestley-Taylor equation, and Thorn-\n\
    thwaite equation have been used for estimating (ETo ) by \nTomas-Burguera et al.\
    \ [76].\nETo is estimated with simplified or empirical methods \n(e.g. Lysimetric\
    \ measurements) and it is highly difficult to \nachieve more precise and robust\
    \ approaches [77, 78]. HS \nequation is the most simple and accurate approach\
    \ based on \ntemperature [10, 31]. There are many empirical approaches \nto predict\
    \ the ETo using five mass transfer-based models \n(Ivanov, WMO, Penman, Trabert,\
    \ and Mahringer), five \nradiation-based approach (Tu, PT, Ab, JH, and Mk), and\
    \ \nfive temperature-based approach (HS, modified Hargreaves-\nSamani1 ) (Th,\
    \ BC, MHS1 , and MHS2 ) [79]. Table 4 shows \nthe literature of empirical methods\
    \ for estimation of ETo.\nMalamos et al. [80] investigated the monthly Geo-spa-\n\
    tial ETo with FAO Penman–Monteith using line, polygon, \nand point through a geometry\
    \ independent algorithm. They \n4466\n \nM. K. Saggi, S. Jain \n1 3\nFig. 8  Number\

    \ to cal-\nculate the daily potential evapotranspiration ETo with FAO-\n56 Penman–Monteith\
    \ using T mean , u 2 , R H,and I s parame-\nters. The Potential ETo is estimated\
    \ for current and future \ndrought condition using PDSI tool, Spatial, and Temperature\
    \ \nbased models such as Penman–Monteith, Thornthwaite, and \nHamon methods. They\
    \ have selected T mean , u 2 , R H , I s input \nvariable, and analyzed on MATLAB\
    \ GUI [82].\nYang et al. [83] analyses the daily reference evapotranspi-\nration\
    \ (ETo ) using short-term forecasting with FAO-56 Pen-\nman–Monteith equation,\
    \ Hargreaves–Samani equation, and \nReduced-set Penman–Monteith (RPM). The R language\
    \ is \nused to simulate with various climate parameters including \nT mean , T\
    \ max , T min , u 2 , RHmean , I s , and Vapor pressure (ea).\n6.2.2  Existing\
    \ Methods Based on Machine Learning\nThere have been many studies on hybrid models\
    \ with \nmachine learning, and evolutionary algorithms to estima-\ntion of ETo\
    \ with few climate parameters around the world.\nPatil and Deka [85] investigated\
    \ the performance of \nextreme machine learning (ELM) to quantify the weekly \n\
    ETo in the Thar Desert of India. Also, they have showed \nthe comparison of Artificial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN) with \nthree input variable. The ELM model gives slightly\
    \ higher \naccuracy than empirical, and ANN models.\nWu et al. [86] proposed hybrid\
    \ model using machine \nlearning and soft-computing to estimate the monthly ETo\
    \ in \nsouth China with 26 data stations. The proposed (Kmeans-\nFFA-KELM) approach\
    \ developed with the three approaches \n(K-means clustering, Firefly Algorithms,\
    \ and Kernel \nExtreme Learning Machine model) found higher accuracy \nusing three\
    \ input variables (Temperaturemax , Temperaturemin , \nand R a ). Another study\
    \ showed performance of six remote-\nsensing based ML models to predict the daily\
    \ ETo in the \nAndalusian. The two ELM and MLP models found higher \naccuracy\
    \ than RF, SVM, GRNN, and XGBoost models [87].\nStacking and blending ensemble\
    \ based ML models are \nused to calculate the daily ETo with limited input variables.\
    \ \nTwo-layer ensemble model is build with RF, SVR, MLP, \nLR and KNN models and\
    \ found higher accuracy in terms \nof R 2 ranged from (0.66 to 0.99) as compared\
    \ to empirical \nmodels [88]. Another, ensemble based model is build with \nANN,\
    \ SVM and RF to estimate the ETo with geno-types \nand optimize the ETo with time\
    \ series data, and found the \ncorrect results [89].\nBai et al. [90] proposed\
    \ ensemble-based four ML mod-\nels with RF, BMA, KNN, SVM and MLP to calculate\
    \ the \nETo . The MLP-based ensemble model provides the efficient \nresults. However,\
    \ the ML and DL based models are proposed \nto estimate a urban ETo with Flux\
    \ Footprint, Remote Sens-\ning and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The\
    \ \nRF model provides slightly better result in terms of R 2 of \n(0.840) and\
    \ RMSE of (0.0239 mm) than CNN model [91].\nAdnan et al. [92] demonstrated the\
    \ capability of dif-\nferent Neuro-Fuzzy methods to estimate the pan evapora-\n\
    tion monthly using climatic inputs of different parameters \nobtained from Uttarakhand,\
    \ (India). Recently, Adnan et al. \n[93] demonstrated the capability of dynamic\
    \ evolving Neu-\nral-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS) and Least-Square \nSupport\
    \ Vector Regression with a Gravitational Search \nAlgorithm (LSSVR-GSA) for estimating\
    \ ETo.\nIt has been shown that the extraterrestrial radiation or \ntemperature-based\
    \ LSSVR-GSA models are superior to \nFig. 9  Process of DSS for crop water irrigation\

    Recently, Tikhamarine et al. [96] combined the Support \nVector Regression and\
    \ Grey Wolf Optimizer (SVR-GWO) \nto predict the monthly ETo at Annaba, Algiers,\
    \ and Tlem-\ncen stations in North Algeria. Moreover, the proposed \nmodel is\
    \ compared with the existing variants of SVR and \nshowed that the performance\
    \ of the SVR-GWO gives occa-\nsionally competitive and very promising results.\
    \ Marouf-\npoorb et al. [34] proposed the concept of hybrid Artificial \nNeural\

    Further, the proposed model showed more efficient \nand accurate results as compared\

    \ models Support Vector Regression and Whale Optimi-\nzation Algorithm to predict\
    \ the daily reference evapotran-\nspiration at three stations in Iran. It has\
    \ been shown that \nhybrid models outperformed the support vector regres-\nsions\
    \ models. Kisi [65] obtained weather dataset from \nTurkish Meteorological Organization\
    \ (TMO) for 2 sta-\ntions from 1982 to 2006 and applied MARS, LSSVR, and \nM5-Tree\
    \ to estimate ETo.\nValipour et al. [79] collected data for the period of \n(1961–2010)\
    \ with 50 climate parameters from 18 regions \nof Iran to estimate monthly ETo\
    \ using five models namely \n(mass transfer, radiation and temperature based).\n\

    \ ETo.\nTao [99] presented the hybrid intelligent ETo model using \ndata of three\

    \ Fuzzy Inference System \n(ANFIS), Firefly Optimization Algorithm with ANFIS\
    \ \n(ANFIS-FA) and Penman–Monteith models.\nCo-active Neuro Fuzzy Inference System\
    \ (CANFIS) \nmodel is proposed for modeling the monthly evaporation of \nLake\
    \ Nasser, Egypt [110]. The Gene Expression Program-\nming (GEP), Support Vector\
    \ Machine (SVM), Classifica-\ntion and Regression Tree (CART), the Cascade Correlation\
    \ \nNeural Network (CCNNs), and are proposed for estimating \nevaporation by Yaseen\
    \ et al. [100].\nFalamarzi et al. [101] estimated the daily ETo for water \nresources\
    \ with ANN and WNN models from the period of \n2009 to 2012. They have applied\
    \ RMSE, APE, N.S., R 2 met-\nrics to check the model accuracy with three input\
    \ parameters \nsuch as T min , T max , and u 2 . Models LS-SVM, MARS, and \nM5\
    \ models have been applied to estimate the Pan evapora-\ntion for Reservoir and\
    \ water resources management. They \nhave applied four input variable, T mean\
    \ , R s , u 2 , and R h with \ndataset of period 1986 to 2006 [102]. Another,\
    \ ANN model \nis applied to forecast the ETo for application of real-time \nirrigation\
    \ scheduling with T mean , R s , u 2 , and R h input param-\neters using dataset\
    \ of (2011 to 2012) [103].\nYassin et al. [73] analyzed the performance of ANN,\
    \ \nand GEP models to quantify the ETo with various climate \nparameters using\
    \ dataset from 1980 to 2010. The GeneX-\npro Tools 5.0, and Propagation version\
    \ 2.2.4 were used to \ndeveloped the model and also provide the accuracy on the\
    \ \nbasis of these metrics MAE, RMSE, R 2 , and OI. Gocic et al. \n[71] forecasted\
    \ the ETo using SVM, FFA, DWT, ANN, and \nGEP models with climate parameters for\
    \ the period of 1980 \nto 2010. Goyal et al. [104] explored the four ML models\
    \ \nnamely ANN, LS-SVR, FL, ANFIS, and Gamma Test to \nestimate the pan evaporation\
    \ for the duration of 2000 to \n2010. They have found the efficient results with\

    However, Chen et al. [105] found the best performance \nof Bayesian Model Averaging\

    \ Evapotranspiration \n(ETc)\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc ) one the most essential\
    \ ele-\nment of the hydrological system for irrigation scheduling. \nThe crop\
    \ coefficient K c method multiplied with (ETo ) is \nmost widely-used to determine\
    \ the (ETc ) Eq. (3). Different \nestimations and methods having their own advantages\
    \ and \ndisadvantages are available. For the estimation of ETc using \nMachine\
    \ Learning, Deep Learning and Evolutionary Algo-\nrithms, some potential literature\
    \ work are presented in this \nsection. The literature analysis of crop evapotranspiration\
    \ \nmethods is presented in Table 6.\n7.1  Existing Methods Based on Statistics\n\
    The need of precise estimation of crop water is an crucial \naspect of agricultural\
    \ planning and there exists several meth-\nods for determining ET in crop land\
    \ [124]. The significant \nfield based estimations are required, appropriate for\
    \ monitor-\ning the crop-water status at the land-scale level [125, 126].\nThe\
    \ FAO-Penman, PM, and 1963 Penman applied to \nforecasting the ET for rice crop\
    \ using meteorological data \nby Shah and Edling (2000). They have found the crop\
    \ coef-\nficients for initial, middle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and \n1.43\
    \ [127]. The derivation and development of crop K c were \nidentified for Castor\
    \ and Maize crops of Rajendranganagar \nby Reddy et al. [128]. Ko et al. [129]\
    \ conducted study to \nestimate the crop water requirement for Cotton and Wheat\
    \ \ncrops at Uvalde, TX, USA. Fang and Ping (2013) presented \nan optimal the\
    \ uncertainty approaches of interval regression \nanalysis and crop water production\
    \ function for irrigation \nand Penman-Monteith method used to obtain ETo . LINGO\
    \ \nsoftware introduced to solve above model [57].\n7.2  Machine Learning and Evolutionary\
    \ Models\nThe Back-propagation Neural Network (BP-NN) model is \nproposed to evaluate\
    \ the crop evapotranspiration ETc with \ncombination of various climate parameters\
    \ (Tmax , T min , \nRHmean , S h , RF and crop coefficient K c ). It is observed\
    \ that \nthe combination of Eddy Covariance method and BP model \nachieved the\
    \ best accuracy in terms of R 2 (0.87) and accu-\nracy (91.44%) than MLR model\
    \ [130]. Mehta et al. [131] \nestimated the ETo , ETc and K c of Wheat and Maize\
    \ crops \nof Gujarat using climate data. They applied the various tem-\nperature\
    \ and radiation based empirical methods to calculate \nand estimate the crop water\
    \ requirement.\nIt is observed that the accurate value of K c for Wheat crop \n\
    is more efficient as compared to FAO-56 Penman–Monteith \nmethod results. Whereas\
    \ in case of maize crop the outcomes \nwere found less accurate at Surat and higher\
    \ outcomes as \ncompared to FAO method at Bharuch station.\nSaggi et al. [41]\
    \ proposed a novel multi-layer ensemble \nmodel based on fuzzy-genetic and regularization\
    \ random \nforest (FG-RRF) for predicting the K c and ETc of Ludhiana \nstation.\
    \ They found that the models had high performance \nfor modeling K c and ETc.\n\
    Elbeltagi et al. [132] presented the deep learning model \nto estimate the Wheat\
    \ ETc from 1970-2017 and forecasting \nthe future changes from 2022-2035 of Nile\
    \ Delta in Egypt \nusing Visual Gene Developer technology. For calibration R 2\
    \ \nof 0.95, 0.96, 0.97 and for testing R 2 of 0.94, 0.95, 0.95 have \nbeen found\
    \ efficient result respectively. Russo et al. [55] pre-\nsented the MCMC and Bayesian\
    \ algorithms to analysis the \nirrigation requirements for ground water mass balance\
    \ with \nsoil tensiometer of Rice crop. They have optimized the man-\nagement\
    \ decisions on crop replacement and increased the \nirrigation efficiency. The\
    \ NN model and regression model \nare explored to estimate a greenhouse tomato\
    \ crop yield, its \ngrowth, and efficiency in use of water with CropAssist and\
    \ \nNeuralWare platforms [133]. Maurya et al. [134] developed \na novel fuzzy-based\
    \ energy-efficient routing protocol based \non automated irrigation system for\
    \ Maize crop on MAT-\nLAB platform. The FIS-DSS (Flexible Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ \nDecision Support System) is proposed to analyze the optimal \nallocation of\
    \ water resources of irrigation system. Fuzzy-\ninference and knowledge based\
    \ user-friendly optimization \ntool is developed for Wheat and corn crops [135].\
    \ Chauhan \net al. [136] proposed a web-based DSS to enhance irrigation \nwater\

    \ methods and sensors based on soil mois-\nture. Tabari et al. [138] explored\
    \ a ANFIS and SVM model \nperformance for Potato crop evapotranspiration ETc using\
    \ \nmeteorological data.\nYamaç et al. [139] applied the four scenarios based\
    \ on \nfeatures subset to accurately estimate the ETc of Potato \ncrop using ANN,\
    \ ABM and KNN models. Further, ANN \nand SVM models are also applied to estimate\
    \ the garlic ETc \nby Abyaneh et al. [140] and the outcomes are found accurate\
    \ \nas compared to lysimeter performance.\nThe need of precise estimation of crop\
    \ water is an crucial \naspect of agricultural planning and there exists several\
    \ meth-\nods for determining ET in crop land [124]. The field based \nestimations\
    \ are required and appropriate for monitoring the \ncrop-water status at the land-scale\
    \ level [125] [126].\nThe FAO-Penman and Penman methods are applied \nto forecast\
    \ the ET for rice crop using meteorological data \n[127]. They have found the\
    \ crop coefficients for initial, mid-\ndle and late stage as 1.39, 1.51, and 1.43.\
    \ The derivation \nand development of crop K c are identified for Castor and \n\
    Maize crops of Rajendranganagar by Reddy et al. [128]. Ko \net al. [129] conducted\
    \ a analyses report to evaluate the crop \nwater requirement for Cotton, and Wheat\
    \ crops at Uvalde, \nTX, USA. Fang and Ping [57] presented an optimal solution\
    \ \nto estimate the ETo using interval regression analysis, crop \nwater production\
    \ function and Penman-Monteith method \nwith LINGO software.\nNumerous experiments\
    \ have been conducted in recent \ndecades to investigate the possible effect of\
    \ climate change \non evapotranspiration ETc . For efficient crop evapotranspi-\n\
    ration ETc modeling using VIP (Vegetation Interface Pro-\ncesses) for Wheat and\
    \ Maize [141], durum Wheat in Tuni-\nsia [142], APSIM-Maize model [143], SEBAL\
    \ model for \nyield, WUE, IWUE and HUE for Wheat crop [144], weigh-\ning lysimeter\
    \ for K c and ETc [145], farm-level operational \nservices in smart agriculture\
    \ [146], crop water model based \non Crop2ML framework [147] have been used.\n\
    The ETc estimation results proved that the ML and EA \napproaches performed better\
    \ than existing classical methods. \nHowever, several studies have investigated\
    \ the estimation \nof ETc with empirical methods. But limited studies have \n\
    reported the estimation of ETc using ML, and EA models \nas shown in Table 6.\n\
    8  Decision Support System for Irrigation \nScheduling\nThis section considers\
    \ the Decision support system (DSS) \nbased on research that have included ETo\
    \ , ETc , and irri-\ngation requirement. An irrigation management system can \n\
    offer farmers with appropriate decision-making tools in \norder to regulate the\
    \ amount of water supplied to crops.\nA decision support system PETP V2.0.0 is\
    \ developed to \nanalysis and estimate the potential evapotranspiration ETo \n\
    using various empirical approaches namely Hargreaves, \nJensen-Haise, Penman-Monteith,\
    \ Priestley-Taylor, etc. Vis-\nual Studio 2010 software is used to build the computational\
    \ \ntool to estimate the accurate results for water requirement \nof crop [148].\n\
    Navarro et al. [149] developed smart irrigation DSS for \nmanaging the irrigation\
    \ scheduling. They purposed 2 ML \ntechniques i.e. PLSR and ANFIS. Maximum and\
    \ mini-\nmum relative humidity, temperature, and direction of wind, \nglobal radiation,\
    \ vapour pressure deficit, rainfall, dew point \nare the variables used to predict\
    \ the daily ETo with FAO \nPenman–Monteith method. Zizhong and Zenghui [150] pre-\n\
    sented a single irrigation system that enhanced higher corn \nproduction and also\
    \ provided efficiency in use of water in \nNortheast China. They include climate\
    \ parameters namely \naverage, max and min of air temperatures, max and min of\
    \ \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours from 1980 \nto 2012. Penman–Monteith\
    \ approach is used to determine \nthe soil evaporation and ETc.\nThe knowledge\
    \ of the irrigation management has an \nimpact on crop water requirements, maintaining\
    \ water bal-\nance and is the practical considerations to enhance produc-\ntivity\
    \ of crop [157]. Various research work in Punjab have \ndemonstrated the requirements\
    \ of crop water irrigation, irri-\ngation water based on ET and pan evaporation,\
    \ [158], but \nfew studies have focused on Soil Water Deficit (SWD) [159].\nParaskevopoulos\
    \ and Singels [151] investigated the inte-\ngrated content of soil water recordings\
    \ of real-time field into \nthe MyCanesim system to estimate its use in 15 sugarcane\
    \ \nfields of South Africa for supporting irrigation system. It is \nused to determine\
    \ the decision making for irrigation sched-\nuling based on the status of forecasts\
    \ of crop, soil water, \nand the next irrigation date. Ying et al. [152] represented\
    \ \nthe evaluation for summer Wheat and winter Maize crop-\nping system for optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Further, they \ndescribed topical versions of the SWAP\
    \ and Wofost models \nfor crop growing simulation and obtaining efficiency in\
    \ use \nof water.\nAfzal et al. [160] improved water resources management \nusing\
    \ different irrigation strategies and water qualities by \nfield, and modeling\
    \ study. To deficit irrigation PRD and RDI \nmethods are used to estimate the\
    \ effects of waste and fresh \nwater on salinity distribution, soil moisture,\
    \ and crop yield \nof Potato, Maize in Italy, Bologna through field experiments.\n\
    The fuzzy, evolutionary, and machine learning models \nare used to develop a DSS\
    \ model for irrigation schedul-\ning. Gaiqiang et al. [135] developed a FIS-DSS\
    \ software \nbased on knowledge, interface for user, and an inference \nengine\
    \ for wheat, corn and cotton crops. It is a fuzzy interval \n4472\n \nM. K. Saggi,\
    \ S. Jain \n1 3\nprogramming model having multiple objectives and con-\nstraints,\
    \ flexibility of model, data processing, and an alterna-\ntive solving algorithm.\
    \ The main objective is to maximize \nthe economic-based benefits for crop-land\
    \ in China. The NN \nmodel is used to train the model with precipitation and his-\n\
    torical climate parameters.\nGiusti and Marsili-Libelli [153] developed a fuzzy-DSS\
    \ \nto schedule the daily irrigation need of crop based on soil \nmoisture as\
    \ a predictive model and an inference model \nas irrigation decision maker. This\
    \ model determines the \nactual need of water for kiwi, corn, and potato crops\
    \ with \npast irrigation soil moisture, climatic parameters, and ETc . \nThey\
    \ used meteorological data including temperature, solar \nradiation, wind, rain,\
    \ etc. The objective of FDSS model is \nto reduce the water usage and provide\
    \ the efficient result in \nterms of saving water up-to 13.55, 18.3, and 72.95\
    \ water \nunits for irrigating three crops respectively. Sahoo et al. \n[161]\
    \ proposed fuzzy multi objective linear programming \napproach for planing of\
    \ land-water-crop system. The mete-\norological data like daily rainfall, evaporation,\
    \ temperature, \nsolar radiation, daily sunshine hours, humidity, wind veloc-\n\
    ity, and albedo are collected from the Central Rice Research \nInstitute, Cuttack.\
    \ The objective function is to optimize, \nmaximized crop production, net return,\
    \ and to minimize the \nlabor requirement for various vegetables and pulses.\n\
    Reddy and Kumar [162] demonstrated a multi-objective \nmethod for the optimal\
    \ crop pattern and multi-crop irriga-\ntion reservoir scheme by several procedures.\
    \ Adeyemo and \nOtieno [163] explored a method to solve the multi objective \n\
    crop planning model by an evolutionary algorithm. They \nhave found excellent\
    \ results in minimizing total water irri-\ngation, maximizing the yield productivity,\
    \ and net income \nfrom farming.\nIrrigation water management is numerically intensive\
    \ \nfor computations and provides model interpretation and \ndiscretization. Neural\
    \ networks and evolutionary algo-\nrithms demonstrated to estimate the irrigation\
    \ volume and \nalso determined the effectiveness to diminish irrigation \napplication\
    \ and maximize production [164]. Ortega Álva-\nrez et al. [154] proposed a non-linear\
    \ model to recognize \nyield schemes and water irrigation management plannings\
    \ \nusing the genetic algorithms. Further, they estimated crop \nyield, gross\
    \ margin and production as a function of irrigation \ndepth. Schmitz et al. [165]\
    \ simulated 92 percent greater pro-\nduction for corn using evolutionary algorithm\
    \ as compared \nto dynamic programming.\nApplication and web based DSS models\
    \ are developed \nfor the irrigation water scheduling by various researchers.\
    \ \nRecently, a web-based DSS is proposed to estimate the soil-\nwater balance\
    \ for irrigation system with limited input param-\neters such as (dual crop-coefficient\
    \ and meteorological). The \nirrigation parameters are computed through soil moisture\
    \ \nand requirement of water. A web-based irrigation decision \nsupport system\
    \ is introduced with limited inputs (WIDSSLI) \nfor summer corn and winter Wheat\
    \ irrigation management \nin North China Plain (NCP) [155].\nTable 7 presents\
    \ the estimation of ETo , ETc , and irriga-\ntion with DSS systems. Antonopoulou\
    \ et al. [166] presented \nan appropriate decision support system for crops which\
    \ is \nimplemented on web-based software. They introduced this \napproach by using\
    \ the Java and PHP technologies for spe-\ncific irrigation technique and soil\
    \ improvement instructions. \nDutta et al. [167] developed a mobile application\
    \ based on \nsustainable irrigation DSS. They proposed cloud sensors \nbased approach\
    \ to evaluate the ground water usage and avail-\nability of water. This approach\
    \ includes the CSIRO sensor \nbased cloud computing organization and integrated\
    \ big data \nthat includes machine learning technologies. Bonfante et al. \n[168]\
    \ proposed an irrigation water supply management tool \nto obtain the maximum\
    \ yield of Maize with W-tens, IRRI-\nSAT, and W-Mod approaches. W-Mod and IRRISAT\
    \ models \nfound more accurate results as compared to W-Tens in terms \nof irrigation\
    \ water use efficiency.\nA Climate-Smart Decision-Support System (CSDSS) \ntool\
    \ is proposed to evaluate the requirement of rice crop in \nMalaysia. They determine\

    \ proposed a SALTMED model which \nincludes the to partial root drying or deficit\
    \ irrigation, sub-\nsurface irrigation, soil nitrogen fertilizer application,\
    \ ferti-\ngation, dry matter production, plant nitrogen uptake, and \nnitrate\
    \ leaching.\nFor the model calibration and endorsement the statistical \nmeasurements\
    \ are used such as R2 coefficient, RMSE, and \npercentage error. The DIDAS software\
    \ package for irrigation \nsystem decision-making strategies of drip irrigation\
    \ systems \nis developed [46].\nA DSS framework have been introduced which includes\
    \ \n22 ETo estimation approaches using user-friendly GUI \n(Microsoft Visual Basic\
    \ 6.0) of 133 selected stations of \nIndia [170]. Potential-ETo and FAO56-PM ETo\
    \ are used to \nestimate the ETo in the Geisenheim Irrigation Scheduling \n(GS)\
    \ for vegetable crops using sprinkler irrigation [171]. \nBallesteros et al. [103]\
    \ estimated the ETo using FORETO \nsoftware with Hargreaves Samani (HS) equation\
    \ or the Pen-\nman Monteith (PM) and Artificial neural networks (ANNs) \nmodels.\
    \ Modern platforms (.NET and Java) software applied \nto calculate the daily/monthly\
    \ ETo using meteorological \nparameters [172]. There are various crop simulation\
    \ based \nmodels exists such as CropSyst [173], STICS (Brisson et al. \n1998)\
    \ [174], EPIC [175], DSSAT [176], VegSyst simulation \nmodel [177], and CERES\
    \ [178].\nA single approach, that can address all operational cir-\ncumstances\
    \ (weather information, crop growth monitoring, \nfield data, agricultural expertise\
    \ and infrastructure etc.), \nas well as the associated expenses for farmers which\
    \ may \nlimit the usage of these systems. Therefore, DSS’s for irri-\ngation scheduling\
    \ have been developed to integrating vari-\nous approaches in terms of (data collection\
    \ from meteoro-\nlogical), pre-processing techniques and modeling based on \n\
    empirical or artificial intelligence.\n9  Conclusion\nOverall agricultural systems\
    \ modeling needs to rapidly adopt \nand absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies\
    \ with \na focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating \nthose who\
    \ develop applications of their models. In spite of \nthe vast literature available,\
    \ the subject of irrigation water \nmanagement and crop water modeling for machine\
    \ learning \ntechniques are yet in its emerging phase. Although there \nis wide\
    \ literature available on statistics, machine learning, \ndecision support system\
    \ for general manifolds. To estimate \ncrop water modeling on general manifolds,\
    \ we have different \napproaches available in literature.\nMoreover, the water\
    \ balance is well-entrenched \napproach for estimating irrigation amount and time\
    \ \n(i.e. irrigation frequency) in irrigation scheduling. This \napproach is simple\
    \ to use, typically inexpensive and \nvery effective approach to estimates the\
    \ ETo , and ETc . \nThe major objective is to adopt the several approaches to\
    \ \ndevelop a flexible system that supports irrigation water \nrequirement system,\
    \ which may fit into diverse fields of \noperational activities (weather information,\
    \ field data \ncollection, crop coefficients etc.). This study provides \nan overview\
    \ of the irrigation water scheduling. It also \npresented the concept of reference\
    \ evapotranspiration \nand crop evapotranspiration for crop water modeling. It\
    \ \nalso presents the various methods of irrigation schedul-\ning. It also address\
    \ the need of decision support system \nand its various approaches that lead to\
    \ irrigation water \nmanagement.\nAcknowledgements Mandeep Kaur Saggi was supported\

    Variable rate irrigation (VRI) may improve center pivot irrigation management,
    including

    deﬁcit irrigation. A remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration model was implemented

    with Landsat imagery to manage irrigations for a VRI equipped center pivot irrigated

    ﬁeld located in West-Central Nebraska planted to maize in 2017 and soybean in

    2018. In 2017, the study included VRI using the model, and uniform irrigation
    using

    neutron attenuation for full irrigation with no intended water stress (VRI-Full
    and

    Uniform-Full treatments, respectively). In 2018, two deﬁcit irrigation treatments
    were

    added (VRI-Deﬁcit and Uniform-Deﬁcit, respectively) and the model was modiﬁed
    in an

    attempt to reduce water balance drift; model performance was promising, as it
    was

    executed unaided by measurements of soil water content throughout the season.
    VRI

    prescriptions did not correlate well with available water capacity (R2 < 0.4);
    however,

    they correlated better with modeled ET in 2018 (R2 = 0. 69, VRI-Full; R2 = 0.55,

    VRI-Deﬁcit). No signiﬁcant differences were observed in total intended gross irrigation

    depth in 2017 (VRI-Full = 351 mm, Uniform Full = 344). However, in 2018, VRI resulted

    in lower mean prescribed gross irrigation than the corresponding uniform treatments

    (VRI-Full = 265 mm, Uniform Full = 282 mm, VRI-Deﬁcit = 234 mm, and Uniform Deﬁcit

    = 267 mm). Notwithstanding the differences in prescribed irrigation (in 2018),
    VRI did

    not affect dry grain yield, with no statistically signiﬁcant differences being
    found between

    any treatments in either year (F = 0.03, p = 0.87 in 2017; F = 0.00, p = 0.96
    for

    VRI/Uniform and F = 0.01, p = 0.93 for Full/Deﬁcit in 2018). Likewise, any reduction
    in

    irrigation application apparently did not result in detectable reductions in deep
    percolation

    potential or actual evapotranspiration. Additional research is needed to further
    vet the

    model as a deﬁcit irrigation management tool. Suggested model improvements include

    a continuous function for water stress and an optimization routine in computing
    the basal

    crop coefﬁcient.

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    INTRODUCTION

    Traditionally, the smallest practical management scale for center

    pivot irrigation has been the ﬁeld scale. Thus, irrigation

    applications are typically intended or assumed to be spatially

    uniform throughout a ﬁeld. Variable rate irrigation (VRI)

    technology for center pivots allows for the management scale

    to be much smaller and application rates to vary within a VRI

    equipped ﬁeld. Consequently, VRI has been the subject of recent

    research (e.g., Stone et al., 2015; Sui and Yan, 2017). As remote

    sensing techniques may provide opportunity to quantify spatial

    variability of irrigation requirements, a number of studies have

    investigated various remote-sensing-based technologies for VRI

    management (infrared thermometers, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015;

    canopy reﬂectance, Stone et al., 2016; and Landsat thermal and

    multispectral imagery, Barker et al., 2018b). In western Nebraska

    and other areas of the High Plains, irrigation water withdrawal

    may be limited in availability, or limited by regulation. In

    some of these areas (and other areas globally), signiﬁcant soil

    variability exists, further complicating irrigation management.

    VRI may be beneﬁcial in such areas as the utility of VRI has

    been demonstrated for ﬁelds with variable soil properties (Hedley

    and Yule, 2009). The utility of VRI in improving eﬃciency of

    irrigation (e.g., reducing the fraction of irrigation that runs oﬀ,

    drains below the root zone or is otherwise not available for

    extraction by plant roots), e.g., in situations of limited water

    supply, has also been demonstrated including deﬁcit irrigation

    management (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2016). One reason that VRI

    may be of interest in deﬁcit irrigation management is that it may

    allow for a more spatially uniform managed level of water stress,

    by accounting for soil, and other variability.

    While the beneﬁts of VRI have been studied as cited

    above, a common misunderstanding regarding new irrigation

    technologies is that they “conserve” water, with reduced pumping

    resulting in more water available to downstream users. In an

    ineﬃcient irrigation system, much of the “ineﬃciency” is water

    that deep percolates past the root zone and recharges the aquifer.

    Irrigation technology, if properly managed, may reduce aquifer

    withdrawals, and reduce deep percolation, also reducing aquifer

    recharge but potentially decreasing water quality issues. From a

    watershed scale perspective, the only way to conserve water in

    the aquifer is to reduce consumptive use or evapotranspiration

    (Allen et al., 2003). Stakeholders are rightly concerned about

    aquifer level declines and the subsequent impacts on streamﬂow.

    However, the hypothesis of the current study is that, while

    VRI can be used to reduce pumping or increase yield, it

    does not signiﬁcantly reduce consumptive use. In this study

    this is explored using a spatial evapotranspiration model to

    manage VRI.

    The Spatial EvapoTranspiration Modeling Interface (SETMI)

    described by Geli and Neale (2012) has been modiﬁed and

    implemented in VRI research in maize and soybean (common

    commodity crops in the High Plains) by Barker et al. (2018a)

    and Barker et al. (2018b). This model includes a reﬂectance-

    based crop coeﬃcient evapotranspiration (ET) model, wherein

    the basal crop coeﬃcient is related to a multispectral vegetation

    index (Neale et al., 1989). SETMI uses relationships developed for

    maize and soybean in Nebraska by Campos et al. (2017). SETMI

    also contains a version of the two-source energy balance (TSEB;

    Norman et al., 1995) as detailed in Barker et al. (2018a). Notably,

    SETMI contains what is referred to as a hybrid methodology,

    wherein ET from an energy balance model is incorporated into

    the water balance through statistical interpolation (Geli, 2012;

    Neale et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2018a). This hybrid model is

    intended to allow the model to compensate for model drift in the

    soil water balance (Neale et al., 2012; Barker et al., 2018a,b).

    While SETMI had been tested for VRI management in western

    Nebraska (Barker et al., 2018b), it had only been tested on

    maize and the soil water balance was found to drift compared

    to neutron attenuation soil water measurements (Barker et al.,

    2018b). Subsequently, modiﬁcations have been made to SETMI

    discussed by Barker et al. (2018b), including dampening surface

    soil evaporation and provisions for incorporating soil water

    measurements into the model. These modiﬁcations had not

    previously been tested, though such are included in concurrent

    research by Bhatti (2018). Finally, no attempt has previously been

    made to test SETMI for deﬁcit irrigation in row crops in the

    western High Plains, though others have studied deﬁcit irrigation

    in the area, for example, Payero et al. (2005) studied deﬁcit

    irrigation in soybean in West-Central Nebraska. However, they

    did not include VRI in their study.

    The objective of the present study was to determine whether

    VRI management using SETMI, when compared to “uniform”

    irrigation, resulted in reduced irrigation applications, reduced

    consumptive use (ET), improvements in yield, and/or reduced

    impact on local water resources as represented by reductions

    in deep percolation (DP) potential. A secondary objective was

    to determine whether SETMI would perform well as a deﬁcit

    irrigation management tool, which could be accomplished by

    accurately simulating soil water content.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS

    SETMI was tested as an irrigation management tool in a 2-year

    ﬁeld experiment in maize in 2017 and soybean in 2018 in western

    Nebraska. This experiment builds upon previous work by Barker

    et al. (2018b), and is complimentary to research by Bhatti (2018).

    Primary response variables were yield, change in soil water

    storage over the measurement period (1SWS), estimated deep

    percolation (DP) during the measurement period, the sum of

    the latter two variables (1SWS+ DP), modeled ET (ETc), and

    water balance measured ET (ETa). The 1SWS+DP represents

    an approximation of the impact on deep drainage from the

    treatments during the measurement periods (beginning prior

    to imposing treatments and ending near harvest). It represents

    potential diﬀerences in groundwater recharge, and nutrient

    leaching capacity.

    Study Location

    The study location for this experiment was a quarter of a ∼48-

    ha center pivot irrigated ﬁeld, which is part of the University

    of Nebraska-Lincoln’s West Central Water Resources Field

    Laboratory, near Brule, NE (41.027◦N, 101.973◦W; Google Earth

    with a Zimmatic (Lindsay Corporation, Omaha, NE) center

    pivot equipped with Lindsay Precision VRI with individual

    nozzle control. The pivot was new in 2015 and is equipped

    with Senninger XiWob UP3 sprinklers (Senninger Irrigation Inc.,

    Clermont, FL) on drops ∼2 m above the ground surface (Barker

    et al., 2018b).

    Soils in the study area range from loam (Santana loam) to

    loamy sand (Bankard loamy sand) and loam–gravel complex

    (Santana-Dix complex) (Soil Survey Staﬀ, 2018). The terrain is

    undulating hills with soil texture varying with topography. The

    Koppen-Gieger Climate class for the location is Bsk (cold arid,

    dry summer; Kottek et al., 2006; Brugger, 2017).

    Crops were planted following a circular pattern and the

    center pivot wheel tracks. The ﬁeld was under continuous maize

    production for several years prior to rotating into soybean in the

    2018 season. The ﬁeld was managed as no-till, but was subject

    to a residue removal study prior to 2017 (van Donk et al., 2012;

    Barker et al., 2018b). In 2017, the study area was under a maize

    crop Dekalb DKC55-20RIB planted at 78,740 seeds ha1 on 8

    May 2017. A total of 231 kg ha−1 of N was applied with ∼25%

    applied through fertigation. The maize was harvested for grain

    between 4 and 16 November 2017. In 2018, the crop was soybean

    Pioneer P24A99X, planted at 457,720 seeds ha1 on 8 May 2018.

    The soybean crop was harvested for grain on 26 September 2018.

    Treatments and Irrigation Management

    In 2017, two irrigation treatments were applied: (1) VRI using

    SETMI with Landsat imagery, and (2) uniform irrigation using

    neutron attenuation based measurements of soil water content

    to provide feedback for irrigation scheduling. Both treatments

    were full irrigation, with no intentional water stress, thus they

    are referred to as VRI-Full, and Uniform-Full, respectively.

    In 2018, two additional treatments were added. These two

    treatments were both deﬁcit irrigation and corresponded to

    the two full irrigation treatments in the modeling and neutron

    probe feedback approaches (VRI-Deﬁcit and Uniform-Deﬁcit,

    respectively). Thus in 2018, the experiment became a two-by-

    two factorial layout. Deﬁcit irrigation as deﬁned here included

    an irrigation management allowed soil water depletion that was

    greater than would be used for minimal water stress management

    during part of the growing season. Additionally, in 2017,

    SETMI was executed using the hybrid method and incorporating

    neutron-attenuation-measured soil water content. However in

    2018, SETMI was executed without these two methodologies (i.e.,

    the reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient ET model based on Landsat

    satellite multispectral inputs and water balance were exclusively

    used). This was because the hybrid methodology was found to

    induce model drift necessitating the incorporation of neutron

    probe measurements. By eliminating the hybrid model in 2018,

    a SETMI-only approach could be tested. This was deemed more

    beneﬁcial than maintaining the 2017 modeling approach.

    The irrigation was managed similarly to Barker et al. (2018b),

    using the concept of a managed root zone water balance and

    management allowed depletion (Woodruﬀ et al., 1972; Martin

    et al., 1990). This method, used by Barker et al. (2018b) provides

    a convenient way to manage VRI and to apply treatments to VRI

    equipped irrigated ﬁelds. The basics of the method are (Barker

    et al., 2018b):

    • Determine soil properties (e.g., available water capacity) for

    each plot or management area.

    • Determine a management allowed depletion fraction for the

    treatment or ﬁeld.

    • Determine a target stored root zone soil water depth above

    management allowed depletion after irrigation, to which the

    root zone will be reﬁlled during an irrigation event. A value of

    ∼20 mm (0.8 in) was used in this study thus providing a soil

    water storage buﬀer for rainfall capture.

    • Compute the water balance, forecasting ET forward in

    time (precipitation could also be forecasted; soil water

    measurements could be incorporated). Similar to Barker et al.

    (2018b), the VRI treatments received plot-speciﬁc irrigation

    based on mean modeled soil water depletion within a ∼9 m

    buﬀer area in each plot. In this study, the water balance for the

    VRI plots was computed using SETMI.

    • Irrigation application depth is computed for any desired

    date as the diﬀerence between the target water content

    (the speciﬁed depth above management allowed depletion)

    and the modeled water content at the end of the day in

    question assuming no water inputs after inputting the available

    water record. This diﬀerence, if positive, is the net irrigation

    requirement for the plot or management area to be applied by

    the end of that day.

    • Irrigation is triggered such to prevent any plot from exceeding

    management allowed depletion (described in the following

    paragraph). Thus, irrigation events occur at the same time

    for all treatments, but application rates vary by treatment

    and/or plot.

    • Maximum and minimum gross application rates (accounting

    for application eﬃciency) are applied as necessary for pivot

    and pump management. In this study application eﬃciency

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    (taken here to be the portion of applied irrigation that was

    inﬁltrated) was assumed to be 85%.

    • Irrigation prescriptions are set to a practical irrigation

    application depth (optional). In this study, gross applied

    irrigation was rounded to the nearest ∼5 mm (0.2 in).

    For the full irrigation treatments, management allowed depletion

    (MAD) was set to 50%. Late in the 2017 season, the MAD

    was allowed to reach 60% as in Yonts et al. (2008), but it was

    maintained at 50% throughout the season for soybean in 2018.

    The management allowed depletion was set to 60% for the deﬁcit

    treatments in 2018; this was increased to 75% after reaching the

    end pod-ﬁll stage following the principles of Kranz and Specht

    (2012) who suggest avoiding stress during pod-ﬁll. This strategy

    implicitly seeks to maximize yield with perhaps only modest

    reductions in applied irrigation, since water stress may aﬀect

    soybean yield during pod-ﬁlling more than other crop stages

    (Doss et al., 1974; Momen et al., 1979; Cox and Jolliﬀ, 1986;

    Kranz and Specht, 2012). The soybean crop was near beginning

    pod-ﬁll when the treatments eﬀectively began to be applied in

    2018; thus the deﬁcit irrigated plots may have been insulated

    from yield loss per Kranz and Specht (2012). However, Doss et al.

    (1974), reported that stressing soybean in late pod-ﬁll was more

    consistent at causing a yield reduction than when stress was only

    earlier in the season.

    Irrigation prescriptions were computed about once per week

    during the treatment periods. In 2017, the treatment period

    began on 9 August; prior to this time a total of 182 mm of uniform

    irrigation was applied. In 2018, the treatment period eﬀectively

    began on 13 August. Prior to that time, all treatments eﬀectively

    received 119 mm of uniform irrigation.

    Modeling

    Modeling for Irrigation Scheduling

    Irrigation prescriptions for the uniform plots were based

    upon neutron-attenuation-measured soil water content (see the

    Measurements and Response Variables section) and a short-

    term simple soil water balance including ET modeled using crop

    coeﬃcients based on (Allen and Wright, 2002) for maize in

    2017 and using relationships reported by Irmak et al. (2013) for

    soybean in 2018. Uniform treatments received irrigation based

    on neutron-attenuation-measured soil water depletion and a

    simple water balance for one plot of the treatment in 2017 and the

    maximum irrigation requirement of two selected plots in each of

    the 2018 uniform treatments.

    Irrigation

    prescriptions

    for

    the

    VRI

    treatments

    were

    computed using the SETMI application, with model formulations

    similar to Barker et al. (2018a) and Barker et al. (2018b). The

    SETMI water balance model was modiﬁed prior to use in 2018

    to include other updates to the FAO56 (Allen et al., 1998)

    methodology, which are described in Jensen and Allen (2016).

    The model includes a daily water balance generally following

    Allen et al. (1998), with ET computed using reﬂectance based

    crop coeﬃcients following Campos et al. (2017) and Barker

    et al. (2018a). In 2017, the hybrid method within SETMI was

    included using TSEB-computed ET (using the Priestly-Taylor

    approximation for canopy latent heat ﬂux; Norman et al., 1995;

    Colaizzi et al., 2014) and a statistical interpolation weighting

    factor from Barker et al. (2018a) equal to 0.56. To prevent model

    drift, in 2017, measured soil water depletions from neutron

    attenuation measurements were incorporated into the model as

    the actual end-of-day root zone depletion on the measurement

    date. In this, neutron attenuation measurements from four

    plots in the VRI-Full treatment were compared to model

    output depletion for the same plots. The four selected plots

    had the maximum, minimum, 33 percentile, and 66 percentile

    values of volumetric water content measurements, respectively,

    for that treatment on 27 June 2017. The reasoning was to

    include locations spread across the distribution of soil water

    content. Modeled depletion for all computation pixels was then

    updated based upon correlation between these measurements

    and modeled soil water depletion if R2 ≥ 0.6, or the mean

    diﬀerence between the measured and modeled values for those

    four locations otherwise as in Bhatti (2018). This adjustment

    was to reduce model drift. In 2018, this methodology was not

    used because excluding the hybrid methodology was expected

    to reduce model drift. For the 2018 simulations, the model was

    initiated with soil water content assumed to be at ﬁeld capacity.

    Spatial Soil Properties

    Prior to execution in 2018, the SETMI water balance model

    was also modiﬁed to include a slow root zone drainage routine

    using the drainage equations of Raes et al. (2017); soil below

    the root zone was assumed to have instantaneous drainage

    whenever water content exceeded ﬁeld capacity. Furthermore,

    the model was expanded to allow for the input of properties

    for three soil layers. The properties for the root zone were

    computed as depth-weighted averages of layers within the

    root zone on a given day. Saturated hydraulic conductivity

    (Ksat) for the root zone, a key parameter in the drainage

    formulas (Raes et al., 2017), was computed throughout the

    season (as root depth increased) based upon Equation 3.10 of

    Radcliﬀe and Šimunek (2010):

    Ksatr =

    Zri

    P3

    j=1

    1Zrij

    Ksatj

    (1)

    where the subscript Ksatr is Ksat in the root zone, Zr is

    the root zone depth, 1Zr is the thickness of a soil layer

    within the root zone, with subscripts i and j being time

    and soil layer, respectively. This method is for steady-state,

    saturated ﬂow. However, it provided a practical means of

    computing Ksat for the root zone and allowed the model

    to stay within the framework of a simple water balance

    (Allen et al., 1998; Jensen and Allen, 2016).

    Soil properties for each plot were estimated from neutron

    attenuation, lab measurements, and the gSSURGO (Soil Survey

    Staﬀ, 2015) database. Field capacity (FC) was computed using

    the maximum neutron attenuation measurement from the 1

    June and 27 June 2017 measurements for each depth and plot,

    using the concept of observational FC (Lo et al., 2017). For 2017

    irrigation management, plot FC was then computed by taking

    the depth-weighted average of this maximum water content from

    the soil surface to 1 m. For 2018 irrigation scheduling, the same

    data were used to compute FC; however FC was computed

    for three soil layers (0–0.23, 0.23–0.61, and 0.61–1.22 m) using

    depth-weighted averages. For the ﬁnal analysis, FC was computed

    as in 2018 irrigation scheduling with the lowest layer being

    0.61–1.0 m and the inclusion of an improved neutron probe

    calibration for 27 June 2017, which changed some of ﬁnal plot

    FC values.

    Permanent

    (WP)

    was

    determined

    from

    laboratory measurements on soil samples from 16 plots. WP

    was determined for each sample using a WP4-T Dewpoint

    PotentiaMeter (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) assuming a

    potential of −1.5 MPa for WP. The resulting WP values were

    correlated with respective FC values for the same plot and depth

    from the 1 June and 27 June 2017 data (R2 = 0.72; Figure 2). The

    resulting relationship was applied depth-by-depth to compute

    WP for all plots corresponding to the respective FC estimation

    methods (i.e., 2017, 2018, and ﬁnal analysis). The regression was

    recalculated for ﬁnal analysis using the updated neutron probe

    calibration mentioned above. However, this made no diﬀerence

    in the resulting WP for the ﬁnal analysis when rounded to the

    nearest 0.01 m3 m−3.

    In 2018, the inclusion of the drainage equations from Raes

    et al. (2017) required the input of both volumetric soil water

    content at saturation (θsat) and saturated hydraulic conductivity

    (Ksat). These values were obtained for each plot and soil layer

    using values from gSSURGO and relationships with FC. The FC

    for these relationships was computed based on volumetric water

    content at −1.5 MPa and available water capacity (AWC) for

    the soil horizons of the dominant components of the four soil

    map units in the study area. This was done assuming this was

    a better estimate of FC than was water content at −0.033 MPa.

    A piecewise linear relationship was developed for θsat using linear

    regression for values of FC < 0.25 m3 m−3 (R2 = 0.92), and

    then the average of all θsat for FC > 0.25 m3 m−3 (Figure 3A). A

    power regression ﬁt well (R2 = 0.96) for Ksat as a function of FC

    (Figure 3B). The relationships in Figure 3 were used in irrigation

    scheduling in 2018 and in ﬁnal analysis, using the respective soil

    layer FC values.

    Model Input Data

    Other spatial model inputs included Landsat 7 and Landsat

    8 multispectral imagery obtained from U.S. Geological Survey

    (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/). This imagery included Level 2

    Surface Reﬂectance and Level 1 thermal infrared imagery (2017

    only). Thermal infrared imagery were corrected for atmospheric

    eﬀects similar to Barker et al. (2018a) and Barker et al. (2018b),

    whose method was based upon Brunsell and Gillies (2002).

    The correction parameters from NASA’s Atmospheric Correction

    Parameter web app (https://atmcorr.gsfc.nasa.gov/, by J. Barsi)

    were used. Local surface weather data described below were input

    to the web application. Only Tier 1 and Real Time imagery

    were used for irrigation scheduling (with the exception of 5

    August 2017, which was a Tier 2 image, included as Real

    Time quality). In the ﬁnal analysis, only Tier 1 imagery were

    included. Landsat 7 imagery were included if no pixels were

    missing due to the scan line gap over the entire study plot

    area. Thirteen images were included in 2017 and 14 images

    in 2018. Not all images were included in irrigation scheduling

    or ﬁnal analysis (Table 1); for example, images were included

    in the ﬁnal analysis that were not available during irrigation

    scheduling and some used in irrigation scheduling in 2017

    were determined to not be of suﬃcient quality to use in ﬁnal

    analysis. The model was executed using a ground resolution of

    1 m in 2017 and 5 m in 2018 and ﬁnal analysis to account for

    discrepancies between Landsat pixel size and position and the

    plot geometry (Bhatti, 2018).

    Weather data for modeling were obtained from three

    Nebraska Mesonet (https://mesonet.unl.edu/) weather stations:

    Big Springs 8NE, Brule 6SW, and Keystone 3W Beta. The

    Brule 6SW data were used for near real-time data for irrigation

    management in 2017 and for the ﬁnal analysis. The Big Springs

    8NE data were used for near real-time data in 2018. This

    weather station was nearby and was used thinking it was the

    Brule 6SW station, which was adjacent to the research ﬁeld.

    The diﬀerence was expected to be small; however the Brule

    6SW station was still determined to be the best suited for

    the ﬁnal analysis. The nearby Keystone 3W Beta data were

    used to compute 20-year historic average reference ET (ETr)

    and temperatures for growing degree-day computation, both

    used for ET forecasting similar to Barker et al. (2018b). This

    station was used because the records for the Brule 6SW and

    Big Springs 8NE stations were not suﬃciently long. ETr was

    computed using the ASCE Standardized Reference ET equation

    (ASCE, 2005). Barometric pressure was obtained from a nearby

    cosmic-ray neutron probe station and was provided by T. E.

    Franz (University of Nebraska-Lincoln). Precipitation from the

    Brule 6SW weather station was veriﬁed in 2017 using a lab-

    calibrated, Texas Electronics, Inc. (Dallas, TX) TR-525USW

    also used from 1 to 8 November 2017, because the Brule

    6SW dataset did not cover this period. Data from the National

    Weather Service Global Historic Climate Network Ogallala NE

    station were used for 9–13 November 2017 because neither

    the lab-calibrated rain gauge nor the Brule 6SE data were

    available. Weather data for the Mesonet and National Weather

    Service stations were obtained from the High Plains Regional

    Climate Center.

    Besides precipitation, the other major water balance input for

    modeling was applied irrigation. The prescribed irrigation was

    assumed to be applied (with an application eﬃciency of 85%—

    used throughout the study) on the day that the pivot passed over

    the plots. In the case that the pivot passed over the plots during

    the night (covering two dates), the irrigation was attributed to

    plots on the date it was estimated to pass over them in the 2017

    irrigation scheduling. The average pivot travel speed from start-

    stop times and travel angle were used to determine the overpass

    time for plots. Irrigation depth was assigned typically the latter of

    the two dates in 2018 scheduling, for simplicity. In ﬁnal analysis,

    the earlier of the two dates was used in all cases, because this

    would make the water available sooner to alleviate any modeled

    water stress (see the formulations of Jensen and Allen, 2016).

    Soil Water Content Model Validation

    Since the value of SETMI in this research was in modeling

    soil water content, the model performance was validated using

    neutron attenuation measurements after the ﬁrst measurement.

    Missing measurements in both years and for the 2018 plots that

    were aﬀected by the irrigation system malfunction during this

    season were excluded. The model was executed using only the

    reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient ET and water balance. The ﬁrst

    neutron attenuation measurements each year were incorporated

    into the model as described in the Measurement and Response

    Variables section.

    Measurements and Response Variables

    The total prescribed irrigation depth (the total gross irrigation

    depth for each plot that was used in the executed irrigation

    prescriptions) was analyzed as a primary treatment comparison.

    This was assumed to be equivalent to the actual gross applied

    irrigation for each plot. The ﬁnal irrigation in both years (applied

    19 September 2017 and 14 September 2018, respectively) were

    not applied and/or computed as intended. In the case of 19

    September 2017, the prescription for the previous irrigation (14

    September 2017) was applied in what was probably a logistically

    practical situation. In the case of 14 September 2018, the applied

    prescription from 8 September 2018 was not converted from

    inches to mm before input into SETMI, thus the prescribed

    irrigation was erroneously high for some plots. In both cases,

    both total applied prescribed (total prescribed irrigation as

    deﬁned above) and the total intended prescribed gross irrigation

    (or the total gross irrigation if correcting for the errors described

    above in the paragraph) were analyzed. The pivot had some low

    pressure problems in 2017. However, these may have been related

    to a pressure sensor (not actual pressure) and were assumed

    not to have aﬀected sprinkler application and uniformity. To

    assess the ability of the VRI methodology on accounting for

    spatially varying irrigation requirements, intended prescribed

    irrigation was compared to available water capacity (AWC) and

    plot modeled ET (ETc; described later in this section).

    Primary measurements included grain yield and soil water

    content. Plot yield was computed from production yield

    monitor data, which was cleaned and processed using the U.S.

    Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service’s Yield

    Editor 2.0.7 software (Sudduth et al., 2012) similar to Barker

    et al. (2018b). Yield points were only included if they were

    within a ∼12 m buﬀer within each plot boundary (Barker et al.,

    2018b). Plots included in the ﬁnal statistics had 22–47 yield

    points within the buﬀer in 2017 and 26–45 points in 2018. Dry

    grain yield was computed using the yield monitor’s moisture

    content measurements.

    *Used to compute ﬁeld capacity.

    †Attributed to previous day during ﬁnal analysis.

    ‡All data were used as if collected on 31 July. For irrigation scheduling, only
    standard

    neutron counts from 31 July were used.

    Soil water content measurements were used in computing

    the other response variables. Soil volumetric water content

    was measured in each plot using neutron probes (503 Elite

    Hydroprobe, CPN, Concord, CA). Access tubes were installed

    in the approximate center of each plot. The neutron probe

    instruments used were either locally calibrated or cross-

    calibrated with a locally-calibrated probe. The local calibration

    was conducted in a ﬁeld immediately east of the study site. Local

    calibration of a gauge used in the study resulted in a slope of

    0.2068 and an oﬀset of −0.0607. Calibrations were applied at a

    4 decimal accuracy in 2017 and ﬁnal analysis; they were applied

    at a higher numerical precision in 2018 irrigation, though this

    was of little consequence. Neutron attenuation measurements

    were taken at the following soil depths with measurements

    assumed to represent the range in parentheses: 0.15 (0–0.23 m),

    0.30 (0.23–0.38 m), 0.46 (0.38–0.61 m), 0.76 (0.61–0.91 m), 1.07

    (0.91–1.22 m), and 1.37 m (1.22–1.52 m). Neutron attenuation

    measurements were limited in temporal frequency in 2017 and

    in seasonal coverage in 2018 (Table 2). However, the coverage

    in both years began before the treatment period had eﬀectively

    started and ﬁnished near harvest. For modeling purposes in

    irrigation scheduling, neutron attenuation measurements were

    treated as the actual root zone water content at the end of

    the measurement date for the VRI-Full treatment in 2017 and

    the uniform treatments in both years. However, some neutron

    attenuation data were shifted to represent the ending conditions

    on the previous day for ﬁnal analysis depending on rainfall

    and irrigation on the measurement day (Table 2). The neutron

    attenuation data for the 0.91–1.22 m depth for two plots for all

    2018 dates except 10 July 2018 were gap ﬁlled for ﬁnal analysis.

    These were ﬁlled using the respective measurement value from

    the 0.61–0.91 m reading.

    The response variables relating to the impact of treatments

    on DP and ET were all derived from the neutron attenuation

    data. The ﬁrst was 1SWS in mm in the top 1.0 m of the

    soil proﬁle (using the 1.07-m reading to represent 0.91–1.0 m)

    between the ﬁrst and last neutron attenuation measurement each

    year (Table 2). Modeled DP and ETc were computed using the

    SETMI water balance with soil properties described for ﬁnal

    analysis. In modeling DP and ETc, the depth-weighted neutron

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    attenuation measurements were incorporated as the actual root

    zone depletions and the average water contents of the soil

    below the root zone (down to 1.0 m below ground surface) at

    the end of the ﬁrst date each year (Table 2). This is similar

    to the method used by Djaman and Irmak (2013). A similar

    method, but using repeated soil water content measurements

    as model input was used by Barker et al. (2018b). ET was also

    computed using the residual of the water balance (ETa). Both

    ETc and ETa were included as response variables. The ﬁnal

    variable considered was the sum 1SWS and DP (1SWS+DP).

    For all of these variables, the neutron-attenuation-measured

    values were assumed to represent the entire plot area. The plot-

    average modeled root depth (based upon time to reach peak

    basal crop coeﬃcient for each pixel) was used to compute root

    zone depletion and average volumetric water content below

    the root zone from the neutron attenuation data. The average

    root depth was computed as a spatial mean for each plot and

    neutron attenuation date excluding a ∼9 m buﬀer within each

    plot boundary (Barker et al., 2018b). The model was executed at a

    5-m pixel resolution in the ﬁnal analysis. The response variables

    were also computed as spatial means excluding the same ∼9 m

    buﬀer within each plot boundary.

    Experimental Design and Statistical

    Analysis

    The experiment was a generalized randomized complete block

    design, with multiple replicates of at least some treatments in

    each block. The study area was broken into plots ∼0.2 ha in

    size accommodating the precision of the sprinkler system and

    the commercial combine yield monitor similar to Barker et al.

    (2018b). Plots were arranged radially with plot boundaries falling

    on pivot wheel tracks (Figure 1). The plots were designed with

    criteria of a minimum of ∼37 m in width and length (Barker

    et al., 2018b). Plots were grouped into six blocks using computed

    AWC for the top 1 m of soil (as computed for the 2017 irrigation

    scheduling) as the blocking criterion. Plots were not blocked by

    radial distance from the center based on results of Barker et al.

    (2018b). Treatments were randomly assigned to plots afresh in

    both years (Figure 1).

    Responses for each treatment and variable were compared

    using ANOVAs computed using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS 9.4

    (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The ANOVAs were computed

    separately for the 2 crop years and for each variable (i.e.,

    no MANOVAs were included). Total prescribed irrigation was

    compared using 95% conﬁdence intervals computed using SAS

    PROC MEANS to compare with the uniform treatments as in

    Barker et al. (2018b). ANOVA was used to compare irrigation for

    the two VRI treatments in 2018.

    A number of plots were discarded from the ﬁnal analysis based

    upon missing data or misapplication of irrigation. In 2017, a

    total of six plots received an erroneous application depth during

    one of the irrigation events. These plots were all Uniform-Full,

    the misapplication aﬀected some VRI-Full plots also, but that

    would have automatically been compensated for in the following

    irrigation prescription. Another plot had water in the neutron

    access tube on the 13 November 2017 measurement and was

    also excluded. All seven plots were excluded from ﬁnal analysis

    for 2017. An additional two plots in 2017 did not have neutron

    attenuation data for 20 July 2017. For 2017, only data for plots

    and measurement dates that had missing data were excluded

    from validating the modeled water content. In 2018, two banks

    of four sprinklers did not function properly during much, if

    not all, of the irrigation season. Based upon the pivot dealer’s

    sprinkler chart (provided by Holzfaster’s Equipment, Ogallala,

    NE, and computed using software by Senninger Irrigation Inc.,

    Clemont, FL, 6 February 2015), the aﬀected areas were near the

    center of the second and sixth radial rows of plots from the

    pivot center (Figure 1). Thus, a total of 14 plots were aﬀected,

    one of which was also missing neutron attenuation data. All 14

    plots were eliminated from the ﬁnal analysis for 2018. One of

    the aﬀected plots in 2018 was used to schedule irrigation for the

    Uniform-Full treatment. However, this treatment always received

    the maximum irrigation depth during a given irrigation cycle.

    Given that the aﬀected sprinklers were likely always on (a default

    conditions of the system; personal communication, Lindsay

    Corporation personnel), this plot would not have adversely

    aﬀected that treatment.

    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

    Study Conditions

    The May–September total ETr was 1,020 mm in 2017 and

    910 mm in 2018 for the Brule 6SW station, comparable to a 20-

    years average of 1,080 mm for 1998–2017 for the Keystone 3W

    Beta station. This is also similar to the 950–1,050 mm reported

    by Sharma and Irmak (2012) for 1986–2009 for this part of

    Nebraska. Total May–September precipitation was 280 mm in

    2017 and 400 mm in 2018, compared to 290 mm for the 1998–

    2017 20-year average for Keystone 3W Beta. This is also similar

    to the 280–320 mm reported by Sharma and Irmak (2012) for

    1986–2009 for the area.

    In addition to weather, the soil properties at the site may

    greatly aﬀect an irrigation experiment. Using the ﬁnal analysis

    values, FC in the top 1 m of the soil proﬁle ranged from 0.11

    to 0.30 m3 m−3. The range of WP values was smaller, 0.05–0.16

    m3 m−3. Calculated AWC for the plots ranged from 0.06 to 0.14

    m3 m−3. This translates into 60–140 mm over a 1-m managed

    root zone.

    Modeling and Treatment Execution

    The incorporation of TSEB-ET in 2017 had a general eﬀect of

    increasing modeled soil water depletion (decreasing soil water

    content). This was in part because of the nature of the piecewise

    water stress coeﬃcient used (Ks; Allen et al., 1998; Figure 4).

    That is, Ks is equal to unity when the modeled root zone water

    content is above the water stress threshold (Allen et al., 1998;

    Figure 4). In the hybrid methodology, the ET modeled by the

    reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcient method in the water balance

    (WB-ET) is updated based upon TSEB-ET. If TSEB-ET ̸= WB-

    ET, then the water balance is updated by back-calculating for Ks

    and then back calculating for start-of-day root zone depletion

    (Geli, 2012). For example, assume that the TSEB-ET had little

    mean bias as compared with the WB-ET. At times, it would

    (Ks) function based on average root zone soil water content, as used in Allen

    et al. (1998) and Jensen and Allen (2016).

    be expected that TSEB-ET < WB-ET, even under non-stressed

    conditions, due solely to model variation. This condition would

    result in a decrease of Ks after TSEB-ET incorporation, whether

    such represented reality or not. However, at times when TSEB-

    ET > WB-ET, and the water balance already indicates a Ks < 1;

    mathematically, the soil water depletion can only be decreased

    (soil water content increased) as far as the water stress threshold

    (Figure 4). It is noted that in cases where Ks = 1 and TSEB-

    ET > WB-ET, no adjustment is made (Barker et al., 2018a).

    These challenges led to exclusion of the TSEB-ET in 2018. One

    possible solution for these challenges may be the inclusion of a

    continuous Ks function. For example the relationship of Jensen

    (1970) has been used for similar purposes (Colaizzi et al., 2003,

    Zhang et al., 2017). Another non-linear relationship presented by

    Boonyantharokul and Walker (1979) is also promising because

    the shape could be modiﬁed to account for diﬀerent sensitivity

    to stress in diﬀerent crops as is done in the piecewise method

    used by Allen et al. (1998). A ﬁnal solution may be incorporation

    of ET in parts (evaporation and transpiration) using canopy and

    soil components from the TSEB. This may help better identify

    what ET diﬀerences are truly related to Ks. The Penman Monteith

    formulation of the TSEB has been reported to provide more

    accurate partitioning of ET than original formulations (Colaizzi

    et al., 2014).

    Possible modiﬁcations to the hybrid model aside, the

    discrepancies in scale of the Landsat thermal infrared imagery

    (60–100 m; Bhatti, 2018; USGS, 2019) and our plot size was

    also a reason for dropping the TSEB-ET in 2018. It was evident

    that incorporating the soil water content measurements into the

    SETMI water balance in 2017 prevented what seemed to be a

    likely bias toward a dry modeled root zone. Thus, it was expected

    that without the TSEB-ET, the neutron attenuation data was

    less necessary. Furthermore, the water balance model had not

    previously been tested in this climate for soybean without soil

    water content measurement incorporation, as it has been for

    maize (Barker et al., 2018b).

    One ﬁnal challenge encountered with using the SETMI model

    was the division of Landsat images as being either early or

    late in the season with regards to computing the basal crop

    coeﬃcient time series (see Barker et al., 2018a). In this, images

    either contribute to the increasing portion of the crop coeﬃcient,

    before and up-to peak value, or they contribute to the decreasing

    portion of the crop coeﬃcient after peak. In the case of 2017, the

    best cutoﬀ was not the same for all pixels. For example, if only

    imagery before 21 July 2017 was included in the development

    portion of the season, then crop coeﬃcients were poorly ﬁt for

    ∼13 plots. However, if the cutoﬀ was set to include 21 July 2017 in

    the development portion of the season, all performed reasonably

    well, but some not as well as if 21 July 2017 was forced to be

    late in the season. Ultimately, 21 July 2017 was allowed to be

    a development period image for all plots. The eﬀect was small

    in terms of modeled root zone depletion. Ultimately, the model

    would be improved by adding an optimization routine based on

    goodness of ﬁt to determine the best cutoﬀ date for each pixel.

    Model Performance

    The modeled 1-m average proﬁle soil volumetric water content

    (θp) had a negative mean bias error (MBE) of ∼-0.03 m3 m−3,

    with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ∼0.04 m3 m−3, in

    2017 (Figure 5). These results may be improved with model

    calibration, including reducing soil evaporation. Assuming a 1.5-

    m root zone did not appreciably improve results for 2017. Model

    performance was improved in 2018 soybean with modeled θp

    for the top 1-m having a MBE < 0.01 m3 m−3 and an RMSE

    ≈ 0.02 m3 m−3. These results represent an improvement over

    results in the same ﬁeld in 2017. Furthermore, these results

    indicate that the water balance model in SETMI is suitable

    for irrigation management under these conditions without the

    periodic incorporation of secondary datasets as was done in

    2017. Assessing the uncertainty associated with using SETMI

    for irrigation management was beyond the scope of this study.

    However, such is acknowledged as a possible source of variability

    and error presented in Figure 5.

    Prescribed Irrigation

    For the 2017 season, the VRI-Full treatment had a range (across

    plots) of 314–375 mm for prescribed gross irrigation depth

    and a range of 304–375 mm for intended prescriptions. When

    comparing treatment means, the total prescribed irrigation

    was essentially the same for the VRI-Full and Uniform-

    Full treatments (353 and 355 mm, respectively; Table 3). The

    mean total intended prescribed irrigation was also similar (351

    and 344 mm for the VRI-Full and Uniform-Full, respectively,

    Table 3). With a 95% conﬁdence interval of the mean of ±

    9 mm for the applied VRI-Full and ± 10 mm for the intended

    VRI-Full, the two treatments were not statistically diﬀerent and

    practically the same. This is logical as both treatments included

    incorporation of neutron attenuation measurements.

    In 2018, total intended gross prescribed irrigation application

    depth ranged from 236 to 277 mm for VRI-Full and 216 to

    241 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit. The range was 246–282 mm for applied

    prescribed gross irrigation for VRI-Full and 221–246 mm for

    VRI-Deﬁcit. In that year total applied prescribed irrigation

    was statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (t = 17.7) for both VRI

    treatments. Both were also diﬀerent from the two uniform

    treatments. Total intended prescribed irrigation was likewise

    diﬀerent for the two VRI treatments (t = 10.2) with only the

    VRI-Full and Uniform-Deﬁcit not being diﬀerent. The greatest

    total intended irrigation depth was 282 mm for Uniform-Full,

    followed by 267 mm for Uniform-Deﬁcit, 265 mm for VRI-Full,

    and 234 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit. Since the uniform treatments had

    no variability in prescribed irrigation, a factorial analysis was

    not performed. However, in both cases intended full irrigation

    was greater than deﬁcit (31 mm greater in the case of VRI

    and 15 mm greater in the case of Uniform). Likewise, intended

    VRI was less than Uniform with Full being 17 mm less and

    Deﬁcit being 33 mm less. It is possible that model bias (Figure 5;

    which was from the ﬁnal analysis, but is still illustrative) may

    have biased the VRI treatments. This could potentially have the

    impact of increasing prescribed irrigation for the VRI treatments.

    It is evident that under our study conditions, adoption of

    VRI based upon reduced water withdrawal alone may not be

    justiﬁable, agreeing with the ﬁndings of Lo et al. (2016), and

    Barker et al. (2018b). Justiﬁcation for VRI would need to include

    other beneﬁts, e.g., changes in yield, lower cost of production

    or reduced nutrient leaching (Lo, 2015; Lo et al., 2016). The

    late imposition of treatments (i.e., the VRI treatments were

    irrigated similar to the Uniform during the ﬁrst portion of

    both years) may also have reduced potential diﬀerences. This

    may particularly be the case for the deﬁcit irrigated soybean

    treatments in 2019, which may have responded diﬀerently had

    the diﬀerent treatments been imposed from the beginning of the

    irrigation season. Furthermore, the Landsat shortwave imagery

    resolution (30 m; USGS, 2019) may limit the ability to address

    the soil and other variability within the study ﬁeld. This may

    have a smoothing eﬀect that may reduce potential beneﬁts of VRI.

    Concurrent research is investigating unmanned aircraft systems

    as a source of high-resolution imagery for VRI management

    with SETMI (Bhatti, 2018). However, the practical management

    scale of VRI may be similar in scale to Landsat as discussed by

    Barker et al. (2018a).

    The intent of VRI is to manage irrigation at a sub-ﬁeld scale

    to account for sub-ﬁeld scale heterogeneity. In the framework

    of the procedure and modeling used in this study, VRI would

    be anticipated to respond to conditions when spatial variability

    exists for root zone AWC and/or ETc. The total intended

    prescribed irrigation was compared for these two variables for

    each VRI plot included in the ﬁnal analysis. In 2017, the

    correlation between total intended gross irrigation depth and

    AWC was negative, as expected, but it was poor (R2 = 0.26, n

    = 18; Figure 6). The poor correlation is likely a result of the

    hybrid model adjustments to the water balance, which were also

    responsible for much of the model drift. In 2018, the correlation

    between total intended gross irrigation depth and AWC was

    similarly poor (R2 = 0.37, n = 6, for VRI-Full; R2 = 0.10, n

    = 4, for VRI-Deﬁcit). The prescribed irrigation depth would be

    expected to be highly correlated with AWC under conditions of

    large AWC variability in situations where diﬀerences in rainfall

    storage capacity across soils may be mined (e.g., Lo et al., 2016),

    as may have been expected for 2018, but this was not observed.

    Scale discrepancies between the SETMI modeled scale, which

    was dependent upon Landsat imagery resolution (30 m; USGS,

    2019) and Landsat pixel positioning, and soil variability may have

    also contributed. There was a poor positive correlation between

    intended gross irrigation and ETc (R2 = 0.12; Figure 6) in 2017.

    In 2018 there was a stronger correlation between total intended

    gross irrigation and ETc for both VRI treatments (R2 = 0.69, n

    = 6, for VRI-Full; R2 = 0.55, n = 4, for VRI-Deﬁcit), suggesting

    that variability in ETc was a major driver in 2018. Despite the

    small dataset, the results of the ETc correlations for 2018 may be

    better than 2017 because the ﬁnal ETc values are close to those

    used in irrigation scheduling for 2018, but in 2017 irrigation

    management, the model was updated with other data sources,

    which may have reduced correlation. Attempts to ﬁnd correlation

    between intended gross irrigation and the product and quotient

    of ETc and AWC generally yielded poor results. The ﬁeld has

    variability in ETc even in the VRI-Full treatment, which is a

    response derived from the Landsat imagery and soil properties.

    Yield and Soil Water Storage Response

    In both years, dry grain yield was similar between all included

    treatments (F = 0.03, p = 0.87 in 2017; F = 0.00, p = 0.96 for

    VRI/Uniform and F = 0.01, p = 0.93 for Full/Deﬁcit in 2018).

    Estimated mean maize grain yield was both statistically and

    practically similar between treatments with 8.91 Mg ha−1 for the

    VRI-Full in 2017 and 8.98 Mg ha−1 for Uniform-Full (Table 4).

    Variability was, however, notable with 95% conﬁdence intervals

    of the estimated means being ± 6 and ±8% of the estimated

    mean for the VRI-Full and Uniform-Full, respectively. In 2018,

    the dry grain yield was statistically similar between all treatments

    ranging from 3.33 Mg ha−1 for Uniform-Full to 3.10 Mg ha−1

    for Uniform-Deﬁcit. However, the variability was substantial,

    ranging from 19% of the estimated mean for Uniform-Full to 24%

    for the VRI-Deﬁcit. This is also notable in the apparent reversal

    of expected response for the VRI-Full and VRI-Deﬁcit treatments

    (3.11 Mg ha-1 and 3.29 Mg ha-1, respectively; Table 4). However,

    it must be remembered that because of the variance of the data,

    these values are statistically the same; thus any conjecture about

    apparent diﬀerences is not valid. It is possible that response

    variance is being induced by the soil variability beyond what is

    captured in the AWC blocking and modeling scale.

    Not only did the irrigation treatments not have a signiﬁcant

    impact on yield, there were also no signiﬁcant diﬀerences

    between treatments for the DP-related variables (1SWS, DP,

    and 1SWS+DP; Table 4). In 2017, 1SWS was similar for both

    treatments (−23 and −20 mm for the VRI-Full and Uniform-

    Full, respectively). 1SWS is presented as a depth-weighted

    average down to 1 m for the last neutron attenuation reading

    minus ﬁrst neutron attenuation reading (Table 2). When deeper

    neutron attenuation values were included, down to 1.52 m, the

    magnitudes increased, but were similar (VRI-Full = −35 mm,

    Uniform-Full = −36 mm; in these deep estimates, three

    additional plots were eliminated because of missing deep neutron

    attenuation readings as compared with the data in Table 4). In

    2017, estimated DP was likewise similar between treatments and

    was practically negligible < 1 mm for both treatments, though the

    diﬀerence was determined to be statistically signiﬁcant.

    §Full/Deﬁcit factor main effects different at the α = 0.05 level with Full = 31
    mm [±8 mm] and Deﬁcit = 20 mm [±7 mm].

    We acknowledge that the estimates for the DP-related

    variables are dependent upon the water balance; during the

    period of 2 June−13 November 2017 the total precipitation was

    241 mm with an estimated 4 mm of runoﬀ using the NRCS

    Runoﬀ Equation (NRCS, 2004) with a curve number of 80.

    In computing DP, the SETMI water balance was executed

    for each plot with the initial soil water content condition on

    1 June 2017 taken from neutron attenuation readings. The

    mean total modeled ETc between 2 June and 13 November

    2017 ranged from 567 to 572 mm for the two treatments. The

    corresponding ETa determined from the water balance was

    548 mm (VRI-Full) and 544 mm (Uniform-Full), a 19–28 mm

    diﬀerence. This diﬀerence could have been reduced by further

    dampening the surface soil evaporation rate in SETMI or by

    reducing the water stress threshold or modifying soil properties;

    however the apparent error was ∼5% or less and we deemed

    these adjustments not justiﬁable. Interestingly, the diﬀerences in

    applied irrigation did not translate into meaningful diﬀerences in

    ET, DP, or 1SWS.

    Results for 2018 were similar to 2017, despite the diﬀerences

    in crops, SETMI methodologies, and the inclusion of the deﬁcit

    treatments. The 1SWS ranged from 8 mm (deﬁcit treatments) to

    17 mm for the VRI-Full. 1SWS is presented as a depth weighted

    average down to 1 m. When deeper neutron attenuation values

    were included, down to 1.22 m (many measurement tubes were

    not suﬃciently deep for the 1.52 m readings), the magnitudes

    were practically and statistically similar (5 mm for the deﬁcit

    treatments, 10 mm for Uniform-Full, and 15 mm for VRI-Full).

    In 2018, estimated DP ranged from 5 mm for VRI-Deﬁcit to

    22 mm for Uniform-Full. Signiﬁcant full/deﬁcit factor main

    eﬀects were found (F = 5.91, p = 0.03) for 1SWS+DP, with full

    treatments being 31 mm and deﬁcit being 20 mm (Table 4). Thus,

    deﬁcit irrigation had a small impact on DP potential.

    With respect to water balance, the 2018 DP estimates were

    computed for the period of 10 July−25 September 2018. The

    total precipitation was 125 mm during this period with an

    estimated 16 mm of runoﬀ (computed as in 2017). In 2018,

    the ETa computed as a residual of the water balance ranged

    from 279 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit) to 299 mm (Uniform-Full), with

    no signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The SETMI modeled ETc had less

    treatment variability ranging from 300 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit) to

    305 mm (Uniform-Deﬁcit), again with no signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

    The net diﬀerence between ETa and ETc ranged from 5 mm

    (Uniform-Full) to 21 mm (VRI-Deﬁcit), diﬀerences < 8% of

    ETa. Again, we feel that SETMI performed adequately and

    that the results did not justify further model adjustments in

    computing DP.

    While there was some diﬀerence in irrigation in 2018,

    there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in dry grain yield or ET.

    Interestingly, even the deﬁcit-irrigated treatments where such

    an eﬀect might be expected, did not result in a signiﬁcant yield

    diﬀerence. Part of the cause may be that the deﬁcit treatments

    were eﬀectively not implemented until mid-August (see the

    Treatments section). However, Doss et al. (1974) found that

    stressing soybean in late pod-ﬁll was more consistent at causing

    a yield reduction than when stress occurred only earlier in

    the season. Moreover, the deﬁcit treatment experienced the

    greatest managed stress around the end pod-ﬁll stage and later.

    One ﬁnal observation is that yield and ET in this ﬁeld may

    both be highly governed by nutrient availability in consequence

    of the light soils (T.H. Lo, UNL, personal communication).

    Future work should seek to quantify possible nutrient stress.

    VRI Full and Deﬁcit Irrigation

    Even though the treatments did not have diﬀerent ET, there

    was the 12 mm diﬀerence in DP potential as represented by

    1SWS+DP between the full and deﬁcit irrigated treatments.

    This diﬀerence corresponds closely to the diﬀerence in applied

    irrigation between the full and deﬁcit irrigated treatments

    (12 mm for VRI and 28 mm for uniform). This supports the

    hypothesis that VRI is unlikely to reduce consumptive use;

    however it may reduce deep percolation. In stating this, it should

    be remembered that all treatments were treated similarly in the

    ﬁrst portion of both seasons. This may have dampened some of

    the potential responses.

    CONCLUSIONS

    Ultimately, the results support the conclusion that, under our

    study conditions, VRI managed with SETMI resulted in a

    relatively small, nominal reduction in water withdrawn in 2018

    as compared to uniform treatments; however no diﬀerence was

    observed in 2017. These results are subject to model performance,

    scale, and treatment implementation. Furthermore, irrigation

    treatments did not result in diﬀerences in grain yield. It is

    evident that any variability accounted for in the VRI management

    did not result in corresponding detectable changes in yield.

    Likewise, few statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in

    estimated deep percolation, modeled or water balance measured

    evapotranspiration, change in soil water storage in the top 1 m

    of the proﬁle, or the sum of these latter two variables between

    any treatments in either year. More testing should be performed

    to demonstrate the utility of SETMI for deﬁcit irrigation

    management. The performance of the SETMI water balance

    model in 2018 was promising, as it was executed unaided by on-

    site measurements beyond weather data, FC, and WP. Testing

    over longer periods and varied conditions is necessary to fully

    test that utility. The temporal and spatial scale of Landsat data

    was a concern (especially thermal imagery); alternate satellite

    data products and/or unmanned aircraft imagery may address

    this problem. The proposed modiﬁcations to SETMI, including

    optimization of the basal crop coeﬃcient development, inclusion

    of a non-linear Ks function, and partitioning TSEB-ET, may also

    improve model performance.

    Abstract: California has unsustainable use of agricultural water and energy, as\
    \ well as problems\nof severe drought, nitrate pollution and groundwater salinity.\
    \ As the leading producer and ex-\nporter of agricultural produce in the United\
    \ States, 5.6 percent of California’s energy is currently\nused for pumping groundwater.\
    \ These problems and new regulatory policies (e.g., Sustainable\nGroundwater Management\
    \ Act, Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program) pressure growers to schedule,\naccount\
    \ and maintain records of water, energy and nutrients needed for crop and soil\
    \ management.\nGrowers require varying levels of decision support to integrate\
    \ different irrigation strategies into\nfarm operations. Decision support can\
    \ come from the public or private sector, where there are\nmany tradeoffs between\
    \ cost, underlying science, user friendliness and overall challenges in farm\n\
    integration. Thus, effective irrigation management requires clear deﬁnitions,\
    \ decision support and\nguidelines for how to incorporate and evaluate the water–nutrient–energy\
    \ nexus beneﬁts of different\npractices and combinations of practices under shifting\
    \ water governance. The California Energy\nCommission-sponsored Energy Product\
    \ Evaluation Hub (Cal-EPE Hub) project has a mission of\nproviding science-based\
    \ evaluation of energy-saving technologies as a direct result of improved water\n\
    management for irrigation in agriculture, including current and future irrigation\
    \ decision support\nsystems in California. This project incorporates end-user\
    \ perceptions into evaluations of existing\ndecision support tools in partnership\
    \ with government, agricultural and private stakeholders. In this\narticle, we\
    \ review the policy context and science underlying the available irrigation decision\
    \ support\nsystems (IDSS), discuss the beneﬁts/tradeoffs and report on their efﬁcacy\
    \ and ease of use for the\nmost prevalent cropping systems in California. Finally,\
    \ we identify research and knowledge-to-action\ngaps for incorporating irrigation\
    \ decision support systems into new incentives and requirements for\nreporting\
    \ water and energy consumption as well as salinity and nitrogen management in\
    \ the state\nof California.\nKeywords: food–water–energy nexus; nitrate leaching;\
    \ precision agriculture; water productivity;\nirrigation management; soil moisture\n\
    1. Introduction\nAgricultural production in California includes the cultivation\
    \ of approximately 400 crops\naccounting for one-third of vegetable and two-thirds\
    \ of fruit and nut production in the\nUnited States [1]. According to California\
    \ Agricultural Production Statistics (2019), this\nagricultural abundance makes\
    \ California a leading US state accounting for over 13% of the\ncountry’s total\
    \ value in agricultural production. Some of California’s leading crops include\n\
    almonds, grapes, strawberries, pistachios, lettuce, walnuts and processing tomatoes\
    \ [1]. In\norder to produce these crops for export across the country and other\
    \ parts of the world,\ngreat amounts of water, fertilizer and energy are used.\
    \ In California, agricultural water\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12081962\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n2 of 31\nuse represents\
    \ one-ﬁfth of the electricity consumed for water use and four percent of total\n\
    electricity consumption annually [2]. Approximately 75–80% of the total water\
    \ pumped is\nused to irrigate three million hectares throughout the state [3,4].\
    \ The majority of the water\nand energy consumption is during the summer growing\
    \ season (June to August), relying on\ngroundwater that uses between 496 to 1750\
    \ Megajoules per Megaliter of water [5]. Declines\nin aquifer levels, increased\
    \ land subsidence and loss of storage strain growers for energy\nefﬁciency improvements\
    \ in drought years. The ampliﬁed demand for water and energy\nduring drought also\
    \ lowers stream ﬂows and lake levels, which impact the production\nof hydroelectric\
    \ power. In addition, the water table is lowered continually during these\nperiods,\
    \ as growers pump groundwater from deeper wells demanding more power. The\nCalifornia\
    \ drought assessment of 2014 reported a loss of 8.1 million ML of surface water\n\
    with a simultaneous increase of 6.3 million ML in groundwater pumped for an additional\n\
    cost of USD 454 million [6]. Flood and furrow irrigation still account for approximately\n\
    40 percent of the total irrigated area in California, despite the advances and\
    \ investments in\nirrigation systems. The adoption of the drip and micro-sprinkler\
    \ irrigation signiﬁcantly\nincreased in acreage between 1991 (0.52 million hectares)\
    \ and 2010 (16 million hectares) [7].\nFigure 1 identiﬁes the hydrologic regions\
    \ across the state of California and the distribution\nof major crops, irrigation\
    \ methods and levels of salinity in irrigation water.\nCalifornia’s increasing\
    \ severity of droughts not only depletes groundwater but also\nincreases the carbon\
    \ footprint and greenhouse gas emissions from increased burning of\nfossil fuels\
    \ to generate the power for pumping groundwater. After facing several severe\n\
    drought years, state leaders implemented incentives, regulations and policies\
    \ to manage\ngroundwater that require record keeping and reporting of water use,\
    \ nitrogen (N) leaching\nand energy consumption. Simple and scalable irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are\nneeded to facilitate base information for growers\
    \ to manage and maximize irrigation\nwater, energy and N use efﬁciency. On-farm\
    \ water management using irrigation decision\nsupport systems coordinates the\
    \ development and management of water, land and related\nresources aimed toward\
    \ equitable economic welfare and sustainable water use for future\ngenerations\
    \ [8,9]. Irrigation decision support systems (IDSS) are integrated solutions\n\
    combining and interpreting real-time meteorological, soil moisture and/or crop\
    \ water\nstress data using telemetric services to help growers make irrigation\
    \ decisions. Most of\nthe ﬁrst IDSS developed in California ranged from spreadsheets\
    \ to stand-alone software.\nWith recent improvements in public weather-station\
    \ networks, sensor technology, satellite\nand aerial imaging, wireless communications\
    \ and cloud computing, web and smartphone\napplications automating a range of\
    \ complex calculations involved in evapotranspiration-\nbased irrigation scheduling,\
    \ crop and soil nitrogen status IDDS have been developed.\nThe California Energy\
    \ Product Evaluation Hub (or Hub) was proposed by the Califor-\nnia Energy Commission\
    \ to ﬁll an information gap between energy sector manufacturers\nand large commercial\
    \ and institutional customers. The purpose of the Hub is to accelerate\nthe adoption\
    \ of beneﬁcial technologies by informing customers purchasing distributed\nenergy\
    \ resource products through procurement processes. The objectives of the Hub are\
    \ to\nevaluate the selected distributed energy resource products (e.g., IDSS)\
    \ in a rigorous and\ntransparent manner and widely disseminate the evaluation\
    \ results to large commercial and\ninstitutional customers. The evaluations will\
    \ allow comparisons of similar technologies,\nas well as comparisons to existing\
    \ government and industry standards. The evaluations,\nand the data behind them,\
    \ will be distributed through the Hub’s public web platform. The\nHub is a cooperative\
    \ effort among the University of California, Davis, Lawrence Berkeley\nNational\
    \ Laboratory, Energy Solutions and the Center for the Built Environment of the\n\
    University of California, Berkeley.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n3 of 31\nare integrated\
    \ into existing crop irrigation management as part of the ongoing research of\
    \ \nthe California Energy Product Evaluation Hub. Finally, we identify knowledge\
    \ gaps in \nIDSS research and current available tools for integrating energy,\
    \ nitrogen leaching and \nsoil salinity management. \n \nFigure 1. Distribution\

    The overall goal of this narrative review is to identify, compile and assess the\
    \ available\nIDSS in California and how they may serve multiple water, energy\
    \ and nutrient manage-\nment goals. Here, we discuss the different water budget\
    \ components and measurements\nused in crop canopy, soil moisture, aerial reﬂectance\
    \ and satellite-based IDSS. We also\nconsider diverse California cropping and\
    \ irrigation systems and how different IDSS are\nintegrated into existing crop\
    \ irrigation management as part of the ongoing research of\nthe California Energy\
    \ Product Evaluation Hub. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps in\nIDSS research\
    \ and current available tools for integrating energy, nitrogen leaching and soil\n\
    salinity management.\n2. Objective and Review Methodology\nWe identiﬁed all active\
    \ IDSS in California through a comprehensive search of all IDSS\non the search\
    \ engines and in consultation with a California IDSS product advisory group.\n\
    The IDSS product advisory group consisted of growers, certiﬁed crop advisors,\
    \ cooperative\nextension advisors, the California Department of Agriculture, California\
    \ Agricultural\nIrrigation Association and additional government, industry and\
    \ trade organizations. The\nadvisory group helped deﬁne the IDSS needs for the\
    \ California cropping system. This\ninformation was used to identify the commercially\
    \ or freely available technologies and\nexclude the IDSS that have not yet been\
    \ made available for widespread use.\nSection 3 deﬁnes California’s water management\
    \ context and the need for IDSS un-\nder increasing drought, regulation and risk\
    \ management. Section 4 provides a broad\noverview of soil–plant–atmosphere approaches\
    \ for IDSS. Section 5 describes the commer-\ncially available IDSS based on soil\
    \ tension, canopy temperature, stem water potential and\nremote-sensing techniques.\
    \ Section 6 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\nintegrated irrigation\
    \ and energy management in agricultural systems. Section 7 describes\nthe science,\
    \ policy and role of IDSS for integrated irrigation and nitrogen (N) management\n\
    to control the environmental problems or groundwater contamination due to excessive\n\
    N fertilizer uses. Section 8 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\
    \ integrated\nirrigation and salinity management. Sections 9 and 10 focus on IDSS\
    \ as a holistic effort\nfor water, nutrient and salinity management and consider\
    \ the innovation, validation and\nadoption strategies.\n3. Context for IDSS in\
    \ California Agriculture\n3.1. Water Scarcity\nOverdrawn aquifers, decline in\
    \ snowpack, frequent droughts and rising evaporative\ndemand are increasing water\
    \ scarcity in California. These water resource concerns have\nled to decreasing\
    \ water availability for irrigation, increasing regulation (e.g., reduced allo-\n\
    cations), increasing energy consumption, difﬁculty in water/fertilization co-management\n\
    and increasing water and energy prices. Because the annual evaporative demand\
    \ exceeds\nprecipitation in the majority of California, irrigation is generally\
    \ considered compulsory.\nWhile most of the precipitation falls in the winter,\
    \ key economic crops have high water\ndemands during the spring–summer–fall season.\
    \ Additionally, there is a spatial disconnect\nbetween precipitation and agricultural\
    \ water demand in California. Most of the surface\nwater used for agriculture\
    \ comes from precipitation in the northern part of the state, while\nthe Central\
    \ Valley and southern parts of the state have the greatest demand for agricultural\n\
    water. These discrepancies in space and time have led to complex water conveyance,\n\
    storage and transfer systems that are important for understanding the potential\
    \ beneﬁts of\nIDSS for California growers [10].\nAlthough California spans a wide\
    \ range of climates, much of the state, including\nsome of the most productive\
    \ farmland, occupies semi-arid regions of the Central and Impe-\nrial Valleys,\
    \ which are characterized by a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers\nand\
    \ mild, wet winters. Statewide, the average water use is roughly 50% environmental,\n\
    40% agricultural and 10% urban [11]. By necessity, California has adopted management\n\
    strategies to deal with water shortages, such as reusing water, long-distance\
    \ water con-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n5 of 31\nveyance and desalination technologies\
    \ to complement local ground and surface water [12].\nUnfortunately, water supply\
    \ diversiﬁcation strategies can also lead to increased energy use\nand, consequently,\
    \ to increased greenhouse gas emissions [13]. California’s water system is\nestimated\
    \ to emit 10% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions [14]. Water–energy nexus\n\
    approaches recognize the close connection between water and energy and the importance\n\
    of considering all aspects of these complex systems [15,16]. As irrigation makes\
    \ up a large\nportion of the water supply system in the state, it is under critical\
    \ consideration by both\ngovernment agencies and agricultural end users. Policy\
    \ makers face the difﬁcult task of\nbalancing the needs of diverse stakeholders,\
    \ protecting the environment and providing\nreliable, sustainable water supplies\
    \ to agricultural, industrial and residential customers [16].\nAt the same time,\
    \ California growers face more frequent and severe drought events, warmer\ntemperatures\
    \ and variable rainfall associated with climate change [17], leading to increasing\n\
    dependence on irrigation [18].\nGrowers also face increasing competition for irrigation\
    \ water and growing concerns\nabout the environmental impacts of irrigation. Growers\
    \ pay for water, energy and infras-\ntructure to irrigate crops. California growers\
    \ pay between USD 12/106 ML−1 water in\ndirect costs and USD 17/151 ML−1 water\
    \ in energy costs [19–21]. While growers are willing\nto adopt new technologies\
    \ to reduce risks during periods of water shortage, the information\nprovided\
    \ by extension services and other educational sources plays an important role\
    \ in\nnew irrigation technology adoption [22].\n3.2. Regulations\nCalifornia growers\
    \ identify the key barriers to water and energy conservation efforts as\n(1) cost,\
    \ (2) a lack of return on investment (3) and uncertainty about the future of available\n\
    water. Cost alone is not enough to increase IDSS adoption or agricultural water\
    \ conserva-\ntion [23]. In semi-arid regions, regulating surface water without\
    \ regulating groundwater (or\nvice versa) increases pressure on the unregulated\
    \ water source instead of increasing the use\nof IDSS [24]. However, approaches\
    \ that involve cooperation across institutional ecosystems\nas well as multi-actor\
    \ governance and participation to jointly regulate groundwater and\nsurface water\
    \ quantity, nutrient/pollutant transport and energy usage may increase IDSS\n\
    adoption [23,25].\nFor the past century, California has been a demonstrative example\
    \ where the reg-\nulation and governance of surface water quantity and quality\
    \ have placed tremendous\nstress on groundwater supply and energy required to\
    \ pump groundwater in years with\nlimited surface water allocation. However, the\
    \ legislation and policies adapted in 2014–2016\nare attempting to jointly regulate\
    \ groundwater and surface water quantity, quality and\ncooperation across institutions.\
    \ In 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater\nManagement Act (SGMA),\
    \ in which two state agencies (Department of Water Resources and\nState Water\
    \ Resources Control Board) mandate and oversee communities self-organizing\ninto\
    \ groundwater sustainability agencies [26]. Each agency created groundwater sustain-\n\
    ability plans to achieve sustainability goals by 2040–2042. Similarly, in 2014,\
    \ the California\nIrrigated Lands Regulatory Program was expanded to regulate\
    \ nitrates in discharge to\nboth surface and groundwater from irrigated agricultural\
    \ lands [27]. California’s 2020\nheat wave and widespread agricultural power outages\
    \ have spurred agricultural trade\norganizations to consider the need for IDSS\
    \ to accommodate off-peak energy usage and\nregulations imposed by utility companies\
    \ [28]. However, there are not yet any direct\nstatewide regulations on the energy\
    \ used for groundwater pumping in California.\n3.3. Loss and Risk Management\n\
    3.3.1. Infrastructure Failures\nIDSS could help growers plan for water usage throughout\
    \ the growing season when\nadjustments may be required to accommodate irrigation\
    \ interruptions to avoid yield losses\nat critical moments. For example, in the\
    \ 2018 Census on Irrigation and Water Management,\n1792 CA growers (29,538 ha)\
    \ reported yield losses because of irrigation interruptions related\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n6 of 31\nto groundwater/surface water shortages, equipment failure,\
    \ energy shortages, high salinity,\nloss of water rights or increase in water\
    \ costs [29]. Having a formal IDSS in place does not\nprevent water, energy or\
    \ infrastructure disruptions but instead could assist in identifying\nequipment\
    \ failures and providing the projected data and calculations needed for difﬁcult\n\
    decisions—how best to prioritize the available water across the farm to the crops\
    \ that will\nhave the highest potential for short- and long-term revenue.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Disease-Based Losses and Water\nGrowers using intuitive, informal irrigation\
    \ practices may err on the side of applying\n‘extra’ water to ensure that crop\
    \ water requirements are met. Additionally, some IDSS may\nalso err on the side\
    \ of overprediction of evapotranspiration and crop water requirements\nto match\
    \ grower management practices. Although this logic may decrease the risk of\n\
    underwatering or water stress, it can increase water logging, nitrate leaching,\
    \ anoxia,\ndenitriﬁcation, salinity, soil erosion and runoff, in addition to the\
    \ wasted energy and water\ncosts [30]. In California perennial crops, overirrigation\
    \ or irrigating too soon can impact\nroot development—especially of shallow, ﬁne\
    \ roots—which can lead to long-term yield\nlosses, especially if the root zone\
    \ oxygen concentration drops below 10% [31]. In both\nannual and perennial crops,\
    \ overirrigation that increases soil and/or canopy moisture can\noften increase\
    \ the survival, growth, infection and dispersal of pathogens, which ultimately\n\
    leads to disease-based yield losses [32]. However, it is important to note that\
    \ not supplying\nenough water to meet crop needs can also trigger many belowground\
    \ diseases [32]. For\na comprehensive review of irrigation–disease interactions,\
    \ please see Swett (2020) [32].\nAlthough IDSS could integrate crop-speciﬁc co-management\
    \ of water and diseases in the\nfuture, to the best of our knowledge, no IDSS\
    \ currently have this function for California\ncropping systems.\n4. Soil–Plant–Atmosphere\
    \ Approaches and Data for IDSS in California\n4.1. Precipitation\nPrecipitation\
    \ is an important component of the hydrologic cycle considered for all\nwater\
    \ budgets. In California, real-time rainfall data can be acquired from different\
    \ sources,\nsuch as the Department of Water Resources California Irrigation Management\
    \ Information\nSystem (CIMIS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s\
    \ California Nevada\nRiver Forecast Center (CNRFC) and United States Climate Data.\
    \ For annual water budget-\ning, monthly precipitation data are often used. Several\
    \ researchers have observed decreases\nin precipitation and increases in autumn\
    \ temperatures since the 1980s [33,34]. In 2018, the\ndelayed start of precipitation\
    \ months resulted in the most destructive wildﬁres of California,\nburning about\
    \ 766,439 hectares of land area [34,35]. This has not only disturbed water\nbudget\
    \ planning and estimation, but it has also impacted the contamination of groundwater\n\
    and other available sources of irrigation by changing the pH due to debris and\
    \ ash [36].\n4.2. Evapotranspiration\nEvapotranspiration depends on weather conditions,\
    \ crop type, canopy density/\ndevelopment, stomatal conductance and regulation,\
    \ irrigation system and management,\nsoil management and soil type. In California,\
    \ the estimates of reference evapotranspiration\n(ETo) come from the 153 active\
    \ CIMIS stations that are sited, maintained and equipped\nby the California Department\
    \ of Water Resources to measure shortwave solar radiation\n(pyranometer), soil\
    \ temperature (thermistor), air temperature (HMP35), relative humidity\n(HMP35),\
    \ wind direction (wind vane), wind speed (anemometer) and precipitation (tipping\n\
    bucket rain gauge). The state is divided into 18 ETo climatic zones based on long-term\n\
    monthly CIMIS averages. Additionally, a spatial CIMIS data product combines the\
    \ network\nof available stations for ground measurement and satellite data in\
    \ order to simulate the\nETo of the whole state. CIMIS estimates hourly ETo for\
    \ cool-season grass with a height\nof 0.10–0.15 m using the CIMIS Penman equation,\
    \ which is modiﬁed from the Penman\nequation [37], with an approach for estimating\
    \ net radiation from shortwave solar radiation,\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n7 of\
    \ 31\ntemperature and relative humidity measurements developed and validated using\
    \ 71 net\nradiometers across California [38]. The CIMIS Penman equation also uses\
    \ different weights\nfor wind speed in the hourly estimation of ETo depending\
    \ on whether it is day or night\ntime and a unique cloud factor obtained from\
    \ each CIMIS station [39].\nIn addition to the CIMIS network, the National Oceanic\
    \ and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental\
    \ Satellite (GOES) satellites have\nbeen used to predict incoming solar radiation\
    \ as the main source energy for evapotran-\nspiration. Satellite-based ETo maps\
    \ are calculated on a two-kilometer grid, which is an\nimportant contribution\
    \ of data for decision making, given that the distance between the\nCIMIS stations\
    \ can be tens of kilometers. These freely available estimates of ETo can be\n\
    paired with crop-speciﬁc coefﬁcients (Kc) to estimate crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) during\nthe growing season. It is important to note that evapotranspiration\
    \ offers decision support\nas to how much water has been used by the crop based\
    \ on meteorological data or will be\nused by the crop based on meteorological\
    \ forecasting [40,41].\n4.3. Irrigation Scheduling Resources\nThe quantity and\
    \ timing of water application to irrigate a crop is a critical part of\nplanning\
    \ a growing season. Crop management activities are mainly dependent on the\nmoisture\
    \ present in the soil and root matrix. Scheduling depends on the combination\n\
    of evaporative demand from the atmosphere, spatial and temporal heterogeneity\
    \ in soil\nproperties and changes in crop canopy during a growing season. California\
    \ IDSS currently\nschedule irrigation by measuring, remotely sensing and/or modeling\
    \ some combination of\nthree different categories: (1) evapotranspiration, (2)\
    \ allowable depletion of soil moisture\nand (3) canopy characteristics [42]. In\
    \ this work, we discuss California IDSS and state\nspeciﬁc data sources that can\
    \ be used to ascertain data from these categories and represent\nthese tools and\
    \ sensors in Figure 2. These categories are used in IDSS throughout the world,\n\
    and we recommend Gu et al. (2020) for an in-depth general review [43].\n4.3.1.\
    \ In Situ Calculation of Crop Coefﬁcient Values\nCrop coefﬁcient (Kc) values can\
    \ be obtained for the entire growing season from his-\ntorical evapotranspiration\

    \ esti-\nmates of ETo and ETc for growers. Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to\
    \ measure actual\nevapotranspiration to derive the Kc values speciﬁc to California\

    \ and surface renewal have estimated\nKc values for almond, pistachio, walnut,\
    \ processing tomato, wine grapes, lettuce, rice,\ncorn, wheat, and alfalfa (Table\
    \ 1) [44–68]. It is important to note that the Kc values derived\nfrom actual\
    \ evapotranspiration studies have several assumptions and site-speciﬁc limita-\n\
    tions for widespread adoption and water use projections. Attention should be given\
    \ as\nto whether water stress had occurred during the actual evapotranspiration\
    \ measurement\nperiods as well as the uncertainty of actual evapotranspiration\
    \ estimates by a method-\nological approach. The use of crop coefﬁcients for irrigation\
    \ of perennial crops is often\nmore challenging than for annual crops. This is\
    \ because there can be signiﬁcant variability\nas a consequence of the crop density,\
    \ crop load, row orientation, variety, irrigation sys-\ntem, pruning, ﬂoor management,\

    \ for more details.\n4.3.2. Scheduling with Allowable Depletion\nThe allowable\
    \ depletion of soil moisture approach requires some knowledge or a priori\nassumption\
    \ of the effective crop rooting depth, soil textural and hydrological properties\
    \ and\nestimates of either soil volumetric water content or soil water potential.\
    \ These parameters\nare used to estimate the plant available water content (AWC)\
    \ as the difference between ﬁeld\ncapacity and permanent wilting point. The allowable\
    \ depletion is established as a threshold\nbased on a fraction of AWC or speciﬁc\
    \ soil water potential at which water stress will occur\nwithout irrigation. The\
    \ allowable depletion can differ by soil texture, crop type, as well\nas phenological\
    \ stage. In California, the allowable depletion can range from 25% AWC in\nonions\
    \ to 90% AWC in ripening wheat but generally runs in the 45–50% AWC range [69–71].\n\
    Allowable depletion, whether measured or modeled, offers decision support regarding\n\
    how much to irrigate (e.g., reﬁll the soil proﬁle), as well as when to initiate\
    \ irrigation. It\nis important to note that allowable depletion is not a direct\
    \ assessment of plant water\nstress but rather assumes plant water stress based\
    \ on empirical relationships between plant\nphysiological stress (e.g., stem water\
    \ potential, canopy temperature, reduced transpiration)\nand soil volumetric water\
    \ content or soil water potential.\nSoil cohesion and adhesion to water molecules\
    \ determines the soil water potential\n(suction or negative pressure). Plants\
    \ take up water when water potential is between\nthe ﬁeld capacity (−0.33 bar)\
    \ and permanent wilting point (−15 bar). Therefore, irriga-\ntion scheduling is\
    \ performed by maintaining the soil moisture within this range of soil\nwater\
    \ potential. The most commonly used methods for soil moisture or water potential\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n10 of 31\nmonitoring in California are tensiometers,\
    \ electrical resistance block (watermark sensors)\nor capacitance-based sensors\
    \ [72]. Recent developments in telemetric operations allow\nmanufacturers to combine\
    \ the soil moisture sensors with web or mobile applications as\nremote systems.\
    \ Additionally, the user friendliness of remote telemetry and real-time\nmoisture\
    \ data in the ﬁeld are now integrated with automated irrigation systems. Some\n\
    of the common telemetric operators for soil moisture sensors in California are\
    \ Wildeye,\nFarm(X), Hortau, Irriwatch and AquaSpy.\n4.3.3. Scheduling with Crop\
    \ Canopy Characteristics\nRecent advancements in the capture and interpretation\
    \ of remotely sensed vegetative\nindices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index or NDVI) allow growers to empirically\nderive real-time values of crop\
    \ coefﬁcients throughout the growing season [73–75]. Remote\nsensing tools, such\
    \ as directly or remotely piloted aerial vehicles or satellite imagery, aid in\n\
    the use of algorithms to combine remotely sensed vegetative indices and soil reﬂectance\n\
    maps [76–79]. This combination helps growers manage irrigation in orchard cropping\n\
    systems where NDVI and other index values for individual trees can be calculated.\
    \ In\nCalifornia, these services are widely provided by Ceres Imaging Inc. to\
    \ specialty crop grow-\ners. Additionally, CropManage uses satellite-based estimates\
    \ of phenology for irrigation\nscheduling [80–82].\n5. IDSS for Crop Water Management\
    \ in California\nThe use of IDSS has increased in California in the last decade,\
    \ especially for efﬁcient\nwater application preparation for the SGMA regulatory\
    \ standards. The most common\nIDSS in California integrate two major components:\
    \ (1) data input/analysis and (2) user\ninterface. The data input/analytical techniques\
    \ acquire data based on soil, crop and/or\nweather parameters, and the user interface\
    \ is based on telemetry that simpliﬁes the acquired\ndata using statistical interpretation,\
    \ photogrammetry and/or simulation modeling. The\nease of understanding or user\
    \ friendliness of the acquired information depends on the\nuse of graphics, color\
    \ notations and approach to simplify the complex data [83]. The\nIDSS commonly\
    \ used in cultivating specialty crops in California can be classiﬁed into\nthree\
    \ types (Table 2): (1) soil-based IDSS, (2) canopy-based IDSS and (3) remote-sensing\n\
    IDSS. Irrigation strategies, such as deﬁcit irrigation, subsurface drip irrigation,\
    \ overhead\nlinear move sprinkler irrigation, deep root irrigation, pressure-compensated\
    \ drip irrigation,\nautomated surface irrigation, and tail recovery systems may\
    \ enhance water use efﬁciency\nfor high-value crops in California [84].\n5.1.\
    \ Soil-Based IDSS\nIn IDSS, soil moisture is generally reported in inches of water\
    \ per foot of soil or as\na percentage of weight or volume [2,85], while soil\
    \ water potential is usually reported in\nbars or kPa. The California IDSS based\
    \ on soil moisture usually also estimate or infer soil\nhydrologic properties\
    \ (e.g., texture, AWC) to contextualize the recommendations. Therefore,\nthe soil\
    \ sensors used as IDSS can be divided into two types.\nType 1—IDSS based on volumetric\
    \ moisture content. These soil moisture sensors include\ntime domain reﬂectometry,\
    \ capacitance and frequency domain reﬂectometry sensors [80,86].\nType 2—IDSS\
    \ based on soil water potential. These sensors include tensiometers and\ngranular\

    \ 12, 1962\n12 of 31\nSoil sensors are generally provided by IDSS vendors in combination\
    \ with their telemet-\nric services to access the data through cloud-based data\
    \ storage applications. The selection\nof these sensors is based on evaluating\
    \ water and energy savings, installation and mainte-\nnance, ease of use and suitability\
    \ for specialty crops and soil type, data interpretation and\nadditional services.\
    \ Vendors have the capability of making recommendations to growers\nby integrating\
    \ and installing in situ weather stations. However, the CIMIS weather stations\n\
    are widely spread throughout the state and provide reliable and validated information\
    \ on\nthe required weather parameters for water budgeting. Some commonly used\
    \ soil moisture\nsensors can be combined with telemetric services provided either\
    \ by the sensor company\nor by a separate IDSS vendor.\nSoil moisture probes are\
    \ widely used to determine the real-time volumetric moisture\ncontent allowing\
    \ user-friendly or site-speciﬁc calibrations. Measurements can be taken\nat the\
    \ desirable depths throughout the soil proﬁle. These sensors also provide additional\n\
    information on soil temperature and salinity. These sensors, based on design,\
    \ can also\nmeasure soil water potential up to −10 bars. The sensors are provided\
    \ to growers as leased\nassets, and real-time irrigation recommendations are made\
    \ through telemetry services.\nExamples include tensiometers that are designed\
    \ to measure soil water potential in heavy\n(0–1 bar) and light soils (0–0.3 bar).\
    \ Watermark sensors are based on electrical resistance in\nsoils and are widely\
    \ useful for measuring soil matric potential up to 2 bars.\n5.2. Canopy-Based\
    \ IDSS\nThe metabolic processes in a plant system are driven by its water content.\
    \ Plant water\nstatus can be estimated by monitoring physiological and metabolic\
    \ processes, such as stem\nor leaf water potential, relative moisture content,\
    \ stomatal conductance, canopy temperature\nand xylem cavitation [2,73,89–92].\
    \ The most commonly measured water stress parameters in\nCalifornia are canopy\
    \ temperature, canopy cover and stem water potential [2]. These plant\nwater status\
    \ indicators are most useful for irrigation timing and can be used to inform when\n\
    irrigation is required, when crops are not receiving enough irrigation, when there\
    \ are problems\nwith irrigation systems (e.g., distribution uniformity), as a\
    \ proxy for soil salinity stress and\nfor applying controlled stress to improve\
    \ crop quality or health. Plant water status indicators\nare less useful for understanding\
    \ how much irrigation is needed, as they do not provide\ninformation about soil\
    \ moisture or evaporative demand. Plant-based IDSS are generally\ncombined with\
    \ meteorological parameters and/or evapotranspiration data.\n5.2.1. Canopy Cover\n\
    Radiation interception and evapotranspiration depend on the canopy cover and sur-\n\
    face area of a crop. Canopy cover serves as an important parameter for several\
    \ remote-\nsensing techniques used as IDSS. As crop canopies change throughout\
    \ the growing season\nin terms of their size, area and reﬂectance properties,\
    \ so do the values of the crop coefﬁcient\n(Kc). The spectral reﬂectance of vegetation\
    \ or crop canopy can help growers understand\nthe variability in the ﬁeld by assessing\
    \ the plant vigor and chlorophyll content [93,94].\nA key component of canopy-based\
    \ IDSS is the crop and growth stage-speciﬁc Kc value.\nThe Kc values are usually\
    \ determined from ﬁeld studies measuring actual evapotranspi-\nration and ETo\
    \ [95,96] but can also be assessed using measurements of leaf area index,\nlight\
    \ interception and percent canopy cover. Some of the commonly used IDSS based\n\
    on evapotranspiration and canopy parameters include Arable Mark 2 sensors and\
    \ Tule\nsensors. These sensors are leased by the respective vendors, and the irrigation\
    \ recom-\nmendations based on canopy parameters are informed through web/mobile\
    \ applications.\nArable Mark 2 sensors are often combined with the soil moisture\
    \ probes to apply the soil\nand canopy parameters to complete the water budget\
    \ equation for irrigation decisions.\n5.2.2. Canopy Temperature\nCanopy temperature\
    \ indirectly measures water deﬁcit when it increases above the\nsurrounding ambient\
    \ temperature [97]. In general, the variability in canopy temperature\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n13 of 31\nis also a result of solar radiation and air temperature.\
    \ Different indices are used for\nirrigation scheduling using canopy temperatures.\
    \ Some examples include the Crop Water\nStress Index, Stress Degree Days, Stomatal\
    \ Conductance Index, Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold and Time Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT) [98–101]. In California, the Crop Water\nStress Index and Degrees Above\
    \ Canopy Threshold have been evaluated for wine grapes,\ncorn, pistachios and\
    \ wheat growers using infrared thermal radiometry [102,103]. The\nCrop Water Stress\
    \ Index is calculated by determining the canopy temperature minus\nthe air temperature\
    \ relative to a well-watered and non-transpiring reference crop [103].\nContrary\
    \ to the Crop Water Stress Index, the Degrees Above Canopy Threshold only\nrequires\
    \ a single canopy temperature measurement for quantifying water stress [103,104].\n\
    For point-based measurements, canopy temperature can be acquired using an infrared\n\
    thermal radiometer [103]. At larger spatial scales, thermal and spectral imagery\
    \ IDSS\n(e.g., Ceres Imaging) using remote-sensing tools can be used for determining\
    \ indices based\non canopy temperature.\n5.2.3. Stem Water Potential\nStem water\
    \ potential is an indicator of how hard a plant is pumping to move water\nfrom\
    \ the soil (−15 to 0 bars) through the xylem (−2 to −60 bars) to the atmosphere\n\
    (−200 to −800 bars) [105]. In California, stem water potential is most commonly\
    \ used\nand recommended for high-value perennial crops, such as grapes, almonds,\
    \ walnuts and\nprunes [106,107]. Stem water potential is most often measured by\
    \ a pressure chamber, which\napplies pressure to a sample leaf until the water\
    \ is pushed out of the stem [90,106,108].\nThere are growing numbers of sensors\
    \ available for measuring the stem water potential.\nThese sensors can function\
    \ as micro-chips or micro-tensiometers or dendrometers for\ninstallation in woody\
    \ vines or trunks [108]. In order to be useful, stem water potential\nmeasurements\
    \ need to be contextualized in relation to the environmental demand, as they\n\
    are sensitive to temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit [105]. Local tools are\
    \ available for\ngrowers to correct stem water potential readings in reference\
    \ to the evaporative demand and\ncompare the readings to baseline values when\
    \ water is not limited. The use of stem water\npotential measurements is high\
    \ in wine grapes, as growers are interested in maintaining\nspeciﬁc levels of\
    \ stress after veraison in order to maintain the quality (M. Cooper, personal\n\
    communication). Larger California vineyards have ‘pressure bomb teams’ to constantly\
    \ test\nstem water potential throughout the vineyards during the key time periods.\
    \ Although there\nare disease management beneﬁts to maintaining stress at hull\
    \ split, nut growers have still\nbeen slow to adopt the pressure chambers to measure\
    \ stem water potential, with adoption\nrates of under 20% among almond growers\
    \ [109].\n5.3. Remote-Sensing IDSS\nRemote and proximal sensing tools can be used\
    \ either independently or in conjunction\nwith ground measurements to estimate\
    \ actual evapotranspiration, ETc, allowable depletion\nand plant water status.\
    \ Remote sensing can use several modes of data collection, including\nsatellite,\
    \ aerial imaging and scanning towers. Remotely sensed measurements of evapotran-\n\
    spiration typically use thermal imaging as an indicator of canopy radiometric\
    \ temperature,\nwhere higher temperatures indicate relatively lower rates of evapotranspiration\
    \ (relatively\nhigher partitioning to sensible heat ﬂux), and relatively lower\
    \ temperatures indicate higher\nrates of evapotranspiration (relatively higher\
    \ partitioning to latent heat ﬂux). Remotely\nsensed vegetation indices from multispectral\
    \ data, such as NDVI, can be used as analogs for\nthe leaf area index, canopy\
    \ cover and height, which are also required for evapotranspiration\nmapping algorithms.\
    \ All remotely sensed evapotranspiration models solve for sensible\nheat ﬂux,\
    \ soil heat ﬂux and net radiation, which leaves the latent heat ﬂux or the energy\n\
    equivalent of evapotranspiration as the remainder of the energy budget. Some of\
    \ the en-\nergy balance models commonly used in evapotranspiration estimation\
    \ include Two-Source\nEnergy Balance (TSEB), Surface Energy Balance Algorithm\
    \ for Land (SEBAL), Surface En-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n14 of 31\nergy Balance\
    \ System (SEBS), Mapping EvapoTRanspiration using Internalized Calibration\n(METRIC)\
    \ and High-Resolution Mapping of EvapoTranspiration (HRMET) [77,110–115].\nThese\
    \ types of evapotranspiration maps and crop stress indices have been integrated\n\
    into several IDSS that serve California, such as Ceres Imaging (Oakland, CA, USA),\
    \ Ir-\nriwatch (Maurik, The Netherlands) and Open ET (a satellite-based water\
    \ data resource\nlaunched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\
    \ and United States\nGeological Services (USGS)). However, one potential concern\
    \ or drawback is that detectable\ndifferences in evapotranspiration based on canopy\
    \ radiometric temperature may be re-\nvealed too late for irrigation intervention,\
    \ in that crops exhibiting this level of water stress\nhave already suffered some\
    \ yield loss from decreased photosynthesis [116]. This limitation\nof thermal\
    \ imaging has led to new areas of development for IDSS that may involve combin-\n\
    ing a variety of spectral bands, solar-induced ﬂuorescence and thermal imagery\
    \ to provide\nadditional information relating water status to yields [117,118].\n\
    Proximal sensing of soil apparent electrical conductivity can be a useful tool\
    \ to de-\nvelop high-resolution maps of AWC and other important soil physical\
    \ and hydrological\nproperties [119]. These soil maps can be used in conjunction\
    \ with maps of evapotranspira-\ntion or stem water potential measurements to assess\
    \ plant water status [77,78]. In many\nareas outside of California, commercial\
    \ IDSS have been developed to assign management\nzones based on soil properties,\
    \ especially in regions where center pivot irrigation systems\ndominate and can\
    \ be retroﬁtted or designed with variable rate application technology. New\nopportunities\
    \ for precision irrigation exist in California micro-irrigation systems using\n\
    variable frequency drives to irrigate based on the management zones. However,\
    \ there\nare not yet commercially available IDSS in California that rely primarily\
    \ on soil apparent\nelectrical conductivity mapping to delineate zone-based irrigation\
    \ management.\n6. IDSS for Energy Management in California\n6.1. General Considerations\n\
    The California agricultural sector consumes 75% of total water use in California\n\
    compared to 24% and 1% for municipal and industrial sectors, respectively [4].\
    \ During\nthe most recent megadrought between 2012 and 2016, the groundwater contribution\
    \ to\ntotal water use nearly doubled from 30–40% to 60%, with most of this being\
    \ used for\nagricultural irrigation [120,121]. Agricultural groundwater consumption\
    \ is directly linked\nwith the energy required to pump groundwater from the aquifers.\
    \ In California, 8% of total\nenergy use is for agriculture, and 70% of the agricultural\
    \ energy used is for groundwater\npumping [122]. Agricultural water and energy\
    \ demand surge in dry years and the summer\nmonths—especially in the afternoons\
    \ during peak daily energy demand for water to cool\nboth crops and humans [123].\
    \ Additionally, 60% of daily water-related energy demand is\ndue to pumping irrigation\
    \ water in California from surface and groundwater sources [124].\nMost surface\
    \ irrigation systems have an irrigation efﬁciency of 67.5–70%, while the\ntraditional\
    \ sprinkler system ranges between 70 and 82.5%. Drip and micro-sprinkler\nsystems\
    \ have the highest irrigation efﬁciency compared to sprinkler or surface systems,\n\
    ranging between 87.5 and 90% [125]. Pressurized surface and subsurface drip or\
    \ micro-\nsprinkler irrigation systems improve irrigation efﬁciency but require\
    \ more energy than\nsurface ﬂood or gravity irrigation [121,126]. Because there\
    \ has been a nearly commensurate\nconversion in half of California’s irrigated\
    \ lands from surface ﬂood or gravity systems to\npressurized systems since 1972\
    \ [127], California’s irrigation infrastructure has unfortunately\nincreased its\
    \ overall energy consumption while increasing its overall water use efﬁciency.\n\
    6.2. Science\nThere are opportunities for coupled energy and water conservation\
    \ in agriculture\nthrough improving irrigation system efﬁciency, application efﬁciency,\
    \ as well as crop water\nuse efﬁciency. Agricultural pumping of irrigation water\
    \ uses approximately 10 TWh of\nelectricity per year [128], and at least 1 TWh\
    \ or 10% of this usage could be conserved\nthrough improved control of water with\
    \ better water metering and improved distribution\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n15\
    \ of 31\nuniformity [4]. Additionally, pumping reductions through science-based\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning efforts on farm- or district-wide scales may also reduce\
    \ energy consumption [123].\nAdditional energy savings may be available through\
    \ increasing the pump efﬁciency to\n55–65% and using variable frequency drives\
    \ to facilitate changes in pump speeds when\nsystem pressure demands are not peaking\
    \ [129]. Moreover, on-farm solar generation and\nsolar or hybrid solar pumps can\
    \ also curb peak energy demands that coincide with peak\nwater demands [123].\n\
    Finally, either front loading pumping to on-farm water storage structures in advance\n\
    of peak energy demand [123,130] or applying a larger magnitude of irrigation a\
    \ week in\nadvance of a predicted heat wave could mitigate peak energy usage during\
    \ heat waves [126].\nHowever, scheduling larger irrigation events in advance of\
    \ a heat wave would have to\nensure that soil properties facilitated storage rather\
    \ than drainage of excess water. Similarly,\ndeﬁcit irrigation has been suggested\
    \ for energy conservation; however, this would need to\nensure that there either\
    \ would not be a signiﬁcant yield loss or that the yield losses would be\nlow\
    \ enough to justify an overall proﬁt based on reduced energy and irrigation costs.\
    \ Finally,\nthere is an opportunity for collective and community-based action\
    \ from irrigation districts\nand newly formed groundwater sustainability agencies\
    \ to use and develop district-wide\ntools for common pool energy users to pump\
    \ and store water in advance of peak times, as\nwell as prioritize and optimize\
    \ groundwater pumping based on the crop stage and need\nduring droughts and heat\
    \ waves [131].\n6.3. Policy\nThe above coupled energy and water management measures\
    \ require supportive poli-\ncies and governance for success, in which California\
    \ has made some promising progress. In\nresponse to the groundwater-pumping-related\
    \ energy use and high greenhouse gas emis-\nsions during the megadrought of 2012–2016,\
    \ California enacted the State Water Efﬁciency\nand Enhancement Program (SWEEP)\
    \ in 2014, which is the ﬁrst and largest program of its\nkind in the United States\
    \ to date. The SWEEP program involves a competitive application\nprocess for growers\
    \ to receive grants to make improvements that will reduce water and\nenergy consumption,\
    \ greenhouse gases, as well as improve drought resilience and air\nquality. Agricultural\
    \ operations can receive grants for three project categories: (1) pump\nand motor\
    \ enhancements, which include installing variable frequency drives and replacing\n\
    or improving the efﬁciency of motors or pumps; (2) irrigation system enhancements\
    \ for\nsystems with pumps, which include system pressure reduction measures, soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors, automating irrigation systems and IDSS; (3) fuel conversion\
    \ and renewable energy,\nwhich include changing fuel types to low-carbon fuel,\
    \ as well as the installation of on-site\nrenewable energy sources to offset fuel\
    \ use [132].\nApplicants must quantify the baseline information about current\
    \ energy, infrastruc-\nture efﬁciency and water use. Approximately one-third of\
    \ applicants have been awarded\nSWEEP at a maximum of USD 100,000 for 18 months\
    \ [133]. The awardees must use base-\nline water and energy data, as well as the\
    \ SWEEP Irrigation Water Savings Assessment\nTool and California Air Resources\
    \ Board Greenhouse Gas Calculator tool, to quantify the\nprojected water and energy\
    \ savings. The SWEEP program has invested USD 80 million in\nover 800 projects\
    \ for an annual water saving of 88,496 Megaliters and GHG reduction of\n80,077\
    \ MTCO2e [134]. The program’s challenges include the need for a stable, continuous\n\
    funding source and increased accessibility for small and socially disadvantaged\
    \ grow-\ners [133]. Speciﬁcally, although a third of projects have been located\
    \ in disadvantaged\ncommunities, only 10% of the funds have gone to socially disadvantaged\
    \ growers and\nranchers [133,134]. Although the SWEEP program has incentivized\
    \ and improved the\nirrigation system infrastructure and design for energy optimization,\
    \ there is still a need and\nlarge opportunity for IDSS and training related to\
    \ coupled water and energy management\nin California [133].\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\
    \ 1962\n16 of 31\n6.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Energy Management\n\
    Although there has been an identiﬁable need for co-management of irrigation and\n\
    energy, there is currently only one decision support tool deployed for this purpose\
    \ in\nCalifornia. The California Energy Commission funded the research and development\
    \ of\nAgMonitor [135]. AgMonitor integrates irrigation schedules based on the\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\napproach and monthly aerial imagery with ﬂow metering and all\
    \ on-farm energy sources\nand sinks. This IDSS provides information on irrigation\
    \ magnitude and timing events\nthat will also optimize energy conservation across\
    \ a farm and has been validated in key\nCalifornian crops, such as processing\
    \ tomato, almond, pistachio and alfalfa. Although\ncommercially available IDSS\
    \ are limited in this area, there are currently research-level\nIDSS in development\
    \ to optimize irrigation applications with photovoltaic power produc-\ntion [136,137].\n\
    7. IDSS for Nitrogen (N) Management in California\n7.1. General Considerations\n\
    California’s intensive irrigated agricultural production has led to the use of\
    \ large\namounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In contrast, N over-application\
    \ has been associated with\nwater pollution and various human health concerns\
    \ [138]. More than 50 years of tradeoffs\nbetween the use of N fertilizer and\
    \ the health of the environment have been documented in\nCalifornia [139,140].\
    \ Over the past years, the volume of inorganic N fertilizer used in the\nstate\
    \ has expanded dramatically. The annual sales between 1980 and 2001 have exceeded\n\
    600,000 tons of N [141].\nA signiﬁcant increase in the N fertilizer application\
    \ rate was observed in the Sacra-\nmento Valley, San Joaquin Basin and Tulare\
    \ Basin of the Central Valley for the period\n2002–2012 compared to 1991–2001\
    \ [142,143]. Nitrogen loading in the Sacramento Valley,\nSan Joaquin Basin and\
    \ Tulare Basin saw a signiﬁcant increase in 2002–2012 compared to\n1991–2001 [138].\
    \ More than 740,000 tons of N fertilizer was loaded on roughly 2.7 million\nhectares\
    \ of irrigated farmland in California. The excess N fertilizer leaches to groundwater\n\
    and affects the quality of drinking water [144]. Improper management of N fertiliza-\n\
    tion in California has contributed to the unsustainability of agricultural production\
    \ and\nhas threatened the health of Central Valley communities whose drinking\
    \ water relies on\ngroundwater resources.\n7.2. Science\nCrop N needs have been\
    \ investigated to provide growers with tools to determine\nproper fertilizer applications.\
    \ Numerous quantitative and complex decision-making tools\nhave been consistently\
    \ used to achieve improved nutrient management and irrigation.\nOnline spreadsheet\
    \ models and IDSS that process large amounts of information have been\nimplemented\
    \ by the University of California to help growers determine the appropriate\n\
    amounts of N fertilizers to apply (Table 3) [82]. Early season leaf sampling in\
    \ tree crops was\ndeveloped to estimate N status in tree tissues and make adjustments\
    \ in fertilizer timing\nand amount. Brown et al. [145] developed online spreadsheet\
    \ models for managing N\nin almonds and developed the four Rs of N management\
    \ (right rate, right time, right\nplace, right source). The right rate consists\
    \ of applying N in appropriate proportion to tree\ndemand. The right time is the\
    \ N application with the accurate timing with tree uptake,\nwhich starts at 70%\
    \ leaf out and stops soon after harvest. The right place encompasses\nvariable\
    \ rate irrigation and N application to address in-orchard soil and yield variability\n\
    as well as N application to the tree’s active root zone or foliage. The right\
    \ source refers\nto using the type of fertilizer that optimizes other nutrients\
    \ and suits the crop and the\nenvironment [146]. The Soil Nitrate Quick Test (SNQT),\
    \ developed for vegetables, provides\nan estimate of the soil mineral N status\
    \ capable of offsetting a fraction of the total N\nrequired by a crop. Hartz et\
    \ al. [147] developed N requirements for processing tomatoes in\nthe Central Valley.\
    \ Nitrogen application guidelines were later modelized to help growers\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n17 of 31\noptimize N application in processing tomato production\
    \ [148] and across several key\nCalifornia crops [149].\nTable 3. Principal decision\

    \ issues, the State Water Board has evaluated the\nexisting policies to determine\
    \ if existing water regulations are sufﬁcient and have improved\nthe wastewater\
    \ regulations to protect groundwater quality (www.cvsalinity.org (accessed\non\
    \ 20 August 2021)). The dischargers, such as growers, food processors, municipalities\n\
    and ranchers, have to comply with new regulations (e.g., Salt and Nitrate Management\n\
    Plan). Californian growers are under rising regulatory pressure to improve N use\
    \ efﬁciency\nin agricultural production to decrease nitrate leaching. Therefore,\
    \ they need the tools to\naccurately estimate crop N needs and availability to\
    \ conﬁdently adjust the N application\nrates. The federal and state agencies responsible\
    \ for protecting air and water quality have\nbeen assessing the causes, consequences\
    \ and costs of California’s agriculture-wide N use.\nThis concern explains the\
    \ various regulatory initiatives, such as the Central Valley Regional\nWater Quality\
    \ Control Board’s Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program, the Central Coast\nRegional\
    \ Water Quality Control Board’s renewal process for the Irrigated Agricultural\n\
    Lands Waiver, the Climate Action Reserve’s N Fertilizer Reduction Protocol and\
    \ the Central\nValley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s General Order for\
    \ Dairy Waste Dischargers\nand the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-term\
    \ Sustainability (CV-SALTS)\nprogram [150].\nCV-SALTS is a collaborative program\
    \ tasked to develop environmentally and eco-\nnomically sustainable management\
    \ plans for nitrates and salts in the Central Valley. The\nExecutive Committee\
    \ encompasses diverse stakeholder groups, such as agricultural groups,\ncities,\
    \ industry, regulatory agencies and community and environmental justice representa-\n\
    tives. The Salt and Nitrate Management Plan (SNMP) developed by CV-SALTS is built\
    \ on a\nrange of existing water quality management policies. It proposes additional\
    \ policies, mech-\nanisms and tools to provide the Central Valley Water Board\
    \ with the appropriate means for\naddressing the long-term loading of salt and\
    \ nitrates in the different regions of the Central\nValley. CV-SALTS is also tasked\
    \ with developing an all-inclusive regulatory program with\nadequate strategies\
    \ to address the management of salts and nitrates sustainably [151].\n7.4. Decision\
    \ Support for Irrigation and N Management\nNumerous IDSS for irrigation + N have\
    \ been developed by extension services, uni-\nversities and other institutions\
    \ involved in water management for states or regions [152].\nSome IDDS that help\
    \ manage N in CA include CropManage, Food, Agriculture, Resource\nManagement System\
    \ (FARMs) and the N Budget Calculator.\nCropManage can help growers and farm managers\
    \ determine watering and fertilizer\nN schedules on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis. All\
    \ the required components to determine crop water\nneeds, such as ETo and weather\
    \ data (from CIMIS), estimated Kc, as well as adequate\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on soil properties, are available without the need for in-ﬁeld\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 1962\n18 of 31\nsensors. CropManage is publicly available at: https://cropmanage.ucanr.edu/\
    \ (accessed\non 21 August 2021). The software automates all steps required to\
    \ calculate crop water\nrequirements, including N recommendations, based on soil\
    \ crop N uptake models, nitrate\nquick test values and credits for nitrate in\
    \ irrigation water and preceding crop residues.\nCropManage also helps growers\
    \ track irrigation and fertilizer schedules on multiple ﬁelds\nand allows data\
    \ sharing among users from the same farming operations. The web-based\napplication\
    \ record-keeping capability allows growers to review water and N applications\n\
    on each ﬁeld and maintain data required to comply with water quality regulations.\
    \ Crop-\nManage can be integrated with other web applications and data sources\
    \ to improve the\naccuracy of irrigation and fertilizer models [82].\nFARMs is\
    \ a user-friendly geospatial web-based application that simpliﬁes the use of\n\
    the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) model by automating\
    \ pro-\ncesses such as weather, climate and soil input. FARMs was developed using\
    \ DSSAT-CSM\nand open-source GIS software. FARMs allows adaptive management to\
    \ perform in-season\nyield predictions using both weather and climatic data to\
    \ evaluate the potential impacts of\nmanagement decisions on end-of-season yield.\
    \ FARMs uses NASA POWER weather data\nintegrated through an API [153]. FARMs simulates\
    \ nitrogen cycling of the cropping systems\nand quantiﬁes crop N stress based\
    \ on nitrogen uptake versus available nitrogen and is\nexpressed as a range between\
    \ 0 (no stress) to 1 (maximum stress). FARMs also simulates\nthe probability of\
    \ nitrate leaching from a given irrigation and N management strategy.\nThe N Calculator\
    \ is a predictive model that helps growers by advising on the timing\nand the\
    \ appropriate amount of N fertilizer to meet yield-based demand [145]. The N\n\
    Calculator has many functions, including calculating fertilization rates based\
    \ on the newest\nUC N management research, applying the four Rs of nutrient management\
    \ (right source,\nright rate, right timing and right location), enabling efﬁcient\
    \ fertilizer use, calculating N\nsupplies from non-fertilizer sources, such as\
    \ cover crops groundwater and compost, and\ncloning the N budget from one orchard\
    \ to another within and between years.\nFor example, using this tool for almonds\
    \ requires entering a yield estimate for pre-\nand post-bloom and adding early\
    \ season tissue-sampling results. The N Calculator helps\nto meet much of the\
    \ nutrients management required from the Irrigated Lands Regulatory\nProgram.\
    \ The Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program requires keeping an Irrigation and N\n\
    Management Plan (INMP) worksheet onsite and submitting a summary report to one’s\n\
    coalition in post-harvest time.\n8. IDSS for Salinity Management in California\n\
    8.1. General Considerations\nAbout 40% of global irrigated land is located in\
    \ arid/semi-arid zones, and this irriga-\ntion is often associated with salinization\
    \ [154]. With the development of intensive irrigation\npractices, the Central\
    \ Valley of California has become one of the world’s most productive\nfarming\
    \ regions. The continuously increasing levels of crop production are threatened\
    \ due\nto the deteriorating irrigation water quality. Clay layers impeding percolation\
    \ to deeper\ngroundwater regions have led to salt accumulation in drainage water\
    \ in many Central\nValley regions. One of the primary sources of salts is the\
    \ water supply imported from the\nSacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. About 250\
    \ tons of salt a day are imported into the\nSan Joaquin Valley through the state\
    \ and federal water project canals [155]. The soils of the\nCentral Valley’s western\
    \ regions are sedimentary and alluvial from the origin and formed\nin an uplifted\
    \ seabed. The native salts have mineralized and leached to the shallow water\n\
    tables over time due to irrigation and ﬂooding [156]. In the predominantly clay\
    \ and silty\nclay soil textures, as plants extract water from the soil and transpire,\
    \ the salt concentration\nlevel of the drainage water is likely to increase. As\
    \ a result, salts are likely to concentrate in\nthe root zone and accumulate in\
    \ shallow water tables through leaching [157]. Excessive salt\nconcentrations\
    \ affect a plant’s osmotic balance and trigger a reduction in plant water uptake\n\
    and stomata closing, which causes transpiration inhibition to occur [158]. The\
    \ increasing\nsoil salinity slowly and steadily contaminates water supplies and\
    \ reduces crop production.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n19 of 31\nVarious factors,\
    \ such as drought, climate change, water shortages and land-use changes,\ncould\
    \ exacerbate the salinity conditions.\nMore than 1.8 million hectares of irrigated\
    \ cropland in Central Valley (primarily in\nthe San Joaquin Valley) are affected\
    \ either through saline irrigation water or saline soils,\nand tens of thousands\
    \ of hectares of productive agricultural land are at risk (Figure 1) [159].\n\
    Salt accumulation has triggered more than 99957 hectares to be taken out of agricultural\n\
    production, and another 0.6 million hectares are considered damaged by salinity\
    \ [155].\nCurrent management activities address only 15% of the annual salt load\
    \ [150]. The direct\nannual costs from increasing salinity will range from USD\
    \ 1 billion to USD 1.5 billion, and\ntotal annual income impacts to the State\
    \ of California are predicted to range between USD\n1.7 billion and USD 3 billion\
    \ by 2030 [160]. The income reduction in the Central Valley\nwill range between\
    \ USD 1.2 billion and USD 2.2 billion [160]. In 2014, salinity reduced\nCalifornia’s\
    \ agricultural revenues by USD 3.7 billion, amounting to 8.0 million tons of crop\n\
    production lost [161].\n8.2. Science\nThe U.S. Salinity Laboratory (1954) classiﬁed\
    \ ﬁve cases of agricultural soil salinity: non-\nsaline (0–2 dS m−1), slightly\
    \ saline (2–4 dS m−1), moderately saline (4–8 dS m−1), strongly\nsaline (8–16\
    \ dS m−1) and extremely saline (>16 dS m−1) [162]. Although this salinity system\n\
    is the most commonly used, many other classiﬁcation systems of salt-affected soils\
    \ exist\nand are available in the literature [163]. The presence of salt in soil\
    \ water may affect plant\ngrowth either through salt-speciﬁc or osmotic effects.\
    \ The salt-speciﬁc or ion-excess effect\nof salinity occurs when excessive salt\
    \ amounts enter the crop, accumulate and damage the\ntranspiring leaves’ cells\
    \ and trigger plant growth reductions. The osmotic or water deﬁcit\neffect of\
    \ salinity occurs when salt in the soil solution decreases the plant’s water uptake\n\
    ability and leads to a decrease in the crop growth rate [164]. Salinity stress\
    \ affects all the\nmajor plant processes, such as germination, growth, water uptake\
    \ and yield [165].\nSalinity can be classiﬁed as natural or primary salinity and\
    \ second-hand salinity or\nhuman-induced salinity. Primary salinity comes from\
    \ salts accumulation over long periods\nof time via natural soil or groundwater\
    \ processes. Two natural processes contribute to\nprimary salinity. The ﬁrst is\
    \ the weathering process that breaks down rocks and releases\nvarious types of\
    \ soluble salts, including chlorides (of sodium, calcium and magnesium),\nsulfates\
    \ and carbonates. The passive results from oceanic salt that the wind carries\
    \ inland\nare deposited in the soil by rainfall. Passive salinity occurs due to\
    \ human activities, leading\nto the modiﬁcation of the soil’s hydrologic balance\
    \ [165].\n8.3. Policy\nThe increase in salts concentration in the California Central\
    \ Valley due to many factors,\nincluding intensive irrigation, has led to crises\
    \ and political decisions toward remediation.\nHigh concentrations of selenium\
    \ were found in ﬁsh in Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge,\nand vast numbers of\
    \ deformed and dead waterfowl were discovered at the refuge [166].\nIn 2006, the\
    \ Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s Salt and Boron Total\n\
    Maximum Daily Load for the San Joaquin River was approved, and a salinity control\
    \ plan\nentitled ‘Actions to Address the Salinity and Boron Total Maximum Daily\
    \ Load Issues\nfor the Lower San Joaquin River’ was adopted in response to the\
    \ Salinity and Boron\nTotal Maximum Daily Loads [156]. Solutions for addressing\
    \ salinity in the Central Valley\nwater require considering innovative salt management\
    \ strategies for both the short term\nand the long term to reach salt balance\
    \ and restoration of the impacted areas. In 2015,\nthe State Water Resources Control\
    \ Board adopted Resolution No. 2015–0010 to approve\nBasin Plan amendments and\
    \ to include the Salinity Variance Program, which applies to\nsurface water under\
    \ the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Salinity Variance Program follows\nwater quality\
    \ standards that include the following constituents: electrical conductivity,\n\
    total dissolved solids, chloride, sulfate and sodium [155]. Recognizing the challenges\
    \ of\nmanaging salinity in surface and ground waters, the Salt and Nitrate Management\
    \ Plan\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n20 of 31\n(SNMP) was implemented as part of the\
    \ Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term\nSustainability (CV-SALTS).\n\
    The long-term salinity management strategies recommended by the SNMP are divided\n\
    into three different phases, as described below.\n(i)\nPhase I focuses on developing\
    \ a prioritization and optimization study for salinity\nmanagement by using an\
    \ interim salinity approach.\n(ii)\nPhase II is related to environmental permits,\
    \ obtaining funding, engineering\nand design.\n(iii)\nPhase III consists of the\
    \ implementation of physical projects to manage salt in the\nlong term.\nThe interim\
    \ salinity permitting approach is recommended by the SNMP to be set\nin place\
    \ for 15 years. The interim salinity approach requires dischargers to participate\n\
    in the prioritization and optimization study. However, the dischargers opting\
    \ out of\nparticipating in the prioritization and optimization study would not\
    \ be eligible for obtaining\na variance under the Salinity Variance Program (https://www.cvsalinity.org\
    \ (accessed on\n29 August 2021)).\n8.4. Decision Support for Irrigation and Salinity\n\
    Although there are not currently any California IDSS that also factor salinity\
    \ manage-\nment, there are several decision tools available to manage salinity\
    \ in California. One of\nthe water quality regulation tools used throughout the\
    \ U.S. is the EPA-supported Total\nMaximum Daily Load (TMDL). The TMDL is a controlling\
    \ tool for allocating responsibility\nfor contamination in impaired waterbodies\
    \ by assessing the assimilative capacity of the\nwaterbody for the contaminant,\
    \ determining the mass loading from non-point and point\nsources, which contribute\
    \ to the pollution, and developing downstream water quality\nstrategies reducing\
    \ the excess of the pollutants in the waterbody. The implementation of\nthe TMDL\
    \ tool in the Central Valley of California has led to the development of decision\n\
    support system tools, such as the Watershed Management Risk Management Framework\n\
    (WARMF) and the San Joaquin River Real-Time Management (SJRRTM).\nThe Watershed\
    \ Management Risk Management Framework (WARMF) model is a de-\ncision support\
    \ system designed to guide stakeholders towards a comprehensive watershed\nmanagement\
    \ plan. The tool helps speciﬁcally to facilitate TMDL implementation at the\n\
    watershed level. The embedded model uses a mass balance approach for an extensive\
    \ suite\nof potential San Joaquin River pollutants, such as total dissolved solids\
    \ (measured as EC),\nsuspended solids, phosphates and nitrates. Models are also\
    \ used to simulate agricultural\nand wetland drainage return ﬂows and estimate\
    \ the salts buildups from shallow ground-\nwater. Components such as simulation\
    \ models, graphical software and GIS software are\nincorporated into a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) to easily visualize the model ﬂow and\nsalinity information.\
    \ The WARMF model contains hydrologic routing that is capable of\ncalculating\
    \ ﬂow and water quality at roughly one-mile intervals [156,167].\nThe SJRRTM is\
    \ a web-based salinity DSS that combines WARMF and assimilative salt\ncapacity\
    \ forecasts information to increase stakeholder awareness of the unique opportuni-\n\
    ties and measures to improve water quality resource management in the San Joaquin\
    \ River\nBasin. The decision support system was implemented using OpenNRM, an\
    \ open-source\nsoftware that systematically allows users to perform tasks such\
    \ as creating, modifying and\nmanaging data and web content. One of the speciﬁc\
    \ features of the SJRTM web portal has\nbeen the integration of WARMF model-generated\
    \ ﬂow with real-time SJR tributary ﬂow\nand EC data with salt load assimilative\
    \ capacity predictions [156].\nIn addition to decision support systems, various\
    \ models are widely used for salinity\nmanagement studies in the Central Valley.\
    \ Models such as Westside Agricultural Drainage\nEconomics (WADE) [168] and the\
    \ Agricultural Production Salinity Irrigation Drainage\nEconomics (APSIDE) [169]\
    \ are examples of policy models used in the Central Valley. The\nAPSIDE model\
    \ has the speciﬁcity of simulating the agricultural production and projected\n\
    income in response to irrigation water quality and drainage policy constraints\
    \ [169].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n21 of 31\n9. IDSS for Irrigation System Management\n\
    Under increasing water deﬁcit or drought conditions, distribution uniformity plays\
    \ a\ncritical factor in managing the available water efﬁciently while simultaneously\
    \ improving\nand maintaining the yield and quality of specialty crops [170,171].\
    \ Distribution uniformity\ncan be deﬁned as the even distribution or spread of\
    \ applied irrigation to avoid over- or\nunder-watering at speciﬁc locations across\
    \ the ﬁeld. Non-uniform distribution can not only\nreduce the yield, but it affects\
    \ the drainage, increases soil erosion risk through runoff, in-\ncreases nitrate\
    \ leaching and reduces the available nitrate content in the soil [172,173]. Under\n\
    California’s arid conditions, a reduced use of water and energy in the agricultural\
    \ sector is\nlargely dependent on efﬁcient DU. Although it is impossible to attain\
    \ 100% distribution\nuniformity, the goal is to maximize the uniform and efﬁcient\
    \ distribution of the applied\nirrigation water.\nApplication use efﬁciency is\
    \ the ratio of the amount of water lost through evapotran-\nspiration to the amount\
    \ of water applied for crop production [174]. The joint initiative of\nthe California\
    \ Department of Food and Agriculture and Department of Water Resources\nhas a\
    \ goal of decreasing 1200–1220 ML of agricultural water use per year through on-farm\n\
    efﬁciency improvements. The majority of California’s crops are now cultivated\
    \ using micro-\nirrigation systems, such as sprinkler, drip and subsurface drip\
    \ irrigation. The distribution\nuniformity for drip and subsurface drip irrigation\
    \ systems is determined by taking the\nratio of average ﬂow of the lowest quarter\
    \ of emitters to all emitters sampled [130,175].\nDecision support tools offer\
    \ the potential for site-speciﬁc irrigation management,\nwhich optimizes distribution\
    \ uniformity by delineating the ﬁelds into management\nzones [176,177]. The UCANR’s\
    \ Bilingual Emission Uniformity Calculator uses a bilin-\ngual (English and Spanish)\
    \ interface with an Excel spreadsheet model to help growers\ncalculate distribution\
    \ uniformity based on emitter discharge measurements [178]. Using\nwireless sensor\
    \ networks (soil and crop canopy-based), irrigation automation and telemet-\n\
    ric control through mobile or cloud-based applications allows the growers to efﬁciently\n\
    increase the distribution uniformity based on real-time data. Growers can use\
    \ automation\nequipment to avoid over- or under-watering with remote access [179,180].\
    \ In California,\nmany nut growers in the state are using an alternative method\
    \ of determining transpira-\ntion uniformity rather than using distribution uniformity\
    \ [181]. Transpiration uniformity\ndescribes the uniform loss of water from the\
    \ ﬁeld, in contrast to DU, which deﬁnes the\nspread across the ﬁeld. Because transpiration\
    \ is an indicator of plant metabolism, it can\nalso be affected by nutrients,\
    \ pests or soil heterogeneity, which would not be related to the\nuniformity of\
    \ an application. Remote-sensing IDSS are useful in evaluating the distribution\n\
    uniformity based on thermal and NDVI maps generated using multispectral imagery.\
    \ In\nCalifornia, Ceres Imaging is widely used by orchard and vegetable growers\
    \ to identify the\nwater stress due to uneven distribution uniformity based on\
    \ colorized NDVI and thermal\nmaps, as shown in Figure 3. The identiﬁcation of\

    and growers (Figure 4). In the cyclical process of innovation–validation–adoption,\
    \ it is\nhelpful to form a project advisory group to achieve a more practical,\
    \ secure and cohesive\napproach [179]. This user feedback is pivotal for implementing\
    \ and improving new IDSS\ntechnologies [184]. The primary focus of the advisory\
    \ group members is to assist in shaping\nthe process of research that can simplify\
    \ the later steps for adoption [185,186].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n23 of 31\n\

    Ideally, IDSS should be assessed for data accuracy, linearity, precision, response\

    \ and predict the Kc values. Different\ncomplexity may be required for different\

    \ systems (IDSS) may greatly beneﬁt the >400 crops grown\nthroughout the State\
    \ of California to support diverse challenges, including drought, en-\nergy, nitrogen\
    \ and salinity management. Here, we conducted a comprehensive review of\nexisting\
    \ IDSS available to California growers, their underlying science, incentive policies\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1962\n24 of 31\nand anticipated outcomes. Effective energy,\
    \ water, nitrogen and salinity management in\nCalifornia under regulatory policies,\
    \ such as the Sustainable Groundwater Management\nAct, require the integration\
    \ of different strategies to improve precision irrigation schedul-\ning, uniform\
    \ water and nutrient application, and the soil–plant–water monitoring. In\naddition\
    \ to water management, these policies also aim to manage groundwater and require\n\
    the record keeping of water use, nitrogen (N) leaching, salinity management and\
    \ energy\nconsumption. Most of the irrigation decision support tools used in California\
    \ are based on\nfewer components of the water budget, and none of the available\
    \ IDSS provide estimation\nof all parameters together. For example, soil-based\
    \ IDSS consider soil water potential or\nvolumetric water content, while crop\
    \ canopy IDSS are based on crop evapotranspiration.\nThese IDSS can potentially\
    \ be used in combination to obtain the overall inﬂow and outﬂow\nof water to and\
    \ from the soil–plant–atmospheric continuum of the crops. However, het-\nerogeneity\
    \ in agronomic and ﬁeld soils can lead to poor management practices at certain\n\
    locations in agricultural ﬁelds. Remote sensing IDSS are useful in determining\
    \ the spatial\nscale information based on spectral data, but the interpretation\
    \ of multispectral/thermal\nimagery is complicated and difﬁcult for growers to\
    \ base decisions for water, nutrient and\nsalinity hotspots. In a nutshell, there\
    \ has been an identiﬁable need for the co-management\nof irrigation decision support,\
    \ nitrogen and salinity management and energy efﬁciency.\nThe integration of IDSS\
    \ for nexus beneﬁts is a cyclical process of innovation by service\nproviders/researchers,\
    \ validation by extension research professionals and adoption by\ngrowers. Therefore,\
    \ for a widescale adoption of these tools, the synergetic evaluation of\npoint-based\
    \ and spatial IDSS needs to be studied and validated on different scales (farm\n\
    to county). Not only is the information presentation and availability important;\
    \ the inte-\ngration within the farm management hierarchy is equally signiﬁcant.\
    \ The recommended\ninformation on water, nitrogen, salts and energy management\
    \ must be clearly and simply\ntransmitted to and from farm managers to individual\
    \ irrigators.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.J., R.S. and M.A.N.;\

    Abstract: This study aims to assess the accuracy of the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET0) estimated\nby CLDAS, ERA5 reanalysis products, and the quality of reanalysis\
    \ weather variables required to\ncalculate PM-ET0. For this purpose, the applicability\
    \ of surface meteorological elements from the\nERA5 reanalysis datasets provided\
    \ by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n(ECMWF), and the\
    \ second-generation China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation\n\
    System (CLDASV2.0) datasets are evaluated in China by comparison with local observations\
    \ from\n689 stations reported by the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA).\
    \ Statistics including\npercent bias (PBias), coefﬁcient of determination (R2),\
    \ root mean square error (RMSE) and mean\nabsolute error (MAE) are used to check\
    \ the accuracy. The results show the highest correlation between\nreanalysis temperature\
    \ and observations, with a mean R2 of 0.96, 0.90 for the CLDAS maximum and\nminimum\
    \ air temperatures, and 0.87, 0.84 for ERA5. For the reanalysis of solar radiation\
    \ (Rs) and\nrelative humidity (RH), an overestimation trend is shown for Rs and\
    \ an underestimation trend is\nshown for RH. For reanalysis of wind speed, a relatively\
    \ low accuracy is shown. The accuracy of\nET0 estimated by the two reanalysis\
    \ products is acceptable in China, but the spatial and temporal\nconsistency between\
    \ the CLDAS estimates and site observations is higher, with a mean RMSE R2 of\n\
    0.91, 0.82 for CLDAS and 1.42, 0.70 for ERA5, respectively. Moreover, CLDAS reanalysis\
    \ products are\nmore effective in describing the boundary details of the study\
    \ area.\nKeywords: CLDAS reanalysis products; ERA5 reanalysis products; accuracy\

    Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important meteorological element in the hydrological\n\
    cycle, which is directly related to the energy and water balance of the Earth’s\
    \ surface,\ndetermining the formation and evolution of the geographical environment\
    \ [1], and also an\nimportant basis and a key link in the evaluation of agricultural\
    \ water use efﬁciency [2,3]. As\nthe global competition for water resources intensiﬁes\
    \ and water resources become depleted,\ncoping with water scarcity requires a\
    \ more accurate knowledge of ET [4].\nIrrigation management in agricultural practices\
    \ requires the accurate estimation of\ncrop water consumption, which in turn requires\
    \ an accurate estimation of crop evapo-\ntranspiration (ETc), and its forecasting\
    \ is signiﬁcant in developing crop irrigation systems\nand real-time irrigation\
    \ scheduling [5,6]. A commonly used ETc estimation method at\nthe ﬁeld scale consists\
    \ of using the Kc-ET0 approach, as proposed in FAO56 [7], where\na crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kc) for the considered vegetation is multiplied by the crop reference\nWater\
    \ 2023, 15, 2027. https://doi.org/10.3390/w15112027\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/water\n\
    Water 2023, 15, 2027\n2 of 21\nevapotranspiration (ET0) to estimate the ETc, although\
    \ the calculation of Kc is based on\nexperience, and applications worldwide are\
    \ successful [8–10].\nAt present, ET0 can also be estimated from pan evaporation,\
    \ but such methods are\nexpensive, technically complex, and not practical. Therefore,\
    \ the Penman–Monteith model\nis usually used for the estimation ET0 [11–14]. However,\
    \ the model requires the input of\nseveral climate variables, including the maximum\
    \ and minimum air temperature (Tmax\nand Tmin), relative humidity (RH), solar\
    \ radiation (Rs), and wind speed at 2 m height\n(U2). These variables are not\
    \ observed, or the price of obtaining these meteorological data\nfrom the relevant\
    \ meteorological services is prohibitive in many regions and locations in\nChina.\
    \ In addition, the common method of obtaining these meteorological data is station\n\
    monitoring, which is time-consuming and makes it difﬁcult to obtain long time\
    \ series and\nhigh-quality meteorological variables.\nSince the 1960s, the application\
    \ of meteorological satellite data made up for the\nshortage of station observations,\
    \ and the spatial and temporal continuity of meteorological\ndata made great progress.\
    \ After the 1990s, satellite data entered the data assimilation\nsystem, which\
    \ further improved the accuracy of meteorological data [15,16]. Reanalysis\ninformation\
    \ assimilates data obtained from remote sensing, ground-based observations and\n\
    numerical simulations [17,18], which has the characteristics of high spatial and\
    \ temporal\nresolutions and is an ideal driving data source for distributed models.\
    \ The main advantage\nof reanalysis products is the free access to continuous\
    \ meteorological data and its great\nadvantage and potential to become an alternative\
    \ to observed data.\nSeveral global reanalysis datasets are available for ET0\
    \ estimation, such as WorldClim,\nwhich provides the global historical and future\
    \ climate data and elevation data [19]; The\nWorld Meteorological Organization’s\
    \ Climate Explorer weather data retrieval platform,\nwith a wealth of global or\
    \ regional climate data [20]; the European Centre for Medium-\nrange Weather Forecasts\
    \ (ECMWF), which provides ERA5 reanalysis products [21]; the\nNational Centers\
    \ for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research\n(NCEP/NCAR),\
    \ known as NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I [22]; the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\
    \ (NASA) Global Simulation; and the Assimilation Ofﬁce for a Second\nReview of\
    \ Modern Research and Applications (MERRA-2) [23,24], etc.\nThe main advantages\
    \ of the reanalysis product are the high spatial and temporal\nresolutions, the\
    \ ability to scale the product appropriately, and the stable improved model\n\
    resolution and bias [25]. Currently, many authors have used reanalysis products\
    \ to rep-\nresent the spatiotemporal variability of surface climate variables.\
    \ ERA5_land reanalysis\ndata were applied to the observations of Peruvian glaciers\
    \ veriﬁed by Martin et al., and\nwere found to be appropriate for characterizing\
    \ 2 m air temperature and relative humidity,\nparticularly in the wet outer tropics\
    \ [26]. Song et al. (2020) [27] compared the applicability\nof various soil moisture\
    \ data in Inner Mongolia, and found that the ERA5 simulation\ncapability is optimal.\
    \ Srivastava et al. (2016) [28] compared the ET0 estimation from ERA-\ninterim\
    \ and NCEP for all the seasons, and revealed a similar performance to the seasonal\n\
    assessment, with a higher agreement for the ERA-interim. The only drawback of\
    \ using a\ndownscaling ERA-interim reanalysis dataset with the WRF is that it\
    \ is time-consuming.\nMartins et al. (2016) [29] used the ERA-interim and NOAA\
    \ NCEP reanalysis datasets for\nthe calculation of PM-ET0 in the Iberian Peninsula\
    \ and compared it with the ET0 Observed\nat 130 meteorological stations in the\
    \ Iberian Peninsula. The results supported the quality\nof the ERA-interim reanalysis\
    \ data to calculate the ET0 computations. The ECMWF ERA5\nreanalysis products\
    \ were selected for this study because they had previously performed\nwell and\
    \ showed great a potential for estimating ET0. However, due to the bias reported\n\
    for ERA products, the use of these data requires assessing the impact of bias\
    \ on the perfor-\nmance of the estimations of reanalysis-based ET0 when compared\
    \ with ET0 computed with\nobservational data [30,31].\nCLDAS-V2.0 is the latest\
    \ version of the land surface assimilation system developed by\nthe China National\
    \ Meteorological Information Center, providing a variety of atmospheric\ndriving\
    \ ﬁeld products (URL: https://data.cma.cn/, accessed on 1 May 2021). At the same\n\
    Water 2023, 15, 2027\n3 of 21\ntime, some scholars have evaluated the applicability\
    \ of different land surface model data.\nLiu et al. (2021) [32] compared CLDAS\
    \ air temperature data with hourly air temperature\ndata from 48,708 ground automatic\
    \ meteorological stations in China for 2017–2018, and\nfound that CLDAS air temperature\
    \ data better reﬂects the interannual variability of air\ntemperature in Chinese\
    \ regions, with an average correlation coefﬁcient of more than 0.991.\nShi et\
    \ al. (2018) [33] analyzed the temporal variation characteristics of average soil\
    \ moisture\nin China by comparing CLDAS soil moisture with hourly observations\
    \ of automatic soil\nmoisture observation stations, concluding that the simulated\
    \ values were very close to the\nobserved values, and the time-series variation\
    \ of soil moisture was captured in each study\narea. Using GLDAS and CLDAS forcing\
    \ data, Yang et al. (2017) [34] evaluated precipitation\nand shortwave radiation\
    \ from the ITPCAS, GLDAS, CLDAS and the gridded analysis\nbased on CMA gauge observations\
    \ (CN05.1) over mainland China during 2008–2014, and\nshowed that CLDAS provides\
    \ more realistic precipitation and radiation approximations\nthan the other datasets.\
    \ The CLDAS forcing dataset contains more in situ and remote\nsensing observations\
    \ of China, so it is more accurate over mainland China. Liu et al.\n(2019) [35]\
    \ compared and evaluated the simulation results of monthly soil moisture and\n\
    monthly evapotranspiration, and reported that CLDAS_Noah-MP signiﬁcantly improved\n\
    the simulation results for mainland China and eight river basins; the R-value\
    \ increased from\n0.451 to 0.534 and the RMSE reduced from 0.078 to 0.068, which\
    \ conﬁrmed the superiority\nof CLDAS, as previously reported by Cui et al. (2018)\
    \ [36] and Shi et al. (2018) [37].\nThe most recent studies have focused on assessing\
    \ one or several meteorological\nvariables for the reanalysis of atmospheric ﬁeld-driven\
    \ products, but relatively few have\nconducted comprehensive assessments of the\
    \ meteorological variables required to calculate\nET0 and reanalysis for ET0 estimation,\
    \ especially for small temporal scales. In addition, the\nnumerical–physical approach,\
    \ horizontal and vertical resolution, and temporal variability\nof the reanalysis\
    \ model will bring uncertainties in the reanalysis simulation process [38,39].\n\
    The resolution and accuracy of these reanalysis products appear to vary with the\
    \ location\nand timescale of the study [40]. Although research indicates that\
    \ the spatial resolution and\nreliability of the new generation of reanalysis\
    \ data products have improved, there is still a\nneed to evaluate the region-speciﬁc\
    \ applicability of CLDASV2.0, ERA5 reanalysis weather\nvariables and the estimation\
    \ of ET0 in different climate zones of China, and ﬁnd the best\nmethod for researchers\
    \ and users to carry out irrigation practices.\nThe main objective of this research\
    \ is to apply the ET0 calculated from reanalysis\ndata to irrigation scheduling\
    \ and management, for which it can be used in those places\nwhere the weather\
    \ data quality is low or (and) weather variables are missing [41,42]. The\ncorrelations\
    \ and bias of the ﬁve reanalyzed meteorological variables from CLDASV2.0 and\n\
    ERA5 are compared based on the daily weather variable data obtained from 689 ground\n\
    automatic meteorological stations in China from 2017–2019. Any biases in these\
    \ products\ncan be identiﬁed by comparison so that the bias correction method\
    \ can be easily applied.\nMoreover, a comprehensive set of the statistical indicators\
    \ is used to assess how calculated\nreanalysis PM-ET0 compared with the corresponding\
    \ station observations, which also\noffers a reference for the selection and application\
    \ of CLDASV2.0 and ERA5 reanalysis\nmeteorological data across different climatic\
    \ regions of China.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Meteorological Data\nCLDAS\
    \ uses fusion and assimilation technology to fuse data from various sources,\n\
    such as ground observation, satellite observation, numerical model products and\
    \ numeri-\ncal model products, then output the land surface-driven products with\
    \ high spatial and\ntemporal resolution, including the maximum and minimum air\
    \ temperatures, 2 m speciﬁc\nhumidity, 10 m wind speed, etc. It covers the Asian\
    \ region (60◦–160◦ E, 0◦–65◦ N), with\na spatial resolution of 0.0625◦ × 0.0625◦\
    \ and a temporal resolution of 1 h. The dataset is\nformed by using the ECMWF\
    \ numerical analysis/forecasting product as the background\nﬁeld and the topographic\
    \ adjustment, multigrid variational assimilation, optimal interpola-\nWater 2023,\

    \ the ground-based automatic station\nobservations and interpolate them to the\
    \ reanalysis grid points [33,43].\nERA5 is the ﬁfth generation of ECMWF atmospheric\
    \ reanalysis of the global climate,\ncreated by the EU-funded Copernicus Climate\
    \ Change Service (C3S). It assimilates remote\nsensing information, upper atmosphere,\
    \ and near-surface conventional observation data,\nincluding different regions\
    \ and sources, on a global scale, spanning from 1979 to the present,\nachieving\
    \ real-time updates with a spatial resolution of 0.25◦ × 0.25◦ latitude-longitude\
    \ [44].\nERA5 reanalysis data provide many kinds of meteorological elements, including\
    \ 2 m air\ntemperature, 2 m dew point temperature, and 10 m wind speed, etc. The\
    \ data sources can\nbe found at http://cdds.climate.copernicus.eu/.\n2.2. FAO-56\
    \ Penman–Monteith Equation\nThe reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated\
    \ using the FAO-56 Penman–\nMonteith equation recommended by the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United\nNations (FAO) in 1998 and the PM-ET0 Equation (1).\
    \ It is not an empirical equation, but\na mechanistic combination equation derived\
    \ from the definition of the Penman–Monteith\nequation, parameterized for the\
    \ reference crops [45]. ET0 (mm day−1) is described as follows.\nET0 =\n0.408∆(Rn\
    \ − G) + γ\n900\nTa+273u2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ(1 + 0.34u2)\n(1)\nwhere ET0 is the reference\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (mm d−1), Rn is the net radiation at\nthe crop surface\
    \ (MJ m−2 day−1) and G is the soil heat ﬂux density (MJ m−2 day−1). Ta\nis the\

    \ pressure (kPa), es − ea is the\nvapor pressure deﬁcit (kPa) calculated from\
    \ the saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor\npressure, ∆ is the slope of\
    \ the vapor pressure curve (kPa ◦C−1) and γ is the psychrometric\nconstant (kPa\
    \ ◦C−1). In the daily calculation scale, G is small relative to Rn, and is therefore\n\
    neglected [46,47].\n2.3. Data Sources\nStation observation data were collected\
    \ from 689 meteorological stations of the China\nMeteorological Administration\
    \ (https://data.cma.cn/). The list of variables retrieved is\ndeﬁned by the Penman–Monteith\
    \ model FAO56 framework, including the maximum and\nminimum air temperatures at\
    \ 2 m, surface radiation, sunshine duration, relative humidity\nat 2 m and wind\
    \ speed at 10 m. The data are subjected to quality control such as climate\nthreshold\
    \ value check, temporal consistency, and spatial consistency check.\nET0 is signiﬁcantly\
    \ affected by seasonal variation and regional differences. The two\ntypes of data\
    \ from the different time series and different study regions are compared in the\n\
    study, and the detailed analysis and comparison are presented in Section 3. Tmax\

    \ and the corresponding values (Pi) for the two reanalysis datasets for\neach\
    \ meteorological variable used in ET0 computations and for the ET0 values [50].\
    \ The\nfollowing several statistical indicators were used to assess the performance\
    \ of the reanalysis\ndatasets in representing the spatial and temporal variation\
    \ of the meteorological variables.\nThe percent bias (PBias) measures the degree\
    \ of deviation between the reanalysis\nestimated data and the corresponding site\
    \ observations [51]. It is simply a normalized\ndifference between the means of\
    \ both sets of values: positive values indicate overestimation,\nand negative\
    \ values indicate underestimation.\nPBias =\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(Pi − Qi)\nn\n∑\ni=1\n\

    \ R2 for the reanalysis estimated air\ntemperatures (Tmin CLDAS, Tmax CLDAS, Tmin\
    \ ERA5, and Tmax ERA5) and the corresponding\nobserved values are summarized in\
    \ Tables 1 and 2. Reanalysis Tmin shows a trend of\noverestimation, with the average\
    \ PBias of Tmin CLDAS and Tmin ERA5 being 0.07 and 0.06,\nrespectively. On the\
    \ contrary, Tmax reveals a trend of underestimation, and the mean\nPBias of Tmax\
    \ CLDAS and Tmax ERA5 are −0.06 and −0.34, respectively. When comparing the\n\
    reanalysis Tmax, the correlation between reanalysis Tmin and site observations\
    \ is higher, the\naverage R2 of the two reanalysis Tmin being 0.96, 0.87 and the\

    \ of the Annual Mean of the Observation-Calculated ET0 and Reanalysis-Estimated\
    \ ET0\nA spatial distribution of the annual mean values of ET0 calculated from\
    \ the sta-\ntions observations (ET0 Obs), ET0 estimated by CLDAS (ET0 CLDAS),\
    \ and ET0 estimated by\nERA5(ET0 ERA5) in China, is shown in Figure 3. The frequency\
    \ distribution of the average\nannual evapotranspiration between different value\
    \ ranges is shown in the histogram of\nFigure 3. The spatial distribution of the\
    \ annual mean values of ET0 estimated from the two\nreanalysis datasets are approximately\
    \ the same; however, from the perspective of frequency\ndistribution, ET0 CLDAS\
    \ is more consistent with ET0 Obs. For the observed calculated ET0,\nonly 15.14%\
    \ of stations have an ET0 Obs < 500 mm, 23.41% of stations an ET0 Obs between\n\
    650 and 800 mm, 16.15% of stations an ET0 Obs between 950 and 1000 mm, and 3.34%\n\
    of stations an ET0 Obs > 1000 mm. For the CLDAS estimated ET0, 13.10% of the stations\n\
    showed ET0 CLDAS <500 mm, ET0 CLDAS ranged from 650 mm to 800 mm for 25.21% of\
    \ the\nstations, from 800 mm to 900 mm for 15.97% of stations, and 5.82% of stations\
    \ exhibited an\nET0 CLDAS >1000 mm. The frequency distribution of different intervals\
    \ of the annual mean\nevapotranspiration estimated by CLDAS is similar to that\
    \ of the site-observed ET0, but in\nmost cases, ET0 CLDAS is slightly overestimated.\n\
    For ERA5 estimated ET0, 11.79% of stations have an ET0 ERA5 between 500 and 650\
    \ mm,\nwhich is 3.64% higher than the frequency of ET0 Obs observations in this\
    \ range. Of the\nstations, 21.69% have ET0 ERA5 between 950 and 1000 mm, an increase\
    \ of 5.53% over the\npercentage of ET0 Obs in this interval, while the proportion\
    \ of ET0 ERA5 with an annual\naverage evapotranspiration interval in the range\
    \ of 800–950 mm is lower than that of\nET0 Obs. The frequency distribution of\
    \ ET0 ERA5 in different evapotranspiration intervals\ndiffers from that of ET0\
    \ Obs observations, and ET0 ERA5 is overall overestimated relative to\nthe ET0\
    \ Obs site-observed values.\nThe statistical indicators of ET0 from station observations\
    \ and two reanalysis estimates\nshow signiﬁcant regional variations in different\
    \ climatic regions of China (Figure 4). The\nannual mean ET0 in climate zones\
    \ 1 and 2 is mainly concentrated between 800 and 950 mm,\nwith a higher ET0 in\
    \ Xinjiang; for example, ET0 is greater than 1000 mm in Urumqi and\nother stations.\
    \ The annual mean ET0 in climate zone 3 is low, with the lower values\nappearing\
    \ in the eastern and northern parts of climate zone 3, and the lowest values of\n\
    ET0 in the whole of China also occur in this region, which may be caused by the\
    \ lower\naverage temperature. The majority of the stations in climate zone 4 have\
    \ a small trend of\nannual mean ET0 ﬂuctuations and are concentrated in the range\
    \ of 800–950 mm; however,\nET0 changes in the west of climate zone 4 and the southwest\
    \ of climate zone 5, and its\naccuracy statistical indicators also change abruptly\
    \ at this boundary location, and the\nchange in ET0 CLDAS is more signiﬁcant,\
    \ mainly because these two locations are susceptible\nto topography. The high\
    \ ﬂuctuation of ET0 in climatic zones 6 and 7, where the higher\nPBias and RMSE\
    \ values also occur (Figure 4), is due to the inﬂuence of the topography of\n\
    the Tibetan Plateau region. In addition, the short sunshine time and high relative\
    \ humidity\ncause a lower ET0 in the southwestern part of climate zone 6 and the\
    \ eastern part of climate\nzone 7. Compared with the ERA5 reanalysis data, CLDAS\
    \ can better simulate the detailed\ncharacteristics of ET0 in different climate\
    \ zones.\nTo explore the accuracy of estimating the daily ET0 from CLDAS, ERA5\
    \ reanalysis\ndata for different climatic zones is shown. The paired comparisons\
    \ between ET0 Obs and\nET0 CLDAS (1st line, 3rd line), and ET0 Obs and ET0 ERA5\
    \ are shown in scatter plots in Figure 5,\nin which all stations are from seven\
    \ different climate zones. The analysis in Figure 5\ncomplements the one in Figure\
    \ 4 in detail. The results show that except for climate zone\n7, the simulated\
    \ ET0 of the reanalysis datasets is closer to the ET0 Obs of the stations in\n\
    the arid and semi-arid areas; that is, the scatter points are concentrated on\
    \ the y = x line,\nand the lowest value of the ET0 CLDAS correlation value is\
    \ 0.91, and the lowest value of the\nET0 ERA5 correlation value is 0.85. The R2\
    \ values of the two reanalysis products are smaller\nin humid, and sub-humid areas,\
    \ ranging from 0.71 to 0.86, and 0.63 to 0.72 for ET0 CLDAS\nand ET0 ERA5. The\

    \ and ET0 ERA5 Estimates Using Reanalysis Products\nThe statistical accuracy indicators\
    \ for the reanalysis estimation of ET0 and observed\nET0 in the seven climate\
    \ zones are summarized in Table 6. The results show that the per-\nformance of\
    \ CLDAS in estimating ET0 is better than that of ERA5 reanalysis products: the\n\
    average RMSE = 0.91 mm d−1 is smaller than that for ERA5 (RMSE = 1.42 mm d−1),\
    \ while\nthe average determination coefﬁcient is larger for the CLDAS reanalysis\
    \ products (R2 = 0.82)\nthan for ERA5 (R2 = 0.70). Similar results have been shown\
    \ by Liu et al. (2019) [35], who re-\nported that the simulation results of CLDAS\
    \ in most climate zones maintained a consistent\nand reasonable performance. The\
    \ PBias distribution of ET0 estimated for two reanalysis\nproducts shows that\
    \ the number of positive bias stations is more than the number of neg-\native\

    \ of the ET0 estimation generated from the two reanalysis datasets revealed\n\
    that the reanalysis product presented a superior performance in the arid and semi-arid\n\
    regions, with a higher correlation at most sites, with R2 > 0.85. Like the Northwest\
    \ desert\nzone, the Inner Mongolia grassland zone and R2 of ET0 CLDAS are 0.91,\
    \ 0.90, and the R2 of\nET0 ERA5 are 0.87, 0.85, respectively, while the correlations\
    \ were slightly worse in humid and\nsemi-humid areas such as climate zones 5 and\
    \ 6. The R2 distributions of ET0 CLDAS range\nfrom 0.69 to 0.77 and 0.54 to 0.62\
    \ for ET0 ERA5 (Table 6).To further evaluate the accuracy of\nthe CLDAS, the ERA5\
    \ reanalysis datasets in estimating ET0, RMSE and MAE for different\nclimate zones\
    \ are compared. ET0 CLDAS and ET0 ERA5 have the largest estimation errors in\n\
    climate zone 7, with an RMSE and MAE of 1.22, 1.06 and 1.67, 1.52, respectively.\
    \ Except\nfor climate zone 7, the RMSE and MAE of ET0 CLDAS range from 0.78 to\
    \ 0.91 and 0.52 to\n0.68, respectively, the distribution of the RMSE for ET0 ERA5\
    \ ranged from 1.12 to 1.56 and\nMAE from 1.04 to 1.39. Moreover, the higher values\
    \ of the RMSE and MAE for ET0 are\nmainly concentrated in coastal humid areas\
    \ such as climate zones 4, 5 and 6 (Figure 6),\nwith an RMSE > 0.88 and MAE >\
    \ 0.65 for ET0 CLDAS, and ET0 ERA5 with an RMSE > 1.42\nand MAE > 1.28. Overall,\
    \ the RMSE and MAE are shorter and closer to the optimal target\nwhen estimating\
    \ ET0 using the CLDAS reanalysis products. The effects of topography,\nslope,\
    \ monsoon and other factors on meteorological variables in different climatic\
    \ zones are\nadopted and integrated into the CLDAS reanalysis datasets, which\
    \ makes the estimation of\nET0 CLDAS more accurate [35,52].\n3.4. Comparison of\

    \ Estimation\nIn this paper, the key meteorological factors for calculating ET0\
    \ are evaluated. It was\nfound that Tmin shows an overestimation trend and Tmax\
    \ shows an underestimation trend,\nand the consistency of the reanalysis minimum\
    \ temperature of the two datasets (average\nR2 0.96 and 0.87) is higher than that\
    \ of the maximum temperature (0.90 and 0.84), but\nthe PBias of the former is\
    \ larger. Similar conclusions were found by Wu et al. (2022) [53]\nand Qian et\
    \ al. (2022) [54] when they used reanalysis data to assess air temperature\nin\
    \ the Chinese region. In addition, Simmons et al. (2010) [55] and Paredes et al.\
    \ [56]\nalso reported a tendency for the overestimation of Tmin and underestimation\
    \ of Tmax by\nthe ERA-Interim in Continental Portugal [57]. The authors hypothesized\
    \ that CLDAS,\nERA5 reanalysis datasets are capturing warming over the land more\
    \ than over the sea,\nwhich makes Tmin CLDAS and Tmin ERA5 larger than Tmin Obs\
    \ data; Tmax CLDAS, Tmax ERA5\nshowed the opposite performance. For the reanalysis\
    \ Rs, both CLDAS and ERA5 slightly\noverestimate the site-observed Rs, the PBias\
    \ of Rs CLDAS and Rs ERA5 range from 0.02 to\n0.17 and 0.06 to 0.24, which is\
    \ similar to the reports of Bojanowski et al. (2014) [57] and\nUrraca et al. (2017)\
    \ [58]. Shefﬁeld et al. (2006) [25] also reported a similar conclusion and\ncombined\
    \ this behavior of overestimation of global radiation for NCEP1 with the fact\
    \ that\nthe reanalysis dataset does not consider the blocking of shortwave radiation\
    \ by the clouds.\nAs for reanalysis of the relative humidity, the PBias of RHCLDAS\
    \ is negative (ranging from\n−0.07 to −0.30) in the 1–6 climate zones, with a\
    \ slight underestimation. The PBias of\nclimate zone 7 is positive, and the value\
    \ is 0.35. This is consistent with the conclusion of\nSimmons et al. (2010) [55]\
    \ that the relative humidity of ERA5 reanalysis is underestimated\nin the mid–low\
    \ latitudes. Fu et al. (2015) [59] also concluded that the RH of NCEP1\nreanalysis\
    \ was slightly underestimated in Australia. Differently, Martins et al. (2016)\
    \ [29]\nreported no tendency for over- or underestimation of the RH when using\
    \ the reanalysis\nmonthly products for Iberia, which can be attributed to the\
    \ different time scales of the study.\nDifferent from the previous four meteorological\
    \ factors, the analysis of the wind speed\nshowed a lower accuracy across the\
    \ seven climatic regions. The average R2 of U2 CLDAS was\n0.25, and the average\
    \ R2 of U2 ERA5 0.18. Many scholars have reanalyzed the wind speed\nand obtained\
    \ similar results, the low accuracy of the wind speed derived from reanalysis\n\
    was reported by Carvalho et al. (2014) [60] studies applied to Continental Portugal.\
    \ The\nsame results were reported by Martins et al. (2016) [29] in the Iberian\
    \ Peninsula for the\nproblem of low accuracy in analyzing the wind speed. The\
    \ two wind speed estimation\nalternatives proposed by Allen et al. (1998) [7]\
    \ are to replace the daily wind speed with\nthe annual average wind speed over\
    \ the local area or use the world average wind speed\nvalue U2 = 2 m s−1 as the\
    \ default wind speed, obtained from over 2000 weather stations\nworldwide. Jabloun\
    \ and Sahli (2008) [61] compared the above methods and found that both\nmethods\
    \ obtained wind speeds with high applicability, but the ET0 was better estimated\n\
    using the local area’s annual average wind speed.\nWater 2023, 15, 2027\n17 of\
    \ 21\n4.2. Analysis of the Spatial Distribution of the Observation-Calculated\
    \ ET0 and\nReanalysis-Estimated ET0\nThe spatial and frequency distribution of\
    \ the annual mean values of ET0 calculated\nfrom the station observations, ET0\
    \ estimated by CLDAS and ET0 estimated by ERA5 in\nChina were analyzed. It was\
    \ found that the frequency distribution and spatial distribution\nof different\
    \ intervals of annual mean evapotranspiration estimated by CLDAS and ERA5 are\n\
    similar to the observed ET0, but in most cases, the reanalysis ET0 is slightly\
    \ overestimated.\nThe overestimation of the reference evapotranspiration derived\
    \ from reanalysis has been\ndiscovered in many relevant studies. Betts et al.\
    \ (2009) [62] compared ET0 at the watershed\nscale using ERA-Interim reanalysis\
    \ data and observations, and found that the reference crop\nevapotranspiration\
    \ from reanalysis data was signiﬁcantly larger than the observed value.\nMoreover,\
    \ other studies using ERA-Interim reanalysis products also reported an overall\n\
    overestimation bias for ET0 [28]. Dee and Uppala (2009, 2011) [44,63] considered\
    \ that the\noverestimation of reanalysis data is mainly related to the utilization\
    \ of small timescale\n(daily or smaller timescale) reanalysis products, water\
    \ vapor movement processes and\nvariational bias correction.\n4.3. Analysis of\
    \ the Accuracy of ET0 Estimated by CLDAS and ERA5 across Different Climatic Regions\n\
    Comparing the accuracy of ET0 estimation across different climatic regions, it\
    \ was\nfound that the variability of ET0 in humid and semi-humid areas is higher\
    \ than that in\narid and semi-arid areas. The RMSE of ET0 CLDAS ranged from 0.78\
    \ to 0.82 in climate zones\n1–3, the RMSE ranged from 0.89 to 0.91 in climate\
    \ zones 4–6, the RMSE of ET0ERA5 ranged\nfrom 1.12 to 1.33 in climate zones 1–3\
    \ and the RMSE ranged from 1.42 to 1.59 in climate\nzones 4–6. Su et al. (2015)\
    \ [64] also found that the reanalysis estimates of ET0 in arid\nand extremely\
    \ cold regions are more consistent with the site observations of ET0. The\nsame\
    \ trend was found by Zhang et al. (2018) [65] when they used ERA-Interim reanalysis\n\
    data to study the characteristics of ET0 in global arid and semi-arid regions.\
    \ Furthermore,\nParedes et al. (2018) [57], using the ERA-Interim reanalysis product\
    \ for the daily estimation\nof grass reference evapotranspiration, also found\
    \ that the higher values of RMSE were\nmostly concentrated in coastal areas of\
    \ Portugal. These ﬁndings are consistent with the\nconclusions of this paper.\
    \ This can be attributed to the meteorological factors related to the\nestimation\
    \ of ET0 in result Section 2.1. We also reported that the accuracy of reanalysis\
    \ Rs\nin arid and semi-arid regions is higher than that in humid regions, which\
    \ is partly because\nthe calculation of solar radiation is a complex task in itself,\
    \ and the high uncertainty\nof atmospheric turbidity in humid climatic conditions,\
    \ which further exacerbates errors\nbetween the reanalysis of solar radiation\
    \ data and station observations, Rs is the most\nsigniﬁcant meteorological factor\
    \ affecting ET0 [66]. The high error of the reanalysis Rs leads\nto a high variability\
    \ of ET0 in humid and semi-humid climate zones.\n5. Summary and Conclusions\n\
    It is difﬁcult to obtain long timeseries meteorological variables required for\
    \ PM-\nET0 calculation from ground stations. The reanalysis datasets provide all\
    \ the weather\nvariables required for calculating ET0, but needs to be evaluated\
    \ for accuracy. In this\npaper, meteorological factors such as Tmin and Tmax,\
    \ Rs, RH and U2 derived from CLDAS\nand ERA5 are statistically analyzed. Moreover,\
    \ based on the daily meteorological data\nof 689 surface meteorological stations\
    \ covering seven different climatic regions in China,\nET0 CLDAS and ET0 ERA5\
    \ at different timescales are compared and evaluated.\nThe quality of meteorological\
    \ factors for calculating PM-ET0 obtained from CLDAS\nand ERA5 reanalysis products\
    \ is acceptable, and the correlation between reanalysis temper-\nature and station\
    \ observation temperature is high, with R2 > 0.90 for Tmin CLDAS, Tmax CLDAS,\n\
    and R2 > 0.84 for Tmin ERA5, Tmax ERA5; however, there is a tendency for an underestimation\n\
    of Tmax, and conversely, a tendency for an overestimation of Tmin. Rs and RH can\
    \ be\naccurately estimated from reanalysis datasets, but reanalysis Rs has a slight\
    \ overestimation\ntrend for site observation Rs and an underestimation trend for\
    \ site observation RH. Com-\nWater 2023, 15, 2027\n18 of 21\npared with the ERA5\
    \ reanalysis products, Tmin, Tmax, Rs and RH derived from the CLDAS\nproducts\
    \ are closer to the site observations, and the overall RMSE and MAE values are\n\
    smaller. In contrast, the accuracy of both U2 CLDAS and U2 ERA5 is coarser, but\
    \ the reanalysis\nof wind speed does not cause a large variability in ET0.\nTwo\
    \ reanalysis products capture the seasonal cycle and monthly time evolution based\n\
    on the observed ET0. During the year, 75–80% of ET0 is concentrated in April–October,\n\
    but the monthly mean ET0 in different climate zones shows single-peak and double-peak\n\
    type variations, with different peak occurrence times. In addition, the agreement\
    \ between\nthe reanalysis estimated ET0 and site-observed ET0 is high in arid\
    \ and semi-arid areas,\nwith the lowest value of ET0 CLDAS correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ being 0.90 and ET0 ERA5 0.85. The\nconsistency is slightly worse in wet and\
    \ semi-humid areas, with the R2 variation range\nof 0.69–0.88 for ET0 CLDAS and\
    \ 0.54–0.79 for ET0 ERA5. CLDAS reanalyzed meteorological\nvariables which are\
    \ used to compute the PM-ET0, and estimated ET0 closer to the site\nobservation\
    \ ET0 Obs, comparing the corresponding values of ERA5.\nThese results suggest\
    \ that reanalysis weather products (Rs, Tmax, Tmin, RH and U2)\ncan be used to\
    \ estimate ET0 when the observed weather data are unavailable. However,\nthe causes\
    \ of the impact of errors in each weather variable on the accuracy of the estimated\n\
    ET0 are not clear, and further studies are required to clarify the quantitative\
    \ sensitivity of\nthe errors in the reanalysis weather variables on the estimated\
    \ ET0 as a way to decrease\nthe reanalysis product estimation errors obtained\
    \ when using daily time steps. Moreover,\nstudies are needed to combine long past\
    \ series data with forecasts, to achieve the real-time\noperation of irrigation\
    \ scheduling models.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.Y. and L.Q.;\

    \ (SSM) derived from\nSAR data was analyzed for changes indicating irrigation\
    \ events at the plot scale in four reference\nplots located in Montpellier (P1)\
    \ and Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4). As rain most likely covers several\nsquare kilometers,\
    \ while irrigation is decided at the plot scale, a difference between SSM signals\n\
    at the grid scale (10 km × 10 km) and plot scale is a clear indication of a recent\
    \ irrigation event.\nIts date and amount are then sought by forcing irrigation\
    \ dates and amounts in Optirrig, selecting\nthe most relevant (date, amount) combination\
    \ from an appropriate criterion. As the observed SSM\nvalues hold for a depth\
    \ of a few centimeters, while the modeled SSM values hold for exactly 10 cm,\n\
    the best irrigation combination is the one that gives similar relative changes\
    \ in SSM values rather\nthan similar SSM values. The irrigation dates were detected\
    \ with an overall accuracy (recall) of\n86.2% and a precision of 85.7%, and thus,\
    \ with relatively low numbers of missed or false irrigation\ndetections, respectively.\
    \ The performance of the method in detecting seasonal irrigation amounts\nvaried\
    \ with climatic conditions. For the P1 plot in the semi-arid climate of Montpellier,\
    \ the mean\nabsolute error percentage (MAE%) was 16.4%, showing a higher efﬁciency\
    \ when compared with\nthe humid climate of Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4 plots), where\
    \ a higher MAE% of 50% was recorded,\nindicating a larger discrepancy between\
    \ the detected and actual irrigation amounts. The limitations of\nthe proposed\
    \ method can be attributed to the characteristics of the Sentinel-1 constellation,\
    \ including\nits 6-day revisit time and signal penetration challenges in dense\
    \ maize cover, as well as the mismatch\nbetween the parameterization of Optirrig\
    \ for SSM simulations and the actual irrigation practices\nfollowed by farmers.\
    \ Despite these weaknesses, the results demonstrated the relevance of combining\n\
    Optirrig and S1 SAR-derived SSM data for ﬁeld-scale detection of irrigation dates\
    \ and, potentially,\nirrigation amounts.\nKeywords: Sentinel-1; surface soil moisture;\

    \ is the largest consumer of fresh water, accounting for a substantial\n70% of\
    \ total freshwater withdrawals [1]. The water demands for irrigated agriculture\
    \ are\nanticipated to rise, posing signiﬁcant challenges to irrigation and freshwater\
    \ availability,\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15164081\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n2 of\
    \ 36\nparticularly in water-scarce regions like the Mediterranean basin [2]. As\
    \ areas affected by\ndrought increase, irrigation becomes more and more crucial\
    \ for achieving optimal crop\ngrowth and production [3–5].\nSatellite remote sensing\
    \ has exhibited considerable effectiveness in the diagnostic\nand supervisory\
    \ aspects of irrigation, particularly in the context of mapping and monitor-\n\
    ing cropped and irrigated areas [6–8], either with optical [9–12] or radar sensors\
    \ [13–17].\nIn detail, the interpretation of several optical vegetation indices,\
    \ such as the NDVI [12],\nthe normalized difference water index (NDWI) [18], or\
    \ the greenness index (GI) [19],\nwas demonstrated to be effective in exploring\
    \ discrepancies in the spectral attributes of\ncrops [20]. Recently, Hamze et\
    \ al. [21] developed a novel methodology to detect irrigation\ndates and amounts\
    \ for maize crops in the Occitanie region, France, using leaf area index\n(LAI)\
    \ values derived from optical images and the Optirrig crop growth and irrigation\n\
    model. The approach involved analyzing cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S2) optical images\
    \ to iden-\ntify potential irrigation events and selecting the most probable event\
    \ that minimized the\ndifference between the predicted and observed LAI values\
    \ derived from S2. The method-\nology achieved an overall recall of 81.6% for\
    \ irrigation date detection when evaluated\nwith daily interpolated LAI data.\
    \ Although the methods described above, which depend\non optical satellite observations,\
    \ have shown promising outcomes in mapping irrigated\nareas and detecting irrigation\
    \ events, their effectiveness is constrained in various tropical\nand temperate\
    \ regions due to the sensitivity of optical data to weather conditions and\ncloud\
    \ cover.\nSurface soil moisture (SSM) is directly inﬂuenced by rain and irrigation\
    \ practices (time,\nfrequency, and amounts), which makes it relevant information\
    \ for irrigation detection and\nmonitoring or supervision purposes [22–24]. By\
    \ monitoring SSM at the plot scale, farmers\nand water managers can make informed\
    \ decisions about irrigation scheduling, optimizing\nwater resources, and maintaining\
    \ crop health for real-time irrigation monitoring, as well\nas long-term irrigation\
    \ practice supervision [25,26]. Over the past four decades, there has\nbeen notable\
    \ enhancement in the quality of surface soil moisture (SSM) products derived\n\
    from both active and passive microwave remote sensors [27]. These advancements\
    \ have\ngreatly improved the ability to estimate and monitor the moisture content\
    \ of the top layer\nof soil, typically not exceeding a depth of 10 cm [28]. Kumar\
    \ et al. [29] were the pioneers\nin utilizing the disparities between low-resolution\
    \ microwave-based SSM products, such\nas ASCAT [30], AMSR-2 [31], SMOS (Soil Moisture\
    \ and Ocean Salinity [32]), AMSR-E [33],\nWindSat [34], and ESA ECV (ESA’s essential\
    \ climate variable product [34]), and the SSM\nsimulated using a land surface\
    \ model (Noah) that does not include anthropogenic interven-\ntions like irrigation\
    \ [35]. Similarly, Malbéteau et al. [36] employed a comparable approach\nby assimilating\
    \ coarse-scale SSM data derived from SMOS products, disaggregated to a\n1 km resolution,\
    \ into a basic land surface model driven solely by precipitation. In this\nmethod,\
    \ irrigated areas were identiﬁed with satisfactory accuracy by examining the cu-\n\
    mulative analysis increment, which represents the difference between the analyzed\
    \ and\nbackground SSM values throughout the season. Similarly, Zaussinger et al.\
    \ [22] employed\nvarious coarse-resolution datasets and compared them with a water\
    \ balance driven by the\nMERRA-2 model in order to assess the utilization of irrigation\
    \ water. The examination\nconducted at a statewide level yielded divergent ﬁndings\
    \ (with correlation coefﬁcients\nranging from 0.36 to 0.8) and notably lower estimations\
    \ compared with the documented\nirrigation water withdrawals.\nHowever, the estimations\
    \ of irrigation mentioned above are generally obtained at\na monthly time scale\
    \ and for pixels covering several square kilometers (km2), making\nthem inadequate\
    \ for effective irrigation supervision, both in terms of spatial and temporal\n\
    resolutions. Therefore, acquiring irrigation information at the plot scale requires\
    \ the use\nof high-spatial-resolution SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data, which\
    \ was found to be\nespecially beneﬁcial for efﬁcient irrigation monitoring at\
    \ smaller agricultural scales. Hence,\nthe sensitivity of SAR signals to soil\
    \ and vegetation water could help in the detection of\nirrigation events, as irrigation\
    \ gradually enhances the water content of both the soil and\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n3 of 36\nvegetation. Extensive literature has consistently shown a\
    \ direct correlation between the\nSAR backscattering coefﬁcient (σ0) and the water\
    \ content of the soil and vegetation [37–40].\nAmong various SAR satellite constellations,\
    \ the Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR constellation (S1A and\nS1B) stands out as an effective\
    \ tool for mapping and monitoring large-scale irrigated areas.\nThis is attributed\
    \ to its unique combination of a high revisit time (6-day interval) and high\n\
    spatial resolution (pixel spacing of 10 m × 10 m). Benabdelouhab et al. [41] demonstrated\n\
    that C-band S1 SAR data can effectively detect irrigation activities in irrigated\
    \ wheat plots\nwith a three-day interval between irrigation and SAR acquisition.\
    \ Detecting consecutive\nirrigation events requires a comprehensive multi-temporal\
    \ dataset due to the dynamic\nnature of irrigation. In a recent study by Bazzi\
    \ et al. [17], a near real-time approach was\ndeveloped to determine irrigation\
    \ timing in diverse summer and winter crop ﬁelds located\nin France and Spain.\
    \ The approach involved a change detection methodology that examined\ntwo consecutive\
    \ S1 observations to detect irrigation activities using the S1 SAR σ0 and S2\n\
    NDVI. The ﬁndings revealed that the proposed method achieved an approximate overall\n\
    accuracy of 84% in detecting irrigation events that occurred in agricultural plots.\n\
    In addition, several studies showed the potential of SSM products derived from\n\
    S1 SAR observations for monitoring and detecting irrigation events over agricultural\n\
    areas [13,42–44] since the SAR signal is sensitive to SSM through the dielectric\
    \ properties of\nthe soil [45,46]. Le Page et al. [43] examined the potential\
    \ of the S2MP (Sentinel-1/Sentinel-\n2-derived soil moisture product [47]) in\
    \ detecting irrigation events at the individual plot\nlevel over irrigated maize\
    \ ﬁelds of southwest France. S2MP is a soil moisture estimation\nproduct that\
    \ combines Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data for SSM estimation\n\
    using the neural networks technique [47]. The results demonstrated a high accuracy\
    \ in\ndetecting irrigation timing, with an F-score ranging from 80% to 83% for\
    \ all the maize plots\nexamined. The ability to detect irrigation events from\
    \ SAR data is predominantly inﬂuenced\nby several factors, including the revisit\
    \ time; radar wavelength (SAR characteristics); and\nvegetation cover, which encompasses\
    \ crop type and growth phase [43]. Additionally, the\neffectiveness of irrigation\
    \ event detection may be impeded by extended revisit times that\ndo not align\
    \ with the rapid drying of the soil surface, which occurs within 2–3 days after\n\
    irrigation, resulting in water content values similar to those observed before\
    \ irrigation [48].\nMoreover, El Hajj et al. [49] demonstrated limitations in\
    \ estimating soil moisture over cereal\ncrops and grasslands using (C-band) S1\
    \ SAR data that were attributed to the limited signal\npenetration under well-developed\
    \ vegetation covers. Consequently, this highlights the\npotential advantages of\
    \ utilizing L-band data (lower frequency, longer wavelength, and\nenhanced penetration\
    \ capabilities) for future applications [50].\nFrom a different perspective, relying\
    \ on the modeling of biophysical processes, crop\ngrowth models have emerged as\
    \ highly valuable tools over the past three decades, en-\nabling the assessment\
    \ of agronomical needs and traits such as crop water requirements,\nbiomass, and\
    \ yield, which has made them suitable for crop development and monitoring\nirrigation\
    \ [51–53]. Extensive multidisciplinary efforts in crop modeling have led to the\n\
    reﬁnement of various dynamic process-based crop models incorporating water balance\n\
    and evapotranspiration components, such as AquaCrop [54], STICS [55], SAFYE [56],\
    \ and\nOptirrig [57]. The latter focuses on the identiﬁcation of appropriate plot-scale\
    \ water man-\nagement strategies while being as parsimonious as possible in the\
    \ description of plant\nphysiology and soil water budget dynamics. These models\
    \ were shown to be useful for\nmonitoring water application effects and stress\
    \ on plant growth, as well as simulating\nthe crop response to irrigation [58–62].\
    \ Consequently, crop models, such as Optirrig, are\nregarded as powerful tools\
    \ for deﬁning crop water requirements and optimizing irrigation\nmanagement strategies\
    \ based on management practices and soil conditions, particularly\nsoil water\
    \ balance [63,64]. Notably, soil water content plays a critical role in Optirrig,\
    \ as it\nrepresents the available water in the soil proﬁle for plant utilization,\
    \ which is essential for\npredicting crop development, biomass accumulation, and\
    \ overall crop yield. The Optirrig\ncrop model incorporates factors such as climatic\
    \ conditions, soil properties, and manage-\nment practices (e.g., irrigation,\
    \ sowing, and harvest dates) to simulate the water balance in\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n4 of 36\nthe soil [57,65]. For example, Mailhol et al. [65] conducted\
    \ a study on irrigated maize ﬁelds\nto assess the capabilities of the Pilote model\
    \ (subsequently transformed and enhanced to\nserve as the agronomic and hydrological\
    \ core of Optirrig) for crop development and yield\nprediction. The model demonstrated\
    \ the capacity to provide satisfactory simulations and\npredictions of leaf area\
    \ index (LAI) values, which is a pivotal variable within its conceptual\nand numerical\
    \ schemes due to its precise estimations of soil water balance, even in the\n\
    initial shallow reservoir of 10 cm in depth, throughout the crop’s growth cycle.\
    \ However,\nthe implementation of crop and irrigation models is often limited\
    \ by the availability of\ninput data [66], which could hamper the accuracy of\
    \ soil water content simulation in the\nmodel and, therefore, the accuracy of\
    \ crop yield predictions and irrigation scheduling [67].\nConsequently, the uncertainties\
    \ encountered in estimating daily or seasonal model vari-\nables, encompassing\
    \ soil water reserves, crop development, biomass accumulation, and\nﬁnal yield,\
    \ are frequently attributable to the limited understanding of soil characteristics\n\
    and crop management practices across extensive geographical extents [68,69].\n\
    To mitigate these uncertainties, several studies have integrated information obtained\n\
    from remote sensing-derived soil moisture data into crop and soil water models,\
    \ thereby\nenhancing agricultural assessments and irrigation monitoring approaches\
    \ [70–73]. For\ninstance, Zhou et al. [71] integrated ESA CCI SSM at a spatial\
    \ resolution of 0.25 degrees into\nthe DSSAT model. The aim was to estimate both\
    \ the surface and root-zone soil moisture\nand assess the impact of data assimilation\
    \ on agricultural drought monitoring. The ﬁndings\nrevealed a signiﬁcant improvement\
    \ in soil moisture estimates following the assimilation of\nSSM data, which potentially\
    \ improves the estimation accuracy of crop yields and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ [74–77]. Similarly, [78] conducted a study to assess the impact of integrating\n\
    in situ and remote sensing soil moisture observations with the APSIM model through\n\
    sequential data assimilation. The evaluation was conducted across ﬁve experimental\
    \ sites\nin the US Midwest, focusing on the improvement in model predictions for\
    \ downstream\nstate variables. The results demonstrated that assimilating remote\
    \ sensing soil moisture\ndata led to enhanced crop yield estimates, with a median\
    \ reduction of 17.2% in RMSE\ncompared with the model predictions.\nConversely,\
    \ recent studies assessed the potential of incorporating SSM derived from\nhigh-spatial-\
    \ and -temporal-resolution Sentinel-1 data into simple land surface and water\n\
    budget models for irrigation events detection [42,44]. For instance, Ouaadi et\
    \ al. [44]\nconducted a study to introduce and assess a novel method for predicting\
    \ irrigation timing\nand amounts at the ﬁeld scale. The approach involved incorporating\
    \ S1 SSM data into a\nsimple water budget model, namely, FAO-56 [79]. The results\
    \ demonstrated that both the\ntiming of irrigation and the amount of water used\
    \ could be accurately determined if a priori\ninformation about irrigation techniques\
    \ is collected. However, land surface and water\nbudget models often rely on observations\
    \ or empirical functions to simulate vegetation\neffects and lack a mechanistic\
    \ representation [80,81]. They also tend to overlook the impact\nof human activities,\
    \ such as irrigation, on soil moisture changes. On the other hand, crop\nmodels\
    \ have the capability to explicitly capture the entire growth process and simulate\n\
    interactions between the root-zone soil moisture and crop water uptake. Therefore,\
    \ crop\nmodels, when combined with agronomic parameters and soil information derived\
    \ from\nremote sensing, can effectively monitor crop yield and irrigation [80,82,83].\n\
    The linkage between crop models and remote sensing observations for detecting\
    \ irri-\ngation is not commonly explored, and there is a dearth of evaluations\
    \ regarding the impact\nof integrating soil moisture estimates into crop modeling,\
    \ among others for irrigation\nmonitoring or supervision. Consequently, this study\
    \ aimed at incorporating SSM obser-\nvations derived from the S2MP product [47]\
    \ into Optirrig for irrigation dates and amount\ndetection. In this study, the\
    \ Optirrig model [57,84] was used for simulating, analyzing,\nand optimizing irrigation\
    \ scenarios. The speciﬁc objective assigned to Optirrig was to\nidentify the actual\
    \ sequence of irrigation events (including dates and amounts) for multiple\nmaize\
    \ ﬁelds under irrigation in the Occitanie region of Southeast France. By simulating\n\
    the dynamics of soil water content, Optirrig could assess the impact of different\
    \ irrigation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n5 of 36\nmanagement practices and/or\
    \ water stress on the SSM. The method aimed at retrieving\nthe irrigation that\
    \ has probably occurred, leading to changes in the SSM between two\nSAR image\
    \ acquisition dates. The approach involved detecting changes in the SSM values\n\
    derived from the S2MP (SSMS1) between the t(l) date of the current SAR image and\
    \ the t(i)\ndate of the previous image. The main objective was, therefore, to\
    \ determine the irrigation\n(date and amount) that could have caused this variation\
    \ in SSM. This was done through\nthe simulation of the SSM using Optirrig for\
    \ various irrigation combinations (dates and\ndoses) injected between t(i) and\
    \ t(l). The irrigation combination that resulted in a similar\nchange in SSM as\
    \ observed in the SSMS1 was considered the most likely one that occurred.\nIt\
    \ is important to note that in this study, the changes in SSM values were examined\
    \ by\ncalculating the rate of change between t(i) and t(l). By examining these\
    \ rates of change,\nwe could assess the similarity or disparity between the observed\
    \ (SSMS1) and simulated\nSSM variations in Optirrig, providing insights into retrieving\
    \ the most probable irrigation\ndate and amount. First, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2,\
    \ weather, and irrigation data were collected\nand then SSMS1 values were estimated\
    \ over maize plots using S2MP. Second, the rate of\nchange of SSMS1 was computed\
    \ between subsequent S1 acquisition dates for ascending\nand descending orbits\
    \ separately. Then, irrigation combinations of dates and amounts\nwere entered\
    \ into Optirrig in order to detect the irrigation combination that led to a rate\
    \ of\nchange that matched that of SSMS1. The performance of the proposed method\
    \ for detecting\nirrigation was evaluated by comparing the actual irrigation dates\
    \ and amounts applied in\nthe studied maize ﬁelds with those estimated.\n2. Materials\n\

    \ is a process-based crop growth and irrigation model that comprises an in-\n\
    ner layer responsible for hydrological and agronomical calculations, and an outer\
    \ layer\ndedicated to generating, analyzing, and optimizing irrigation scenarios.\
    \ It is derived from\nthe Pilote model [64,65] developed by the same research\
    \ team, with some adaptations\nregarding process modeling (and a thorough rewriting\
    \ in the R language in a completely\nexplicit, agile, and modular form that ﬁts\
    \ the modern international standards). Optirrig\nsimulates crop growth and yield\
    \ based on water and nutrient availability and consumption,\nemphasizing the identiﬁcation\
    \ of effective irrigation and fertilization practices and decision\nrules, particularly\
    \ for cereals and horticulture [57,84]. The model version used in this study\n\
    focuses on ﬁeld crops and is represented in Figure 2. It assumed no nitrogen stress\
    \ due\nto sufﬁcient fertilization on the study sites, and hence, the nitrogen\
    \ cycle component was\nexcluded from the model.\nWithin its inner hydro-agronomic\
    \ module, Optirrig conducts a daily water balance,\nconsidering factors such as\
    \ inﬁltration, drainage, evaporation, transpiration, and changes\nin soil water\
    \ reserves (R1, R2, R3) in different reservoirs (surface, root zone, and deep).\n\
    Optirrig relies on four daily climatic inputs: precipitation (P), mean air temperature\
    \ (T),\npotential evapotranspiration (ETo), and total global solar radiation (Rg).\
    \ Additionally, irri-\ngation (I) can be incorporated as a management parameter.\
    \ Crop growth is tracked through\nthe leaf area index (LAI), which is determined\
    \ by the thermal time (TT) and potential water\nstress (Sw), as shown in Figure\
    \ 2. The crop coefﬁcient (Kc) and partition coefﬁcient (Cp) are\nderived from\
    \ the LAI, as they control the allocation of ETo into transpiration demand (Tp0)\n\
    and evaporation demand (Es0). The actual transpiration (Tp) and evaporation (Es)\
    \ are\nthen calculated based on available water reserves, which are continually\
    \ updated. Biomass\naccumulation (TDM) is determined by radiation interception\
    \ and can also be inﬂuenced\nby water stresses. Finally, crop yield (Y) is evaluated\
    \ using the harvest index (HI), which\nmay deviate from its potential value if\
    \ signiﬁcant water stresses are observed throughout\nthe cropping season. For\
    \ more speciﬁc information, Table 3 provides additional details,\nparticularly\
    \ regarding the soil and crop parameters involved.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n\

    \ generation and analysis of multiple irrigation\nscenarios to enhance water efﬁciency\
    \ and optimize crop yield. The model’s structure offers\nthe capability to incorporate\
    \ independent information, treated as observations, pertaining\nto certain state\
    \ variables. This feature can be utilized for various purposes, including\nclassical\
    \ tasks like model ﬁtting or exploratory analyses.\nAs stated above, Optirrig\
    \ performs a daily water balance that encompasses inﬁltration\nand drainage, evaporation\
    \ and transpiration, and changes in soil water reserves (R1, R2, R3)\nin the surface,\
    \ root-zone, and deep reservoirs, respectively. The R1 reservoir with a shallow\n\
    depth of 10 cm controls the water balance at the soil surface. In this context,\
    \ we compared\nthe SSM values derived from remote sensing with the simulated soil\
    \ water balance in the\nR1 reservoir. The main objective was to identify irrigation\
    \ dates and amounts that minimize\nthe disparity between the observed (remote\

    \ S1 SAR images operating at the C-band frequency of\n5.405 GHz were utilized.\
    \ These images were acquired by S1A and S1B satellites in both\nascending mode\
    \ (afternoon at 18:00 UT) and descending mode (morning at 06:00 UT).\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ 72 images (36 ascending and 36 descending) were obtained for each of the\nfour\
    \ reference plots (6-day revisit time) located in Montpellier (P1) and Tarbes\
    \ (P2, P3, and\nP4). The data spanned from April to October for each year, with\
    \ 2017 for P1 and 2018,\n2019, and 2020 for P2, P3, and P4, respectively. This\
    \ period corresponds to the irrigation\nperiod for these reference plots. The\
    \ SAR images were acquired in the interferometric-wide\n(IW) swath with two polarizations:\
    \ VV (vertical–vertical) and VH (vertical–horizontal).\nFor the purpose of this\
    \ study, only the VV and VH polarizations were considered in the\nSSM (surface\
    \ soil moisture) estimation algorithm. The 288 images were derived from\nthe ground-range-detected\
    \ (GRD) product, featuring a pixel spacing of 10 m × 10 m.\nThese images were\
    \ downloaded via the European Space Agency (ESA) website (https:\n//scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home,\
    \ accessed on 9 November 2022).\nFigure 3 illustrates the repetitiveness of S1\
    \ data in both the ascending “A” and de-\nscending “D” acquisition modes across\

    \ orbits as the P1 plot were\nacquired for P3 (2019) and P4 (2020). Each study\
    \ site underwent the acquisition of 10 SAR\nimages per month, comprising 5 ascending\
    \ and 5 descending images. The descending SAR\nimage (morning) for the Montpellier\
    \ site (Figure 3a) was acquired 36 h before the ascending\nevening image, exhibiting\
    \ incidence angles of 38.1◦ and 39.3◦, respectively. Similarly, in\nTarbes (Figure\
    \ 3b), the morning acquisition preceded the evening acquisition by 36 h, and\n\
    the incidence angles were 36.2◦ and 40.3◦, respectively.\n \np\npurpose of this\
    \ study, only the VV and VH polarizations were considered in the SSM \n(surface\

    \ These \nimages were downloaded via the European Space Agency (ESA) website (https://sci-\n\

    \ angles of 38.1° and 39.3°, respectively. Sim-\nilarly, in Tarbes (Figure 3b),\
    \ the morning acquisition preceded the evening acquisition by \n36 h, and the\

    \ namely, in April 2017\nfor the P1 plot in Montpellier (a) and in April 2018\
    \ for the P2 plot in Tarbes (b). Also indicated are the\nincidence angles associated\
    \ with each acquisition.\nESA’s S1 toolbox was employed to calibrate a total of\
    \ 288 S1 images. This calibration\nprocess encompassed radiometric and geometric\
    \ adjustments, which transformed the\ndigital numbers into backscattering coefﬁcients\
    \ (σ0) in linear units (radiometric calibration)\nand ortho-rectiﬁed the images\
    \ (geometric calibration) using a 30 m digital elevation model\nderived from the\
    \ Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Finally, two distinct sets of\nσ0 temporal\
    \ series were derived for each study site. These series represent the repeated\n\
    images obtained through the same acquisition mode (ascending and descending) every\
    \ six\ndays. The ﬁrst set corresponded to the morning acquisition and was labeled\
    \ as DM1 for\nthe Montpellier site in 2017, and DM2, DM3, and DM4 for Tarbes in\
    \ 2018, 2019, and 2020,\nrespectively. Moreover, the temporal series acquired\
    \ in the afternoon were denoted as MA1\nfor the Montpellier site in 2017, while\
    \ for the Tarbes site, they were labeled as MA2, MA3,\nand MA4 for the years 2018,\
    \ 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nFor each acquired S1 SAR image of the temporal\
    \ series (DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, MA1,\nMA2, MA3, and MA4), the SAR σ0 at plot scale\
    \ (σ0\nP) was calculated by averaging the\npixel values within each plot (P1,\
    \ P2, P3, and P4) in both the VV and VH polarizations.\nThe SAR incidence angle\
    \ (θP) was determined for each SAR image at every plot. The\nincrease in SSM values\
    \ can be attributed not only to irrigation events but also to rainfall\nevents,\
    \ which are the primary contributors to SSM variations. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to\ndistinguish between rainfall events and irrigation events. Both rainfall\
    \ and irrigation events\nare considered water supplements and can have a similar\
    \ effect on the value of σ0\nP and SAR\nbackscattering coefﬁcient at the grid\
    \ scale (σ0\nG\n\x01\n. Thus, resolving the ambiguity between\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n11 of 36\nrainfall and irrigation is crucial for accurately detecting\
    \ irrigation events. To achieve better\ndetection of irrigation events, information\
    \ about rainfall is essential.\nIn this study, information about rainfall occurrence\
    \ was determined through the SSM\nvalue obtained at the grid scale (Section 2.4).\
    \ It was assumed that if the bare soil plots\nwith low vegetation cover within\
    \ the 10 km × 10 km spatial extent exhibited an increase\nin SSM values between\
    \ two consecutive SAR acquisitions, a rainfall event likely occurred.\nThis correlation\
    \ between rainfall and σ0\nG was demonstrated by Bazzi et al. [88], where they\n\
    compared SSM estimations at bare soil plots in a 10 km grid scale with rainfall\
    \ events at\nthe same scale, revealing a strong consistency between rainfall events\
    \ and SSM values at\nthe 10 km grid scale. The backscattering coefﬁcient at grid\
    \ scale (10 km × 10 km), namely,\nσ0\nG, was obtained for each SAR acquisition\
    \ of each temporal series by averaging the SAR\nbackscattering coefﬁcient of all\
    \ pixels within each grid cell that corresponded to either\nbare soil or areas\
    \ with small vegetation cover. The identiﬁcation of bare soil pixels with\nlow\
    \ vegetation cover was achieved by using a land cover map of France [89] to delineate\n\
    agricultural regions and subsequently applying a threshold value to the NDVI (NDVI\
    \ < 0.3)\nobtained from the S2 images (Section 2.5). Additionally, the σ0\nG values\
    \ were obtained for\nboth VV and VH polarizations, along with the average SAR\
    \ incidence angle (θG) at each\ngrid cell for every SAR image.\n2.5. Sentinel-2\
    \ Optical Data\nSentinel-2 (S2), which comprises optical satellites, was deployed\
    \ by the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) in 2015 and 2017 as two constellations,\
    \ S2A and S2B. Operating in\ntandem, these constellations offer a revisit time\
    \ of 5 days. S2 provides optical images that\nencompass 13 different bands, with\
    \ bands 4 and 8 speciﬁcally employed in calculating\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI). The high temporal resolution of the\nS2 satellite enabled\
    \ the acquisition of 15 cloud-free optical images for plot P1 in 2017,\n19 images\
    \ for plot P2 in 2018, 21 images for plot P3 in 2019, and 17 images for plot P4\
    \ in 2020\nthroughout the maize cropping seasons (between April and October).\
    \ For each reference\nplot, the images were downloaded from the Theia website\
    \ (https://www.theia-land.fr/,\naccessed on 9 November 2022), which offers ortho-rectiﬁed\
    \ level-2 products corrected for\natmospheric effects using the Level-2A operational\
    \ processor. The time span covered by\nthe S2 images aligned with that of the\
    \ S1 acquisitions for each reference plot and year. The\nprocessor employs algorithms\
    \ for scene classiﬁcation and atmospheric correction. These\noptical images were\
    \ used to calculate the NDVI values by averaging the values of all\nthe pixels\
    \ at the plot scale for each S2 date (Figure 4). The NDVI values serve as input\n\
    for estimating the SSM at the plot scale (S2MP (Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 Moisture\
    \ Product)\ndescribed in Section 3.1). Furthermore, for each grid cell, the average\
    \ NDVI value was\nobtained speciﬁcally for bare soil pixels exhibiting low vegetation\
    \ cover, as discussed in\nSection 3.1.2, to estimate the SSM at the grid scale.\n\
    3. Methods\nOur methodology focused on retrieving irrigation dates and amounts\
    \ at the plot\nlevel by integrating surface soil moisture (SSM) data obtained\
    \ from Sentinel-1 (SSMS1,\ndescribed in Section 3.1) into Optirrig using an inversion\
    \ technique. The approach relied\non comparing the change in the SSMS1 between\
    \ two S1 SAR acquisition dates, namely, t(l)\nand the previous date t(i), to the\
    \ change in the SSM simulated by Optirrig when forcing\ncombinations of irrigation\
    \ dates and amounts (I(j,k), j accounting for the dates and k for the\namounts)\
    \ in the input ﬁles of the model. In return, Optirrig provides SSM values in its\
    \ ﬁrst,\nshallow reservoir of 10 cm depth, which exceeded by a few centimeters\
    \ the penetration\ndepth of the radar signal in soils. Due to this difference,\
    \ comparing the SSMS1 and Optirrig\nSSM simulations (SSMM) was not a straightforward\
    \ task. We, therefore, proposed to\ninstead compare the rates of change (ΨSSMS1,\
    \ ΨSSMM) between successive observation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n12 of 36\n\
    dates, seeking the irrigation date and amount that reduced the difference between\
    \ those\ntwo rates, deﬁning the rate of change between any two t(i) and t(i+1)\
    \ dates as\nΨSSM =\nSSM(i+1) − SSM(i)\nSSM(i)\n(1)\nHowever, the SSM estimated\
    \ from SAR data might be inﬂuenced by various factors,\nespecially rainfall and\
    \ irrigation: both lead to an increase in the backscattering coefﬁcient,\nwhich\
    \ affects the SSM values. Hence, it was mandatory to ﬁrst distinguish between\
    \ rainfall\nand irrigation events, which is expected from a combined analysis\
    \ of changes in SSM values\nat the plot scale (SSMP) and the grid scale (SSMG).\n\
    The method for detecting irrigations was based on identifying changes in the plot-scale\n\
    surface soil moisture (SSMP) values between the current SAR acquisition at time\
    \ t(l) and\nthe previous SAR acquisition at time t(i). In essence, the approach\
    \ assumed that an increase\nin SSMP between two consecutive SAR dates (t(i) and\
    \ t(l)), resulting in a positive rate of\nchange (ΨSSMP), was attributable to\
    \ either rainfall or irrigation (Section 3.1.1). Conversely,\nan increase in SSMG\
    \ values at the grid scale (10 km × 10 km) likely denoted a rainfall event\n(Section\
    \ 3.1.2). Consequently, a ΨSSMP value higher than the ΨSSMG value between t(i)\n\
    and t(l) signaled the effect of local water application (which a priori excluded\
    \ rainfall) and\nwas considered indirect evidence of irrigation.\nFurther veriﬁcations\
    \ were performed using Optirrig. The evolution of SSM throughout\nthe maize growing\
    \ cycle was simulated using Optirrig without the presence of irrigation in\nso-called\
    \ “rainfed” conditions (SSMr), thus taking into account the sole effect of rainfall\n\
    on the soil water content (Section 3.2.1). The ΨSSMr rate of change between t(i)\
    \ and t(l)\nwas computed and compared with ΨSSMP. A ΨSSMP value lower than or\
    \ equal to the\nΨSSMr value meant that there was no effect of water application\
    \ other than rainfall on\nthe plot-scale surface soil moisture. Conversely, if\
    \ the ΨSSMP value was higher than the\nΨSSMr value, it was interpreted as evidence\
    \ of irrigation between t(i) and t(l).\nThe proposed methodology for irrigation\
    \ detection consisted of (i) applying the above\nconditions to the SSM values\
    \ derived from Sentinel-1 at plot and grid scales to determine\nwhether irrigation\
    \ took place, and (ii) if so, simulating the SSM values with Optirrig for\ndifferent\
    \ combinations of irrigation dates and amounts, seeking the combination that\n\
    produced the best match between the rates of change of the observed and simulated\n\
    SSM values.\n3.1. S2MP for SSM Estimation\nThe estimation of the surface soil\
    \ moisture (SSM) was accomplished using the S2MP\ndeveloped by El Hajj et al.\
    \ [47] using time series data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\nand a neural network\
    \ technique for estimating SSM within the upper 3–5 cm layer. The\nneural network\
    \ employed sought the optimal ﬁt between the reference and estimated SSM\nby incorporating\
    \ the calibrated water cloud model (WCM) [90], along with the integral\nevaluation\
    \ model for soil backscattering [91–93]. Within the WCM, the total backscattered\n\
    coefﬁcient was computed as the combined contribution of direct vegetation and\
    \ soil,\nmultiplied by an attenuation factor. This approach, which was used in\
    \ this study, delivered\nsatisfactory estimations of surface soil moisture (SSM)\
    \ with a root mean square error (RMSE)\nof 5 vol.%. It required three inputs:\
    \ the σ0 value in VV and VH polarizations, the SAR\nincidence angle (θ), and an\
    \ NDVI value. Consequently, the SSM estimations were obtained\nindividually for\
    \ each plot and each grid cell at every available SAR acquisition date within\n\
    the eight temporal series of the four reference plots (Figure 4).\nRemote Sens.\

    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n14 of 36\n3.1.1. SSM Estimation at Plot Scale\nThe\
    \ proposed approach relied on identifying variations in the level of surface soil\n\
    moisture at the plot scale. For each SAR date, the SSMS1 values were estimated\
    \ at each\nplot, denoted by SSMP (Figure 4). When the SSMP level increased between\
    \ two successive\nsynthetic SAR acquisitions, the σ0\nP value also tended to increase,\
    \ leading to an increasing\nSSMP. Consequently, if an irrigation event occurred\
    \ between two SAR acquisitions, the\nSAR SSMP value would show an increase [16].\n\
    Additionally, the stability or slight decrease of SSMP values between two dates\
    \ could\nalso be linked to irrigation and not only when increasing values of SSMP\
    \ are observed (as\nmentioned in the previous paragraph), particularly when SSMP\
    \ values are already high. In\nfact, without any interventions like irrigation,\
    \ rainfall, soil activities, or vegetation growth,\nthe SAR signal tends to decrease\
    \ between two SAR acquisitions (within a maximum of\n6 days), particularly during\
    \ the spring and summer seasons. This decrease is inﬂuenced\nby various water\
    \ cycle factors, such as inﬁltration, evaporation, and evapotranspiration,\nwhich\
    \ contribute to a decline in SSM values. Thus, the stabilization or slight decrease\
    \ in\nSSMP between the SAR acquisition date t(i) (SSMP(i)) and the subsequent\
    \ acquisition date\nt(l) (SSMP(l)) could have been due to an additional water\
    \ supply if no rainfall had occurred\nbetween t(i) and t(l).\nSince the method\
    \ revolved around detecting changes in SSMP values, we proposed\ncalculating the\
    \ rate of change between the SSMP value at each SAR acquisition date t(l)\n(SSMP(l))\
    \ and the SSMP value at the previous SAR acquisition date t(i) (SSMP(i)). Conse-\n\
    quently, we computed the SAR SSMP rate of change (ΨSSMP) for each SAR acquisition\
    \ t(l)\nat the plot scale as follows:\nΨSSMP(l) =\nSSMP(l) − SSMP(i)\nSSMP(i)\n\
    (2)\nA positive, stable, or even slightly negative ΨSSMP(l) provided indirect\
    \ evidence of\nirrigation and/or rainfall occurrence between t(i) and t(l). Therefore,\
    \ additional criteria\nneeded to be included to verify a potential irrigation\
    \ event. This involved comparing\nΨSSMP to ΨSSM at the grid scale (ΨSSMG), as\
    \ well as to the variations in shallow reservoir\nsoil moisture simulated in Optirrig\
    \ without the presence of irrigation (ΨSSMr). The latter\ntook into account the\
    \ impact of rainfall on the surface soil moisture (SSM) between the\nSAR acquisitions\
    \ t(i) and t(l). The upcoming sections cover the discussion of these criteria\n\
    and conditions.\n3.1.2. SSM Estimation at the Grid Scale\nAt the grid scale, an\
    \ estimation of SSM from σ0\nG (SSMG) for bare soil plots with low\nvegetation\
    \ cover (NDVI < 0.3) was conducted for each grid cell and SAR date (Figure 4).\n\
    This estimation provided information about the surface water content over the\
    \ bare soil\nplots at the basin scale. It was assumed that high soil moisture\
    \ values observed at the grid\nscale (10 km × 10 km) centered around the plots\
    \ were more likely to be associated with\npotential rainfall events than with\
    \ irrigation events: high soil moisture conditions at the\ngrid scale indicate\
    \ humid soil conditions “everywhere”, which is typically associated with\nrainfall\
    \ events showing no “plot by plot” patterns.\nAt a given SAR acquisition date\
    \ t(l), the change in SAR SSM at each 10 km cell could\nbe determined by calculating\
    \ the rate of change of SSMG (ΨSSMG(l)) between the SSMG\nvalue at t(l) and the\
    \ SSMG value at the previous SAR acquisition date t(i):\nΨSSMG(l) =\nSSMG(l) −\
    \ SSMG(i)\nSSMG(i)\n(3)\nA positive value of ΨSSMG(l) meant that SSMG increased\
    \ between t(i) and t(l) and\na rainfall event was assumed to have occurred. On\
    \ the other hand, when the SSMG\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n15 of 36\nvalues\
    \ decreased or remained stable between two SAR acquisitions, it likely indicated\
    \ the\nabsence of precipitation or low precipitation amounts, resulting in negative\
    \ or null values\nof ΨSSMG(l). By contrast, as discussed in the previous sections,\
    \ increasing values of SSM\nat the plot scale (positive ΨSSMP(l)) could be attributed\
    \ to irrigation, rainfall (leading to\npositive ΨSSMG(l)), or a combination of\
    \ both. Therefore, a positive difference between\nΨSSMP(l) and ΨSSMG(l) (ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ − ΨSSMG(l) > 0) was assumed to signal the occurrence\nof plot-scale irrigations.\n\
    3.2. Optirrig Simulations\n3.2.1. Simulated SSM Evolution\nOptirrig simulates\
    \ the soil water balance and crop yield on a daily basis by combining\na soil\
    \ module and a crop module, assuming that water is the sole limiting factor. The\
    \ soil\nmodule comprises a three-reservoir system [57,84] that spans from the\
    \ surface layer to the\nmaximum rooting depth. The ﬁrst reservoir, with a shallow\
    \ depth of 10 cm, controls the\nwater balance at the soil surface. In this reservoir,\
    \ the evaporation demand is reduced for\nincreasing values of the leaf area index\
    \ (LAI), while the transpiration demand progressively\ntakes over by means of\
    \ a partitioning coefﬁcient. The second reservoir, referred to as R2,\naccounts\
    \ for the root section and its capacity expands as roots grow. Before the potential\
    \ root\narea is fully occupied by the second reservoir, the third reservoir represents\
    \ the remaining\nportion of the soil root zone. Initially, water is extracted\
    \ from the shallow reservoir (R1,\n10 cm deep) through evaporation, and subsequently,\
    \ the plant draws water exclusively\nfrom the second reservoir. Therefore, Optirrig\
    \ allows for the simulation of SSM at 10 cm\ndepth for different irrigation scenarios.\
    \ Those simulations serve to compare the effect of\ndifferent irrigation applications\
    \ on the SSM to the observed SSM from Sentinel-1, and thus,\nretrieve the irrigation\
    \ that leads to the same SSM behavior between SAR acquisitions.\nThe SSMr values\
    \ obtained from Optirrig for rainfed conditions are affected by rainfall\nonly,\
    \ while the SSM values derived from Sentinel-1 at the plot scale (SSMP) are affected\n\
    by rainfall and irrigation. In fact, the aim of this study was to detect potential\
    \ irrigation\nthat occurred between a SAR acquisition date (t(l) and the previous\
    \ date t(i)). Therefore, the\nrate of change of SSMr (ΨSSMr) between t(i) and\
    \ t(l) was computed in order to quantify the\neffect of rainfall alone on the\
    \ SSM:\nΨSSMr(l) =\nSSMr(l) − SSMr(i)\nSSMr(i)\n(4)\nThe approach assumed that\
    \ when there was an increase in SSMP between t(i) and t(l),\nresulting in a positive\
    \ rate of change (ΨSSMP(l), Equation (2)), it was mainly due to the\nrise in SSMP\
    \ caused by rainfall and/or irrigation. On the other hand, an increase in SSMr\n\
    values could indicate a rainfall event between the SAR acquisitions, leading to\
    \ a positive\nΨSSMr(l). Therefore, a ΨSSMP(l) value higher than the ΨSSMr(l) value\
    \ between t(i) and t(l),\nprovided indirect evidence of irrigation occurrence.\n\
    3.2.2. Inversion Approach for Irrigation Detection\nThe previous sections proposed\
    \ two criteria (Section 3.1.2: ΨSSMP(l) > ΨSSMG(l) and\nSection 3.2.1: ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ > ΨSSMr(l)) to seek the possible irrigation events I(j,k) having taken\nplace\
    \ at a date j between t(i) and t(l), with an amount given by the k index. However,\
    \ El Hajj\net al. [72] highlighted that the SSM is estimated with an accuracy\
    \ of 5 vol.%, which applies\nin our case to the SSM values estimated at the plot\
    \ scale (µSSMp = 5%). The uncertainty on\nΨSSMP will then depend on the uncertainties\
    \ in the measurements of SSMp at t(i) and t(l)\nas follows [94]:\nµ(l) = ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ ×\nv\nu\nu\nt\n \nµSSMP(l)\nSSMP(l)\n!2\n+\n \nµSSMP(i)\nSSMP(i)\n!2\n(5)\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n16 of 36\nFor instance, at the SAR acquisition date\
    \ t(l), a value of the SSMp is recorded as\nSSMP(l) = 25 vol.%. Furthermore, our\
    \ approach focuses on detecting the change in SSMP\nbetween t(l) and the previous\
    \ image date t(i), where SSMP(i) = 15 vol.%. As a result, the\nΨSSMp value is\
    \ determined using Equation (2) yielding ΨSSMP(l) ∼= 0.67. Subsequently,\nthe\
    \ error value on ΨSSMP(l) (µ(l)) is computed using Equation (5), with a calculated\n\
    value of µ(l) ∼= 0.26. The presence of too large uncertainties may hamper the\
    \ identiﬁ-\ncation of irrigation events from the previous arguments involving\
    \ the ΨSSMP(l) values\n(ΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMG(l) > 0 and ΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMr(l) > 0).\
    \ The following two conditions\nthus have to be met:\nΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMG(l) > µ(l)\n\
    (6)\nΨSSMP(l) − ΨSSMr(l) > µ(l)\n(7)\nMoreover, El Hajj et al. [48] and Ouaadi\
    \ et al. [44] highlighted that the effect of a rain\nor irrigation event on the\
    \ SAR backscattering coefﬁcient can last up to 3 days before the\ntotal dry-out\
    \ of the surface. It is essential to note that the duration of dry-out largely\
    \ relies\non the speciﬁc soil type and its inﬁltration characteristics, as well\
    \ as the vegetation cover.\nHence, an irrigation that occurred 3 days (n = 3)\
    \ before t(i) can have an effect on the change\nobserved in SSM between SSMP(I)\
    \ and SSMP(l), and therefore, on the computed ΨSSMP(l).\nFrom this point of view,\
    \ a light rain that occurred shortly before the acquisition could\nhave the same\
    \ signature as a signiﬁcant rain occurring 3 days before would. This means\nsearching\
    \ for an irrigation event that occurred at the j date between t(i)−3 and t(l).\
    \ As for the\npossible irrigation amounts, we restrained the set to realistic\
    \ values with three possibilities:\nk = 20, 30, or 40 mm. This produced the I(j,k)\
    \ combinations of dates and amounts to test,\nresulting in SSMR(j,k) values simulated\
    \ by Optirrig, and therefore, in ΨSSMR(j,k) values, for\neach I(j,k) between t(i)\
    \ and t(l):\nΨSSMR(j,k) =\nSSMR(l) − SSMR(i)\nSSMR(i)\n(8)\nThe most probable\
    \ irrigation combination between t(i) and t(l) was the I(j,k) that min-\nimized\
    \ the absolute value of the discrepancy between ΨSSMR(j,k) and ΨSSMP(l), which\n\
    was denoted |∆Ψ(j,k)|. Consequently, our goal was to ﬁnd the irrigation event\
    \ I(j,k) that\nminimized the difference between the ΨSSMR(j,k) and ΨSSMP(l) values.\
    \ By contrast, the\nhighest |∆Ψ(j,k)| values for a hypothesized I(j,k) event indicated\
    \ the lowest probability for\nI(j,k) to have occurred:\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j,k)\n\f\f\f\
    =\n\f\f\fΨSSMR(j,k) − ΨSSMP(l)\n\f\f\f\n(9)\nWhen trying to minimize the |∆Ψ(j,k)|\
    \ values, seeking |∆Ψ(j,k)| values as close to\nzero as possible, it is very likely\
    \ that both negative and positive values of ∆Ψ(j,k) will be\nencountered. A negative\
    \ ∆Ψ(j,k) (∆Ψ(j,k) < 0) occurs when the tested irrigation I(j,k) yields a\nΨSSMR(j,k)\
    \ lower than ΨSSMP(l). The negative value indicates a shortfall in the impact\
    \ of\nI(j,k) on ΨSSMR(j,k) when compared with ΨSSMP(l). Conversely, a positive\
    \ ∆Ψ(j,k) suggests\nthat the tested irrigation I(j,k) outperforms the ΨSSMP(l)\
    \ by leading to ΨSSMR(j,k) values\nhigher than ΨSSMP(l). This indicates a desire\
    \ to make the ∆Ψ(j,k) of an I(j,k) at j and ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\nof an I(j,k) at j + 1 comparable\
    \ and a change in sign occurs between ∆Ψ(j,k) and ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\nvalues, from negative\
    \ to positive (10) or from positive to negative (11):\n∆Ψ(j,k) < 0 And ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\
    \ ≥ 0\n(10)\n∆Ψ(j,k) > 0 And ∆Ψ(j+1,k) ≤ 0\n(11)\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n\
    17 of 36\nThis change in sign is a “necessary but not sufﬁcient condition” for\
    \ the detection of an\nirrigation event having taken place between t(i) and t(l),\
    \ as the magnitude of the change in\n∆Ψ(j,k) values also has to be compared with\
    \ the intrinsic uncertainties, which requires\n∆Ψ(j,k) < −µ(l) And ∆Ψ(j+1,k) ≥\
    \ −µ(l)\n(12)\n∆Ψ(j,k) > µ(l) And ∆Ψ(j+1,k) ≤ µ(l)\n(13)\nIn the last step, Equations\
    \ (12) and (13) establish the conditions for detecting an irriga-\ntion event\
    \ between two speciﬁc time points, namely, t(i) and t(l). These conditions involve\n\
    comparing the magnitudes of ∆Ψ(j,k) values with the intrinsic uncertainties represented\
    \ by\nµ(l). Equation (12) states that if ∆Ψ(j,k) is less than the negative intrinsic\
    \ uncertainty (−µ(l)),\nand ∆Ψ(j+1,k) is greater than or equal to −µ(l), it suggests\
    \ the possibility of an irrigation\nevent that occurred between t(i) and t(l).\
    \ In addition, Equation (13) implies that when the\ndifference ∆Ψ(j,k) is greater\
    \ than the positive intrinsic uncertainty (µ(l)), and the subsequent\ndifference\
    \ ∆Ψ(j+1,k) is less than or equal to µ(l), it indicates the potential occurrence\
    \ of an\nirrigation event between time points t(i) and t(l).\nTherefore, if either\
    \ condition (12) or (13) is met, the magnitudes of |∆Ψ(j,k)| and\n|∆Ψ(j+1,k)|\
    \ are compared. The one with the smallest value represents the most probable\n\
    combination of irrigation date and amount (I(j,k)). This means that if an irrigation\
    \ event\nis detected based on either condition, the comparison of the absolute\
    \ values helps to\ndetermine which I(j,k) is the most likely based on the smallest\
    \ difference in ∆Ψ values:\nI(j,k)opt = min(\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j,k)\n\f\f\f,\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j+1,k)\n\
    \f\f\f)\n(14)\nThe minimum value of |∆Ψ(j,k)| and |∆Ψ(j+1,k)| corresponds to the\
    \ irrigation event\nwith the highest likelihood in terms of the date and amount,\
    \ as it represents the irrigation\ncombination that caused the least discrepancy\
    \ in ∆Ψ (between ΨSSMR(j,k) and ΨSSMP(l)),\nconsidering the given uncertainties\
    \ µ(l).\n3.3. Workﬂow for the Detection of Irrigation Events\nFigure 5 provides\
    \ a comprehensive ﬂowchart of the proposed irrigation detection\nmethodology,\
    \ highlighting its key steps and processes. The approach aimed at retrieving\n\
    the irrigation dates and amounts between a SAR acquisition date (t(l)) and the\
    \ previous\ndate (t(i)). It is good to mention that SSM values derived from S1\
    \ SAR images acquired in\nthe ascending and descending modes were used independently.\
    \ For example, over the P1\nplot and at t(l) (SAR acquisition date) the detection\
    \ approach was applied between the SSM\nderived from ascending SAR time series\
    \ (MA1) at t(l) and the date of the previous image t(i)\nfrom the same time series,\
    \ at a ﬁxed interval of 6 days. For each plot and between t(l) and\nt(i), ten\
    \ primary indicators could be derived for the plot, as presented in Table 4.\n\
    The chain started with phase 1, which consisted of distinguishing the occurrence\
    \ or\nnot of an irrigation event. It was crucial to differentiate between rainfall\
    \ and irrigation\nevents, as both can cause changes in SSM values. To eliminate\
    \ the ambiguity between\nirrigation and rainfall events, two ﬁlters were implemented.\
    \ The ﬁrst ﬁlter compared the\nchange rate of SSM at the plot scale ΨSSMP(l) between\
    \ t(l) and t(i) with the rate of change\nof SSM at the grid scale (ΨSSMG(l)).\
    \ A higher value of ΨSSMP(l) indicated the presence of\nwater application apart\
    \ from rainfall.\nThe second ﬁlter involved a comparison between ΨSSMP(l) and\
    \ the simulated change\nrate of SSM without irrigation (ΨSSMr(l)). Similarly,\
    \ if ΨSSMP(l) was higher than ΨSSMr(l),\nit indicated the presence of a water\
    \ application other than rainfall. Once it was conﬁrmed\nthat an irrigation event\
    \ occurred, the approach moved to phase 2, which aimed to determine\nthe irrigation\
    \ date and amount between two SAR acquisitions.\nIn phase 2, irrigation combinations\
    \ of date j (ranging between t(i)−3 and t(l)) and dose\nk (I(j,k)) were entered\
    \ into Optirrig between t(i) and t(l). This resulted in simulated SSM\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n18 of 36\nvalues generated by Optirrig, and corresponding\
    \ change rates ΨSSMR(j,k)(l) were computed.\nThe objective was to ﬁnd the most\
    \ probable irrigation combination (I(j,k)opt) between t(i) and\nt(l) by minimizing\
    \ the absolute discrepancy between ΨSSMR(j,k)(l) and ΨSSMP(l) (|∆Ψ(j,k)(l)|).\n\

    \ the results of assessing the performance of the irrigation detection\napproach\
    \ discussed earlier by examining its capability to accurately retrieve irrigation\
    \ dates\nand amounts over the four reference plots. Three metrics were calculated\
    \ based on the\nconcepts of true positive, false positive, and false negative,\
    \ which are deﬁned as follows. A\n“probably detected irrigation” I(j,k) was classiﬁed\
    \ as a true positive (TP) if it was detected\nwithin three days of a real irrigation\
    \ date (dRe) collected during the ﬁeld trials. On the other\nhand, any probably\
    \ detected irrigation I(j,k) that deviated signiﬁcantly from these dates was\n\
    classiﬁed as a false positive (FP). Conversely, if an irrigation event was not\
    \ detected, it was\nconsidered a false negative (FN).\nThe methodology was applied\
    \ to SSM temporal series from the ascending (evening\noverpass) and descending\
    \ (morning overpass) SAR acquisitions separately due to diurnal\nvariations caused\
    \ by differences in vegetation water content between morning and evening.\nStudies\
    \ consistently showed that the radar backscattering coefﬁcient (σ0) is generally\
    \ higher\nin the morning overpass compared with the evening overpass [95,96].\
    \ As a result, it is\nrecommended to investigate each SAR temporal series separately,\
    \ with one acquired in the\nmorning and the other in the evening for each of the\
    \ four reference plots (Section 2.4). In\nother words, the method of irrigation\
    \ retrieval was employed by examining the variation\nin SSM between consecutive\
    \ SAR images, which were denoted as t(l) and the previous\nimage t(i), acquired\
    \ within the same SAR time series acquisition. It is important to note\nthat this\
    \ approach was applied, independently, to both the ascending and descending SAR\n\
    time series. Therefore, the time interval between two SSM observations was ﬁxed\
    \ at 6 days\n(t(l) − t(i) = 6 days, revisit time of S1).\nMoreover, there was\
    \ an overlap in the time span between t(i) and t(l) in both ascending\nand descending\
    \ temporal series, as the morning acquisition was only 36 h prior to the\nevening\
    \ acquisition. For example, the evaluation of irrigation retrieval was conducted\n\
    between the t(l) = 6 August 2017 SAR image acquired in the ascending mode and\
    \ the\ndate of the previous image t(i) = 31 July 2017. Similarly, in the descending\
    \ mode, another\nSAR image was acquired at t(l) = 5 August 2017 (36 h before the\
    \ evening image), with\nt(i) = 30 July 2017. Consequently, a real irrigation event\
    \ that occurred on 3 August 2017\ncould potentially be detected using either the\
    \ descending SAR image (t(l) = 5 August 2017)\nor the ascending SAR image (t(l)\
    \ = 6 August 2017). As a result, two dates of irrigation\ndetection could be recorded\
    \ for the same actual irrigation date. The retrieved irrigation date\nthat exhibited\
    \ the shortest time lapse between the real irrigation event and the retrieved\n\
    irrigation date was considered a true positive (TP).\nThe “Recall” (Re) was the\
    \ ﬁrst metric, representing the overall accuracy and sensitivity\nin detecting\
    \ irrigation dates (Equation (15)). It is calculated as TP divided by TP + FN\
    \ (all\nirrigation events). A low FN count favors a higher Re value, indicating\
    \ better irrigation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n20 of 36\ndate detection accuracy.\
    \ The “Precision” (Pn) was the second metric, deﬁned as the ratio\nof TP to TP\
    \ + FP (all detected events) (Equation (16)). False positive detections decrease\n\
    Pn, affecting the precision. The third metric calculated the harmonic mean of\
    \ recall and\nprecision, resulting in the F-score (Equation (17)). The F-score\
    \ enables comparison of the\nharmonic mean of Re and Pn in detecting irrigation\
    \ dates across multiple cases, providing\na balanced evaluation of the performance:\n\
    Recall =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False negative\n(15)\nPrecision =\nTrue\
    \ Positive\nTrue Positive + False positive\n(16)\nF-score = 2 × Recall × Precision\n\
    Recall + Precision\n(17)\nOnce the probable dates of irrigation were retrieved,\
    \ additional investigations were\nconducted to evaluate the detection of irrigation\
    \ amounts applied at the detected dates\nof irrigation (t(m)). To assess the accuracy\
    \ of the estimation, the mean absolute error\npercentage (MAE%) was calculated\
    \ by comparing the detected irrigation amounts (AD)\nwith the corresponding actual\
    \ (real) irrigation amounts (AR) over the t(m) for the four\nreference plots.\
    \ The MAE% quantiﬁes the average deviation between the estimated and\nactual irrigation\
    \ amounts, allowing for a seasonal assessment of the performance of the\nestimation\
    \ method:\nMAE% = 1\nn ×\n∑n\nt(m)|ADm − ARm|\nAR\n× 100\n(18)\nwhere t(m) is\
    \ the detected irrigation date; n is the total number of detected irrigation dates\n\
    (t(m)); AR is the average of the actual irrigation amounts; and ADm and ARm are\
    \ the detected\nand actual irrigation amounts, respectively, at t(m).\nA lower\
    \ MAE% indicates a higher level of accuracy in estimating the irrigation amount,\n\
    as the probable amounts closely align with the actual amounts applied. Conversely,\
    \ a higher\nMAE% suggests a larger discrepancy between the probable and actual\
    \ amounts.\n4. Results\n4.1. Detection of Irrigation Dates and Amounts\nThe proposed\
    \ methodology for detecting irrigation involved two main steps. First, the\nSSM\
    \ values derived from Sentinel-1 were analyzed at both the plot and grid scales\
    \ using\nspeciﬁc conditions, as described in Section 3.2.2, to determine whether\
    \ irrigation took place\nbetween two subsequent SAR images (phase 1). If irrigation\
    \ was detected, the second step\ninvolved simulating the SSM values with Optirrig,\
    \ considering various combinations of\nirrigation dates and amounts. The goal\
    \ was to ﬁnd the combination that best matched the\nobserved and simulated SSM\
    \ value changes (phase 2).\nPhase 1 consisted of applying two ﬁlters to distinguish\
    \ between irrigation and rainfall\nevents. The ﬁrst ﬁlter compared the plot-scale\
    \ SSM change rate (ΨSSMP) with grid-scale\nchange rate (ΨSSMG) and the second\
    \ ﬁlter compared ΨSSMP with ΨSSMr (rate of change\nof SSM simulated using Optirrig\
    \ with no irrigation). Previous sections explored two\nirrigation detection conditions\
    \ based on the difference observed between ΨSSMP and\nΨSSMG (Equation (6)), as\
    \ well as ΨSSMr (Equation (7)). In order to identify the occurrence\nof an irrigation\
    \ event, ΨSSMP − ΨSSMG and ΨSSMP − ΨSSMr have to show values higher\nthan the\
    \ error on ΨSSMP (µ(l), Equation (5)).\nFigure 6 shows an example of the detection\
    \ of irrigation occurrence between the\nt(l) date of SAR acquisition and t(i)−3,\
    \ where real irrigation was recorded (represented\nby blue dashed vertical lines),\
    \ for the four reference plots: P1 at t(l) = 6 August 2017\n(Figure 6a), P2 (Figure\
    \ 6c) at t(l) = 30 June 2018, P3 at t(l) = 30 July 2019 (Figure 6e), and P4\n\
    at t(l) = 13 July 2020 (Figure 6g). The blue, green, and red horizontal dash lines\
    \ represent\nΨSSMP, ΨSSMG, and ΨSSMr, respectively, between t(l) and t(i). To\
    \ provide context, daily\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n21 of 36\nprecipitation\

    \ additional\ndata help to understand the relationship between the ΨSSMG and ΨSSMr\
    \ values and\nrainfall events. Figure 6a,c,e,g illustrate that when there was\
    \ low or no precipitation, both\nΨSSMG and ΨSSMr exhibited a slight decrease or\
    \ remained stable. Concurrently, in all\nfour cases documented, ΨSSMP demonstrated\
    \ higher values than both ΨSSMG and ΨSSMr.\nThis observed difference, which exceeded\
    \ the error margin of ΨSSMP (µ(l)), conﬁrming\nthe conditions in Equations (6)\
    \ and (7) were met, which served as evidence of irrigation\noccurrence in the\

    \ indicates the value of the error on ΨSSMP.\nIn phase 2, when an irrigation occurrence\

    \ to determine the probable date and amount of irrigation.\nThis involved simulating\
    \ the ΨSSMR(j,k) (black lines) for each irrigation combination (I(j,k)),\nwhere\
    \ the date j ranged from t(i)−3 to t(l), and the tested amount k was set to 20,\

    \ in Figure 6b,d,f,h for each of the\nexamples where irrigation occurrence was\
    \ suspected in phase 1 (Figure 6a,c,e,g).\nFor instance, an occurrence of irrigation\
    \ was identiﬁed between t(i) = 31 July 2017 and\nt(l) = 6 August 2017, with ascending\
    \ SAR image dates (Figure 6a). A detailed analysis was\ncarried out in Figure\
    \ 6b to determine the speciﬁc irrigation date and amount that probably\noccurred\
    \ between t(i)−3 and t(l). This investigation involved examining the changes in\n\
    ∆Ψ(j,k) for different irrigation dates j ranging from 28 July 2017 to 5 August\
    \ 2017, and k\namounts of 20, 30, and 40 mm to compare ∆Ψ(j,k) values to the error\
    \ on ΨSSMP (µ(l)). It is\nimportant to note that the error on ΨSSMP between t(i)\
    \ and t(l) was µ(l) = 0.068.\nConcerning the plot P1 (Figure 6a,b), on the date\
    \ j = 31 July 2017, the observed values\nof ∆Ψ(j,k) ranged from −0.71 for k =\
    \ 20 mm to −0.76 for k = 30 and 40 mm, all of which were\nlower than −µ(l). This\
    \ discrepancy could be attributed to signiﬁcantly lower ΨSSMR(j,k)\nvalues compared\
    \ with ΨSSMP (∆Ψ(j,k) < −µ(l)) observed at j in Figure 6a. Furthermore,\non j\
    \ + 1 = 1 August 2017, the ∆Ψ(j+1,k) values exhibited positive values greater\
    \ than −µ(l)\n(∆Ψ(j+1,k) = 0.22 > −µ(l)) for k = 20, 30, and 40 mm. This satisﬁed\
    \ one of the criteria for\nidentifying the most likely irrigation event (I(j,k)),\
    \ as stated in Equation (12) (∆Ψ(j,k) < −µ(l)\nand ∆Ψ(j+1,k) ≥ −µ(l)).\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be concluded that an irrigation event occurred between j = 31 July 2018\n\
    and j + 1 = 1 August 2017. To determine the most probable irrigation date (I(j,k)opt)\
    \ the irriga-\ntion combination (I(j,k)) leading to the smallest absolute value\
    \ between ∆Ψ(j,k) and ∆Ψ(j+1,k)\nwas identiﬁed, as described in Equation (14)\
    \ (I(j,k)opt = min(\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j,k)\n\f\f\f,\n\f\f\f∆Ψ(j+1,k)\n\f\f\f)). Accord-\n\
    ingly, since |∆Ψ(j+1,k)| = 0.22 (regardless of the amount k) is smaller than |∆Ψ(j,k)|\
    \ = 0.71\nfor k = 20 mm and |∆Ψ(j,k)| = 0.76 for k = 30 and 40 mm, the irrigation\
    \ date j + 1 = 1 Au-\ngust 2017 was identiﬁed as the most probable date of I(j,k)opt.\
    \ However, the analysis of\n∆Ψ(j+1,k) did not reveal any discernible variations\
    \ across different irrigation amounts k = 20,\n30, and 40 mm, making it impossible\
    \ to identify irrigation amounts beyond k = 20 mm.\nIn Figure 6b, the actual irrigation\
    \ date, marked in blue, was 3 August 2017. Therefore,\nthe detected irrigation\
    \ date (1 August 2017) had a time difference of 2 days compared with\nthe actual\
    \ date.\nBased on the reasoning above, for the remaining three cases over P2 (Figure\
    \ 6c,d), P3\n(Figure 6e,f), and P4 (Figure 6g,h), the actual irrigation dates\
    \ were successfully detected\nwith a time lapse of 1 day from the actual irrigation\
    \ dates:\n•\nFor P2: The detected irrigation date was 26 June 2018 and the actual\
    \ date was 27 June 2018;\n•\nFor P3: The detected irrigation date was 25 July\
    \ 2019 and the actual date was 24 July 2019;\n•\nFor P4: The detected irrigation\
    \ date was 8 July 2020 and the actual date was 9 July 2020.\nFurthermore, it is\
    \ noteworthy that the detected irrigation amounts for the P2, P3, and\nP4 plots\
    \ were consistently k = 20 mm. This demonstrates that the analysis did not identify\n\
    any discernible differences in the ∆Ψ(j,k) values when testing irrigations with\
    \ different\namounts (k = 20, 30, and 40 mm) at the detected irrigation dates.\n\
    4.2. Irrigation Events Detection Performance\nThe performance of the irrigation\
    \ dates detection was evaluated using the accuracy\nmetrics (recall, precision,\
    \ and F-score) across the four reference plots. The irrigation\ndetection approach\
    \ yielded varying levels of accuracy across different plots (Figure 7).\nRemote\

    \ ten dRe over P1, four each over P2 and P3, and three over P4. \nTo ensure operational\
    \ eﬀectiveness, it is important to not only identify irrigation \ndates but also\
    \ estimate the irrigation amounts. Therefore, we conducted a comparison be-\n\
    tween the detected amounts (AD) and the actual amounts (AR) on the P1, P2, P3,\
    \ and P4 \nplots over the irrigation dates detected using the SSM derived from\
    \ SAR temporal series \nin the ascending and descending modes. In Figure 8, both\
    \ the detected dates and irrigation \namounts were presented alongside the real\
    \ ﬁeld data. The ﬁgure illustrates all observed \nSentinel-2 NDVI values, categorizing\
    \ them based on the vegetative or reproductive stages. \nIt also highlights instances\
    \ of missed irrigation detection, false detections, and correct de-\ntections.\
    \ Within Figure 8, grey and yellow bars correspond to the real and detected irriga-\n\
    tion amounts, respectively. Thus, a true irrigation date detection is represented\
    \ when a \nyellow bar is positioned over a grey bar for each actual irrigation\
    \ date. Conversely, a false \nirrigation detection (false positive) is indicated\
    \ by a single yellow bar, indicating that our \napproach detected irrigation on\
    \ a date that did not correspond with an actual irrigation \nevent. Likewise,\
    \ an undetected irrigation date (false negative) is represented by a single \n\
    grey bar, indicating that our approach failed to detect an irrigation date. \n\
    In the present study, Figure 8 displays only three instances of false positive\
    \ date de-\ntections, speciﬁcally in Figure 8a on the date 01 July (DOY = 182),\
    \ in Figure 8c on the date \n20 August (DOY = 233), and in Figure 8d on the date\
    \ 19 August (DOY = 232). Moreover, \nthe analysis revealed the failure to detect\
    \ four irrigation events. Among these undetected \nevents, three occurred in Figure\
    \ 8a on the dates 11 August, 22 August, and 26 September \n(DOYs = 223, 234, 269),\
    \ while the fourth one took place in Figure 8b on the date 05 August \n(DOY =\
    \ 217). \nThese results illustrate one of the inherent limitations of the approach\
    \ employed, \nwhich relies on the progressive growth of crop cover, as indicated\
    \ by the ascending dy-\nnamics of NDVI, along with the revisit time of the SAR\
    \ data. This limitation explains the \noccurrence of false detections during the\
    \ reproductive stage and the missed detections of \nactual irrigation events.\
    \ The reliance on crop cover development and the timing of SAR \nobservations\
    \ introduced constraints on the accuracy of the detection method (see the Dis-\n\
    cussion section). \nNext, the investigation focused on analyzing the changes in\
    \ ΔΨ(j,k) over the detected \nirrigation dates (t(m)) to gain insights into the\
    \ applied amounts of irrigation water. Among \nFigure 7. The accuracy metrics\

    \ to conduct a seasonal assessment of the irrigation \namounts to provide insights\
    \ into the performance of the amount-detection method \nthroughout the season.\

    \ the detected irrigation amounts (AD) with the corresponding actual \n(real)\
    \ irrigation amounts (AR) for all the detected irrigation dates (t(m)) in the\
    \ four reference \nplots. A lower MAE% indicates a higher level of accuracy in\
    \ estimating the irrigation \namounts, indicating a close alignment between the\
    \ estimated and actual amounts applied. \nConversely, a higher MAE% suggests a\
    \ larger discrepancy between the estimated and ac-\ntual amounts. Based on the\
    \ obtained results, a MAE% of 16.4% was achieved for the P1 \nplot in Montpellier,\
    \ indicating relatively high accuracy in estimating the irrigation \namounts.\
    \ The estimated amounts closely matched the actual amounts applied in this plot.\
    \ \nHowever, for the Tarbes plots (P2, P3, and P4), a MAE% of 50% was obtained,\

    \ (recall), with\n88% accuracy among the detected dates (precision). The F-score,\
    \ which is a combined\nmeasure of precision and recall, achieved a satisfactory\
    \ value of 78%, indicating a reasonably\nbalanced performance in identifying irrigated\
    \ areas. In P2, the recall was slightly higher\nat 75%, indicating that 25% of\
    \ the irrigated areas were not correctly detected. However,\nthe precision was\
    \ 100%, meaning that all the identiﬁed irrigated events were accurate.\nThe associated\
    \ F-score was 86%, indicating a good overall performance with a trade-off\nbetween\
    \ recall and precision. For P3 and P4, both exhibited a high recall of 100%, indicating\n\
    that all irrigated events were correctly identiﬁed. However, the precision varied\
    \ between\n80% for P3 and 75% for P4, suggesting that 20% to 25% of the detected\
    \ irrigated areas were\nfalse positives. The F-scores were 89% for P3 and 86%\
    \ for P4, demonstrating a good overall\nperformance with a slightly higher emphasis\
    \ on recall. These results highlight the strengths\nof the approach, providing\
    \ valuable insights for improving the accuracy and reliability of\nirrigation\
    \ date detection. The accuracy of the irrigation dates detection was impacted\
    \ by\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n26 of 36\nthe presence of false detections,\
    \ primarily attributed to the low accuracy of SSM estimation\nunder dense vegetation\
    \ covers and/or the SAR revisit time (see the Discussion section).\nTo ensure\
    \ operational effectiveness, it is important to not only identify irrigation dates\n\
    but also estimate the irrigation amounts. Therefore, we conducted a comparison\
    \ between\nthe detected amounts (AD) and the actual amounts (AR) on the P1, P2,\
    \ P3, and P4 plots\nover the irrigation dates detected using the SSM derived from\
    \ SAR temporal series in\nthe ascending and descending modes. In Figure 8, both\
    \ the detected dates and irrigation\namounts were presented alongside the real\
    \ ﬁeld data. The ﬁgure illustrates all observed\nSentinel-2 NDVI values, categorizing\
    \ them based on the vegetative or reproductive stages.\nIt also highlights instances\
    \ of missed irrigation detection, false detections, and correct\ndetections. Within\
    \ Figure 8, grey and yellow bars correspond to the real and detected\nirrigation\
    \ amounts, respectively. Thus, a true irrigation date detection is represented\
    \ when\na yellow bar is positioned over a grey bar for each actual irrigation\
    \ date. Conversely, a false\nirrigation detection (false positive) is indicated\
    \ by a single yellow bar, indicating that our\napproach detected irrigation on\
    \ a date that did not correspond with an actual irrigation\nevent. Likewise, an\
    \ undetected irrigation date (false negative) is represented by a single\ngrey\
    \ bar, indicating that our approach failed to detect an irrigation date.\nIn the\
    \ present study, Figure 8 displays only three instances of false positive date\n\
    detections, speciﬁcally in Figure 8a on the date 01 July (DOY = 182), in Figure\
    \ 8c on the date\n20 August (DOY = 233), and in Figure 8d on the date 19 August\
    \ (DOY = 232). Moreover,\nthe analysis revealed the failure to detect four irrigation\
    \ events. Among these undetected\nevents, three occurred in Figure 8a on the dates\
    \ 11 August, 22 August, and 26 September\n(DOYs = 223, 234, 269), while the fourth\
    \ one took place in Figure 8b on the date 5 August\n(DOY = 217).\nThese results\
    \ illustrate one of the inherent limitations of the approach employed, which\n\
    relies on the progressive growth of crop cover, as indicated by the ascending\
    \ dynamics of\nNDVI, along with the revisit time of the SAR data. This limitation\
    \ explains the occurrence of\nfalse detections during the reproductive stage and\
    \ the missed detections of actual irrigation\nevents. The reliance on crop cover\
    \ development and the timing of SAR observations\nintroduced constraints on the\
    \ accuracy of the detection method (see the Discussion section).\nNext, the investigation\
    \ focused on analyzing the changes in ∆Ψ(j,k) over the detected\nirrigation dates\
    \ (t(m)) to gain insights into the applied amounts of irrigation water. Among\n\
    the detected irrigation dates, a dose of k = 20 mm was identiﬁed as the most probable\n\
    amount of irrigation for ﬁve occurrences and k = 30 mm for two occurrences out\
    \ of a total\nof seven detected irrigation dates out of the 10 actual irrigation\
    \ dates. In the case of plots P2,\nP3, and P4, a dose of k = 20 mm was detected\
    \ for all the detected irrigation dates. However,\nthe detected irrigation amounts\
    \ underestimated the real irrigation amounts in most cases.\nTherefore, it could\
    \ be valuable to conduct a seasonal assessment of the irrigation\namounts to provide\
    \ insights into the performance of the amount-detection method through-\nout the\
    \ season. The MAE% (Equation (18)) served as a measure of the average deviation\n\
    between the detected irrigation amounts (AD) with the corresponding actual (real)\
    \ irrigation\namounts (AR) for all the detected irrigation dates (t(m)) in the\
    \ four reference plots. A lower\nMAE% indicates a higher level of accuracy in\
    \ estimating the irrigation amounts, indicating\na close alignment between the\
    \ estimated and actual amounts applied. Conversely, a higher\nMAE% suggests a\
    \ larger discrepancy between the estimated and actual amounts. Based\non the obtained\
    \ results, a MAE% of 16.4% was achieved for the P1 plot in Montpellier,\nindicating\
    \ relatively high accuracy in estimating the irrigation amounts. The estimated\n\
    amounts closely matched the actual amounts applied in this plot. However, for\
    \ the Tarbes\nplots (P2, P3, and P4), a MAE% of 50% was obtained, indicating a\
    \ larger discrepancy\nbetween the estimated and actual amounts. The estimation\
    \ method exhibited a lower level\nof accuracy in these plots, with more signiﬁcant\
    \ deviations between the estimated and\nactual amounts applied.\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2023, 15, 4081\n27 of 36\n5. Discussion\nThe methodology aimed to determine\
    \ irrigation dates and amounts at the plot level by\nintegrating surface soil\
    \ moisture (SSM) data obtained from Sentinel-1 (SSMS1) into Optirrig\nusing an\
    \ inversion technique. To achieve this, we compared the change in SSMS1 between\n\
    two Sentinel-1 SAR acquisition dates, namely, t(l) and the previous date t(i),\
    \ with the change\nin SSM simulated by Optirrig under various combinations of\
    \ irrigation dates and amounts\n(I(j,k), where j represents the date and k represents\
    \ the amount) injected into the model.\nThe analysis that produced the results\
    \ presented in the previous sections focused on\ndetermining irrigation dates\
    \ and amounts for which the disparity between the change\nin SSM predictions and\
    \ simulations between two SAR observations (i) was minimized,\naiming for a value\
    \ as close to zero as possible, and (ii) met speciﬁc criteria by demonstrating\n\
    signiﬁcant changes between the SSM simulated for different irrigation scenarios\
    \ in Optirrig\nand its difference with the SSM obtained from Sentinel-1 data.\
    \ These criteria were applied\nusing a change detection approach commonly used\
    \ in signal analysis and remote sensing\napplications. For a more detailed understanding\
    \ of the process of inversion and the\nspeciﬁc selection criteria utilized to\
    \ detect irrigation events, please refer to Figure 6 and its\naccompanying explanations.\n\
    The method yielded signiﬁcant results, highlighting the value and interest in\
    \ combin-\ning SSM derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data and Optirrig SSM simulations.\
    \ This combination\ndemonstrated the potential beneﬁts of detecting irrigation\
    \ events over maize plots. How-\never, there were limitations to detecting irrigation\
    \ events through the combined use of\nSSMS1 and Optirrig SSM simulations, which\
    \ could result in both missed (false negative)\nand false positive irrigation\
    \ detections, between two SAR observations. These limitations\nprimarily stemmed\
    \ from four factors: (1) the 6-day temporal resolution of the Sentinel-1\nSAR\
    \ being insufﬁcient to detect all the irrigation events, (2) heavy rainfall and\
    \ soil satura-\ntion, (3) the limit of penetration of the C-band SAR signal in\
    \ dense vegetation cover, and\n(4) farmer’s irrigation practices.\n5.1. Sentinel-1\
    \ Revisit Time\nFirst, these limitations were inﬂuenced by the soil texture, ﬁeld\
    \ capacity, and rapid\ndrying of the soil, which could impact the effectiveness\
    \ of irrigation event detection. The\nrapid drying of the soil necessitated a\
    \ sensor with a higher temporal resolution to detect\nquick changes in soil moisture\
    \ content, such as an increase due to irrigation followed by a\ndecrease due to\
    \ drying. Previous studies conﬁrmed the importance of a maximum time\ndelay of\
    \ three days between an irrigation event and the subsequent SAR image to accurately\n\
    detect the event’s impact on the SAR backscattering signal [44,48]. Beyond this\
    \ timeframe,\nit becomes challenging to detect the effect of an irrigation event.\
    \ The temporal resolution\nof the S1 SAR should ideally be no more than three\
    \ days for a more effective irrigation\ndetection [16,43].\nThe 6-day revisit\
    \ time of the S1 SAR constellation poses a signiﬁcant challenge in\ndetecting\
    \ irrigation events due to the rapid dry-out of certain soil surfaces, as previously\n\
    mentioned. It also creates difﬁculties in distinguishing the effects of rainfall\
    \ and irrigation\nevents, especially in the worst-case scenario, where both rain\
    \ and irrigation occur between\nthe same two consecutive acquisition dates. The\
    \ increase in SSM values after rainfall and\nirrigation may be similar, even for\
    \ different amounts, which makes it even more difﬁcult. In\nthe speciﬁc case described\
    \ in the P2 plot (Figure 8b), there was a missed irrigation detection\non 5 August\
    \ 2018 following a heavy rainfall event (∼=33 mm) on 2 August 2018, which\nlikely\
    \ caused a signiﬁcant increase in soil moisture, resulting in high SSM values.\
    \ This\nmissed detection could be attributed to the method’s inability to effectively\
    \ distinguish\nbetween the impact of the heavy rainfall and the irrigation. As\
    \ a result, the occurrence\nof the irrigation event went undetected, leading to\
    \ a false negative detection. It is worth\nnoting that this particular case was\
    \ observed only once in the analysis due to the applied\nﬁlters and methods used\
    \ to distinguish between rainfall and irrigation events. These ﬁlters\ninvolved\
    \ analyzing Optirrig SSM simulations and SSM at both plot and grid scales, as\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n28 of 36\ndescribed in Section 3. Unfortunately,\
    \ due to an anomaly affecting S1B, the revisit time for\nS1 SAR data has increased\
    \ from 6 days to 12 days, as only S1A remains operational. This\nreduced revisit\
    \ frequency presents a challenge for SSM estimation frequency and accurate\nirrigation\
    \ detection and monitoring. To address this challenge, an effective strategy involves\n\
    integrating SSM estimations from other SAR data sources. Collaborating with SAR\
    \ satellites\nlike ALOS PALSAR, RADARSAT, and COSMO-SkyMed can provide supplementary\
    \ SSM\ndata, effectively augmenting the frequency of observations. Additionally,\
    \ leveraging the\nbeneﬁts of small- or micro-SAR satellites, which can be launched\
    \ in constellations, offers\na promising solution. These satellites provide increased\
    \ revisit frequencies and higher\nspatial resolutions, which are essential for\
    \ capturing frequent and detailed observations\nof irrigation patterns and soil\
    \ moisture dynamics. By combining the data from different\nSAR sources, both large\
    \ and small, a more comprehensive dataset covering a broader\nrange of time intervals\
    \ and spatial scales can be created. This integrated approach can\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ enhance the potential for the precise analysis of irrigation patterns and soil\n\
    moisture dynamics, despite the limitations imposed by the reduced revisit time.\
    \ Moreover,\nthere is promising news on the horizon—the launch of a new constellation\
    \ of SAR satellites,\nnamely, Sentinel-1C, is planned for the end of 2023. Once\
    \ operational, Sentinel-1C is\nexpected to mitigate the revisit time challenge\
    \ by providing more frequent observations,\nbolstering the accuracy of irrigation\
    \ detection and soil moisture estimation efforts.\n5.2. Climatic and Soil Conditions\n\
    Optirrig SSM simulations were crucial in differentiating rainfall and irrigation\
    \ events.\nIn the present study, the observed SSM changes derived from the S1\
    \ data at the plot and\ngrid scales were compared with the simulated SSM changes\
    \ from Optirrig under rainfall\nconditions. This comparison provided valuable\
    \ insights into the expected SSM values,\nallowing for the accurate interpretation\
    \ of S1 data and avoiding irrigation misinterpreta-\ntions. However, Optirrig\
    \ ﬁlter effectiveness may vary depending on speciﬁc cases, and the\ncontext and\
    \ limitations should be considered.\nIndeed, heavy rainfall can also lead to false\
    \ positive irrigation detection, particularly\nin situations where there is a\
    \ moderately developed maize cover that restricts soil evap-\noration [97]. This\
    \ effect is particularly pronounced during the early vegetative stage and\nlate\
    \ reproductive stages of maize growth when the vegetation cover is not dense enough\n\
    to attenuate the SAR signal (NDVI < 0.7) [49], and thus, allow for effective monitoring\
    \ of\nthe underlying SSM. During this period, the moderately dense vegetation\
    \ canopy acts as a\nbarrier, limiting the evaporation of soil moisture. In this\
    \ context, if a heavy rainfall event\noccurs, the soil can become saturated with\
    \ water, which means that the soil has reached its\nmaximum water-holding capacity\
    \ and cannot absorb any more moisture. As a result, the\nsoil remains wet even\
    \ after the rainfall has ceased. When using Optirrig SSM simulations,\nwhich estimate\
    \ SSM levels based on rainfall inputs, simulations may not exhibit signiﬁcant\n\
    changes between two consecutive SAR acquisition dates when soil saturation occurs.\
    \ This\nis because the simulations account for the limited capacity of the soil\
    \ to absorb additional\nmoisture beyond saturation. In fact, the detection of\
    \ irrigation amounts was found to\nbe less efﬁcient for the plots in the humid\
    \ climate of Tarbes (P2, P3, and P4) compared\nwith the “semi-arid” climate of\
    \ Montpellier (P1). For the P1 plot, the estimation of the\nseasonal irrigation\
    \ amounts exhibited a relatively high accuracy, with a mean absolute error\npercentage\
    \ (MAE%) of 16.4%. In contrast, for the P2, P3, and P4 plots in the humid climate,\n\
    a higher MAE% of 50% was obtained, suggesting a larger discrepancy between the\
    \ detected\nand actual amounts of irrigation. This discrepancy was likely due\
    \ to the challenges posed\nby the humid climate, where heavy rainfall events can\
    \ contribute to soil saturation, thereby\naffecting the accuracy of irrigation\
    \ detection and amount estimation. The effectiveness of\nthe irrigation detection\
    \ approach, particularly in estimating irrigation amounts, appears\nto be inﬂuenced\
    \ by the local climate conditions, with the humid climate introducing addi-\n\
    tional complexities. Moreover, SSMS1 values at the plot scale may remain high\
    \ due to the\nwater content in the saturated soil, where evaporation and rapid\
    \ dry-out are restrained. In\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n29 of 36\nfact, the\
    \ S1 SAR signal is sensitive to the presence of water in the soil, resulting in\
    \ elevated\nSSM values. However, at the grid scale (10 km × 10 km), SSM values\
    \ calculated over bare\nsoils may show stability or decrease since bare soil areas\
    \ have higher evaporative capacities\ncompared with plots with developed maize\
    \ cover. In such situations, the method used for\nirrigation detection may interpret\
    \ the observed increase in SSM variation at the plot scale\nas an indication of\
    \ irrigation occurrence. In other words, Optirrig simulations for rain-fed\nconditions\
    \ may not show substantial SSM changes, and the S1 SSM values at the plot scale\n\
    may remain high, leading to false irrigation detection. In the study, three false\
    \ positive\nirrigation detections were observed after relatively heavy rainfall\
    \ events, speciﬁcally over\nP1 on 01-Jul (DOY = 182), P3 on 20 August (DOY = 232),\
    \ and P4 on 19 August (DOY = 232).\nThese false positive detections occurred due\
    \ to the restrained evaporation of soil moisture\nunder developed maize cover\
    \ (NDVI values that ranged from 0.6 to 0.7), which resulted in\nhigh SSM values\
    \ that were mistaken as indications of irrigation occurrence.\n5.3. C-Band SAR\
    \ Signal Penetration through Dense Vegetation Cover\nThe limited penetration of\
    \ the C-band SAR signal through dense vegetation cover\nhas a direct impact on\
    \ the effectiveness of irrigation detection using Sentinel-1 SAR data.\nThe method\
    \ proposed in this study relies on analyzing the change of SSM derived from S1\n\
    data and SSM simulations through Optirrig to identify irrigation events. However,\
    \ when\nthe SAR signal is impeded by dense vegetation, the accurate estimation\
    \ of SSM becomes\nchallenging. This limitation arises from the S1 signal’s inability\
    \ to penetrate through\nvegetation and reach the surface soil. Research conducted\
    \ by El Hajj et al. [49] focused\non the penetration of the C-band SAR signal\
    \ across different plots of maize, wheat, and\ngrassland. Their ﬁndings revealed\
    \ that the C-band SAR signal’s penetration is limited to an\nNDVI value of 0.7.\
    \ Therefore, dense vegetation cover can hinder the detection of irrigation\nevents\
    \ due to the SAR signal’s limited sensitivity to surface soil moisture. Therefore,\
    \ if the\nC-band SAR signal is unable to penetrate dense vegetation, the estimated\
    \ SSM values may\nnot adequately represent the irrigation-induced changes in soil\
    \ moisture. Consequently,\nthe threshold criteria, which were based on S1 and\
    \ Optirrig SSM simulations, used in this\nmethod to identify irrigation events\
    \ (Section 3.2.2) may not be met, resulting in missed\ndetections or false negative\
    \ results. In our case, missed detections were observed for peak\nNDVI values\
    \ between 0.7 and 0.8 over the P1 and P2 plots (Figure 8a,b). These ﬁndings\n\
    are consistent with the results obtained by El Hajj et al. [48] for grassland\
    \ plots and Le\nPage et al. [43] for maize plots. Both studies highlight the limitations\
    \ of irrigation detection\nover dense vegetation cover (NDVI > 0.7) due to the\
    \ restricted penetration of the C-band\nSAR signal.\n5.4. Farmer’s Irrigation\
    \ Practice Variability\nOne additional reason for missed or false negative detections\
    \ of irrigation events is\nthe variation in farmers’ irrigation practices, particularly\
    \ in terms of timing and quantity.\nIt is likely that the accurate detection of\
    \ irrigation is hindered because farmers do not\nalways follow the irrigation\
    \ decisions based on a soil water balance and exact crop water\nrequirements or\
    \ decisions that could be advised by Optirrig, including triggers, criteria,\n\
    and doses. Instead, their irrigation decisions are inﬂuenced by a combination\
    \ of factors,\nincluding their experience, local knowledge, and perceptions of\
    \ water availability. They\nmay prioritize ensuring an adequate water supply to\
    \ the crops, leading to irrigation\namounts that exceed the exact crop water requirements.\
    \ For instance, it appeared to be\nchallenging to detect the last irrigation applied\
    \ on 26-Sep (DOY = 269) over the P1 plot.\nThis irrigation event may not be deemed\
    \ necessary from the water balance perspective\nof Optirrig, but farmers still\
    \ apply it for reasons such as grain ﬁlling or to prevent soil\ncrusting [98].\
    \ On the other hand, Optirrig relies on a soil water balance equation to simulate\n\
    and predict the soil moisture content in the root zone of the crops. This equation\
    \ takes into\naccount factors such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil\
    \ characteristics, and irrigation\nevents to estimate the water balance in the\
    \ soil. Therefore, when testing different irrigation\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n\
    30 of 36\ndates and amounts, Optirrig determines the exact SSM induced by the\
    \ irrigation and other\nwater sources (rainfall), which may not align precisely\
    \ with farmers’ irrigation timing and\nthe amounts they apply. In the present\
    \ study, we consistently noticed that the detected\nirrigation amounts in the\
    \ four plots (P1, P2, P3, and P4) were consistently lower than\nthe actual irrigation\
    \ amounts applied by the farmers in the ﬁeld. This indicates a case\nof underestimation\
    \ or missed detection of irrigation events. This discrepancy between\nfarmers’\
    \ actual irrigation practices and the detected irrigation amounts can explain\
    \ the low\naccuracy of detecting real irrigation amounts (which is somehow expected\
    \ as Optirrig is\nused here as a tool for analysis, not for recommendations).\
    \ Farmers tend to overestimate\ncrop water requirements and apply higher levels\
    \ of irrigation that do not match the exact\ncrop water needs.\n5.5. Uncertainties\
    \ Associated with Optirrig’s Simulations\nIn a broader context, the SSM simulations\
    \ in Optirrig are subject to inherent uncertain-\nties, which can impact the accuracy\
    \ of irrigation detection. These uncertainties arise from\nseveral factors, including\
    \ the variability in input parameters and the temporal dynamics of\nvegetation\
    \ [99,100]. In fact, the accuracy of SSM simulations depends on the availability\n\
    and quality of input parameters, such as soil properties, vegetation characteristics,\
    \ and\nmeteorological data [101]. However, these parameters can vary spatially\
    \ and temporally,\nleading to uncertainties in the simulations [102]. Moreover,\
    \ the temporal dynamics of\nvegetation, including growth stages, leaf area index,\
    \ and canopy density, can also introduce\nuncertainties in SSM simulations. Vegetation\
    \ plays a crucial role in the water balance of\nthe soil–plant–atmosphere system,\
    \ as it affects evapotranspiration rates and soil moisture\ndepletion in crop\
    \ models [103], such as Optirrig. However, accurately representing the\ndynamics\
    \ of vegetation within the model is challenging. Changes in vegetation charac-\n\
    teristics over time can lead to variations in evapotranspiration rates and water\
    \ uptake by\nplants, impacting the simulated SSM values [104] and potentially\
    \ affecting the detection\nof irrigation events. To mitigate these uncertainties,\
    \ there is growing interest in incorpo-\nrating multiple external and independent\
    \ data, such as radar and optical data, in various\nirrigation mapping, detection,\
    \ and crop monitoring approaches [105,106]. In a recent study,\nNie et al. [107]\
    \ demonstrated the potential of using remotely sensed vegetation and soil\nmoisture\
    \ observations (MODIS LAI and SMAP data) to constrain irrigation estimation in\n\
    the Noah-MP land surface model. Results have shown that incorporating these constraints\n\
    reduces model sensitivity to irrigation parameterization, improves characterization\
    \ of\nirrigation patterns and their effects on evapotranspiration and soil moisture,\
    \ and corrects\nfor vegetation conditions and irrigation timing. This approach\
    \ highlights the importance\nof utilizing remotely sensed data for irrigation\
    \ detection and provides a less engineered\nmethod to constrain irrigation modeling\
    \ uncertainty. The integration of several remote\nsensing data sources aims to\
    \ inform crop models and reduce uncertainties associated with\nirrigation estimation.\
    \ In the present case, incorporating both radar data for soil surface\nmoisture\
    \ estimates and optical data, such as LAI observations, into the inversion process\n\
    would likely yield substantial beneﬁts. By combining these data, it becomes possible\
    \ to\nconstrain both the water balance and crop growth schemes of Optirrig. This\
    \ approach\nenhances the accuracy and reliability of the crop model, enabling\
    \ improved detection of\nirrigation events and more precise estimation of crop\
    \ water requirements. For instance,\nFerrant et al. [106] developed and tested\
    \ a methodology using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\nsatellite observations to monitor\
    \ the spatiotemporal variations in irrigated areas in the\nKudaliar catchment,\
    \ Telangana State, South India. The methodology employed a machine\nlearning algorithm\
    \ and achieved high accuracy by combining radar and optical data. The\nresults\
    \ showed the variability of irrigated areas across different seasons and highlighted\n\
    the potential of this approach for near-real-time monitoring in South India. These\
    \ ﬁndings\ncontribute to calibrating agro-hydrological models and assessing the\
    \ impact of agriculture\non water resources. Incorporating biophysical data, such\
    \ as LAI, from high-resolution\noptical images, like those from Sentinel-2, in\
    \ conjunction with SSM SAR estimations can\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 4081\n31 of\
    \ 36\ngreatly beneﬁt the constraint of Optirrig simulations. This combination\
    \ of data sources\nenhances the monitoring of irrigation practices by providing\
    \ complementary information\non vegetation dynamics and soil moisture levels.\
    \ By integrating LAI and SSM data, Optirrig\ncan achieve improved accuracy and\
    \ reliability in detecting and monitoring irrigation prac-\ntices. The results\
    \ of the present study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and\noffer\
    \ valuable insights into the precision and dependability of irrigation date and\
    \ amount\ndetections, providing reliable information for monitoring irrigation\
    \ practices. With further\nvalidation using a larger dataset encompassing diverse\
    \ crops and irrigation methods, we\ncould potentially develop a near-real-time\
    \ tool for irrigation detection.\n6. Conclusions\nThis study aimed at the detection\
    \ of irrigation dates and amounts at the plot level by\nintegrating Sentinel-1\
    \ surface soil moisture (SSMS1) data into Optirrig using an inversion\ntechnique,\
    \ which ﬁts in the idea of providing methods for the supervision of irrigated\n\
    perimeters. The methodology involved comparing the change in SSMS1 between two\
    \ SAR\nacquisition dates with the change in SSM simulated by Optirrig for various\
    \ combinations\nof irrigation dates and amounts. Two ﬁlters were applied to remove\
    \ the ambiguity between\nirrigation events and rainfall, and thus, determine the\
    \ occurrence or not of a potential\nirrigation event. These ﬁlters relied on comparing\
    \ the change in the SSM at plot scale to\nthe change in SSM at grid scale (10\
    \ km × 10 km) and in the SSM simulated by Optirrig\nunder the effect of the rainfall\
    \ alone. The detected irrigation date with the shortest time\ndifference from\
    \ the real irrigation event date was considered the detected event. To assess\n\
    the accuracy and robustness, the method was tested against documented situations\
    \ in\nfour experimental maize plots located in the Occitanie Region of southern\
    \ France (near\nMontpellier and Tarbes). This testing helped to evaluate the method’s\
    \ applicability for\noperational purposes, such as supervising irrigated territories,\
    \ and provided insights into\nits strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.\n\
    The performance of the inversion process in retrieving correct irrigation dates\
    \ between\ntwo successive Sentinel-1 images was evaluated using three metrics:\
    \ recall, precision, and\nF-score. These metrics assess the accuracy based on\
    \ false negative (missed irrigation de-\ntection), false positive (incorrectly\
    \ detected irrigation), and true positive detections. The\nevaluation of the inversion\
    \ process using real irrigation data yielded promising results. The\nrecall, which\
    \ represents the ratio of true positive detections to the sum of the true positives\n\
    and false negatives, was determined to be 86.2%. This indicates that the inversion\
    \ process\nsuccessfully captured a signiﬁcant portion of the irrigation events.\
    \ Similarly, the precision,\nwhich denotes the ratio of true positive detections\
    \ to the sum of the true positives and false\npositives, was calculated to be\
    \ 85.7%. This metric demonstrates the accuracy of the inver-\nsion process in\
    \ correctly identifying irrigation events while minimizing false detections.\n\
    Furthermore, the assessment of seasonal irrigation amounts estimation performance\
    \ for\neach plot revealed variations based on the climate conditions. The efﬁciency\
    \ of irrigation\namount detection proved to be lower for the plots situated in\
    \ the humid climate of Tarbes\nin comparison with the “semi-arid” climate of Montpellier.\
    \ The estimation of seasonal\nirrigation quantities for the P1 plot demonstrated\
    \ relatively accurate results. However, for\nthe plots in Tarbes, a notably higher\
    \ mean absolute error percentage (MAE%) was recorded,\nindicating a more signiﬁcant\
    \ disparity between the detected and actual irrigation amounts.\nA comprehensive\
    \ and meticulous analysis of the results provided valuable insights\ninto the\
    \ weaknesses and instances of failure in detecting irrigation dates and amounts.\
    \ The\nexamination of missed and false irrigation detection brought to light the\
    \ primary limitations\nof the method, which could be attributed to two key factors.\
    \ First, the characteristics of the\nSentinel-1 constellation, including its 6-day\
    \ revisit time and the challenges associated with\nsignal penetration in dense\
    \ maize cover, were identiﬁed as contributing to the limitations.\nAdditionally,\
    \ it was found that the parameterization of Optirrig for SSM simulations did\n\
    not precisely align with the irrigation practices and decision rules followed\
    \ by farmers,\nfurther impacting the accuracy of the method.\nRemote Sens. 2023,\
    \ 15, 4081\n32 of 36\nThe incorporation of external information and constraints\
    \ to enhance the inversion pro-\ncess represents a valuable perspective for future\
    \ practical implementations of the method,\nboth at speciﬁc plots and across larger\
    \ irrigated areas. One promising approach is the\nincorporation of additional\
    \ data sources and constraints to inform and reﬁne the inversion\nprocess in Optirrig.\
    \ For instance, combining soil surface moisture estimates obtained from\nradar\
    \ data with leaf area index (LAI) observations derived from optical data can offer\n\
    signiﬁcant beneﬁts to the inversion process. Especially notable is the upcoming\
    \ launch of\nthe new SAR mission NISAR in the L-band, which offers the potential\
    \ for more precise and\ndeeper SSM (surface soil moisture) estimations. This capability\
    \ will be particularly advan-\ntageous in regions with dense canopy cover, as\
    \ the L-band SAR signal can penetrate further\ninto the soil and crop canopy.\
    \ L-band SAR data bring a distinct advantage due to their\nsuperior ability to\
    \ penetrate dense vegetation cover, resulting in more accurate estimations\nof\
    \ soil moisture content within such areas. To tackle the challenge of observation\
    \ frequency\nand to further reﬁne the accuracy of soil moisture estimations and\
    \ irrigation detection, a\npotential strategy involves incorporating L-band NISAR\
    \ data as an additional data source\ncomplementing the existing C-band data. The\
    \ integration of these two data types can\nlead to an increased observation frequency,\
    \ thereby furnishing valuable insights into both\nwater balance and crop growth\
    \ dynamics within the Optirrig model. By leveraging such\ncomplementary information\
    \ and further validation using a larger dataset encompassing\ndiverse crops and\
    \ irrigation methods, it becomes possible to enhance the accuracy and\nreliability\
    \ of the method’s performance and potentially develop a near real-time tool for\n\
    irrigation detection.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.H., B.C. and\

    Article history Views PDF Share Tools Abstract Listen This study aimed at investigating
    the applicability of a SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model in understanding
    the effects of drought on summer maize. A real-time irrigation module was developed
    for the downstream irrigation area of the Yellow River to estimate the real-time
    irrigation of crops. By further simulating the dynamic evolution process of soil
    moisture content, a dynamic drought evaluation model of summer maize was established,
    and the relative soil moisture was set as the evaluation index to assess and analyze
    the dynamic variation of drought evolution during the growth of summer maize.
    The results showed that the improved SWAT model has strong applicability. During
    the growth of summer maize, the variation trend of drought is consistent with
    that of natural precipitation. Moreover, drought mainly occurs during the sowing-seedling
    and seedling-jointing stages, and the average frequency is 84.8 and 78.3%, respectively.
    Moderate drought is most likely to occur during the growth of summer maize and
    occurs mainly during the sowing-seedling and seedling-jointing stages, and the
    occurrence frequency is 55.3 and 32.6%, respectively. Extra-severe drought has
    the greatest impact, mainly in the jointing-tasseling, tasseling-milking and milking-maturity
    stages, and the occurrence frequency is 17.4, 15.2 and 10.9%, respectively. HIGHLIGHTS

    Agricultural drought is defined as the phenomenon of reduction in the crop yield
    or even total crop failure due to the decrease in the soil moisture content during
    the crop growth period (Zhong et al., 2016; Yonas, 2021), and it is one of the
    most serious natural disasters causing agricultural economic losses in China (Cui
    et al., 2020). Previous studies indicate that the domestic agricultural aridity
    will be more severe in the following years in the context of climate change (Cho
    et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2021). As the main crop in China, the growth process
    of summer maize is easily affected by agricultural drought events (Wu et al.,
    2019). Consequently, the exploration of the drought process and its dynamic evolution
    during the crop growth period has great significance in preventing disastrous
    drought events and ensuring regional food security. Agricultural dynamic drought
    refers to the process of describing the dynamic change of agricultural drought
    based on the real-time dynamic monitoring data of drought occurrence and development.
    Agricultural drought research based on real-time dynamic monitoring data can improve
    the accuracy of drought assessment (Kumar et al., 2021; Prodhan et al., 2021).
    The dynamic evaluation of agricultural drought is often completed through the
    evaluation of relative soil moisture, crop water deficit index and other indicators
    (Alam et al., 2014). Presently, most of the real-time dynamic monitoring data
    for the research on agricultural drought are selected from various meteorological
    stations to build a crop drought evaluation index. By using a combination of methods
    such as long-term data analysis, mathematical model construction and comprehensive
    evaluation, the susceptibility of different crops to drought has been studied
    and analyzed on a temporal or spatial scale (Mishra & Singh, 2010; Xia et al.,
    2018; Chen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). However, the meteorological
    stations in China are limited in number and uneven in geographic distribution.
    Therefore, the agricultural drought evaluation model that adopts meteorological
    data as source data often lacks space–time representativeness and shows unfavorable
    and unqualified accuracy in the regional agricultural drought research (Du et
    al., 2014; Liu & Hwang, 2015; Wang et al., 2018). However, the SWAT (Soil and
    Water Assessment Tool) distributed hydrological model can make up for this limitation
    (Xue et al., 2019). By simulating the hydrological process of the watershed, the
    SWAT model can obtain continuous and large-scale hydrological and meteorological
    data of the studied area. Based on this rationale, researchers began to explore
    the application of the SWAT model in the crop water cycle process and irrigation
    water resources management from the early 21st century (Arnold et al., 1998; Kumar
    & Kumar, 2020). As the research progressed, the SWAT model was employed in studies
    such as agricultural drought evaluation and understanding the dynamic changes
    of drought during the crop growth period, and was widely used in various climatic
    zones. The SWAT model can simulate the change of soil moisture content during
    crop growth period and calculate irrigation water (Wang et al., 2003; Neitsch
    et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2018). For instance, McDaniel et al. (2017) adopted
    the SWAT model to simulate three drought indices, namely crop production, soil
    water consumption and transpiration during the growth season of cotton in the
    Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) and predicted the variation of agricultural
    drought for the next cropping season. By utilizing an improved SWAT model, Chen
    et al., (2018) simulated the impact exerted by agricultural production practices
    on water saving and crop yield in the high plains of Texas. The results of their
    study indicated that a deep irrigation depth is favorable for maintaining the
    crop yield and reducing the occurrence of drought events. Sun et al. (2014) developed
    a drainage basin SWAT model and used it to simulate potential evapotranspiration
    and precipitation, which overcame the limitation of insufficient data from few
    meteorological stations located in complex terrain areas and enabled agricultural
    drought monitoring at the watershed scale. Li et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2019)
    employed the SWAT model to simulate soil moisture content from which they calculated
    relative soil moisture and used it as an agricultural drought evaluation index.
    This allowed the evaluation of agricultural drought in areas where the soil moisture
    content data are absent. However, in many of these previous studies, the effect
    by real-time irrigation on the precision of the SWAT model was not considered.
    Similarly, the dynamic changes in the extent of drought during the crop growth
    period under the combined effects of precipitation and irrigation were not included
    in the simulation. Additionally, there are very few studies on the dynamic characteristics
    of drought during the growth of summer maize in the downstream irrigation area
    of the Yellow River (Ma et al., 2017, 2021). Therefore, a real-time irrigation
    module for the crop was developed in the SWAT model. Further, both the precipitation
    and the irrigation levels were adopted as the source of soil water during the
    growth of summer maize, which improved the soil water balance formula. The purpose
    is to allow simulation of the dynamic variation of the soil moisture during the
    growth of summer maize by constructing a drought evaluation model with relative
    soil moisture as the evaluation index. Furthermore, the dynamic variation of drought
    evolution during the whole growth period of summer maize was evaluated and analyzed
    to provide a theoretical background for the agricultural drought. The findings
    of this study can aid in the decision-making for the irrigation of downstream
    areas of the Yellow River. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area Listen The Sanliuzhai
    Yellow River diversion irrigation area is located in Zhongmu County, Henan Province.
    The study area is situated downstream of the Yellow River which belongs to the
    warm temperate continental monsoon climate (Figure 1). The annual average temperature
    is 14.2 °C, and the annual average precipitation is 597.7 mm, which mainly occurs
    in summer, with seasonal drought. The annual farming period of the irrigation
    area is 309 days, the active growth period of crops is 217 days, and the frost-free
    period is 240 days. The irrigation area is an important grain and cotton production
    area, and suitable for the growth of various crops in Henan Province. The irrigation
    water in the irrigation area is mainly from the Yellow River, with an irrigation
    area of 7,000 km2, which belongs to a typical Yellow River Diversion Irrigation
    Area. Within 1 m, the soil types from top to bottom are silty soil, loamy soil
    and loam sandy soil (Bian et al., 2019; Henan Jiuzheng Engineering Consulting
    Co., Ltd, 2021). In this study, the Sanliuzhai Yellow River irrigation area was
    taken as the research area, and the experiments were carried out in high-standard
    farmland, including soil moisture content and winter–summer maize index monitoring,
    etc. Data source Listen The digital elevation model (DEM), land use status data
    and soil type data of the Sanliuzhai Yellow River diversion irrigation area were
    established based on the data coming from the Resources and Environment Data Center
    of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The DEM data used were derived from 1:250,000
    elevation data from the Re-source and Environment Data Center of the Chinese Academy
    of Sciences, and the resolution is 100 m. However, the soil hydraulic parameters
    were calculated and obtained from soil water characteristic software SPAW (Sachin
    et al., 2014). The data on variables such as precipitation, temperature, solar
    radiation, water consumption by vegetation, evaporation from land surfaces, wind
    direction and wind velocity were selected from the daily meteorological data of
    the Zhongmu national meteorological station from 1961 to 2017. The missing data
    were compensated by the built-in weather generator in the SWAT model. The crop
    growth parameters were determined and revised based on the built-in database in
    the SWAT model and also coordinating the actual growth pattern of the summer maize
    in the research area. The farmland management data were obtained from the literature
    review and field survey. Fig. 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Location map of the study
    area. Improvement of the SWAT model Listen The SWAT model is a drainage basin
    distributed hydrological model featuring strong physical mechanism and is widely
    employed in agricultural water resources management, simulation of basin hydrological
    process and identifying agricultural non-point source pollution. The model is
    flexible and extensible, and it is computationally very efficient for doing continuous
    daily simulations for a longer period. However, the SWAT model cannot accurately
    simulate real-time crop water requirements (Harikrishna & Sanat, 2020; Navideh
    et al., 2020; Ferreira et al., 2021; Hanna et al., 2021). Therefore, in this study,
    the following modifications were made to the SWAT model: The occurrence of drought
    events during the growth of summer maize is more susceptible to irrigation activities.
    In this study, a real-time crop irrigation module is developed in the SWAT model
    to simulate the real-time and dynamic impact exerted by irrigation activities
    on the irrigation district (Figure 2). Based on the real-time monitoring data
    of the soil moisture content, this module calculates the real-time soil moisture
    in the irrigation area and deduces the real-time water demand (M) of the crop
    according to current hydrological and meteorological data and crop growth conditions.
    Following that, the model compares the predicted precipitation (P) and the real-time
    water demand (M) and suggests if irrigation is required in the experimental region.
    If irrigation is required, the irrigation water shortage (WD) is calculated by
    subtracting real-time water demand (M) from predicted precipitation (P). If irrigation
    is not required, then the next HRU (Hydrologic Research Unit) will be activated.
    This module can accurately simulate the relative soil moisture and irrigate in
    real-time during the crop growth period, thus improving the accuracy of the simulation
    and making the results of this paper more accurate (Ma et al., 2015). The soil
    water balance formula in the SWAT model was improved based on the real-time prediction
    of irrigated water shortage (WD), and the real-time irrigation amount was introduced
    as an index that can influence soil moisture content (Equation (1)). As the sources
    of water in the soil, both precipitation and irrigation levels were taken into
    consideration for studying the dynamic simulation of soil moisture content in
    the experimental area (Equation (2)). Fig. 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Structure
    of real-time irrigation module. The improved formula for water balance in the
    soil is as follows: (1) (2) where SWt represents the final soil moisture content,
    and the unit is (mm). SW0 represents the initial soil moisture content, and the
    unit is (mm). t represents the research period, and the unit is (s). Precip represents
    the effective precipitation levels during the research period, and the unit is
    (mm). Irr represents the irrigation levels during the research period, and the
    unit is (mm). WD represents the irrigation shortage quantity, and its unit is
    (mm). Revap is the potential transpiration capacity during the research period,
    and its unit is (mm). ETa represents the actual transpiration capacity during
    the research period, and the unit is (mm). SURQ is the surface runoff amount during
    the research period, and the unit is (mm). PERC represents the infiltration quantity
    during the research period, and the unit is (mm). LATQ indicates the soil water
    flow during the research period, and its unit is (mm). TILEQ represents the drainage
    capacity of buried pipes during the research period, and the unit is (mm). Rationality
    of calibration and validation of the SWAT model Parameter calibration and verification
    of measured data Listen The SWAT-CUP was used for sensitivity analysis and verification
    based on the growth parameters and soil parameters of summer maize obtained from
    the field experiment in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River (Luo
    et al., 2008; Liu & Luo, 2011). These parameters used in the SWAT model carried
    out calibration and verification with the help of the field test data of the study
    area such as actual measured output, soil moisture, leaf area index, etc. Following
    this, a verification experiment was carried out (Figure 3). The results indicated
    that the simulated soil moisture content was consistent with the measured value,
    and the actual dynamic change of soil moisture content could be reflected objectively
    by the simulated value of soil moisture content. Fig. 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE
    Comparison of measured and simulated soil moisture content during the field experimentation
    from December 10, 2015 to May 27, 2016. Validation of typical events Listen To
    ensure the feasibility of the improved SWAT model in drought research during the
    growth of the summer maize, typical drought events, as well as their development
    process in the experimental area, were adopted to verify the constructed model.
    According to available information, a continuous drought during autumn and winter
    in 2008–2009 as well as in 2010–2011 and a summer drought in 2014 were observed
    and marked as severe drought events in recent years. By observing the experimental
    monitoring data during the above-mentioned drought events, it is clear that the
    precipitation in the experimental area was significantly low compared to previous
    years. From the experimental monitoring data, it is also apparent that the transpiration
    was greater than precipitation, and a large fluctuation in the soil moisture content
    was observed. The average values of relative soil moisture were 37.4, 21.9, and
    33% during the above-mentioned drought events, and these events were graded as
    severe, extra-severe, and extra-severe, respectively. Even though extra irrigation
    water was supplied during these drought events, the drought state was often restored
    within 3–5 days of irrigation, particularly during the summer drought of 2014.
    This was because higher transpiration rates were usually observed in summer, and
    the variation of drought features was obvious despite intermittent precipitation
    (Ma, 2009; Duan et al., 2011; Li, 2014). The SWAT model was utilized to assess
    and analyze the process of typical agricultural drought events, from the occurrence,
    development to termination (Figure 4). Compared with the actual experimental testing
    data, hydrometeorological data, and drought data, the simulation results were
    consistent with the actual development process of drought events. Fig. 4 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Variation of the daily relative soil moisture during typical
    drought events in the experimental area. Based on the research above, the accuracy
    of the method is verified by measured data and typical drought events. This means
    that the model can accomplish the drought event assessment in the experimental
    area, and can also grade the drought event as well as provide the time scale for
    when the drought occurs, develops and finishes. Assessment index and grading of
    agricultural drought Listen Usually, the soil moisture content simulated by the
    SWAT model is represented in mm. Therefore, it is required to convert the soil
    water storage into average soil weight moisture content (Sun et al., 2014) (Equation
    (3)), which is used to calculate the relative soil moisture (Equation (4)). (3)
    (4) where W represents relative soil moisture, and the unit is (%). θ is the average
    soil weight moisture content (by weight), and its unit is (%). Fc is the field
    moisture capacity, and the unit is (%). SW is the moisture content of a certain
    deep soil layer simulated by hydrological model, and the unit is (mm). is the
    thickness of the soil layer, and the unit is (cm). ρsoil is soil bulk density,
    and the unit is (g/cm3). During the growth of summer maize, the root growth depth
    of summer maize is different at different growth stages, and the soil moisture
    content changes greatly at different depths. Based on the comprehensive analysis
    of the related results of drought indexes of summer maize, Xue et al. (2020) classified
    the soil depth and drought grade in different growth stages of summer maize (Table
    1). Table 1 Drought index of maize based on relative soil moisture. Drought grade

    AND DISCUSSIONS Dynamic characteristics of drought events during the growth of
    summer maize Variation characteristics of relative soil moisture during different
    growth stages of summer maize Listen The improved SWAT model was employed to simulate
    the relative soil moisture during the whole growth stage of summer maize from
    1972 to 2017 and the results were used to compare with the corresponding precipitation
    (Figure 5). Fig. 5 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Change in annual precipitation and
    relative humidity during the whole growth period of summer maize from 1972 to
    2017. During the sowing-seedling stage, the average relative soil moisture was
    57.0%, with a maximum value of 85.2% and a minimum value of 45.1%. The corresponding
    precipitation during this stage was 24.7 and 0 mm and the precipitation frequency
    was 22.6 and 99.7%, respectively, and the interannual variation coefficient of
    precipitation was 0.19. While the average annual precipitation during the same
    stage was 7.3 mm which varied from 0 to 41.6 mm, with the interannual variation
    coefficient of 1.39. During the seedling-jointing stage, the average relative
    soil moisture was 50.4%, with a maximum value of 75.3% and a minimum value of
    32.6%. The precipitation corresponding during this stage was 182.3 and 23.9 mm,
    the precipitation frequency was 14.9 and 87.2%, respectively, and the interannual
    variation coefficient of precipitation was 0.20. While the average annual precipitation
    during the same stage was 107.6 mm which varied from 13.9 to 344.5 mm, with an
    interannual variation coefficient of 0.73. During the jointing-tasseling stage,
    the average relative soil moisture was 86.2%, with a maximum value of 132.7% and
    a minimum value of 22.8%. The precipitation corresponding during this stage was
    149.7 and 34.9 mm and the precipitation frequency was 27.7 and 89.4%, respectively,
    and the interannual variation coefficient was 0.38. While the average annual precipitation
    during the same stage was 115.2 mm which varied from 1.6 to 271.5 mm, with an
    interannual variation coefficient of 0.61. During the tasseling-milking stage,
    the average relative soil moisture was 90.1%, with a maximum value of 135.2% and
    a minimum value of 19.8%. The precipitation corresponding during this stage was
    148.3 and 60.5 mm, the precipitation frequency was 12.8 and 68.1%, respectively,
    and the interannual variation coefficient was 0.37. While the average annual precipitation
    in the same stage was 96.3 mm which varied from 3.7 to 231.3 mm, with an interannual
    variation coefficient of 0.51. During the milking-maturity stage, the average
    relative soil moisture was 89.7%, with a maximum value of 131.6% and a minimum
    value of 19.7%. The precipitation corresponding during this stage was 67.6 and
    11.9 mm and the precipitation frequency was 40.4 and 87.2%, respectively, and
    the interannual variation coefficient was 0.34. While the average annual precipitation
    in the same stage was 77.4 mm which varied from 3.0 to 105.3 mm, with an interannual
    variation coefficient of 0.78. Consequently, during the growth of summer maize
    from 1972 to 2017, the average relative soil moisture was largely influenced by
    precipitation. The variation trend of relative soil moisture corresponded well
    with the dynamic variation trend of precipitation. Subsequently, Pearson''s correlation
    analysis was carried out for each growth stage. Results indicated that the correlation
    coefficient was between 0.41 and 0.71, and both passed the significance test in
    which α = 0.01 (Su et al., 2020). This suggests that rainfall was the main source
    that replenishes soil moisture during the growth of summer maize in the experimental
    area. However, relatively high correlation coefficients were observed during the
    jointing-tasseling stage, which is 0.71, and were relatively lower at other growth
    stages, which is about 0.5. This is because the soil depth of relative soil moisture
    considered by summer maize at different growth stages is different, and the correlation
    coefficient between relative soil moisture and precipitation is inversely proportional
    to the depth of the soil layer considered. The deeper the depth of the soil layer
    considered, the smaller the correlation coefficient between the two, and the smaller
    the influence of precipitation on relative soil moisture. Although the soil depth
    in the sowing-seedling stage is 0–30 cm, its correlation coefficient is only 0.45,
    mainly because the sowing-seedling stage is relatively short, the relative soil
    moisture is greatly affected by the early precipitation, and the correlation coefficient
    with the corresponding precipitation is relatively small. Interannual variation
    and frequency of drought during different growth stages of summer maize Listen
    The interannual variation, linear variation, and 5-year moving average trend of
    relative soil moisture at each growth stage of summer maize in the experimental
    area from 1972 to 2016 are shown in Figure 6. The relative soil moisture at different
    growth stages of summer maize followed in cyclic fluctuation of ‘ascend–descend–ascend’.
    By analyzing the total variation trend of relative soil moisture during each growth
    stage, it was noted that the change range of relative soil moisture is small in
    the sowing-seedling and seedling-jointing stages, but relatively large in the
    jointing-tasseling, tasseling-milking, and milking-maturity stages, and the years
    of drought in each growth stage were different. Fig. 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE
    Variation tendency of annual relative humidity during the whole growth period
    of summer maize from 1970 to 2016. By conducting the linear trend analysis of
    relative soil moisture, there was no significant change in relative soil moisture
    at the seedling-jointing and jointing-tasseling stages, that is, the drought conditions
    for many years remained basically unchanged in these two growth stages. However,
    it was observed that the overall relative soil moisture decreased at the rate
    of 2.36 every 10 years and 1.86 every 10 years during the sowing-tillering and
    tasseling-milking stages, respectively. This indicated that the degree of drought
    in the experimental area showed an aggravating trend during these two growth stages.
    In addition, the overall relative soil moisture increased at the rate of 2.04
    every 10 years during the milking-maturity stage. This implied that the degree
    of drought in the experimental area showed an ameliorating trend during this growth
    stage. Employing the M–K trend analysis of relative soil moisture at each growth
    stage, only the sowing-tillering passed the significance test where α = 0.05 (Adam
    et al., 2020). This indicates that in the long term, the variation of relative
    soil moisture during the growth of summer maize became more stable, or in other
    words, the variation of extent of drought degree remained steady during the growth
    stage of summer maize in the experimental area. Correlation analysis showed a
    positive correlation between 5-year moving average curve and the variation trend
    of relative soil moisture during each growth stage of summer maize. Moreover,
    the variation trend of relative soil moisture changed significantly during the
    jointing-tasseling and tasseling-milking stages, while a relatively small fluctuation
    was observed during the sowing-seedling, seedling-jointing, and milking-maturity
    stages. This indicated that during the experimental stage, the drought severity
    on summer maize was relatively significant during the jointing-tasseling and tasseling-milking
    stages. To further understand the drought characteristics of summer maize, the
    frequency of drought during different growth stages of summer maize from 1972
    to 2017 was calculated. The average frequency of drought in each growth stage
    of summer maize was 84.8, 78.3, 28.3, 28.3 and 26.1%, respectively. By analyzing
    the frequency of drought in each growth stage of summer maize, light drought and
    moderate drought occurred mainly in the sowing-seedling stage, with frequencies
    of 30.4 and 55.3%, respectively. At the same time, light drought, moderate drought
    and severe drought were the main types in the seedling-jointing stage, and the
    occurrence frequencies were 28.3, 32.6 and 13.0%, respectively. Also, during the
    jointing-tasseling stage, extra-severe drought mainly occurred, and the frequency
    was 17.4%. Similarly, only moderate drought, severe drought and extra-severe drought
    occurred during the tasseling-milking stage, and the occurrence frequencies were
    10.9, 2.2 and 15.2%, respectively. In the end, the frequency of light drought
    was 8.7% and that of extra-severe drought was 10.9% during the milking-maturity
    stage. These observations indicate that summer maize is susceptible to drought
    during the sowing-seedling stage and the seedling-joining stage, and the frequency
    of light drought and moderate drought are relatively high. Nevertheless, extra-severe
    drought is most likely to occur during the jointing-tasseling, tasseling-milking,
    and milking-maturity stages. This is because the frequency of precipitation increases
    in the middle and late growth period of summer maize, which reduces the possibility
    of drought. In addition, due to the high temperature in summer, if there is no
    effective rainfall, the strong evaporation and transpiration can easily cause
    serious drought problems. Spatial distribution characteristics of drought in summer
    maize Listen Spatially, the drought status of summer maize in the study area has
    little change, and the annual average drought frequency is between 25.6 and 37.7%.
    As the study area is north–south, the study is divided into three regions on average:
    north, central and south. The drought frequency of summer maize is 33.8–37.7%,
    28.9–34.2% and 25.6–30.1%, respectively (Figure 7). The agricultural drought trend
    weakens from north to south because the rivers in the study area mainly flow through
    the southern region, and the largest river Jialu river flows through the middle
    and south. Fig. 7 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Annual drought frequency distribution
    of summer maize. Planting experiment of summer corn Listen The SWAT model studied
    in this paper was used to conduct summer maize planting tests from 2015 to 2016.
    The test was divided into a real-time irrigation group and a conventional irrigation
    group. The real-time irrigation group was irrigated according to the dynamic drought
    law of summer maize growth period and real-time soil water content, and the conventional
    irrigation group was irrigated according to planting experience. The test results
    show that the water consumption of each growth stage of the real-time irrigation
    group is smaller than that of the conventional irrigation group. The total water
    consumption decreased by 450.23 and 500.25 m3/ha in 2015 and 2016, while the yield
    increased by 361.95 and 347.1 kg/ha, and water use efficiency (WUE) increased
    by 0.24 and 0.25, respectively (Table 2). This is because the real-time irrigation
    group can conduct timely and appropriate irrigation for summer maize, which reduces
    the drought risk of summer maize and avoids the yield reduction of summer maize
    caused by excessive irrigation. Therefore, the SWAT model studied in this paper
    can reduce the consumption of soil moisture and improve the yield of summer maize.
    CONCLUSIONS Listen A real-time irrigation module was developed in the SWAT model,
    and thus the soil water balance formula was improved. By simulating the soil moisture
    content in the experimental area, the relative soil moisture during the growth
    period of summer maize was calculated. Then, the results were adopted as the assessment
    indices and were utilized to evaluate and analyze the dynamic characteristics
    of drought during different growth stages of summer maize. The following conclusions
    were made from this study. The drought conditions during the growth of summer
    maize were greatly affected by precipitation, and the variation trend of drought
    remains stable in long term and the interannual variation is significant. During
    each growth period, the dynamic variation trend of average relative soil moisture
    kept consistent with corresponding precipitation. Their correlation coefficients
    ranged between 0.612 and 0.761, and they all passed the significance test where
    α = 0.01. In addition, the soil relative humidity of summer maize at the seedling-joining
    and jointing-tasseling stages varies greatly in different years, with the change
    of rainfall. During each growth stage of summer maize, drought could be easily
    observed, and mainly in moderate drought and light drought with the annual average
    drought frequency was between 10.9–55.3% and 8.7–30.4%, respectively. Nevertheless,
    severe drought and extra-severe drought are mostly observed during the jointing-tasseling,
    tasseling-milking, and milking-maturity stages, and the annual average drought
    frequency was between 2.2–13.0% and 10.9–17.4%, respectively. Spatially, the annual
    average drought frequency of summer maize is between 25.6 and 37.7%, and the drought
    gradually weakened from north to south. The improved SWAT model has demonstrated
    strong applicability in the study of drought conditions during the growth of summer
    maize. This improved model can provide a novel approach for researching the dynamic
    characteristics of summer maize drought conditions. This study can also offer
    a scientific basis for preventing agricultural drought downstream of the Yellow
    River where the irrigation district resides. DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT Listen

    \ by the National Turfgrass Federa-\ntion, the US national turfgrass industry\
    \ covers more area \nthan any crop (Figure 1) and is valued at $40 billion, with\
    \ \nturfgrass being used on more than 700,000 athletic fields \naround the country.\
    \ It also offers a variety of job opportuni-\nties in seed and sod production,\
    \ lawn care, and landscaping. \nFlorida’s turf industry ranks number one in the\
    \ country \nwith a total acreage of close to 4 million acres and economic \nactivity\
    \ of $7.82 billion, supporting about 173,000 jobs.\nTurf Irrigation\nWhile adequate\
    \ irrigation is critical for optimal turf growth, \nexcess irrigation will result\
    \ in waste of freshwater, leaching \nand/or runoff of nutrients, and pollution\
    \ of freshwater \nbodies. Efficient irrigation conserves freshwater and also \n\
    contributes to best management of nutrients to minimize \nnutrient loading to\
    \ water bodies. Advancements of mobile \nsmart devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets),\
    \ which have \nbecome commonplace today because of their convenience, \nhave facilitated\
    \ access and use of weather data for different \npurposes. These devices are ideal\
    \ for disseminating infor-\nmation on a regular basis using real-time data. Programs\
    \ \ndeveloped for mobile smart devices are typically called \n“apps.” There are\
    \ many apps available that perform a variety \nof functions, and they can be personalized\
    \ to the user’s \nneeds.\nWe developed an app called Smartirrigation Turf to provide\
    \ \nan easy-to-use mobile tool that delivers information to \nimprove irrigation\
    \ scheduling for urban turf. By using the \napp instead of a set time-based schedule\
    \ for irrigation, \nhomeowners and others can easily determine the irrigation\
    \ \namount to turf that more closely matches water needs. The \napp is specifically\
    \ designed for users who irrigate their turf \nwith an automatic irrigation system\
    \ and typically set it to \nirrigate a fixed amount on certain days without modifying\
    \ \nFigure 1. Fractional area coverage of turfgrass (%) in the US.\nCredits: NASA\
    \ (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Lawn/\nlawn2.php)\n2\nSmartirrigation\
    \ Apps: Urban Turf\nfor weather changes. Using the app to modify the irrigation\
    \ \nschedule will reduce irrigation costs, nutrient leaching, \ndisease, and wasted\
    \ water.\nThe Smartirrigation Turf app is applicable in any part of \nthe contiguous\
    \ US and is compatible with iOS (iPhone, \niPad, and iPod Touch) and Android devices.\
    \ The app is \navailable to download in the Apple App Store (https://t.co/\ndS5o5R4zvH?amp=1)\
    \ and Google Play Store (https://t.co/\nge1hZgQ1Uf?amp=1).\nSetting Up and Using\
    \ the App\nThis section provides a step-by-step guide for using the app \nto obtain\
    \ information on how to set an automatic timer for \nturf irrigation. The Smartirrigation\
    \ Turf app is designed \nfor landscapes and includes cool-season turf, warm-season\
    \ \nturf, annual flowers, woody plants and herbaceous peren-\nnials—wet climates,\
    \ woody plants and herbaceous perenni-\nals—dry climates, and desert plants.\n\
    Step 1. User Registration\nOnce users download the app and install it on their\
    \ device, \nthey can sign in if they have an account, or register to create \n\
    an account and start using the app (Figure 2). This allows \nthe app to create\
    \ an irrigation schedule specific to the site \nand user. Your registration information\
    \ is linked to all other \ninput data required by the app. This information is\
    \ kept \nconfidential and used solely to administer the app.\nStep 2. New Location\
    \ or System\nNext, the irrigation site location must be identified (Figure \n\
    3). To do this, a small map with a movable pin is used. The \npin is located at\
    \ your current location by default (using the \ndevice’s GPS). You can move the\
    \ pin by dragging it if you \nare not at the irrigation system site when you are\
    \ setting \nup the app. Identifying the location of the irrigation system \ncorrectly\
    \ is important because this information links the \nsystem to the closest weather\
    \ data source available.\nUsers may also take a photo of the given system for\
    \ a quick \nvisual reference. This might be useful if the app is used for \nmultiple\
    \ irrigation systems or multiple zones. You can enter \ndescriptive names for\
    \ irrigation systems, but these may be \neasy to forget.\nOn the same screen where\
    \ the irrigation system location \nis identified, users must name the new system\
    \ (Figure 3). \nThe name should be something meaningful to the user, \nparticularly\
    \ if multiple systems will be added (e.g., “North \nYard,” “Pool Area,” “Tom’s\
    \ Backyard,” etc.).\nStep 3. Weather Data Sources\nThe irrigation schedule provided\
    \ by the app is based on \nuser inputs and site-specific weather data. The app\
    \ offers \ntwo different options for weather data. The user can opt for \na weather\
    \ station or select the National Weather Data Grid.\nFigure 2. Login and registration\
    \ screens for the Smartirrigation Turf \napp.\nCredits: J. H. Debastiani Andreis\n\
    Figure 3. Location selection for new irrigation systems using the \nSmartirrigation\
    \ Turf app.\nCredits: J. H. Debastiani Andreis\n3\nSmartirrigation Apps: Urban\
    \ Turf\nThe app uses observed weather data from two weather \nstation networks,\
    \ the Florida Automated Weather Network \n(FAWN) and Georgia Automated Environmental\
    \ Monitor-\ning Network (AEMN). For more information about \nFAWN and AEMN, visit\
    \ http://fawn.ifas.ufl.edu and http://\ngeorgiaweather.net, respectively. Weather\
    \ station data are \nincluded in the app only for Florida and Georgia.\nUsers\
    \ may alternatively select the National Weather Data \nGrid for the weather data\
    \ source. The data used are from \nDark Sky (https://darksky.net) and include\
    \ the continental \nUnited States.\nGridded national weather data sources provide\
    \ spatially \ncontinuous weather information. However, it is important \nto remember\
    \ that these gridded data sources provide a \nsingle value for all locations within\
    \ a single pixel (data \nresolution). Overall, gridded rainfall products are reported\
    \ \nto overestimate small rain events and underestimate heavy \nstorms (Thiemig\
    \ et al. 2012). If a weather station is available \nnearby, it is recommended\
    \ that users select weather station \ndata over gridded national weather data\
    \ sources. Currently, \nthe app does not allow users to add their own weather\
    \ data. \nTable 1 provides a summary of a few of the limitations and \nbenefits\
    \ of weather data from gauging stations and gridded \nproducts.\nStep 4. Soil\
    \ Information\nNext, users select the soil type from a list that includes sand,\
    \ \nsandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, and clay (Figure 4). \nFor example,\
    \ most soils in Florida are either sand or sandy \nloam, while the most common\
    \ soils in Georgia are sandy \nloam or loam. If the soil type is not known, the\
    \ user can \nobtain the needed soil texture information from the Web \nSoil Survey\
    \ website (https://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/\napp/WebSoilSurvey.aspx).\nThe\
    \ user also inputs the root depth. The default value for \nroot depth is 12 inches,\
    \ but it can be adjusted within a \nreasonable range based on user knowledge.\
    \ The soil type \nand root depth are used to calculate soil water-holding \ncapacity,\
    \ which is the amount of water the soil can hold \nwithout losing it to drainage.\
    \ This helps to ensure that \nthe app-generated schedule does not recommend over-\n\
    irrigation resulting in leaching or runoff.\nStep 5. Adding Zones to the System\n\
    In this step, users enter the irrigation system zones. Users \nmay input multiple\
    \ zones and give each zone unique \ncharacteristics (Figure 5). For each zone,\
    \ users will need \na name (description), plant type, sprinkler type, sprinkler\
    \ \nrate, and days when irrigation occurs. This information \nshould match the\
    \ conditions of the user’s irrigation system. \nThe plant type relates to a crop\
    \ coefficient or factor that \nmodifies the irrigation schedule to reflect the\
    \ water needs of \na specific plant type. The sprinkler type can be micro, spray,\
    \ \nmulti-stream spray, gear-driven rotors, or impact sprin-\nklers. A standard\
    \ rate is provided for each sprinkler type, \nbut the rate is adjustable if the\
    \ user has better information \nabout the system. The standard rate for micro,\
    \ multi-\nstream, gear-driven rotors, and impact sprinkler types is \n0.5 in/hr.\
    \ The standard rate for the spray sprinkler type is \n1.5 in/hr. Users select\
    \ the days of the week when irrigation \noccurs by checking the day boxes. Blue\
    \ coloring indicates \nthat irrigation occurs on that day.\nMany users may be\
    \ subject to water restrictions that only \nallow irrigation on certain days.\
    \ This should be considered \nwhen entering the days to irrigate. If you are unsure\
    \ of \ncurrent watering restrictions, check with your local water \nmanagement\
    \ district. Users in Florida can also check with \ntheir local UF/IFAS Extension\
    \ office (http://solutionsfory-\nourlife.ufl.edu/map/).\nFigure 4. Inputting site\
    \ soil properties using the Smartirrigation Turf \napp.\nCredits: J. H. Debastiani\
    \ Andreis\n4\nSmartirrigation Apps: Urban Turf\nStep 6. Irrigation Schedule Generated\n\
    After finishing the irrigation system and zone input, the \nuser should select\
    \ “Save.” The user will receive an irriga-\ntion schedule for each zone of the\
    \ system (Figure 6). The \nschedule is in hours and minutes. This information\
    \ is \ndesigned so that the user can easily take the recommended \ntime schedule\
    \ and modify the current automatic irrigation \nsystem. Once the system is updated\
    \ with the new schedule, \nno further action is needed until the app notifies\
    \ the user \nthat actions should be taken.\nThe app also makes sure that the irrigation\
    \ amounts recom-\nmended do not exceed soil water-holding capacity. If the \n\
    input data result in this circumstance, the user will receive \nan instruction\
    \ to modify the number of irrigation days and/\nor the irrigation system.\nIrrigation\
    \ is calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith \nmethod to estimate reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) with \nregion-specific crop coefficients (Kc) (Zotarelli et al. 2010).\
    \ \nCrop coefficients used are provided in Table 2 and Table 3 \nThis version\
    \ of the tool considers irrigation to be equal to \nETc where: ETc = Kc * ETo.\n\
    Irrigation schedules are determined by averaging the last \nfive days of reference\
    \ evapotranspiration (ETo) and multi-\nplying by the appropriate crop coefficient.\
    \ Every 15 days a \nnew schedule is determined, and users receive a notification\
    \ \nthat their schedules need to be changed (Figure 7).\nStep 7. Weather Forecast\
    \ Information\nIn addition to providing a real-time irrigation schedule, the \n\
    app also provides current conditions, forecasts of tempera-\nture and rainfall\
    \ probability for the next few hours, and \nestimates of high and low temperatures,\
    \ relative humidity, \nrainfall probability, and wind speed for the next five\
    \ days \n(Figure 8). Forecast information can be found using the \nmenu in the\
    \ app. Forecast data are provided by the National \nWeather Service (NWS). For\
    \ more information about NWS, \nvisit http://weather.gov.\nFigure 5. Inputting\

    \ J. H. Debastiani Andreis\n5\nSmartirrigation Apps: Urban Turf\nApp users receive\
    \ notifications if more than 0.4 inches \nof rain occurs 24 hours prior to irrigation.\
    \ An example \nnotification for such an event is, “A rain event occurred in \n\
    (your location) area. Please check (your irrigation zone) \nand skip tomorrow’s\
    \ irrigation if appropriate.” Notifications \nare also sent if the probability\
    \ of rain is higher than 60% \nfor the next 24 hours. An example would be, “There\
    \ is over \n75% chance of rain for (your system) area in the next 24 \nhrs. Adjust\
    \ irrigation as appropriate” (Figure 9). Historical \nnotifications are accessible\
    \ in the app using the menu \n(Figure 10). Users receive notifications to further\
    \ refine \ntheir irrigation schedules to minimize the occurrence of \nirrigation-generated\
    \ runoff or drainage.\nUsing the App\nOnce you install the app and enter information\
    \ specific to \nyour site, the app is working! Use the app schedule to set \n\
    the timer on the automatic irrigation system by zone. Next, \nread app notifications\
    \ and alter the schedule as needed. No \nadditional changes are needed to the\
    \ app unless there is a \nchange in the irrigation system.\nConclusion\nThe Smartirrigation\
    \ Turf app provides an easy way to \ndetermine your irrigation schedule for better\
    \ management \nof turf. The irrigation schedule is based on real-time ETo \ndata\
    \ at a weather station near the system location when \navailable or gridded national\
    \ weather data from the Dark \nFigure 8. Weather forecast information provided\

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In Precision farming,
    sensors can be installed in the fields to capture environmental data such as climatic
    data, moisture levels, and information on soil water requirements [1], [2]. Sensor
    data must be transported to a center that processes data for field intervention
    decisions [1], [3]. Sensors actively forward data from other nodes in the routing
    process to the center, which may quickly drain the battery of nodes that relay
    a lot of data [4]. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can assist the data collecting
    process because of the need to cover a large area in precision agriculture [2],
    [5]. Note that the application of UAVs could provide a solution to prolong the
    network lifetime. Since UAVs usually have a limited endurance due to the physical
    constraint of batteries, UAV-assisted data gathering schemes should consider the
    energy consumption of sensors and the maximum flight distance of UAVs as well.
    Practically, UAV-assisted data gathering consists of two main tasks: 1) designing
    clusters wherein the cluster heads (CHs) work as rendezvous nodes to gather data
    from each cluster, 2) determining UAV trajectories for collecting the data at
    the CHs and returning to the base, where the battery of UAVs can be recharged
    or swapped. A good UAV-assisted data-gathering scheme should achieve a trade-off
    between the flying distance of UAVs and the total energy consumption of sensor
    nodes. In this article, we are motivated by the quest for an efficient solution
    for minimizing the sensor-to-sensor energy expense while satisfying an upper limit
    on the travelling distance of each UAV per data collection round. The contributions
    of the article are summarized as follows. We derive a theoretical lower bound
    for the energy consumption of sensors to transport data to cluster heads in uniform
    and plain deployments and prove that the energy consumption of sensors is close
    to the theoretical bound if clusters are balanced regarding energy consumption.
    Therefore, an essential step in proposed heuristic multi-UAV schemes, called Gathering
    data Assisted by Multi-UAV with a BAlanced Clustering (GAMBAC), is to find balanced
    or near-balanced clusters concerning energy consumption. To evaluate the efficiency
    of GAMBAC, we compare the results of GAMBAC and the mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) formulation. For sensor networks with a small number of nodes our heuristic
    algorithms give results close to the MILP formulation. We perform extensive numerical
    investigations and show that the GAMBAC schemes extend network lifetime and requires
    less energy to support a specific number of collection rounds than the best existing
    approach. The rest of this article is organized as follows. We provide a short
    summary of related works in Section II. We describe the operation of a practical
    system with sensor nodes in Section III. We present our theoretical result about
    the lower bound for the energy consumption of a sensor network in Section IV.
    We describe arguments behind the proposed GAMBAC schemes in Section V. We present
    simulation results in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes this article.
    SECTION II. Related Works Data gathering schemes and rendezvous-based protocols
    for wireless sensor networks have drawn a lot of attention for almost two decades.
    Recently, UAVs have been proposed for data collection in large-scale wireless
    sensor networks [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].
    Xing et al. [6] considered a data gathering problem with low-speed mobile elements
    on the ground and proposed the application of rendezvous points so mobile elements
    could collect data from rendezvous points. The authors investigated the minimum-energy
    rendezvous point and considered the constraint of mobile element paths (e.g.,
    mobile elements could only move along the routing tree). Several essential aspects
    (energy consumption, data collection deadline, UAVs'' limited endurance, etc.)
    are related to the application of UAVs in wireless sensor networks. Since UAVs
    usually have a limited endurance due to the physical constraint of batteries,
    the UAV completion time for data gathering and flying should be considered as
    in [9]. Zhan and Zeng [10] investigated a trade-off between the aerial cost, which
    is defined by the propulsion energy consumption and the operation cost of UAVs,
    and the ground cost. Wu et al. [11] also considered a data collection with multiple
    collectors, where a genetic algorithm was proposed to design ME paths so the delay
    constraint could be met. Ebrahimi et al. [12] studied the data collection problem
    with one UAV as a data collector and proposed a heuristic algorithm for clustering,
    selection of head nodes, and construction of routing trees. Alfattani et al. [13]
    investigated using multiple UAVs to collect data from clusters and applied genetic
    algorithms to solve optimization problems. According to Ghdiri et al. [14] there
    exist 1) offline scenarios where the network and the coverage area are fixed and
    known ahead, and hence the UAV trajectories can be preplanned ahead, and 2) online
    scenarios where IoT sensors are mobile and so offline path planning becomes unpractical
    (applications such as wildlife monitoring and intelligent transportation systems).
    For UAVs deployment, energy-efficient trajectory design is required, either in
    the offline scenarios where the system''s status is available beforehand or in
    the online scenarios where no or limited information is available for the UAV''s
    mission. The offline scenarios correspond to applications for dedicated or private
    IoT networks, where the IoT system architecture is static and changes occasionally.
    A comprehensive survey on trajectory schemes is provided in [15]. To our best
    knowledge, Konstantopoulos et al. [16] have proposed the best method (Convex-Hull
    based Protocol—CHP) to design ME tours until now. The CHP starts with choosing
    initial UAV paths based on convex hulls, which can cover the nodes at the furthest
    distance from the center. Then, it improves the initial paths using a simulated-annealing
    approach. This article also considers a data-gathering problem with mobile elements.
    We derive the lower-bound limit on the energy consumption of sensors and establish
    that the energy consumption approaches the lower bound if clusters have the same
    energy consumption, which has not been found in the literature to our best knowledge.
    We design GAMBAC schemes to establish either energy-consumption-balanced or near-balanced
    clusters to satisfy the flying constraint. In addition, we show that our algorithms
    outperform the CHP method. SECTION III. Cooperation of Wireless Sensor Nodes and
    the Operation Centre We deal with a precision agriculture scenario, where farmers
    deploy N sensors to collect the soil moisture levels of specific points in a large
    area for growing crops. Cloud computing is applied in an operation center to host
    an agricultural decision-making support system [1], [3]. Information about the
    position of each sensor node is available for decision-making. The operation center
    and sensor nodes cooperatively control a topology creation [17], [18] (i.e., determine
    directional links between sensor nodes) during the operation to form an ad hoc
    network. The moisture levels of N points should be transported to the operation
    center periodically by the end of each period of T max seconds. The operation
    center processes data to control water pumps and sprays in the crop production
    area. There are several alternatives for transmitting and transporting data to
    the processing center: a) sensors directly send data to the center, b) sensor
    nodes cooperate in an ad hoc sensor network to transport data to the center, c)
    UAVs are used along with an ad hoc sensor network to convey data to the center.
    Alternatives a) and b) may quickly drain the battery of nodes that relay a lot
    of data [4]. Consequently, those monitoring nodes die, and there will be no monitoring
    data, which may prevent the correct determination of decisions for efficient irrigation
    control. In this article, we deal with alternative c), which is motivated by a
    need to cover a large area in precision agriculture because the application of
    UAVs could provide a solution to prolong the working time of deployed sensors
    [9], [19], [20]. We focus on the application M UAV, each UAV could fly with a
    constant speed v 0 (m/s) at an altitude of H meters and the maximum flight distance
    of ℓ max . The deployment illustration is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Sensor
    network with the clusters, CH nodes, and the flight paths of four UAVs that are
    determined at the beginning of each round by the operation center. Show All The
    data collection process is performed as follows in each round. Fig. 2. Planar
    Voronoi diagram with the seed elements consisting of the set of points S P ={
    O 0 , O 1 ,…, O q } and the set of open line segments S L ={ O 0 O 1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ , O 1 O 2 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ,…, O q O 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ } . Show All The operation center selects cluster head (CH) nodes, plans
    the assignment of sensors to CH nodes, and determines the data forwarding tree
    (DFT) of each CH node and computes the ℓ max -constrained UAV trajectories (see
    Fig. 1). The operation center broadcasts information to sensor nodes about the
    selection of CH nodes and the routing information (e.g., DFTs). The operation
    center sends the UAVs to flight along the planned trajectory. Each UAV trajectory
    is represented by a closed polyline O 0 O 1 … O q O 0 , where O 0 is the sink
    location and O i,1≤i≤q is the intermediate turning points (cluster heads) in Fig.
    2. Sensor nodes transmit measured data and energy consumption information to the
    assigned CH following the routing path in an ad hoc wireless sensor network during
    each data collection period. CH waits for an associated UAV to hover above its
    position and transmits the aggregated data to the UAV. The operation center makes
    decisions based on information about the location of sensors, and the energy consumption
    of each node due to the transmitting activity and the actual energy level of a
    battery in sensor nodes. The information about the energy consumption is encoded
    and sent with monitoring data to the processing center. If packet loss happens,
    the energy consumption information is estimated from the past data. SECTION IV.
    Lower-Bound of the Energy Consumption In this section, we introduce some notations
    for the formalized problem description, then we present a proposition on the lower
    bound of the energy consumption of nodes. Let G=(V,Ξ) denote the network graph,
    where V={ s 1 ,…, s N } is the set of sensor nodes and Ξ denotes the set of direct
    wireless links that can be feasibly established between sensor node-pairs. That
    is, the distance between u and v , ( u,v∈V ), is smaller than the sensor maximum
    radio transmission range ( R ). Definition 1 (Clusters): For graph G=(V,Ξ) , Clustering
    C(G,K)={ V 1 ,…, V K ,H} describes the partition of sensor nodes into K separate
    sets V k ⊂V of nodes and the selection of a cluster head node ( c h k ) for each
    set (cluster), k=1…K , where H={c h 1 ,…,c h K } is the set of cluster head nodes

    Definition 3: A uniform deployment evenly distributes identical sensors in a specific
    area. Definition 4: A plain deployment divides an area into multiple subareas.
    In each subarea, an uniform deployment is carried out with homogeneous sensors.
    That is, a network in the plain setting consists of multiple regions and each
    node collects the same amount of data during one round. Proposition 1: (Lower
    bound of the energy consumption of sensors to transport data to CHs) In each round,
    the energy consumption of sensors E S2S = ∑ N i=1 e i,C(G,K) for the transportation
    of data to CHs satisfies the following in-equations: E S2S >B= c S 2 total ℓ max
    if a sensor network is with the uniform deployment and S total is the area covered
    by the sensor network, where E R = E RX (1)+ E TX (1,R) is the total energy consumption
    of receiving and transmitting a unit of data over the maximum radio range R ,
    ϱ is the density of a sensor deployment, and c= ϱ E R R , ℓ max is the maximum
    length of UAV trajectories. E S2S >B= c( ∑ K i=1 ς i √ S i ) 2 ℓ max if a sensor
    network consists of separate convex regions A i ,i=1,…,K , each region has area
    of S i . Each sensor node located inside A i collects the same amount of data
    ς i during one round. The total energy consumption approaches the lower bound
    if clusters are energy-consumption-balanced. The proof is provided in the Appendix.
    SECTION V. Proposed Algorithms Based on the theoretical result, we propose heuristic
    algorithms for the operation center to select cluster heads and a clustering,
    and plan the path for UAVs in each data collecting period. A. GAMBAC- α —Toward

    the number ( K ) of clusters is, the smaller the energy is consumed to transport
    data to cluster heads. Note that the number of clusters is upper bounded by a
    threshold depending on ℓ max . According to Proposition 1, the total energy consumption
    approaches the lower bound if clusters are energy-consumption-balanced. Therefore,
    algorithm GAMBAC- α tries to reach this goal through obtaining the largest number
    of clusters so the data volume of each cluster is almost the same and UAVs could
    fly without violating the endurance limit. Procedure GAMBAC- α through the execution
    of GAMBAC( G,M, ℓ max ,0,N , Select_CHs- α ) repeatedly divides interval (low,high)=(0,N)
    to search for the largest possible value of K . In the loop, procedure SelectCHs-
    α ( G,K ) (Algorithm 2) chooses set H with K cluster heads so the largest cluster
    still has a total data volume that does not exceed 1+ϵ times the average data
    amount. During the selection, the probability of a SN being chosen as CH is proportional
    to its residual energy, i.e., the nodes with higher energy are given more priority
    to become a CH, which prolongs the network lifetime. Procedure SelectCHs- α (
    G,K ) (Algorithm 2) consists of two tasks: 1) add new CHs; and 2) adjust the current
    H by growing data forwarding trees (i.e., clusters) and then removing the smallest
    ones (as inefficient). The first task gradually selects a new CH from the set
    of available nodes V G ∖ V T that contains all SNs outside the current DFT forest.
    The second task rebuilds the DFT tree, and this is done by utilizing Grow ( G,H
    ). The Grow operation (Algorithm 3) returns subgraph ( V T , E T ) representing
    a DFT forest, where the volume of data in each DFT (or respective cluster) does
    not exceed W=(1+ε) totalVolume K . If the number of DFTs/clusters is larger than
    K (for example, when there is a few insufficient, small clusters), the cluster
    heads of these small clusters are removed from H (line 14 of Algorithm 2) and
    SelectCHs- α ( G,K ) keeps searching for better positioned CHs (based on random
    selection). Note that the maximum number of searches is limited. Otherwise, SelectCHs-
    α ( G,K ) returns H . Algorithm 3: Grow ( G,H ). Input: Graph G=(V,E) ; H the

    ( G,H ) (Algorithm 3) computes K data forwarding trees for K CH nodes by using
    an algorithm similar to the parallel Dijkstra algorithm [21] for constructing
    graph Voronoi diagrams. For each node c h i , a DFT rooted at c h i is gradually
    grown by adding the closest available nodes. Node u is added if it is the node
    closest to the current “forest” (union of all the current DFTs) and, of course,
    is added to c h i ’s DFT for being the DFT nearest to it. The growth of each DFT
    must stop before exceeding the predetermined threshold (set at c h i .dataVolume
    ). Procedure Grow ( G,H ) produces complete Voronoi sets which are ϵ -balanced.
    Procedure MultipleTSP ( s 0 ,H,M ) based on an travel-salesmen algorithm [22]
    to find the the appropriate set S Π of trajectories (of M available UAVs). At
    the end of the main loop of GAMBAC, if the length of trajectories is below the
    limit ℓ max , then it searches for a larger K (further reduce the total energy
    consumption). Otherwise, the search range set by letting high be mid. Algorithm

    Residual Energy Among All Sensor Nodes Inspired by Proposition 1, our GAMBAC-
    α has been designed to keep balancing the size of the clusters (and, consequently,
    the communication workloads per cluster). However, GAMBAC- α may perform poorly
    in deployments with different amounts of monitoring data. In this section, we
    improve our solution with a subtle strategy. An improved version called GAMBAC-
    β has the same code base as GAMBAC- α (i.e., through the execution of GAMBAC (
    G,M, ℓ max ,0,100 , Select_CHs- β )). Here the idea is to keep balancing the ratio
    between the required workload and the residual energy of the CH. Instead of balancing
    “data volume,” we switch to “energy expense in fraction” (denoted by p in Algorithm
    4). For a predetermined fraction value p , clusters are formed so that the energy
    expenditure per each cluster is, at most, a fraction p of the current capacity
    (procedure Select_CHs- β in Algorithm 4). The tune-up phase seeks to find the
    minimum value of p so that the density of CHs is still low enough for M UAVs to
    sufficiently travel, picking up harvested data (each spans a distance no longer
    than ℓ max ). In each step, Select_CHs- β recruits the node with the largest residual
    energy outside the current DFT forest to set H . To restrict the percentage of
    energy expenditure per CH below fraction p , the max data volume of CH u is set
    to be p 100 × u.residualEnergy E RX (1)+ E TX (1) , where E RX (1)+ E TX (1) is
    the total energy spent for receiving and transmitting a unit of data to a UAV.
    Other than that, the remaining details are similar to in SelectCHs- α , where
    notably Grow ( G,H ) is repeatedly performed to extend the DFT forest upon a new
    CH recruit. C. GAMBAC- γ Through the execution of GAMBAC ( G,M, ℓ max ,0,100 ,
    Select_CHs- γ ) we get GAMBAC- γ . The only difference between GAMBAC- β and GAMBAC-
    γ is the setting of the probability of selecting a node to be a cluster head.
    Function Select_CHs- γ picks up a random node from V G ∖ V T with probability
    proportional to its residual energy (as in GAMBAC- α ) and inserts it to the set
    of CHs. SECTION VI. Numerical Results A. GAMBAC Versus Reference Results We have
    performed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem
    as well. Then, we use CPLEX to get optimal (reference) results for scenarios with
    parameters listed in Table I. Note that the computational complexity of MILP is
    O( N 3 ) (proportionally to the number of nodes), so we can only get reference
    results with CPLEX for networks with a maximum of 50 nodes. TABLE I Parameter
    Settings Two scenarios with four UAVs were investigated. Sensor nodes are randomly
    deployed in the scenarios. Each UAV has a flying limit of 200 m, and each sensor
    node has the initial energy of 50 J and generates the same amount of 64 Kb of
    data per round. In the comparison, ϑ is computed using an energy consumption presented
    in [23]. From Table II, we can observe that after 50 rounds the node with minimum
    remaining energy still has 78.35% and 69.65% of its capacity with the MILP-based
    solution and GAMBAC- α , respectively. The MILP-based solution took 30 min for
    computations per round, while GAMBAC- α needed 0.35 s. TABLE II Comparison Between
    the MILP-Based Solution and GAMBAC- α B. Performance of Heuristic Algorithms In
    this section, we compare the Convex-Hull based Protocol (CHP) [16] (which has
    been the best existing approach so far) with three proposed schemes: GAMBAC- α
    ”, GAMBAC- β and GAMBAC- γ . Note that CHP also carries out the cluster configuration
    and the computation of UAV trajectories at the sink node. Assume that farmers
    deploy sensors (like [24]) in an area of 3000m×3000m to collect soil moisture
    measurements for irrigation management. Two scenarios are investigated: Scenario
    1 represents a case where there is no hole in the area, and the sensor data rate
    fluctuates between 8 and 64 kbits/s. Scenario 2 is an example where the area has
    a big hole but is plain elsewhere, and the data rate (DR) is not fixed over time
    (can fluctuate from 8 to 64 Kb/SN). The DR is relatively high on the far away
    side of the hole, near the border, where the rate is 52 Kb/SN (emergency rate),
    but is the same pattern anywhere else (8-64 Kb/SN). Assume the sensor network
    should support the specific number of rounds (e.g., depending on the length of
    a planting season and the need for collecting data), we plot a battery energy
    level required in each sensor in Figs. 4 and 6. Note that the battery level depicted
    in the y-axis of Figs. 4 and 6. We observe that GAMBAC β is the best scheme for
    saving energy consumption. For example, to support 200 rounds, the GAMBAC- β scheme
    needs the batter of only 32 J for each sensor node, while GAMBAC- γ , CHP and
    GAMBAC- α require the battery of 40, 41, and 50 J, respectively. The phenomenon
    is understandable from the histogram of the residual energy of nodes at a specific
    round (e.g., 464) plotted in Fig. 5. Compared to other schemes, GAMBAC- β utilizes
    energy most efficiently. Sensor nodes have the highest level of residual energy
    and the status of the smallest energy after each round is highest. Similar observations
    are obtained in Scenario 2 as well (see Fig. 7). Note that GAMBAC- β outperforms
    other schemes in all the scenarios with different deployments of sensor nodes
    in a geographic area. Fig. 3. Deployment of sensors in two scenarios. (a) Scenario
    1. (b) Scenario 2. Show All Fig. 4. Number of rounds versus required battery energy

    algorithms (Scenario 2). Show All Fig. 7. Histogram and the standard deviation
    σ of SN residual energy at round 211 (Scenario 2). Show All The CHP solution is
    a geometric approach, where the sink is at the center of the area with multiple
    sectors of similar weights. The geometric approach works well when the network
    area has a simple shape (continuous without any void), and the observed data volume
    distributes evenly over the network. However, if the network has a complicated
    shape (with void regions) and the data volume observed at the sensors varies,
    this geometric approach could not produce good results. From our experiments,
    CHP performs well in the first scenario (simple shape network), but poorly in
    the second (with a void and unequal distribution of observed data). SECTION VII.
    Conclusion We have proposed joint clustering & multi-UAV gathering schemes to
    extend network lifetime. Our heuristic (GAMBAC) algorithms give a result close
    to the MILP approach and are efficiently applied for a network of large sizes.
    Numerical results showed that our algorithms outperform existing proposals. In
    all the scenarios, GAMBAC- β requires significantly less initial energy to support
    the specific number of data collection rounds than the CHP algorithm. In future
    work, we will investigate randomization techniques to select cluster head nodes
    and algorithms to facilitate searching for the optimal number of clusters. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    multiple regions by constructing a planar Voronoi diagram with the seed elements
    consisting of the set of points S P ={ O 0 , O 1 ,…, O q } and the set of open

    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ,…, O q O 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ } . Fig. 2 illustrates such Voronoi
    partition, where the Voronoi region of a point in S P is gray in color, while
    the remaining parts are Voronoi regions of the line segments in S L . For a node
    u , let ψ u be the point or line segment whose Voronoi region contains s u . It
    is straightforward to see that the Euclide distance between s u and its CH cannot
    be less than the distance between s u and ψ u , which is denoted as d( s u , ψ
    u ) (see Fig. 2). According to [25], the most energy efficient way for delivering
    data over a distance d( s u , ψ u ) is to take ν u =⌈ d( s u , ψ u ) R ⌉ hops
    with equal distance of d( s u , ψ u ) ν u , where ⌈.⌉ denotes the ceiling function.
    Let f u be the S2S energy consumption for delivering data from source s u to its
    CH. Then, we have f u ≥ ν u [ E RX (1)+ E TX (1, d( s u , ψ u ) ν u )] ≥ ν u [

    We apply the Riemann summation to approximate an integral. Namely, we divide the
    Voronoi region into χ= ℓ t,t+1 / Δ x rectangles, each with equal width Δ x as
    illustrated in Fig. 8. Then for a rectangle Rec t i with height y i , we further
    divide it into J=⌈ y i R ⌉ subrectangles, where the first J−1 has height of R
    and the last has height of y i R −J+1 (see Fig. 8). As analyzed above, we can
    assert that a SN s u located in the j th subrectangle Subrec t j has the hop distance
    to its CH of at least ⌈ d( s u , ψ u ) R ⌉ , which is equal to j . Thus, we have

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Nashville, TN, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    A. Modern Agriculture It is projected that as much as 4.4 billion acres of irrigated
    land will be required to meet the needs of our growing population [4]. This new
    land, which is roughly equivalent to twice the size of the continental United
    States, will need to be irrigated to cultivate crops and accelerate agricultural
    productivity. [4] However, global climate change and ecological crises are damaging
    the many natural processes that make modern irrigation systems possible. For example,
    variations in rainfall patterns and more extreme weather conditions have impacted
    the availability and quality of ground water, the main source of water for modern
    irrigation systems [9]. These challenges present significant obstacles to improving
    agricultural productivity. The farmers who do manage to successfully navigate
    these challenges may inadvertently contribute to further ecological problems.
    Large-scale irrigation projects, which divert significant amounts of freshwater,
    can deplete downstream river systems and potentially damage delicate ecosystems.
    The increased evaporation of water into the atmosphere caused by irrigation can
    also alter rainfall patterns, not just over the irrigated area, but also thousands
    of miles away [7]. Additionally, irrigation mismanagement has been linked to further
    erosion of coast lines, resulting in habitat loss for endangered species [8].
    These widespread ecological issues are further exacerbated in the state of California,
    which is currently experiencing the driest three year period in its history [5].
    This makes Californian farms particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences
    of wasteful irrigation practices. B. Soil Moisture Sensors Ensuring proper moisture
    content is essential when supporting plant growth and survival. Soil moisture
    content that is too wet or too dry can negatively impact a plant’s photosynthetic
    capacity and ability to survive. Under watering leads to decreasing biomass, wilting
    stems, and browning leaves. Over watering prevents roots from absorbing the oxygen
    they need to function, increasing the risk of root disease and crop failure. It
    is therefore vital that farmers integrate soil moisture sensors to correctly irrigate
    their plants, detect leaks in irrigation systems, and optimize for high crop yields.
    An effective way to take this measurement is to install soil moisture sensors.
    However, not all soil moisture sensors are created equal. There are currently
    two main kinds of soil moisture sensors on the market: high quality and low quality
    sensors. Each type has its own set of unique advantages and disadvantages. High
    quality sensors are more accurate and often come equipped with sensors that measure
    soil temperature, leaf temperature, leaf wetness, and dew point. They also are
    able to periodically upload the data they record to the cloud, allowing for the
    creation of dashboards that can be accessed through mobile and web applications.
    While these additional features make high quality sensors expensive and potentially
    more complex to deploy and maintain, they provide valuable data and connectivity.
    Low quality sensors on the other hand, are generally less expensive and easier
    to deploy, but they come at the cost of accuracy and lack internet connectivity
    to upload data to the cloud. The low quality sensor explored in this paper is
    the Blumat Digital tensiometer soil moisture sensor. Tensiometer soil moisture
    sensors operate by measuring the increase in soil moisture tension as roots absorb
    water from the soil [6]. As the surrounding soil dries, the ability of the soil
    to withdraw water from the sensor increases and the sensor displays a higher value
    [6]. Irrigation of the soil reverses this process and the tensiometer draws water
    back from the soil. This decreases the pressure on the sensor and it displays
    a lower value. For the high quality sensor, we use the Vantage Pro2 electrical
    resistance soil moisture sensor from Davis Instruments. Electrical resistance
    sensors measure the resistance to the passage of current through soil. The wetter
    the soil, the less resistance to the passage of current. The Davis Instruments
    sensor uses a function to transform this resistance into units of pressure [3].
    Blumat sensors are stand-alone and are read manually; each one costs 88(cfAmazon.com)asofthiswriting.Davissoilmoisturesensorsarepartofasoilmoisturestationtha
    1425 today (cf Amazon.com). Thus, for each 4-sensor deployment, Davis costs 4x
    more than Blumat. Figure 1 above compares the data acquisition capabilities of
    the Davis and Blumat soil moisture sensors. The additional data provided by Davis
    contributes to its significantly higher deployment cost. Fig. 1. Comparing the
    features of the Blumat Digital tensiometer soil moisture sensor with the Davis
    Instruments electrical resistance sensor. The additional features and data contributes
    to Davis’ higher cost. Show All C. Calibration Between Sensors The range of values
    and suggested irrigation periods differ between high and low precision sensors.
    The Blumat Digital sensor reliably measures up to 300 mBar and recommends watering
    when the sensor reads 120 to 190 millibar (mBar) [2]. In contrast, the Davis sensor
    can measure up to 2000 mBar (20 cBar) and suggests watering between 300 to 600
    mBar. In cooler climates with high water-holding capacity soils, the Davis sensor
    suggests watering between 400 to 600 mBar [3]. This discrepancy between the Blumat
    sensor and the Davis sensor, as visualized in figure 2, can result in farmers
    following drastically different irrigation practices. For example, soil considered
    moist by the Davis sensor may be deemed dry by the Blumat sensor. This paper aims
    to reconcile this by introducing a calibration step between the two that allows
    growers to adjust the range of the low-quality sensor to match that of the high-quality
    sensor. In doing so, we hope to enable farmers lower their costs while still achieving
    successful and sustainable irrigation practices. Fig. 2. Visualizing the different
    calibration and suggested irrigation ranges between the Blumat and Davis soil
    moisture sensors. Show All Fig. 3. A picture of the beds at Edible Campus. In
    addition to serving as a food source, the program promotes sustainable food systems
    and environmental stewardship at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
    Show All SECTION II. Related Work Many studies have been conducted on the use
    of low-cost soil moisture sensors in precision agriculture. For instance, researchers
    from ETH Zurich evaluated the performance between three low-cost soil moisture
    sensors and a high-accuracy time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor [10]. They
    concluded that the low-cost sensors could not reliability measure the soil moisture
    and that site-specific calibration was crucial for more accurate measurements
    [10]. However, their work was conducted in a sparsely populated research catchment,
    while our study was carried out on an active farm in Santa Barbara. Our mobile
    application also presents more simple visualizations of data, particularly from
    the Blumat Digital, to enable easy interpretation of soil moisture measurements.
    Moreover, we focused specifically on establishing a reliable cutoff between wet
    and moist soil, which can aid in preventing over or under watering and boost crop
    yields. The Gravimetric technique is another commonly used research method for
    calibrating soil moisture sensors. This technique involves comparing the weight
    of soil samples before and after drying in an oven to accurately determine the
    amount of water present in the soil. The resulting weight difference is then calibrated
    against data obtained from soil moisture sensors to establish a precise measurement
    of soil water content. [11]. A drawback to this method is that it is time-consuming,
    labor-intensive, and only provides a snapshot of the moisture content at the time
    of sampling. Moreover, this method is infeasible for many small-scale farms as
    gravimetric techniques require access to a well-equipped laboratory. Prior studies
    also indicate that while gravimetric sampling techniques offer high levels of
    accuracy, it is quality of individual calibration of soil moisture sensors that
    minimizes the error [11]. Our work aids in decreasing the time and resources required
    by gravimetric sampling while also presenting calibrations method specific to
    the the affordable Blumat Digital sensor deployed under real-world conditions.
    Our proposed method can be quickly replicated by farmers and gardeners and has
    the potential to improve water-use efficiency and crop yields. There are several
    existing mobile applications that help farmers more accurately determine soil
    moisture content. For example, the MySoil app uses publicly available and crowd
    sourced soil data to generate watering schedules and provide soil moisture readings.
    Similarly, the SoilWeb app provides users with soil data from the Soil Survey
    Geographic dataset, which is published by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation
    Service. Although such existing apps have been developed to assist with soil moisture
    sensing, they are often associated with various limitations. These limitations
    include a dependence on supplementary measuring equipment, inflexibility in calibration
    and data analysis, and user-unfriendly interfaces for on-site data collection
    and visualization. To overcome some of these challenges, our study introduces
    a new mobile application that is custom-built for use with the Blumat Digital
    soil moisture sensor and targeted towards everyday farmers. This app streamlines
    the data collection process and offers clear and easily comprehensible visualizations
    of soil moisture data, making it suitable for both seasoned and novice farmers.
    SECTION III. Edible Campus Prior to our research, our team recognized that in
    order to preserve water at larger scale farms, we must first begin by working
    with our local communities. We partnered with Edible Campus, a farming initiative
    at the University of California, Santa Barbara that provides for food-insecure
    students. As photographed in figure 3, the farm plants in raised beds and is managed
    by student farmers, many of whom who work part-time. Due to this part-time status,
    watering schedules at the farm were often roughly estimated, leading to instances
    of over watering and unnecessary watering of empty beds. In addition, smaller
    scale farms such as Edible campus often have limited budgets, which restricts
    them to purchasing cheaper, low-quality soil moisture sensors. These considerations
    made Edible Campus an ideal setting and test bed for our research. SECTION IV.
    Data Acquisition A. Deployment Setup To gather data for our analysis, we deployed
    six Blumat Digital and four Davis Instrument soil moisture sensors in two of the
    beds at Edible Campus as shown in figure 4. Initially, we asked student farmers
    to periodically input readings from the Blumat sensor into a shared excel spreadsheet
    - as readings from the Blumat sensor had to be recorded manually. However, we
    encountered two main limitations with this approach. First, the data recorded
    by students was often incorrectly time stamped or placed in the wrong column of
    the spreadsheet. Second, students frequently forgot to record data daily, as there
    was no immediate incentive for them to do so. These issues led us to explore alternative
    methods for data collection. Fig. 4. The deployment of Blumat and Davis soil moisture
    sensors at Edible Campus. Sensors were evenly spaced out in beds 9 and 10. Show
    All Fig. 5. The first, second, and third page of our mobile application that enabled
    student farmers at Edible Campus to more accurately collect and visualize Blumat
    data. Show All B. Mobile Application To address these challenges, our team developed
    a mobile application that allows students that to more easily collect Blumat data.
    As presented in figure 5, the app was divided into three pages, each focusing
    on a core feature. The first page was an input data page that allowed farmers
    to select a specific Blumat sensor number and input the mBar value. The second
    page let farmers view and edit all of the data for a specific sensor. The final
    page displayed a graph visualizing changes in soil moisture readings. Students
    at Edible Campus used this mobile application to understand trends in moisture
    levels and collect data that enabled our calibration. C. Time Matching Data The
    Davis Instrument soil moisture sensor periodically uploads its data to the cloud
    every five minutes. To match the Blumat data collected from our mobile application
    with Davis data, we paired datapoints that had the closest timestamps to each
    other. For both figure 7 and 6 the x-axis is the timestamp and the y-axis records
    the readings from the Blumat and Davis sensors in mBar. By connecting the data
    points, as shown in Figure 6, it becomes apparent that there is a correlation
    between the two sensors. This suggests that there is some relationship between
    the Blumat and Davis sensors, and that additional calibration could be performed
    to enhance the accuracy of the Blumat sensor in comparison to the Davis sensor.
    Furthermore, examining the time-matched data depicted in figure 7, it is clear
    that the soil moisture measurements from Edible Campus tend to fall within the
    wet/moist range for both Davis and Blumat sensors. This is primarily due to the
    soil management practices employed by the farmers at Edible Campus, who maintain
    the soil at this level to support optimal plant growth. Fig. 6. The graph on the
    above draws a line through all of the data collected for one of the four Blumat-Davis
    sensor pairs (w/out outliers). Notice that there exists a correlation between
    the two sensors. Show All Fig. 7. The graph above displays the raw data for all
    of the data collected for one of the four Blumat-Davis sensor pairs (w/out outliers).
    Notice that the data is skewed towards the wet/moist region for both sensors.
    Show All Fig. 8. Finding the cutoff C where the area under the curves in orange
    and blue are equivalent. This is the mBar the Blumat sensor reads when the soil
    is at the wet/moist cutoff according to the Davis sensor. The cutoff C is found
    when the natural log odds is 0. This occurs when C = 102 mBar. Show All D. Outlier
    Removal To address outliers, we first eliminated all Blumat readings lower than
    50 mBar, as they were accompanied by highly variable Davis mBar values. We also
    removed Blumat readings above 300 mBar, as the Blumat soil moisture sensor is
    not accurate in measuring values above 300 mBar. We observed several instances
    where the water inside the Blumat soil moisture sensors had not been replenished,
    which provides an explanation for these high mBar readings. Additionally, due
    to equipment malfunctions of Davis sensor 4, we removed its data from further
    analysis. It should be noted that the variability of our data is inherent to the
    fact that our sensors perform data collection on-site. On-site deployment offers
    the benefit of delivering highly accurate results tailored to the specific deployment.
    Nonetheless, the approach is not without its drawbacks, as we are unable to maintain
    constant surveillance over the sensors, leaving them susceptible to damage or
    longer periods of inaccurate data collection. SECTION V. Data Analysis We next
    investigated multiple popular techniques for performing calibration. We considered
    the log-odds ratio, Monte Carlo simulation, and linear regressions. We summarize
    our analysis for each in the following subsections. A. Log-Odds Ratio The log-odds
    ratio is a statistical measure use to compare the likelihood or probability of
    two events occurring [1]. It is defined as the logarithm of the odds ratio, which
    is the probability of one event occurring over the probability of the other event
    occurring. We applied this methodology to determine a more accurate cutoff between
    wet and moist soil around the Blumat Digital soil moisture sensor using data from
    the Davis sensor. According to documentation from Davis instruments, the sensor
    records less than or equal to 100 mBar in wet soil and greater than 100 mBar in
    moist soil [3]. Based on this information, our team divided our Blumat data into
    two sets: Bwet, containing all Blumat values when the adjacent Davis sensor recorded
    wet soil and Bmoist, containing all Blumat values when the adjacent Davis sensor
    recorded moist soil. Next, we generated two normal distributions by calculating
    the mean and standard deviation of our two sets of Blumat data. We then calculated
    the value C such that P(Bwet > C) = P(Bmoist < C) and found that C = 102. In other
    words, if the Blumat sensor recorded soil moisture levels below 102 mBar, a Davis
    sensor is more likely to classify the soil as wet. If the Blumat sensor recorded
    a soil moisture levels above 102 mBar, a Davis sensor is more likely to classify
    the soil as moist. Thus, the cutoff between wet and moist for the Davis sensor
    is when the Blumat sensor reads 102 mBar. Figure 8 shows this analysis. B. Monte
    Carlo One limitation of the Log-Odds methodology is that it assumes the distribution
    of Bwet and Bmoist follows a normal distribution. To further verify our conclusions
    from our Log-Odds calibration, our team employed Monte Carlo random sampling.
    This method involves generating a large number of random samples and does not
    assume any particular distribution of the data. Our goal was to find the cutoff
    C that most accurately split the Blumat–Davis data pairs. For each possible cutoff
    C, our team sampled 50 data points 200 times and calculated the average rate of
    errors and successes. An error occurred when the Blumat and Davis mBar values
    were on opposite sides of the cutoff C. A success occurred when both values were
    on the same side of the cutoff C. Through our Monte Carlo experiments, we determined
    that the optimal cutoff value (C) for the Blumat sensor to attain 9% accuracy
    was 100 mBar. Notably, this value aligns with the high-precision Davis sensor
    documentation, which indicates that 100 mBar serves as the threshold between wet
    and moist soils. Hence, our results corroborate the conclusions reached through
    the Log-Odds approach, specifically that if a Blumat sensor records below 100
    mBar, an adjacent Davis sensor would classify the soil as wet, and if a Blumat
    sensor records above 100 mBar, an adjacent Davis sensor would classify the soil
    as moist. Although the Log-Odds cutoff was slightly higher at 102, we assert that
    the discrepancy is negligible and that the outcomes are consistent C. Linear Regression
    To further analyze the relationship between Blumat and Davis soil moisture sensors
    and verify the results from our Log-Odds and Monte Carlo experiments, we used
    Least Squares Linear Regression. The result of our linear regression yielded a
    line of best fit of: D=.28∗B+38 (1) View Source Where D is the reading from the
    Davis sensor in mBar and B is the reading from the Blumat sensor also in mBar.
    This line of best fit correctly classifies Blumat data as either wet (D < 100)
    or moist (D > 100) 91% of the time, which is consistent with the accuracy obtained
    in our Monte Carlo experiments. This further supports that the cutoff between
    wet and moist soil is 100 mBar for the Blumat soil moisture sensor. SECTION VI.
    Future Work Moving forward, our research will focus on exploring the amount of
    water required to attain a specific mBar value, beginning from a known starting
    mBar value, for the Blumat Digital soil moisture sensor. This will be especially
    useful for farmers, on both large scale and small scale farms, who want to maintain
    optimal soil moisture levels. Additionally, we plan to explore the impacts of
    humidity, pressure, wind speed, and soil temperature on soil moisture at Edible
    Campus. This data can be collected by our mobile app when student farmers input
    readings for a Blumat sensor. Finally, we plan to investigate the degree to which
    the calibration threshold value changes across different locations and soil types.
    We also shared our findings with the team at Edible Campus, and as a result, they
    have started watering their crops at 100 mBar in order to keep the soil in the
    moist/wet range. To evaluate the impact of this calibration on crop yield, we
    plan to work in collaboration with the growers to compare yield of the coming
    summer with that of the previous summer. SECTION VII. Conclusions Our research
    investigates the use of a cutoff value to guide irrigation decisions by growers.
    We show that we are able to determine this threshold with high accuracy (>90%)
    using low cost, low accuracy soil moisture sensors coupled with a calibration
    step. Calibration entails using a high cost, high accuracy sensor system for a
    short period of time to detect the statistical relationship between the two sensor
    systems. We then can remove the high cost sensor system (and use it for calibration
    at other growing areas or farms) and maintain accurate decision support using
    only low-cost soil moisture sensors. We investigate multiple approaches to identifying
    this relationship and the combination confirmed the validity of our threshold
    between moist and wet soils. Our freely available mobile app makes it easy for
    growers to record data from sensors, visualize their data, and receive decision
    support as to when to irrigate. By improving the accuracy of low-cost sensors
    our mobile app gives growers a way to lower their costs but achieve trustworthy
    and higher accuracy support for their irrigation decisions. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This

    India SECTION I. Introduction Water is a scarce and valuable natural resource
    and especially an essential component, it needs to be developed, planned, managed,
    conserved, and in particular, effectively utilized [1]. Optimum management of
    presented water resources in the agriculture sector is obligatory because of limited
    resources and increasing demands. It is vital to rise agricultural yield under
    limited water resources for optimum agricultural crops to satisfy upcoming food
    production requirements [2]. The constraint water supply must be efficiently utilized
    for irrigating additional areas with a similar quantity of water [3]. Lately,
    various research workers have employed the Internet of things (IoT) and artificial
    intelligence (AI) to manage irrigational problems accurately via linear models.
    Precision irrigation scheduling is directed towards effectual water usage for
    all the plants, when and where it is essential, to reimburse for water loss over
    evapotranspiration, deep percolation, or erosion when preventing over- and under-irrigation
    [4]. With appropriate irrigation management through and optimum control efficient
    monitoring, water could be saved, along with providing a reduction in other indirect
    costs experienced from energy usage through fossil fuel or electricity for pumping,
    for optimum cost-efficiency [5]. Fig. 1 depicts the overview of IoT-based smart
    irrigation system. Fig. 1. Iot-based smart irrigation system Show All More recently
    used irrigation system is depends on cyclic water application notwithstanding
    the plant''s real requirement for irrigation water, which is a bigger problem
    [6]. An appropriate irrigation schedule helps to produce better crop production.
    But while surface irrigation system is employed, it is impossible to change the
    frequency and depth of irrigation water because of the implementation complexity.
    Variations in irrigation depth are quite unclear for the producer to diverge the
    irrigation scheduling [7]. Defining the optimal quantity of water isn''t an easier
    task; it relies on several factors namely wind speed, air temperature, average
    relative humidity, solar radiation, and sun hours. Consequently, the irrigation
    depth is unevenly projected to save the interval constant and the irrigation depth
    over the rising period [8]. The precise description of irrigation scheduling is
    a time-consuming and challenging method. The computer program has made it more
    available, and now it is likely to irrigation scheduling the water quantity exactly
    based on the water essential for crop production [9]. Sensor-based irrigation
    schedule system is an effective tools personalized to field characteristics that
    could considerably facilitate irrigation scheduling decisions [10]. Because of
    the development of sensors and the massive revolution of IoT for smart agriculture,
    the application presents a substantial helpful effect on irrigation water conservation
    and plants. Khan et al. [11] examine a new integration of optimizing intelligent
    smart irrigation methods for improving efficiency of the energy management. At
    this point, an optimum CH formation and selection were carried out by Hierarchy
    Shuffled Shepherd Clustering (HSSC) approach. Besides, the finest routing path
    and energy regulation are offered by the projected Emperor Penguin Jellyfish Optimized
    (EPJO) approach. In [12], a new method “Enhanced CH based Data gathering” (ECHGS)
    was projected to effort the energy and delay in IoT related smart irrigation methods
    for cultivation. During this presented method, the CH for the set of sensor nodes
    is chosen dependent on the residual energy (RE) and workload. The node is a higher
    RE and lesser workload was chosen as a CH for collecting and delivering the data
    to server node efficiently. Ullah et al. [13] projected an energy-efficient water
    management platform (EEWMP), an enhanced version of SWAMP. Quimbita et al. [14]
    examine a smart irrigation method energized by microgrid. The suggestion comprises
    2 steps namely the primary creates the daily irrigation profile dependent upon
    an adept method for sufficient utilization of water. Afterward, assuming the irrigation
    profile, the power needed for the water pump was measured-an optimum daily profile
    of current demand was defined in the second step. The microgrid is handled through
    the energy managing scheme that depends on prediction control model. Sangeetha
    et al. [15] include the smart agriculture management method for producing crop
    production and agricultural benefits. The hybrid remote-controlled device utilized
    the Global Positioning System (GPS) with Radial Function Network (RFN) has been
    introduced for controlling the irrigated scheme, forecasting the temperature,
    reducing the humidity in water content, and maintaining the air pressure. It employs
    the Internet of Everything (IOE) environmental factor and IoT sensors for monitoring
    and managing irrigation systems. This study develops an Arithmetic Optimization
    Algorithm with Machine Learning based Smart irrigation system (AOAML-SIS) technique
    in an IoT environment. Initially, the AOAML-SIS technique exploits the IoT sensors
    for data collection process. For determining the need for irrigation, the AOALM-SIS
    technique utilizes multilayer perceptron (MLP) classification model. Since the
    MLP parameters play a vital role, the parameter tuning process is carried out
    by the AOA algorithm. The experimental assessment of the AOAML-SIS technique takes
    place on agriculture data. The simulation values inferred the effectual irrigation
    classification efficacy of the AOAML-SIS technique over other models. SECTION
    II. The Proposed Smart Irrigation System In this study, an automated smart irrigation
    system using AOAML-SIS technique has been developed in IoT environment. Initially,
    the AOAML-SIS technique exploits the IoT sensors for data collection process.
    For determining the need for irrigation, the AOALM-SIS technique utilized the
    MLP classification model. Since the MLP parameters play a vital role, the parameter
    tuning process is carried out by the AOA algorithm. A. Irrigation Classification
    Using MLP In this work, the MLP model is applied to irrigation management. ANN
    is non-parametric method that consists of a sequence of processing components
    named neurons [16]. The feedforward neural network is a class of supervised ANN
    that usually has 3 layers of nodes, such as hidden, input, and output layers.
    The MLP is the more common and well known feedforward network. The MLP node was
    arranged hierarchically in various FC layers. Especially, MLP has input, output,
    and hidden layers (HLs) that reside among the input and output layers. In this
    work, the HL provides the processing and computation power for producing the network
    output. The connection is characterized using the network weight that is are real
    number within[1, 1.]. In this work, two stages are implemented for yielding the
    output value of all the nodes in every layer. Initially, the weighted sum of the
    input value is evaluated by: S j = ∑ i=1 n ( w ij I i + β j ) (1) View Source
    In Eq. (1), l i indicates the i−th input parameter, n indicates the overall amount
    of nodes (neurons) from the input layer w ij shows the weight connection amongst
    the hidden nod j and I i and β i indicates the bias (threshold) weight of i th
    hidden nodes. Next, the resultant value of every node in the HL was calculated
    according to the weighted sum. Here, activation is utilized for triggering the
    output according to the value of summation function. Then, distinct kinds of activation
    function are stored. The sigmoid activation function is widely employed for mapping
    the HL outcome value that is evaluated by: f j (x)= 1 1+ e − s j (2) View Source
    Lastly, the network output is attained by the following expression: y ^ k = ∑
    j=1 m ( w kj f i + β k ) (3) View Source The MLP performance depends on the value
    of weight and biases connection determined in the trained stage. Thus, the major
    aim of trained MLP is to discover a collection of optimum connection weights and
    biases for minimizing predictive error. B. AOA Based Parameter Tuning For tuning
    the parameters of the MLP model, the AOA is used. AOA primarily imitate the usage
    of numerical operator in the numerical problem-solving technique [17]. Arithmetic
    is the previous part of mathematics which is used to deal with the properties
    of the function and numbers. The arithmetic operator is an operation symbol that
    implements necessary arithmetic, viz., a symbol exploited to 4 techniques. During
    the optimization, this operator was exploited to select the better solution for
    the candidate. At first, the searching range of candidate outcomes was widely
    secured for breaking the deadlock of method falls into searching stagnation. Next,
    enhance the search efficiency of solution through the deep search. The sequence
    of feasible solutions has been randomly produced at the earlier step of optimized
    technique of AOA, as follows. X=[ χ N−1,1 χ N,1 χ 2,… 1 χ 1,1 χ N−1,j χ N,j χ
    2,j χ1,j χ N,n−1 χ 1., ′ n−1 χ N−l,n χ 1,n χ N,n χ 2,….n ′ ] X= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢
    ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ x 1,1 x 2,1 … ⋮ x N−1,1 x N,1 … … … ⋮ … … … … … ⋮ … … x 1,j x 2,j …
    ⋮ x N−1,j x N,j x 1,n−1 … … ⋮ … x N,n−1 x 1,n x 2,n … ⋮ x N−1,n x N,n ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (4) View Source Formerly, the AOA implements the optimization
    technique, it is essential to resolve the search technique according to the values
    of Math Optimizer Accelerated (MOA) method that is evaluated using the subsequent
    expression: MOA( C − Iter)=Min+ C − Iter×( Max−Min M − Iter ) (5) View Source
    From the expression, MOA (C _Iter) denotes the function values in C ‘_Iter iteration;
    C _Iter characterize the existing iteration. M “_Iter indicates the highest amount
    of iterations; Min and Max are augmented function lower and higher values. The
    exploration stage in the AOA system was generally recognized by operators such
    as Multiplication (M) and Division (D). The position of candidate result was considerably
    upgraded during the exploration process in the following: x i,j ( C − Iter+1)
    ={ best ( x j )/(M0P+ε)×((U B j −L B j )×μ+L B j ) (best( x j )×MOP ×(U B j −L
    B j )×μ+L B j r 2 <0.5 otherwise (6) View Source From the expression, χ i,j (
    C − 1ter+1) represents the j th position of i th solution in (CIter+11 th iteration;
    E designates the smaller value; U I j and LB designate the upper as well as lower
    boundaries of positions of candidate result: μ is exploited to regulate the exploration
    phase are static as 0.5; the MOP shows the math optimizing possibility of AOA
    that is defined below: 1 MOP( C − Iter)=1− C − Ite r 1 α M − Ite r 1 α (7) View
    Source In Eq. (7), α denotes the accurateness of exploitation on iteration, α
    = 5. The employment of exploitation technique mainly relies on Addition (A) and
    Subtraction (S) operators are easy to create minimum distribution, for candidate
    solution was implemented a deep search with large probability to evaluate the
    optimum solution: x i,j ( C Iter +1) ={ best( x j )−MOP×((U B j −L B j )×μ+L B
    j , best( x j )+MOP×((U B j −L B j )×μ+L B j , r 3 <0.5 otherwise } (8) View Source
    The adaptive conversion amongst the exploration as well as exploitation steps
    are reinforced AOA technique that determines the better solution and endures the
    multiplicity of potential solutions for performing the study. Algorithm 1: Pseudocode

    the AOAML-SIS technique are well studied here. Table I. Classification outcome

    output of the AOAML-SIS technique with several epochs. The obtained values demonstrated
    that the AOAML-SIS technique has reached improving values under each epoch. For

  description: Remotely sensed-based surface temperature is an important tool for
    crop monitoring and has great potential for improving irrigation management. However,
    current thermal satellite platforms do not display the fine spatial resolution
    required for identifying crop water status patterns at the field scale. The thermal
    sharpening (TsHARP) utility provides a technique for downscaling coarse thermal
    images to match the finer resolution of images acquired in the visible and near
    infrared bandwidths. This sharpening method is based on the inverse linear relationship
    between vegetation fraction calculated from the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST). The current study used the TsHARP
    method to sharpen low-resolution thermal data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectrometer MODIS (1 km) to the finer resolution of Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Vegetation
    and Environment New micro-Spacecraft (VENµS) (5 m) visible-near infrared images.
    The sharpening methodology was evaluated at scene and field scales in southern
    Georgia and northern Mississippi, USA. A comparison of sharpened temperature was
    made with reference temperatures from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)
    in four different spatial resolutions (30, 60, 120, and 240 m) for method validation.
    Coarse resolution comparison on the dates in which imagery from both sensors were
    acquired on the same day resulted in average observed mean absolute error (MAE)
    of 1.63◦C, and R2 variation from 0.34 to 0.74. Temperature errors at the field
    scale ranged from 0.25 to 3.11◦C using both Sentinel-2 and VENµS. Sharpened maps
    at 120 and 60 m resolution showed the highest consistency for all fields and dates.
    Maps sharpened using VENµS images showed comparable or higher accuracy than maps
    sharpened using Sentinel-2. The superior performance coupled with the better revisit
    time indicates that the VENµS platform has high potential for frequent in-season
    crop monitoring. Further research with ground data collection is needed to explore
    field use limitations of this methodology, but these results give useful insights
    of potential benefits of implementing the TsHARP technique as a tool for crop
    stress monitoring.

    surface temperature is an important tool for crop monitoring and has great potential
    for improving irrigation management. However, current thermal satellite platforms
    do not display the fine spatial resolution required for identifying crop water
    status patterns at the field scale. The thermal sharpening (TsHARP) utility provides
    a technique for downscaling coarse thermal images to match the finer resolution
    of images acquired in the visible and near infrared bandwidths. This sharpening
    method is based on the inverse linear relationship between vegetation fraction
    calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface
    temperature (LST). The current study used the TsHARP method to sharpen low-resolution
    thermal data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer MODIS (1 km) to
    the finer resolution of Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Vegetation and Environment New micro-Spacecraft
    (VENµS) (5 m) visible-near infrared images. The sharpening methodology was evaluated
    at scene and field scales in southern Georgia and northern Mississippi, USA. A
    comparison of sharpened temperature was made with reference temperatures from
    Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in four different spatial resolutions
    (30, 60, 120, and 240 m) for method validation. Coarse resolution comparison on
    the dates in which imagery from both sensors were acquired on the same day resulted
    in average observed mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.63 °C, and R2 variation from
    0.34 to 0.74. Temperature errors at the field scale ranged from 0.25 to 3.11 °C
    using both Sentinel-2 and VENµS. Sharpened maps at 120 and 60 m resolution showed
    the highest consistency for all fields and dates. Maps sharpened using VENµS images
    showed comparable or higher accuracy than maps sharpened using Sentinel-2. The
    superior performance coupled with the better revisit time indicates that the VENµS
    platform has high potential for frequent in-season crop monitoring. Further research
    with ground data collection is needed to explore field use limitations of this
    methodology, but these results give useful insights of potential benefits of implementing
    the TsHARP technique as a tool for crop stress monitoring. Keywords: image sharpening;

    Thermal remote sensing uses thermal infrared (TIR) bands in the 8 to 14 µm region
    of the electromagnetic spectrum in which atmospheric absorption effects are attenuated
    [1]. At the molecular level, plant absorption in the TIR bands is influenced by
    the absorption properties of leaf tissues driven by molecular vibration [2]. At
    the physiological level, absorption is directly influenced by the transpiration
    rate [3]. In drought conditions, plants that exhibit isohydric behavior tend to
    close their stomata to maintain leaf water potential (LWP). This decreases their
    transpiration rate significantly, leading to an increase in leaf temperature [4].
    The direct relationship between changes in leaf temperature resulting from changes
    in LWP makes TIR bands more sensitive to detecting water stress than other regions
    of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because of this, thermal imagery has become increasingly
    important in monitoring of water status for irrigation management [5] in crops
    such as coffee [6], cereals [7,8], and soybean and cotton [9]. Thermal infrared
    temperature maps can be used to estimate LWP and create LWP maps at the field
    scale. In turn, the LWP maps may be used to delineate LWP-based irrigation management
    zones (IMZs) for site-specific irrigation [10]. The spatial resolution of currently
    available satellite-based thermal imagery is not fine enough to identify crop
    water status patterns at the field scale. Satellite platforms such as Terra MODIS
    (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration–Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer) have
    a very high temporal resolution (1 day), but a coarse spatial resolution of 1
    km [11]. Conversely, Landsat Thematic Mapper—TM, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper
    Plus—ETM+, and Landsat Operational Land Imager—OLI, have higher spatial resolution
    of 120, 60, and 100 m respectively, but a low revisit time of 16 days. While Landsat
    datasets have a finer resolution, its low temporal resolution is not adequate
    for frequent monitoring required during the growing season for irrigation decisions.
    The occurrence of clouds can further decrease the availability of usable images.
    To address this tradeoff problem between low-resolution images with high revisit
    time and high-resolution images with low revisit time, sharpening methodologies
    to downscale TIR coarse resolution have been proposed [12]. These techniques to
    disaggregate land surface temperature (LST) are found in the literature under
    a variety of terms, such as thermal sharpening, subpixel temperature estimation,
    downscaling LST, component temperature retrieval, spatial enhancement of LST,
    and others [13], but they can be classified into two main categories, called temperature
    unmixing and thermal sharpening. The main difference between these two groups
    is that in temperature unmixing, the goal is to decompose the coarse mixed pixel
    temperature into its existing elements through temporal, spatial, and spectral
    observations, while thermal sharpening aims to enhance the thermal image by exploring
    the correlation between LST and auxiliary data such as vegetation cover [14].
    Thermal sharpening is the category most frequently used for downscaling thermal
    images. One of the earliest works using spatial sharpening dates back to 1985,
    wherein Landsat-4 Thematic Mapper (TM) thermal imagery was sharpened to 30 m resolution
    using a multiband least squares method [15]. This approach was possible due to
    the high correlation between the TM bands in agricultural scenes. A thermal image
    estimate was created using a coefficient predicted from Landsat-4 TM visible and
    infrared bands that was then used to enhance the spatial resolution on the original
    thermal band. Over the last 30 years, a variety of new sharpening algorithms have
    been suggested including the thermal sharpening (TsHARP) technique that was improved
    from the Disaggregation procedure for radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad)
    algorithm developed by Kustas et al. [16]. The DisTrad method uses the relationship
    between radiometric surface temperature and the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) to disaggregate temperature data at the NDVI finer image resolution.
    The NDVI resolution is first aggregated to the coarser resolution of the brightness
    temperature (BT) image and a second degree polynomial least-squares regression
    is fitted between the two variables. In this study, airborne images were used
    to estimate temperatures over the southern Great Plains by sharpening MODIS images
    to 200 m and provided temperature errors of ~1.5 °C. Agam et al. [11] proposed
    an improvement from the DisTrad algorithm by using vegetation fraction as the
    dependent variable instead of NDVI. Different types of land cover in a scene can
    cause increased number of outliers in the two ends of NDVI values. A summary study
    published in 2013 [13] indicated that Landsat TM and Terra Advanced Spaceborne
    Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) were the satellite platforms
    most frequently used for LST disaggregation. At the time, MODIS was a much younger
    platform, and since then has become widely utilized in downscaling approaches
    due to the high temporal frequency in which images are made available. With MODIS
    images collected on a daily basis, the availability of datasets for sharpening
    during the growing season depends on the satellite platforms used to derive visual
    and NIR (VNIR) data. Landsat 7 ETM+ [14,17] and Landsat-8 OLI [18] are commonly
    used to build the LST-NDVI regression and can generate roughly two sharpened images.
    Sentinel-2 has a higher revisit time and offers the potential of more sharpened
    images during the season. Clouds may greatly reduce the availability of useable
    images, especially in areas with frequent cloud cover. Sentinel-2 is a two-satellite
    platform operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the Copernicus
    earth observation program which became operational [19] in 2015. The two satellites
    are in the same orbit but spaced 180° apart. They provide data in 13 different
    spectral bands (443–2190 nm) with spatial resolutions of 10, 30, and 60 m and
    a revisit time of 5 days. Sanchez et al. [20] used Sentinel-2 VNIR data to sharpen
    MODIS images to a 10 m resolution over experimental fields in southeastern Spain.
    Over a period of 2 months, they sharpened LST images on 6 different days. In 2017,
    a super-spectral micro-satellite resulting from a partnership between the Israel
    Space Agency (ISA) and the French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) was
    launched [21,22]. The Vegetation and Environment New micro-Spacecraft (VENµS)
    was intended to increase land data acquisition to, among other purposes, improve
    modeling of vegetation processes. This minisatellite has a revisit time of 2 days,
    a spatial resolution of 5.3 m, and a spectral resolution of 12 bands (420–910
    nm). Although the unique features of this low-orbit satellite show great potential
    for increased dataset frequency, to our knowledge, no studies have explored the
    use of VENµS in thermal sharpening methodologies. The majority of sharpening studies
    cited above explored the use of sharpening for large scene scales. However, very
    few studies have been conducted exploring the feasibility of using this technique
    in crop fields to aid in management decisions. In this context, the main goal
    of this work was to assess the use of the TsHARP technique to sharpen MODIS images
    using Sentinel-2 and VENµS in the southeastern USA at field scale and to assess
    if sharpened images have the potential to be used at the field scale for delineating
    irrigation management zones (IMZs) for variable rate irrigation in cotton. Applying
    this technique to this region is especially challenging because of frequent cloud
    cover during the growing season. The TsHARP use at scene scale was also assessed.
    Specific objectives were to compare the performance of the TsHARP technique using
    data from the two satellite platforms on overlapping dates. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Study Sites This study was conducted in three different locations of the
    southeastern USA in which cotton is an important crop (Figure 1) using imagery
    from the 2019 growing season. The first and second study sites are located in
    southwestern Georgia and centered around 84°44′28″W, 31°11′28″N, and 84°33′7″W,
    31°26′42″N. The third study site is located in northeastern Mississippi centered
    around 88°51′42″W, 34°31′58″N. The Miller County scene (hereafter referred as
    to scene 1) is mostly composed of cotton fields, followed by woody wetlands, pine
    forest, and peanut fields. Land cover in scene 2, located in Baker County, Georgia,
    was 40% woody wetlands followed by pine forest, and cotton and peanut fields.
    The land cover in scene 3, located around Union County, Mississippi, was composed
    mostly of various types of forest, followed by pasture and soybean fields. All
    locations have similar subtropical climates with high humidity and hot summers,
    with the average air temperature of the hottest month (July) being equal to or
    greater than 22 °C [23,24]. The minimum and maximum average temperatures from
    July to November in the last 20 years were 15.6 and 27.4 °C [25]. Figure 1. Study
    locations for (a) the polygons used to define the satellite scenes and Sentinel-2
    false color composite of scenes used for thermal sharpening for study sites in
    (b) Miller County, Georgia (Scene 1) (c) Baker County, Georgia (Scene 2) and (d)
    Union County, Mississippi (Scene 3). The United States Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service’s (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL)
    hosted by CropScape (https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/ (accessed on 9 July
    2020)) was used to identify fields that were planted with cotton during the 2019
    growing season. Extensive agricultural ground truth data acquired from the Common
    Land Unit (CLU) data from the USDA Farm Services Agency (FSA) is coupled with
    moderate resolution satellite images to create yearly crop-specific land cover
    maps of the whole continental United States [26]. A total of 22 cotton fields
    were identified for this study, with field sizes ranging from 14 to 164 ha (Table
    A1). 2.2. Satellite Images Acquisition and Processing Thermal images from MODIS
    and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were acquired in all three locations
    on dates within the cotton growing period ranging from August to November 2019
    (Table 1). The MODIS product used was MODIS/Thermal Bands Daily L2B-Lite Global
    (MODTBGA), and it was download from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) Earth Data Search website (https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search (accessed
    on 15 April 2020)). MODTBGA version 6 is available daily with a spatial resolution
    of 1 km (km) with sinusoidal projection, and it consists of brightness temperature
    data from three MODIS bands (bands 20, 31, and 32) [27]. After download, MODIS
    images were pre-processed using ArcGIS (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). In ArcMap version
    10.2.2 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA), MODIS band 31 was re-projected to the World
    Geodetic System (WGS) 1984 zone 16, and a scale factor of 0.01 was used to obtain
    brightness temperature values. Landsat-8 OLI images were downloaded directly from
    the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/
    (accessed on 20 April 2020)). Landsat-8 provides images with 15 (panchromatic),
    30, and 100 m (thermal) spatial resolution. However, thermal bands are disaggregated
    to 30 m resolution images by the Landsat Science team and are made publicly available.
    Landsat-8 pre-processing was performed by using the Semi-Automatic Classification
    Plugin (SCP) in QGIS 3.14.0 (QGIS Development Team, 2020) [28]. SCP offers pre-processing
    and post-processing tools for a variety of satellite images [29]. Radiometric
    calibration was performed on Landsat-8 thermal infrared band 10 (10.6–11.19 μm),
    where the DOS1 (Dark Object Subtraction) atmospheric correction technique was
    used to convert data to Top of Atmosphere (TOA), and correct for solar irradiance
    effects. SCP was also used to convert values to brightness temperature in Celsius.
    Table 1. Satellites’ data acquisition dates for all three locations and selected
    dates for field scale validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
    MODIS for both Sentinel-2 and VENµS (gray). Visual-near infrared (VNIR) data from
    Sentinel-2 was used for sharpening in all three locations. Images were downloaded
    from the USGS Earth Explorer website. SCP was used to perform atmospheric correction
    in all Sentinel-2A images. The SCP used DOS1 atmospheric correction for Sentinel-2
    images as well. Band 8 (842 nm) and band 4 (665 nm) were used to calculate NDVI.
    VNIR images from VENµS were also utilized for thermal sharpening of MODIS. VENµS
    data were only available for the scenes in Georgia (Miller and Baker counties).
    Images were download from the Theia Data and Services Center for continental surfaces
    (https://www.theia-land.fr/en/data-and-services-for-the-land/ (accessed on 20
    April 2020)). VENµS-based NDVI was calculated using bands 11 (865 nm) and 5 (620
    nm) from the level 2 product. VENµS level 2 product provides fine cloud and shadow
    mask, and it is already atmospherically corrected. Due to the differences in satellite
    temporal resolution, and frequent cloud coverage during the summer in the study
    areas, the difference in acquisition date among the satellites used for TsHARP
    implementation (MODIS, Sentinel-2, and VENµS) was up to one day and up to five
    days for validation (MODIS and Landsat-8). 2.3. TsHARP Methodology As described
    previously, the TsHARP technique is based on the inverse relationship between
    LST and vegetation cover. The fractional vegetation cover (fc) is estimated from
    NDVI using Equation (1) [30]: 𝑓c=1− ( NDVI max −NDVI NDVI max − NDVI min ) 0.625
    (1) where NDVImax and NDVImin are the maximum and minimum NDVI values in the scene
    and NDVI is the index value in an individual pixel. The fc image is aggregated
    to a coarser resolution to match with the coarse resolution of the LST image,
    and an empirical linear regression model is fitted, as shown by Equation (2):
    𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 =a+b𝑓 c 𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 (2) where a and b are the intercept and slope resulting
    from the linear regression between LST and fc at coarse resolution. Coefficients
    a and b are then applied to the fine-resolution fc data (fc fine) and fine-resolution
    NDVI to predict LST at a finer resolution (Equation (3)) [19]. Coefficients a
    and b are also applied to the fc image at coarse resolution to derive a new LST
    image. The difference between the original LST image and the newly derived image
    is used to calculate the residual error image at coarse resolution. The residual
    error image is then disaggregated to a fine resolution and applied to the LST
    at finer resolution to increase the prediction accuracy (Equation (4)). A detailed
    explanation of the TsHARP algorithm was provided by Agam et al. [11]. 𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒
    =a+b𝑓 c 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒 (3) 𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 =𝐿𝑆 𝑇 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒 +𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 (4) 2.4. TsHARP Validation
    and Assessment The complete workflow of the TsHARP technique can be divided into
    two steps (Figure 2. Flowchart of the thermal sharpening (TsHARP) methodology,
    including inputs, outputs, and processing steps, and methodology validation using
    Landsat-8 images (modified after Huryna et al. [19]). The first step is the sharpening
    of MODIS images using Sentinel-2- and VENµS-derived NDVI to finer resolutions.
    The second step is the validation of the method by comparing the sharpened temperature
    with a reference temperature from Landsat-8 images at 30, 60, 120, and 240 m spatial
    resolution. The TsHARP validation was performed by fitting a linear regression
    model to MODIS BT and Landsat-8 BT images in the coarse and finer resolutions.
    The validation was performed at the scene scale for all dates for which images
    were downloaded and for selected dates at the field scale (See Table 1). Figure
    2. Flowchart of the thermal sharpening (TsHARP) methodology, including inputs,
    outputs, and processing steps, and methodology validation using Landsat-8 images
    (modified after Huryna et al. [19]). The methodology performance assessment was
    estimated using different quantitative statistics approaches [31]. Coefficient
    of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE),
    and bias (Equations (5)–(8)) were calculated to estimate the level of agreement
    between predicted and reference temperatures: 𝑅 2 =1− ∑ ( 𝑇 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑝 − 𝑇 𝑟𝑒𝑓  ) 2

    The thermal sharpening validation was performed for a total of 14 dates using
    the MODIS/Sentinel-2 and MODIS/VENµS BT-NDVI regressions (Table 1). 3.1.1. Sensors’
    Comparison at Coarse Resolution The correlations between MODIS brightness temperature
    (BT) and aggregated Landsat-8 BT at coarse resolution are shown in Figure 3. Results
    showed that the correlations between the BT of the two sensors were similar towards
    the end of the season (end of October and beginning of November) when average
    temperatures were in the low 20 °C or below, with coefficients of determination
    (R2) ranging from 0.68 in scene 1 to 0.74 in scene 3. The regression model coefficients,
    however, were different. Despite having the highest R2 among the three scenes,
    the sensor comparison of scene 3 presented the highest RMS error and positive
    bias of 3.54 °C. In scenes 1 and 2, the RMS errors in this period were below 1.25
    °C, with a negative bias lower than 0.95. Figure 3. Relationship between MODIS
    BT and Landsat-8 BT at coarse resolution (930 m) in selected periods for Sentinel-2
    at (a) scene 1 (Miller County, GA, USA), (b) scene 2 (Baker County, GA, USA),
    and (c) scene 3 (Union County, MS, USA). MODIS acquisition dates were used as
    the reference date. In the months of August and September, correlations were overall
    lower, and varied with location. The lowest R2 values were observed in scene 1
    (0.31) followed by the third date in scene 3 (0.41) and first date in scene 2
    (0.44). The low relationship in these three dates can be attributed to cloud coverage
    in one or more images. Parts of the respective scenes were cropped to exclude
    areas affected by the clouds, substantially decreasing the number of pixels. In
    addition, methods utilized to mask clouds were not effective in removing areas
    under the clouds’ shadow. The combination of reduced number of pixels and BT values
    affected by cloud shadow led to a weaker relationship between sensor responses.
    A negative bias was observed in 7 out of 9 dates and indicates that temperatures
    extracted from MODIS scene were cooler when compared to Landsat-8. The comparison
    between these two sensors yielded RMS errors no higher than 1.92 °C in 6 out of
    9 dates. In the second date of scene 2, and the first and last dates in scene
    3, the RMSE values observed were higher, with errors ranging from 2.75 to 3.45
    °C. In 2 out of these 3 dates, the bias was positive and not negative like in
    most of the dates. No clear factors were found that can explain these deviations.
    Similar results were observed in the selected dates for VENµS analysis (Figure
    4). As mentioned earlier, VENµS images were only available for the two scenes
    in Georgia. The relationship between MODIS BT and Landsat BT was strong at the
    end of October when temperatures were lower, and weaker in the months of August
    and September. In the remaining dates, R2 values in scene 2 were again stronger
    than the ones observed in scene 1. The RMS errors varied between 1.03 to 2.14
    °C in both locations. Similar to MODIS/Sentinel-2 sharpening, a negative bias
    was observed for 3 out of 5 dates, while a positive bias was obtained for the
    other 2 dates. Figure 4. Relationship between MODIS BT and Landsat-8 BT at coarse
    resolution (930 m) in selected periods for VENµS at (a) scene 1 and (b) scene
    2. MODIS acquisition dates were used as the reference date. A study conducted
    in 2014 [32] reported differences between MODIS and Landsat satellite LST spatial
    distribution. Maximum temperatures showed a difference of about 15 °C. The range
    between minimum and maximum temperatures from Landsat were always wider than observed
    in MODIS (Table 2). In the study described here, towards the end of October, most
    of the crops were already harvested and fields had exposed soil, causing a more
    evident BT difference between dense vegetation and exposed soil, which could be
    more easily detected by the coarse spatial resolution from MODIS. During the months
    of August, September, and mid-October, most fields in the scenes still had vegetation
    cover from the crops, thus temperature changes were more subtle across different
    land covers. These subtle changes were depicted in the finer resolution from Landsat,
    leading to a wider range of temperature values compared to the smaller range from
    MODIS, resulting in a lower R2. Table 2. Scene minimum, maximum, and temperature
    ranges for MODIS (1 km) and Landsat-8 (30 m) original images. Coarse resolution
    sensor comparison showed that the BT range values of Landsat were always wider
    than observed in MODIS (Table 2). At one date (8/29), the Landsat BT range was
    double the MODIS BT and the max difference was as high as 6.4 °C. Similar results
    were observed by Weng et al. [32] when comparing Landsat TM LST to MODIS. In the
    two dates used in their study, similarities were observed only between minimum
    surface temperatures. Landsat TM maximum temperatures were considerably higher
    than in MODIS, causing great discrepancies in LST spatial patterns. Essa et al.
    [33] stated that surface temperature from MODIS were substantially lower than
    Landsat 7 ETM+ temperatures. A 5 °C mean temperature difference between the two
    sensors was achieved on six occasions. The results from 10 out of 14 dates examined
    in this paper showed a similar trend, where a negative bias was found between
    the two sensors. This consistently lower temperature presented by MODIS when comparing
    with Landsat sensors can be described as a systematic bias. Yet, the fact that
    some occasions showed different trends casts a shadow over this determination.
    The concept of systematic bias was discussed by Liu et al. [34]. A consistent
    bias between two satellites could be introduced by sensor measurement errors such
    as random noise. Satellite sensor-specific characteristics such as bandwidth,
    acquisition time, and orbit parameters are further causes of bias [32]. 3.1.2.
    TsHARP Validation Landsat-8 thermal images were aggregated to 60, 120, and 240
    m to perform validation at the four spatial resolutions proposed, including Landsat’s
    original resolution of 30 m. Table 3 and Table 4 show the statistics of sharpened
    images compared to reference maps in all the scenes studied using both VENµS-
    and Sentinel-2-based NDVI, respectively. Validation of thermal sharpening resulted
    in an overall higher R2 than only comparing sensor brightness temperatures at
    coarse resolution. Sharpened accuracy was higher in coarser resolutions (120 and
    240 m) in 10 of the 14 dates analyzed. In most remaining dates in which accuracy
    at 240 m was slightly lower than finer resolutions, portions of the scene had
    to be excluded prior to the analysis due to cloud cover. The decrease in the number
    of pixels in the 240 m resolution could have affected the sharpening accuracy.
    Based on the results, sharpening efficiency tended to decrease with increased
    targeted resolution. These findings are corroborated by results observed by Huryna
    et al. [19]. In their study, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-3 thermal imagery were resampled
    and then sharpened to 240, 120, and 60 m resolutions using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2,
    respectively. In both cases, R2 values decreased and temperature uncertainty values
    increased as resolution increased, with highest error values of 1.17 and 1.45
    °C for Landsat and Sentinel-3, respectively. Table 3. Quantitative analysis of
    sharpened thermal maps using VENµS-derived normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI) in comparison to reference images from Landsat. Lag shows the difference
    in days between sharpened and Landsat-8 images. Table 4. Quantitative analysis
    of sharpened thermal maps using Sentinel-2-derived NDVI in comparison to reference
    images from Landsat. Lag shows the difference in days between sharpened and Landsat-8
    images. The coefficient of determination for Sentinel-2 validation dates in scene
    1 ranged from 0.55 at 30 m resolution to 0.76 at 240 m, with highest values occurring
    on 28 October, while for VENµS dates, the lowest value was 0.48 at 30 m, and the
    highest value was 0.8 at 240 m (Table 4). In scene 2, the method’s accuracy in
    dates available tended to be higher than achieved in scene 1 for both Sentinel-2
    and VENµS dates, with only three R2 values below 0.6. Remaining values for Sentinel-2
    varied from 0.6 to 0.8 and for VENµS, from 0.63 to 0.79. In this scene (scene
    1), the three weakest relationships were observed at the finer resolutions of
    30 and 60 m. Scene 3 displayed a similar performance as the two previous scenes,
    with values ranging from 0.50 to 0.77, except on 3 October, wherein the Landsat-8
    image had large areas in the middle of the scene covered by clouds and cloud shadow
    that were difficult to remove. The remaining affected pixels that were not excluded
    by the masking process affected the accuracy of validation. A 3 days difference
    in acquisition time between sharpened and reference images was observed and could
    have also been a cause of higher error, although no trend between error magnitude
    and time lag between satellites was observed. Validation of sharpened maps had
    slightly higher RMS errors than the sensors’ BT comparison at coarse resolution,
    with uncertainty increasing as the aimed resolution became finer. The highest
    errors were observed in the first and third dates of scene 3, with error values
    around 3.04 and 3.78 °C. It is worth emphasizing that MODIS and Landsat had a
    1-day difference in acquisition time when the highest error of almost 4 °C was
    observed. Lowest overall errors were observed in the last date of scene 2 for
    both Sentinel-2 and VENµS selected dates, with uncertainty around 1 °C at 240
    m spatial resolution. Although MAE values also tended to increase with increased
    resolution, its response was not the same as RMSE. Images sharpened to 120 and
    240 m resulted in MAEs similar or even lower than the mean errors from the temperature
    comparison at coarse resolution. Figure 5 shows the temperature error (sharpened
    T (°C) − reference T (°C)) maps at 60 m resolution at the three individual scenes
    and their respective land cover types. Error maps were created from MODIS/Sentinel-2
    from 27 October in scene 1, 28 October in scene 2, and 29 August in scene 3. Error
    maps were selected from dates in which there was a maximum of 1-day lag between
    images. In general, the sharpened BT was lower than the reference temperature.
    This corresponds with the systematic bias found with the sensor comparison in
    this paper. Scene 3 is composed in its majority by various types of forests with
    a lower percentage of grassland and small areas of sparse vegetation (crop fields)
    (Figure 5g). The low variability in land cover type in this scene led to a more
    homogeneous temperature error distribution (Figure 5h). Brightness temperatures
    were underestimated across the whole scene, with forest areas presenting the biggest
    differences in temperature between sharpened and reference maps. The land cover
    distribution in scenes 1 and 2 are more varied between dense and sparse vegetation
    (Figure 5a,d). Differently from scene 3, sharpened temperatures in scenes 1 and
    2 were frequently overestimated in woody wetlands and underestimated in cultivated
    fields with sparse vegetation and/or exposed soil. The higher variability in temperature
    errors across different land covers resulted in a lower accuracy of sharpening
    in these two scenes in Georgia when compared to the scene in Mississippi. Figure
    5. Land cover maps of (a) scene 1, (d) scene 2, and (g) scene 3, (b,e,h) are the
    respective temperature error maps (sharpened T (°C) − reference T (°C)) at 60
    m resolution, and (c,f,i) are the respective error histograms. Error maps/histograms
    presented were created from MODIS/Sentinel-2 sharpening from the last date of
    scenes 1 and 2, and first date of scene 3. Highest errors were observed in areas
    covered by wetland and bare soil. Huryna et al. [19] achieved conflicting results
    when sharpening Sentinel-3 images, with temperatures being underestimated over
    dense vegetation and overestimated over agricultural fields, with errors of 1.5
    to 3 °C in riparian areas. The bias between original MODIS and Landsat-8 images
    at coarse resolution were similar to errors seen at finer resolution and might
    help explain the conflicting results between the two studies. Great variability
    in the TsHARP performance was observed among the scenes and dates. LST–NDVI relationships
    were higher in the scenes with more homogenous land cover, resulting in overall
    higher accuracy. A high-temperature sharpening performance can be achieved when
    there is a good correlation between LST and vegetation cover [35]. Nevertheless,
    the linear relationship expected between LST and vegetation fraction does not
    always hold, leading to increased sharpening errors. Factors such as albedo and
    soil moisture can cause great variations in LST in areas with low NDVI [11]. The
    different moisture levels in these areas cause great variability in evaporation
    that drives surface temperatures to be lower or higher [35,36]. This temperature
    variation is hardly detected by the vegetation index, resulting in a triangular
    shape in the NDVI–LST feature space. Further causes of error can be associated
    to situations that do not follow the LST–NDVI inverse relationship. When in high
    air temperature and sunlight conditions with limited water availability, low LST
    values are expected in high NDVI areas such as dense vegetation due to high transpiration
    [37,38]. However, in a scenario in which energy is the limiting factor, transpiration
    and evaporation are decreased, leading to an often-positive correlation between
    NDVI and LST. These findings suggest that the LST–NDVI relationship is geographically
    variable. The use of geographically weighted regression-based algorithms might
    be beneficial to address local variations in LST–NDVI correlation [39]. 3.1.3.
    TsHARP Validation Comparison between VENµS and Sentinel-2 The validation results
    of MODIS coarse images’ thermal sharpening using VENµS VNIR was compared to results
    from sharpening using Setninel-2 on 28 October at scenes 1 and 2 (Figure 6). The
    sharpening performance using both satellites was comparable for both scenes, yielding
    similar temperature errors, accuracy, and bias. The relationship between sharpened
    and reference temperatures was strong in all instances with values ranging from
    0.68 to 0.80, and temperature uncertainty ranging from 1 to 1.47 °C. Although
    similar, MODIS/Sentinel-2 performance was slightly higher at 120 and 240 m in
    scene 2 when compared to scene 1, with R2 values of 0.77 and 0.8, while VENµS
    sharpening showed higher accuracy in scene 1 at all four different spatial resolutions.
    MODIS/VENµS was also slightly more accurate than MODIS/Sentinel-2 in scene 1 in
    all spatial resolutions, with R2 values of 0.71 and 0.69 at 30 m, 0.75 and 0.72
    at 60 m, 0.78 and 0.75 at 120 m, and 0.80 and 0.76 at 240 m resolutions for MODIS/VENµS
    and MODIS/Sentinel-2 respectively, while in scene 2, both models had the same
    R2 at 30 and 60 m, with Sentinel-2 achieving higher R2 at 120 and 240 m. Overall,
    scene 2 showed lower RMSE, MAE, and bias than scene 1 in both models, with highest
    values of 1.16, 0.93, and −0.80 for VENµS, and 1.18, 0.96, and −0.80 for Sentinel-2,
    respectively. Figure 6. Quantitative statistics of TsHARP validation yielded by
    MODIS sharpening using (a) scheme 2 and (b) VENµS at scenes 1 and 2. 3.2. Field
    Scale Field boundaries were extracted from sharpened and reference images at 30,
    60, 120, and 240 m to perform validation at a field scale for each individual
    field. The field selection criteria relied solely on the crop cultivated. Cotton
    fields were identified using USDA-NASS CropScape data layer from 2019. 3.2.1.
    MODIS/Sentinel-2 TsHARP Validation The validation of the sharpening algorithm
    in scene 2 was performed in eight fields on 9 September (Figure 7). An overall
    strong relationship between sharpened and reference temperatures was observed
    in fields 1 and 3 across all spatial resolutions, with R2 values ranging from
    0.60 at 30 m to 0.94 at 240 m, and 0.64 at 30 m to 0.88 at 120 m, respectively.
    The weakest relationships were observed for fields 8 and 4, wherein the model’s
    accuracy was below 0.5 in all resolutions. Remaining fields showed strong relationships
    at 60, 120, and 240 m, with the exception of field 5, in which higher accuracy
    was obtained only at coarser resolutions of 120 and 240 m. Only three fields showed
    moderate to strong relationships at the finest targeted resolution, while for
    the other resolutions, temperature estimation results were more reliable, with
    most fields having higher accuracy maps. Temperature uncertainty of higher than
    2 °C was obtained for fields 1, 2, and 5, while field 6 resulted in errors lower
    than 1 °C (Figure 7b). Figure 7. Quantitative statistics between sharpened and
    reference temperatures at field scale for fields selected in scene 2, including
    (a) coefficient of determination (b) RMSE, and bias. The negative bias shown in
    all areas indicated an underestimation of BT when compared to reference data and
    it is consistent with the results obtained for the scene scale. The residual errors
    resulted from the linear regression between BT and NDVI showed errors ranging
    from −0.5 to 1 °C in the areas that fields were located. Nevertheless, temperature
    underestimation in sharpened maps was as high as 2.5 °C in some fields, likely
    due to a discrepancy in temperatures collected by both thermal sensors in these
    specific areas, rather than due to a weak relationship between BT and NDVI. This
    temperature difference can be a result of biases caused by sensor parameters such
    as bandwidth, acquisition time, and geolocation errors [32]. The field scale validation
    results for scene 3 are shown in Figure 8. Due to the lower number of cotton fields
    in this scene and their smaller size, only five fields were selected for analysis.
    Nevertheless, a higher number of dates throughout the growing season were available
    for validation. Figure 8. Quantitative statistics between sharpened and reference
    temperatures at field scale for fields selected in scene 3 on three different
    dates, including coefficient of determination on (a) 29 August (b) 15 September
    and (c) 3 October, and (d–f) RMSE and bias for the same dates, respectively. High
    performances were observed in September (Figure 8b,e) and October (Figure 8c,f),
    in which most fields showed a strong relationship between sharpened and reference
    temperatures coupled with the low-temperature errors. A positive bias in September
    indicates that temperatures were overestimated at an average of 0.95 °C in all
    fields. Despite the high agreement between sharpened and reference temperatures
    observed for all fields in August, in one or more resolutions, temperature error
    was higher than in subsequent months (Figure 8a,d). Spatial resolutions of 60
    and 120 m displayed the most consistent results along the three dates, with strong
    relationships in most fields. High R2 values were observed in four out of five
    fields at 60 m resolution on the second and third dates, and two fields on the
    first date, while at 120 m, all five fields had strong relationships on the first
    date, four on the third, and three on the second. Sharpened maps at 30 m had the
    weakest performance, with a maximum of 2 fields presenting moderate relationships
    and overall temperature errors higher than coarser resolutions. Maps at 240 m
    had weaker performance in this scene due to the low or insufficient number of
    pixels for correlation caused by the smaller field sizes. The resulting statistics
    indicated that the thermal sharpening of coarse MODIS images at the four finer
    resolutions are field-specific. The accuracy of sharpened temperatures in field
    5 was high at all resolutions on the first date and was consistently high at 60
    and 120 m in subsequent months. High-temperature maps’ accuracy was observed in
    at least three resolutions at fields 2 and 3 in September and October, and at
    240 m in the first month. The weakest performance was observed in field 4, in
    which sharpened maps had very low accuracy among all dates in most spatial resolutions
    when compared to Landsat reference temperatures. The fields that showed the strongest
    (field 5) and the weakest performances (field 4) were located side by side in
    the scene, suggesting that the sharpening results might be affected by field individual
    characteristics, planting date, and management practices. High agreement between
    sharpened and reference maps at 60 m resolution was observed in field 1 for all
    three dates (Figure 9). Despite the higher temperature difference between sharpened
    and reference maps in August, the BT distribution patterns still showed great
    similarities. A high correlation between sharpened and reference maps was also
    shown on the subsequent dates. The high agreement between sharpened and reference
    maps shown in the validation process evidences great consistency in the TsHARP
    results. The robust results from the use of Sentinel-2 VNIR for sharpening presented
    in this study are corroborated by studies previously mentioned [19,20]. Figure

    reference temperature maps. (g–i) Temperature error maps (sharpened T (°C)–reference

    3.2.2. MODIS/VENµS TsHARP Validation Figure 10 shows the quantitative statistics
    for TsHARP validation at two different dates in scene 1. The algorithm’s performance
    presented variability between dates and areas, as previously observed. The model’s
    accuracy was consistent across three out of the nine fields selected, with strong
    relationships in all resolutions in field 6 at both dates, and at the second date
    for fields 2 and 5. On 29 August, high-accuracy sharpened maps for fields 2 and
    5 were observed at 60 and 120 m only. Fields 7 and 8 showed high R2 values between
    sharpened and reference temperatures only at the coarser resolutions of 120 and
    240 m, while in remaining fields, the overall accuracy was low either on all or
    one of the dates. Disaggregated maps at 120, 240, and 60 m resolutions were the
    most consistent in terms of correlation with reference temperature maps. Temperature
    uncertainty was relatively low in most fields at both dates, with values ranging
    from 1.25 to 2.17 °C in August and 0.66 to 2.13 °C in September. An overestimation
    of sharpened temperatures was observed in August with a positive bias of 2.17
    °C, while in September, sharpened temperatures were up to 2.01 °C lower than reference
    temperatures. On this date, temperature overestimation was observed only in field
    4, in which sharpened temperatures were on average 0.66 °C higher than the reference.
    Figure 10. Quantitative statistics between sharpened and reference temperatures
    at field scale for fields selected in scene 1 including coefficient of determination,
    (a) 29 August and (b) 10 September, and (c,d) RMSE and bias for respective dates.
    In scene 2, the MODIS images’ sharpening using VENµS NDVI was validated on one
    date in the beginning of September, with three days difference from the MODIS/Sentinel-2-derived
    sharpened image (Figure 11). A field scale comparison between these two sharpened
    maps was not performed because of the time difference, however similarities in
    the results were observed. Fields 8 and 4 had weak relationships between sharpened
    and reference temperatures in all spatial resolutions, repeating the weak performance
    seen in the MODIS/Sentinel-2 scene. These results suggest that the poor accuracy
    of the sharpened maps was caused by subfield land cover variability that was not
    depicted in the coarse MODIS pixel resolution, such as a mix of exposed soil and
    canopy cover. The possible effects of different field conditions will be discussed
    in the next subsection. Figure 11. Quantitative statistics between sharpened and
    reference temperatures at field scale for fields selected in scene 2 including
    (a) coefficient of determination and (b) RMSE and bias. Overall, sharpening accuracy
    was high at 60, 120, and 240 m, with at least half of the fields showing R2 values
    higher than 0.62. Only three fields had moderate to strong relationship at 30
    m, with the highest value of 0.68. Overall, RMS errors were below 1.73 at all
    four resolutions. Temperature uncertainty as low as 0.25 °C was achieved at 240
    m in field 2 and as low as 0.38 °C at 30 m. Bias indicated that sharpened temperatures
    were overestimated in all fields (Figure 11b). High-accuracy sharpened maps were
    achieved for all resolutions in field 3 (Figure 12). Sharpened map with 30 m pixel
    size provided the most detailed insight in the BT distribution in the field (Figure
    12a). The same BT patterns were maintained when pixel size was doubled, and sharpening
    accuracy increased from 0.68 to 0.8 (Figure 12e,f). The two coarser maps presented
    even higher accuracy of 0.89 and 0.86, but temperature distribution patterns in
    the field became harder to identify (Figure 12c,d). Exposed soil at the northern
    part and in the middle of the lower half of the field, most likely caused by erosion
    processes over the years, resulted in an overestimation of sharpened temperatures
    in those pixels. In these areas, sharpened temperatures were around 30.8 °C, while
    in the reference image, the same pixels varied from 28 to 29 °C, causing a decrease
    in the overall accuracy at 30 m. Background soil reflectance can also affect the
    sharpening performance throughout the season, once the low vegetation cover in
    the first stages of crop development can lead to high amounts of mixed pixel reflectance
    and consequently, an overestimation of canopy sharpened temperatures. Figure 12.
    Field 3 sharpening maps of MODIS images using VENµS at (a) 30 (b) 60 (c) 120 and
    (d) 240 m resolution, and (e–h) the respective validation regressions. Disaggregation
    methods are often studied in large scene scales. Few authors have attempted to
    use this methodology for small agricultural areas. Sánchez et al. [20] used Sentinel-2
    to sharpen MODIS coarse thermal images to 10 m resolutions over a semi-arid agricultural
    area in southeast Spain. An average temperature uncertainty of 2 °C was observed.
    Temperature errors between 2 and 3 °C were observed by Bisquert et al. [14]. In
    a simulated experiment, Landsat 7 thermal images were aggregated to coarse resolution
    and then sharpened, achieving temperature uncertainty of ~1 °C [40]. In the present
    study, temperature errors for field scale ranged from 0.25 to 3.11 °C using both
    Sentinel-2 and VENµS, following results found by the other authors. Furthermore,
    it has been reported that absolute temperature errors of up to 1.5 °K are suitable
    for agricultural management decisions [20,41,42]. Results from this paper are
    encouraging. A great number of fields presented low errors at 240 and 120 m, and
    at the finer resolutions of 60 m and in lesser cases of 30 m. The high-accuracy
    maps generated from this methodology with relatively low errors show a great potential
    in the use of TsHARP in MODIS/Sentinel-2 and MODIS/VENµS combinations for field
    scale. Figure 13 shows field 3 sharpened temperature distribution in relation
    to air temperature on 5 days throughout the growing season from June to September
    at 60 m resolution. Air-canopy temperature difference is a well-recognized indicator
    of water stress in cotton [43,44]. Field canopy temperatures in June were less
    than 3 °C below air temperature, while in August and September, this difference
    was as high as 5 °C. Air-canopy temperature distribution was very similar throughout
    the field in the first and last dates. In the dates from mid-June to early September,
    a slight variability in air-canopy temperature distribution is observed. The use
    of a high spatial resolution satellite such as VENµS with high revisit time to
    sharpen coarse thermal images presents great potential to enable a more frequent
    monitoring of canopy temperature changes across the field throughout the growing
    season, with a fine resolution with the aim to identify crop water stress patterns
    in the field for management zone delineation. It is important to note that for
    a better estimation of plant water status, the sharpened BT values should be converted
    to LST [45]. Figure 13. Field 3 time series of canopy temperature (Tc) - air temperature
    (Tair) distribution throughout the season. Canopy temperature used was extracted
    from the sharpened temperature maps. 3.2.3. Effects of In-Field Land Cover Variability
    on TsHARP Performance Two fields from scene 1 in Miller county were selected to
    demonstrate how different field conditions can positively or negatively affect
    the accuracy of resulting sharpened maps in a field scale. Figure 14 shows an
    example of the comparison between before and after exclusion of selected areas
    within fields 3 and 9. Land patches covered by vegetation other than the cultivated
    crop, roads, flow channels caused by erosion, exposed soil, and waterlogged areas
    were extracted from the field boundaries for validation (Figure 14e–h). These
    areas were usually responsible for decreasing the level of accuracy between reference
    (Figure 14a,c) and sharpened (Figure 14b,d) maps. This difference was likely caused
    by the sharpening technique reliance on the BT–NDVI relationship, once many of
    these land cover types mentioned have low NDVI values resulting in high sharpened
    temperatures, while reference images are dependent on the temperature variability
    itself and not on the NDVI patterns throughout the area. Figure 14. Field map
    comparison between reference and sharpened (MODIS/VENµS) maps before and after
    pixel removal. (a–d) Reference and sharpened maps of the whole area within fields
    3 and 9. (e–h) Visual imagery and field boundary for both fields. (i–l) Reference
    and sharpened maps after pixel extraction for fields 3 and 9. Reference and sharpened
    maps after the pixel removal process of fields 3 and 9 are shown in Figure 14i–l.
    Note that the temperature distribution at sharpened and reference maps appear
    to become more alike in field 3 after removal of unwanted pixels. A circular area
    around the pivot, a narrow road, and a waterlogged area were excluded in this
    field, increasing the sharpening accuracy. This stronger relationship between
    the two maps was likely due to two factors: (1) exposed soil pixels from the road
    had low NDVI values, resulting in finer pixels with overestimated temperature
    at the sharpened map, and (2) the two remaining excluded areas had high moisture,
    which explains the lower temperature relative to the rest of the field in the
    reference map, while in the sharpened map, pixel temperatures were higher in these
    areas than in the remaining field due to the low NDVI values of water patches
    and wet soil. Conversely, the extraction process did not yield the same results
    for field 9 once BT pattern differences were still evident in the remainder of
    the field. Based on the temperature range in the reference image and on the premise
    that stressed cotton plants are usually up to 5 °C above air temperature [46,47],
    it is possible to infer that the whole field was well-watered either due to rain
    or irrigation events. The TsHARP algorithm may not detect the moisture variability
    caused by irrigation, since it accounts for the subpixel temperature variability
    related to the vegetation fraction, thus making irrigation events a common source
    of error [40]. Although little information about most of the fields studied is
    known, it can be assumed that field-specific conditions are a determinant factor
    in the accuracy of sharpened temperatures. For instance, different authors have
    pointed out the limitations of thermal disaggregation in irrigated fields [14,48].
    Surface temperature can rapidly respond to water stress, while NDVI has a slower
    response after initial stress [36]. Agam et al. [40] discussed the importance
    of excluding selected pixels that do not conform to the inverse linear relationship
    between LST and vegetation fraction, such as water bodies that present both low
    NDVI and surface temperature. Furthermore, areas that have high NDVI variability
    may be a source of errors once this variability cannot be depicted by the coarse
    resolution pixels of MODIS images. Temperature data from field 9 collected with
    Landsat resulted in higher temperature along the entire west edge of the field,
    potentially due to a mixed pixel response between the crop and the grassed area
    adjacent to the field. However, vegetation cover in the same area was high, leading
    to an opposing result in the sharpened image. The observations on the effect of
    undesirable pixels’ removal on the thermal pixel disaggregation performance are
    reinforced by statistics shown in Figure 15. A higher level of agreement between
    the sharpened and reference temperatures was displayed after pixel extraction
    in field 3 on both dates, as well as a decrease in temperature errors, whereas
    in field 9, the accuracy decreased at 30 and 120 m, despite slightly lower errors
    being achieved. Figure 15. Fields 3 and 9 comparison statistics between sharpened
    and reference temperatures before and after pixel removal on 29 August and 10
    September, including (a) coefficient of determination and (b) RMSE. 4. Conclusions
    Corroborating findings found in the literature, results from this study highlighted
    the differences in coarse-resolution BT between MODIS and Landsat. For the five
    dates for which imagery from both sensors were acquired on the same day, observed
    average MAE was 1.63 °C. Coefficient of determination within the same dates varied
    from 0.34 to 0.74, with scene MODIS BT frequently being cooler than Landsat-8.
    Further research can benefit from implementation of intercalibration between MODIS
    and Landsat-8 before sharpening validation to attenuate errors caused by the sensors’
    individual characteristics. Despite the inconsistent correlations in coarse resolution
    caused by these differences and the presence of clouds in one or both images,
    relationships between sharpened MODIS and Landsat were stronger at all finer resolutions.
    Field-scale agreement between sharpened and reference temperatures showed some
    level of independence from the scene scale. Agricultural fields located in regions
    of the scene with smaller residual errors or not affected by cloud cover can show
    higher temperature accuracy than other areas. These findings suggest that sharpened
    maps can be used with caution for small scales even if coarse comparison between
    sensors in the scene scale shows weaker relationships. Sharpened maps at 120 and
    60 m resolution showed the highest consistency within all fields and dates using
    both VENµS and Sentinel-2. Maps sharpened to 240 m showed high accuracy, but greatly
    depended on the field size because of the lack of pixels available in smaller
    areas. Resolutions finer than 60 m presented the least consistent relationships,
    with accurate maps being very field-specific. Very few studies have explored the
    performance of thermal sharpening in field scales, and the use of VENµS multispectral
    data. Findings from this research show that considering the combination of pixel
    size, and temperature estimation accuracy and error, sharpened MODIS at 60 m are
    the most reliable for season-long cotton monitoring. The comparison between sharpened
    images using VENµS and Sentinel-2 was performed to evaluate a potential agreement
    between results, due to the lack of information available in the use of VENµS
    for thermal disaggregation. VENµS results showed comparable or higher accuracy
    than Sentinel-2. The superior performance coupled with the better revisit time
    evidences the great potential of using VENµS for frequent in-season crop monitoring
    for IMZ delineation. This work is the first to report the use of VENµS images
    for thermal sharpening. Nevertheless, only an initial study was performed to explore
    the possibility of using sharpening at field scale for monitoring purposes. Further
    research with ground data collection is needed to explore field use limitations
    of this methodology, but these results give useful insights of potential benefits
    of implementing the TsHARP technique as a tool for crop stress monitoring. Author

    In the progress of human civilization, agriculture plays a vital and a tactical
    part in the procedure of economic improvement of the country. In the various aspects
    of life such as: it is the source of work of many people around the world, roughly
    2.5 billion of the rural people directly rely on agriculture as a mean of living
    it contributes to national income for countries that are in developing stage,
    and it offers food for the population and fodder for animals, this agricultural
    sector plays a significant part. Irrigation becomes difficult and it plays a critical
    role in agriculture, in areas that are dry or where there is no adequate rainfall:
    this crucial factor assures the good yields and production of high quality food
    in sufficient quantities to fulfill the demand, and by irrigation the population
    can become constant. So much water evaporates instead of feeding the plants, not
    to mention leaks and other losses, so irrigation system cannot always give the
    expected results. Hence to accomplish its merits, we ought to make use of the
    new technologies (Tamayo et al. 2010; Nuvvula et al. 2017; Rodríguez et al. 2017).
    To meet the particular management objective, irrigation management which is a
    difficult decision- making procedure should define how much water and when it
    has to be applied for the growing crop. The existing situation cannot to observe
    by the farmer, if he is too far from the farm (Awati and Patil 2012). Huge water
    efficiency, the very less consumption of energy, and large crop productivity were
    the primary target of precision irrigation, which makes use of the technologies
    like remote sensing, wireless sensor networks, real-time control, information
    systems and mobile devices (Achanta and Karthikeyan 2019). Wireless sensors network
    (WSN) is most commonly used process for observing the climate and utilizing the
    data of soil nutrient to estimate the crops health and the superiority of agricultural
    produces (Lachure et al. 2015). Sensor node, communication device, power supply
    and processors were the devices of WSN. In clustering or direct way the sensor
    nodes broadcast the data to the base station. By monitoring the weather conditions
    (namely temperature and humidity) and soil moisture for precision agriculture
    nowadays (Kadiravan et al. 2017; Xia et al. 2011) to build decision support systems
    (DSS) to increase agricultural yield, irrigation can be planned. An automatic
    Smart data mining based irrigation support system is projected in this study for
    regulating the irrigation in agriculture, where the real time soil moisture content
    from land and weather conditions will be gathered by means of WSN (Xiong et al.
    2009; de Lima et al. 2010). For irrigation management, convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC) was brought-in in this work. This,
    in turn, avoids the weekly irrigations which is required for plantation, according
    to soil measurements and climatic variables collected by numerous independent
    nodes organized in field. Through the intricate and varied information created
    schemes, the effectiveness and consistency of irrigation can be preserved through
    the weather, soil, water, and crop data. In order to do this process, we need
    help from the sensor network and other agricultural techniques for storing and
    using the rain water, maximizing their crop productivity, minimize the cost for
    cultivation and utilize the real time values rather than depending on prediction.
    2 Literature review Utilization of humidity and temperature sensor at appropriate
    positions for observing crops was proposed by Manikandan and Rajaram (2016). According
    to the feedback control mechanism the sensing system works by means of central
    control unit that regulates the flow of water in the real time depending on the
    prompt values of temperature and moisture on the field. CPU gathers the data from
    sensor. Hence, they were given the accurate quantity of water that maximizes the
    productivity of the farm, which helps the agriculturalists to monitor the sensory
    data and plan them self the action to be taken. A self-designed moisture wireless
    sensor was introduced by Xiao et al. (2010), which observe the water level and
    moisture content infield. From this network, the smart irrigation control scheme
    the construction of the wireless sensor network and was planned. Expert data and
    real-time moisture statistics aids to implement the irrigation test. The system
    verifies the applicability and feasibility of enforcing the process of rice growth
    and to be a respectable examination in the field of precision agriculture and
    continuous resources of water. A wireless scheme for intellectual field irrigation
    system devoted to Jew''s-ear planting in Lishui, Zhejiang, China, which depends
    on ZigBee technology was offered by Zhou et al. (2009). The wireless design made
    it very simple for installation and maintenance, rather than conventional wired
    connection. The software algorithm and hardware design of portable controller
    and wireless sensor/actuator node, which behave as the terminal device and controller
    in ZigBee wireless sensor network are explained elaborately. Finally, performances
    of the entire scheme were computed. Variable sampling interval precision agriculture
    (VSI-PA) system was suggested by Hamouda and Msallam (2020) which computes and
    observes the factors of agricultural for a suitable activities of agricultural
    like irrigation of water. The sensor nodes were chosen for every area at every
    step, for sensing the temperature and moisture of soil. Further, for each separate
    area the variable sampling interval was separately measured based on area’s soil
    temperature. The experimental examination concludes that the projected VSI-PA
    scheme delivers a substantial enhancement in using the energy at the same time
    preserving a small difference of the soil moisture in spite of the soil temperature
    values. Fuzzy logic based irrigation control system (FLB) utilizing a wireless
    sensor network for precision agriculture was presented by Patil et al. (2012).
    An appropriate dampness in agricultural soil regulates irrigation controller,
    by generating the irrigation pump off or on according to the readings of sensor,
    which, in turn, provides the science basis that helps water assets under the expertise
    of temperature sensors, soil moisture sensors, accurate irrigation gear, intelligent
    fuzzy controller, and devices controlled by computer, hence agricultural irrigation
    can acquire the finest part out of utilization of water. So an intelligent controller
    was proposed through fuzzy logic approach, for giving the irrigation for agriculture
    and it mimics or matches the intelligence of human being. An entire agrarian solution
    for the agriculturalist according to the GSM technology and Wireless Sensor Networks
    was introduced by Bansal and Reddy (2013). PVIDSS: was developed by Zhang et al.
    (2015), which is an irrigation system that works according to the wireless sensor
    network (WSN) for providing an efficient method to increase the productivity of
    irrigation. The survey, interview and document evaluation were done initially,
    to be acquainted with the chief aspects influencing the growth of vine and accumulate
    the requirements of system and irrigation rules. According to the function requirement
    the PVIDSS architecture was designed. The system observes vineyard’s the key parameters
    precisely like soil wetness and temperature, and measures the precision irrigation
    depending on the vine’s water requirement rule and field data, by incorporating
    the WSN based on ZigBee. The experimental analysis discloses that in data processing
    WSN centered decision support scheme is ideal and it is very simple to implement
    and deploy, and it favors the effective water usage agriculture development. A
    novel irrigation wireless sensor network using high altitude platform (HAP) and
    an adaptive switched-beam concentric circular antenna array was proposed by Albagory
    (2018) and it gives very wide area coverage that extends to various tenses of
    kilometers and hence it can bridge the complexity of executing the wide area sensor
    networks by conventional techniques especially for hard terrain regions. Otherwise,
    the switched-beam antenna system provided by the proposed technique has very high
    gain with narrow main lobe and low side lobe levels which supports the communications
    link between HAP and ground irrigation sensors and actuators over wide areas.
    A classical drip irrigation scheme architecture through the WSANs was proposed
    by Bennis et al. (2015). Temperature, Soil moisture and pressure sensors observe
    the operations of irrigation were there in our model. Particularly, it considers
    the scenarios where the system malfunction occurs, when situation like pipes rupture
    or the block emitters happens. Further, it distinguish 2chief levels of traffic
    for the data broadcasted by the WSAN, and helps for sufficient priority dependent
    routing protocol in order to accomplish the great QoS output. A system was projected
    by Nikolidakis et al. (2015), which functions according to the association of
    a combined system for programmed irrigation administration with a modern new routing
    protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), called as ECHERP (equalized cluster
    head election routing protocol). This scheme concentrates mainly on the managing
    effectively the supply of water in cultivated fields in an automatic method. Here
    the scheme assumes the past statistics and the modifications on climatic values
    for computing the amount of water that are necessary for irrigation. If suppose
    the gathered value is beyond the brink value, to diminish the essential amount
    of water more regular data grouping is projected. In order to manage crop-field
    utilizing sensors (temperature, soil moisture, humidity, Light) and systematize
    the system of irrigation, the Rajalakshmi and Mahalakshmi (2016) developed a new
    system. The information from the sensors was sent to the database of Web server,
    through wireless transmission; here the information was enciphered in JSON format.
    So, this system helps in parts where the level of water is limited and it is 92%
    further effective than the traditional method. An wireless sensor network application
    for a cost efficient wireless managed irrigation solution and real time moisture
    of soil was observed and it was proposed by Dursun and Ozden (2011). A wireless
    acquisition station powered by solar assists us in performing data acquisition
    for managing the valves for irrigation. It consists of three parts: valve unit
    (VU), base station unit (BSU) and sensor unit (SU). Irrigation system that is
    acquired avoids trees moisture stress and salification, at the same time it gives
    an effective utilization of fresh water reserve. Furthermore, the established
    irrigation technique eliminates the requirement for handiwork for flooding irrigation.
    An intelligent irrigation scheme which functions on the wireless sensor networks
    and fuzzy control was designed by Gao et al. (2013) and it comprises of the monitoring
    centre and wireless sensor networks. Solar power will be used by entire nodes
    in Monitoring area for gathering the facts of soil moisture, along with the information
    of diverse crops growth in diverse durations. The rate of change of deviation
    and soil moisture content deviation were considered as the input variables of
    the fuzzy controller, and the fuzzy control normal database was presented for
    the fuzzy irrigation control system. The data transmission from wireless sensor
    network node goes into the monitoring centre, and output figures of irrigation
    water insist to communicate through a wireless sensor network for closing and
    opening time of the valve in the field (crop regions). A competent irrigation
    scheme centered on computing evapo-transpiration (ET) and the mandatory irrigation
    quantity employing fuzzy inference methodology was given by Mousa et al. (2014).
    Scheduling the irrigation on basis of specific demands of the produce and the
    modification in numerous climatologically parameters and further aspects were
    considered as the target of this system. Over- or under-watering will be eliminated
    by this method, which considerably disturbs the quality of crop and produces utilizing
    the projected algorithm. Furthermore, algorithm projected by us minimizes the
    switching of power, because it protects energy from wasting. From the experimental
    result it is confirmed that the fuzzy framework is a swift and precise tool for
    gauging the evapo-transpiration along with the essential net irrigation. Beside,
    our model forbids reduction in soil humidity from attaining 100%; which, in turn,
    indicates the everlasting wilting point. Irrigation begins at once when the ratio
    of depletion extents to50% of total soil humidity available. Goldstein et al.
    designed various irrigation recommendation prediction models utilizing three machine
    learning (ML) schemes, including the classical linear regression and two nonparametric
    schemes, gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT) and boosted trees classifier
    (BTC) is used (Goldstein et al. 2018; Asfaram et al. 2016).The models were trained
    with eight versatile feature subsets. The results revealed that non-parametric
    models, such as GBRT and BTC models had high accuracy in predicting irrigation
    decisions compared to linear regression models, having success rates of 93 and
    95%, correspondingly. Table 1 shows the comparative analysis of the existing approaches
    and their limitations. By analyzing these approaches, it can be said that, the
    neural network based approach provides a better performance in comparison with
    the other available schemes. Table 1 Comparative analysis of the available techniques
    Full size table 3 Proposed methodology The proposed irrigation control model will
    be explained in this section. Two components were there in this model: real time
    collection of data and irrigation prediction, where the real time soil moisture
    content (MC) data collection were performed with the assistance of wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and then irrigation will be controlled according to those collected
    data through convolutional neural support vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC)
    for an efficient irrigation management is illustrated in Fig. 1. The Overall structure
    of the projected model is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overall structure of the
    discussed model Full size image In various agricultural cropping systems in semi-dry
    and dry regions, irrigation is considered as the crucial practice and it assist
    the water solicitations and organization were assumed as main challenges. Self
    driven centre pivot including the linear-move irrigation systems frequently put
    on water from time to time; But continuous differences in properties of soil and
    water accessibility happens in maximum fields. In this case, the way to pertain
    site-specific irrigation management to improve the temporally and spatially variable
    conditions could maximize the efficiency of application, minimize the environmental
    influences, and possibly enhance the harvest. Merits of a distributed in-field
    sensor based site-specific irrigation system with a smart Decision support system
    (DSS) scheme gives probable means to maximize the harvest and quality as well
    as save water. Agriculture data’s were already gathered and stored in the database
    for the training of the irrigation prediction system which was implanted with
    the help of this developed WSN platform and gateway node by considering some parameters
    (Nuvvula et al. 2017). So, here we start with the real time land monitoring process
    by considering the factors like weather, soil moisture content, water, and crop
    data with the help of this proposed system. With the help of robust estimation
    methodologies such as neural network algorithms, we can rectify the agricultural
    system model and it is a tedious nonlinear systems. Convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC) technique was proposed in this work
    for estimating the soil moisture content by taking into account the soil and environmental
    factors (Turkoglu et al. 2019). The agriculture facts collection was executed
    by the established gateway node and WSN platform. In this proposed approach, the
    soil and environmental data is gathered with wireless sensor network (WSN) environment
    for the real-time monitoring and evaluation of soil moisture content (MC). From
    soil temperature sensor, soil moisture sensors, environmental temperature sensor,
    environmental humidity sensor, CO2 sensor, and sunlight intensity sensor the data’s
    were collected and they were maintained in gateway node and wifi connectivity.
    From the wifi network the real-time data were mined and sent over to the computer
    server for soil MC forecast with the help of the convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC). 3.1 Weather dependent irrigation
    prediction According to those collected soil moisture content data and weather
    conditions, the irrigation will be estimated. Two or more other algorithms were
    combined to rectify the same issue with a hybrid algorithm, either by selecting
    one (based on the data), or swapping between them over the course of the algorithm.
    And it is linked via the preferred features of each; hence the whole algorithm
    is superior when compared with the separate components. 3.2 Convolutional neural
    networks CNNs are considered as the hierarchical frameworks of MLPs where the
    consecutive interchanging layers were intended to acquire the knowledge of the
    progressively higher-level features, and classification results are provided by
    the last layer. The interchanging layers in CNNs provides2 fundamental actions,
    convolution and sub-sampling (e.g., pooling operations), significant of modest
    and complex cells in the mammalian visual cortex. The presented session concentrates
    on the task of CNNs visual identification (Rajalakshmi and Mahalakshmi 2016).Convolutional
    Layer: Here we perform the 2D filtering among input moisture content and weather
    x and a bank of filters w, producing additional set of data h. The input–output
    relationships was denoted by a connection table CT, here filter replies from the
    inputs where linked to the same output data and finally they were combined linearly
    (Wang et al. 2019). The convolutional layer executes the mapping, \\({\\text{h}}_{{\\text{j}}}
    = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\text{i}}}^{ } {\\text{k}} \\in {\\text{CT}}_{{{\\text{i}},{\\text{k}},{\\text{j}}}}
    \\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\times {\\text{w}}_{{\\text{k}}} } \\right)\\).
    A non-linear activation function, a scaled hyperbolic tangent, were enforced to
    h, identical to the scenario of MLPs. Sub-sampling layer Here we perform “Max-Pooling
    operation”, this bring-in the minor invariance to translation and distortion,
    which results in quicker merging and enriched generalization. Fully-connected
    layer The fully connected layer’s input (i.e., the second last layer) is a set
    of aspects maps from the lower layer and here we match the outcome of the preceding
    layer into a 1-dimensional feature vector, and it is preceded via the scaled hyperbolic
    tangent activation function. Output layer The output layer contains 1 output neuron
    unit for each class label, and it behaves as a linear classifier working on the
    1-dimensional feature vectors which is measured from the layers that are fully-connected
    are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Convolution neural networks Full size image Stochastic
    gradient descent (SGD) methods are better suitable, because of extremely non-linear
    nature of the error surface, since they generally eliminate the stuck in poor
    local minima (Dursun and Ozden 2011). 3.3 Support vector machines SVMs focus on
    recognizing the hyper plane in the feature space; this segregates the categories
    of data whereas increasing the margin in that space. Provided with a controlled
    soft-margin classification issue and a training set of N data points \\(\\left\\{
    {{\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} ,{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right\\}_{{{\\text{i}}
    = 1}}^{{\\text{m}}}\\), where \\({\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{R}}_{{\\text{n}}}\\)
    refers to the ith input pattern and \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{R}}\\)
    indicates the ith output pattern, the SVM technique focus at building a classifier
    of the form (Gao et al. 2013): $$y\\left( x \\right) = {\\text{sign}}\\left( {\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{m} {\\alpha_{i} y_{i} k\\left( {x_{i} ,x} \\right) + b} } \\right),$$ (1)
    here \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) stands for the positive real constants, b indicates a real
    constant and \\({\\text{K}}\\left( {.,{ }.} \\right)\\) indicates a non-linear
    Kernel function, which match the input space onto a advanced dimensional space
    is shown in the Fig. 3. For maximizing the hyperplane margin for a soft-margin
    SVM, the subsequent cost function (i.e., primal SVM issue) has to be reduced.
    $$minimizew,\\varepsilon ,b\\left\\{ {\\frac{\\left\\| w \\right\\|2}{2} + c\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{m} { \\in_{i} } } \\right\\}.$$ (2) Fig. 3 Hyperplane margin for a soft-margin
    SVM Full size image Limited by the 2 constraints \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    \\left( {{\\text{w }}\\cdot{\\text{ x}}_{{\\text{i}}} { } - {\\text{ b}}} \\right){
    } \\ge { }1{ } - \\xi_{{\\text{i}}}\\) and \\(\\xi_{{\\text{i}}} { } \\ge { }0\\),
    for \\(i = \\left\\{ {1, 2, \\ldots ,m} \\right\\} \\cdot \\xi_{i}\\) refers to
    a slack variable, which computes the amount of mis-classification done on data
    xi and the parameter C limits the compromise among the faults on training data
    and margin maximization \\(({\\text{C }} = { }\\infty\\) results in a hard-margin
    SVM) (Mousa et al. 2014). SVMs were guided by bringing-in the Lagrange multipliers
    and rectifying the dual quadratic programming problem, which yet isn’t valid to
    CNNs (Raghav et al. 2020). Hence, to assist a CNN and SVM we make use of an individual
    algorithm with the competency of online incremental updates, and the highlight
    is on “primal gradient-based methods”, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
    based methods. The process of support vector machines training model is shown
    in Fig. 4. The SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns features to
    create the training model with the help of RBF kernel. Fig. 4 Process of support
    vector machines training Full size image 3.4 Convolutional neural support vector
    machines In learning the invariant features from data, CNNs is considered as an
    effective one, but it doesn’t always give the optimal classification results.
    As a contradictory, the knowledge of the difficult in variances cannot be obtained
    from the SVMs static kernel function, but it gives decent decision surfaces by
    increasing the boundaries through approaches like soft-margin. Exploring a hybrid
    system is the main aim of this context, where the CNN gets the knowledge to absorb
    the structures that are comparatively invariant to unrelated differences of the
    input. Similarly, best solution for differentiating the classes in the learned
    feature space can be obtained from SVM having a non-linear kernel. Next to this
    method, proposed convolution neural support vector machines (CNSVMs), a heterogeneous
    combination of the CNN and SVM, where the output layer of the CNN is substituted
    with an SVM (i.e., the CNNs the fully connected layer is the SVM input). Our CNSVMHNN
    is qualified through a stochastic gradient descent based method, with the ability
    of online incremental updates, as conversed after in this segment (Goldstein et
    al. 2018).\\({\\text{w }} \\cdot \\varphi \\left( {\\text{x}} \\right){ } + {\\text{
    b}}),\\) here w indicates the vector of weights, b refers to a bias, and all factors
    were involved in φ. In the case of φ-machines and SVMs, \\(\\varphi\\) refers
    to a random function. The aim of the projected CNSVMHNN is to be familiar with
    a hyperplane \\({\\text{f}}\\left( {\\text{x}} \\right)\\) in the Reproducing
    Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which separates the data classes at the same time
    take full advantage of the margin among the classes and hyperplane. Officially,
    it is specified with a training set \\({\\text{S }} = { }\\{ ({\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}}\\),
    \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} )\\} {\\text{m}}_{{\\text{i}}} = 1,\\) where \\({\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    {\\text{R}}_{{\\text{n}}}\\) and \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\left\\{ { + 1,{
    } - 1} \\right\\}\\) for a binary classification problem (it can be modified to
    multi-class problems), the CNSVM reduces the below given cost function: $$minimize_{w}
    \\left\\{ {\\frac{\\lambda }{2}\\left\\| w \\right\\|^{2} + \\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{m} {l\\left( {x_{i} ,y_{i} ;w} \\right)} } \\right\\}$$ (3) Here \\({\\text{l}}\\left(
    {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} ,{\\text{ y}}_{{\\text{i}}} ;{\\text{ w}}} \\right){
    } = {\\text{ max}}\\left\\{ {0,{ }1{ }{-}{\\text{ y}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{f}}\\left(
    {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right)} \\right\\}.\\) In Eq. (3), \\({\\lambda
    } \\ge { }0{ }\\) refers to a regularization factor (brought-in to avert over-fitting),
    which scales \\(\\left\\| w \\right\\| ^{2}\\). The term max \\(\\left\\{ {0,{
    }1 - {\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{f}}\\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} }
    \\right)} \\right\\}\\) indicates the hinge-loss, and f(xi) refers to a RKHS with
    associated kernel \\({\\text{K}}\\left( {.,{ }.} \\right).\\) The \\(\\frac{\\lambda
    }{2}\\left\\| w \\right\\|^{2}\\) assists us to increase the margin through regularization,
    while the term \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{m} {l\\left( {x_{i} ,y_{i}
    ;w} \\right)}\\) reduces the training error. The misclassification parameter C,
    which does the scaling of the empirical loss term, is associated to the regularization
    parameter: \\(\\lambda = 1 /mC .\\) By reducing the primal problem in Eq. (2),
    we train SVMs and this equation focus on restraints, the ideal solution w (or
    weight vector) can be indicated as a linear aggregation of the training samples
    in a high-dimensional space, such that w = \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda }\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{nsv} {y_{i} \\alpha_{i} \\theta \\left( {x_{i} } \\right)}\\) where φ refers
    to the high-dimensional mapping indirectly expressed by \\({\\text{K }}\\left(
    {.,{ }.} \\right)\\) and only a subset of samples satisfies the condition, \\({\\upalpha
    }_{{\\text{i}}} \\ne 0\\) refers to the Support Vectors (SVs) in w, indicated
    by NSV. It specifies that the output weight vector w is a sparse fusion of the
    learned features \\(\\varphi \\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right).\\)
    By reducing a given criterion \\({\\text{R }}\\left( {{\\text{f}}\\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    } \\right),{\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right)\\) over the training set, so that
    the term \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{m} {R\\left( {fx_{i} } \\right),y_{i}
    }\\) is diminished, the training of CNNs and SVMs can be accomplished. It is monitored
    that the CNSVM cost function in of Eq. (3) can be reduced with the help of Stochastic
    Gradient Descent (SGD) methods that is suitable for online incremental learning.
    Here, stochastic sub gradient projection (SSGP) method was proposed (refer Algorithm
    1) for the online incremental training of proposed CNSVMHNN. The SSGP fits the
    situation of irrigation prediction tasks quite good (Asfaram et al. 2016). 3.5
    Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach Two user-defined parameters were required
    for Algorihtm 1, they are: (i) parameter m as provided in Eq. (3), that describes
    the amount of training samples to employ in every mini-batch of training data
    for calculating the sub-gradients, and (ii) T for \\(t = \\left\\{ {1, 2, \\ldots
    ,T} \\right\\},\\) that signifies the number of iterations to do. In SSGP implementation,
    originally the weight vector w is initialized to any vector whose norm is nearly
    \\(\\left\\| w \\right\\| \\le \\frac{1}{\\lambda }\\) At every iteration t of
    the algorithm, a set of \\(\\{ At \\left( i \\right)|i = 1, 2, \\ldots , m\\}\\)
    samples is necessary and handled by the swarm, with Eq. (3) taking the form below:
    $$f\\left( {w;A_{t} } \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda }{2}\\left\\| w \\right\\|^{2}
    + \\frac{1}{m}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\left( {x,y} \\right) \\in A_{t} }}^{m}
    l\\left( {x_{i} ,y_{i} ;w} \\right)$$ (4) The learning rate will be set and decayed
    by a factor \\(= \\frac{1}{{{\\lambda t}}}\\), and \\({\\text{A}} + {\\text{ t}}\\)
    is determined as the set of samples in \\({\\text{At}}\\) for which w undergo
    a loss that is non-zero. Then it is proceeded by execution of a two-step update:
    (i) \\({\\text{w}}_{{\\text{t}}}\\) gets scaled by \\(\\left( {1 - \\eta t\\lambda
    } \\right)\\) for every sample \\(\\left( {{\\text{x}},{\\text{ y}}} \\right){\\text{
    A}} + {\\text{ t }},\\) and (ii) the vector \\(\\frac{{{\\text{ynt}}}}{{\\text{m}}}{\\text{
    x}}\\) is added to w, where the resultant weight vector is indicated by \\({\\text{w}}_{{{\\text{t}}
    + \\frac{1}{2}}} = {\\text{w}}_{{{\\text{t}} - {\\upeta }_{{\\text{t}}} \\nabla_{{\\text{t}}}
    }}\\). Hence, the sub-gradient projection is conveyed by: $$\\nabla_{t} = \\lambda
    w_{t} - \\frac{1}{{\\left| {A_{t} } \\right|}}\\sum\\nolimits_{{\\left( {x,y}
    \\right) \\in A _{t}^{ + } }} {yx}$$ (5) where \\({\\text{w}}_{{{\\text{t}} +
    \\frac{1}{2}}}\\) is updated by the sub-gradient of the objective function computed
    with \\({\\text{At}}\\). As the description of the hinge-loss indicates that \\(\\nabla\\)t
    refers to a sub-gradient of \\({\\text{f}}\\left( {{\\text{w}};{\\text{ At}}}
    \\right),\\) in this instance, wt + 1 is fixed as the projection on \\({\\text{wt}}
    + { }1/{ }2{ }\\) which generates a quick reduction in the learning rate. Then,
    \\({\\text{wt}} + 1\\) is acquired by reducing \\({\\text{wt}} + { }1{ }/2\\)
    (as provided in the second final step of Algorithm 1). The finest solution of
    the CNSVM relies in the set B and the output of the SSGP is the updated weight
    vector \\({\\text{wt}} + 1.\\) The regularization parameter required to be adjusted,
    where \\(1/\\lambda\\) takes charge for the complexity of the issue. 4 Result
    and discussion The investigational outcomes of projected scheme were discussed
    in this section; it is executed with the help of NS2. The current PVIDSS algorithm
    (Zhang et al. 2015), fuzzy based neural network (FBNN) algorithm (Wang and Hu
    2015) and proposed convolutional neural support vector machines hybrid classifier
    (CNSVMHC) were distinguished with respect to precision, recall and accuracy for
    the dataset for the dataset of Harmonized World Soil Database v 1.2. The database
    Harmonized World Soil Database is basically a 30 arc-second raster database having
    more than 15 000 diverse soil mapping units that matches the current regional
    and national updates of soil information universally (SOTER, ESD, Soil Map of
    China, WISE) with the facts confined within the 1:5 000 000 scale FAO-UNESCO Soil
    Map of the World (FAO, 1971–1981). The consequential raster database comprises
    of 21,600 rows and 43,200 columns, and these are connected to harmonized soil
    property statistics and to utilize the standardized structure we need to permit
    the connection of the data attribute with the raster map to show or inquire the
    arrangement in terms of soil units and the classification of the chosen soil parameters
    (pH, organic Carbon, water storage capacity, soil depth, cation exchange capacity
    of the soil and the clay fraction, total interchangeable nutrients, lime and gypsum
    contents, sodium exchange percentage, salinity, textural class and granulometry).

    over the total number of relevant instances. The proposed algorithm is determined
    as $${\\text{Recall}} = \\frac{{{\\text{Truepositive}}}}{{{\\text{truepositive}}
    + {\\text{Falsenegative}}}}.$$ (7) 4.1.3 Accuracy Accuracy is one metric used
    for computing the classification models. Casually, accuracy is the fraction of
    predictions that is got correct by this model. Officially, accuracy can be given
    as follows: $${\\text{Accuracy}} = \\frac{{{\\text{Truepositive}} + {\\text{Truenegative}}}}{{{\\text{Total}}}}.$$

    in farming, an automatic Smart data mining based Irrigation Support System was
    proposed. For irrigation management, the suggested work convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid neural network classifier (CNSVMHC) was brought-in in this
    work. The system predicts the weekly irrigations which are required for a plantation,
    which is done according to climatic variables and soil measurements both were
    collected by numerous independent nodes installed in field. As of the intricate
    and varied information centered systems, the effectiveness and uniformity of irrigation
    were maintained, by assuming the factors like soil, weather, water, and crop information.
    The experimental result confirms that the projected scheme gives improved results
    in terms of the precision, recall and accuracy metrics. The future deployment
    concentrates on enhancing water application efficiency. So, both the energy and
    water helps in water pumping in irrigation and it will be preserved. In developing
    countries it is foreseen that this will substitute setting up of low-capacity
    solar photovoltaic water pumping schemes for irrigation that ensemble the socioeconomic
    situations of small scale farmers. References Achanta SDM, Karthikeyan T (2019)

    18 April 2023 Introduction Water scarcity is predicted to be the major limitation
    to increasing agronomic outputs to meet future food and fiber demands (UNDP 2007).
    With the agricultural sector accounting for 80–90% of all consumptive water use
    and an average water use efficiency of less than 45% (Hezarjaribi and Sourell
    2007; Molden 2007), major advances must be made in irrigation water management.
    Currently, irrigation is a key component of global food security, accounting for ~ 40%
    of global food production and ~ 20% of all arable land (Molden 2007; Schultz et
    al. 2005). Precision agriculture offers the technologies to address and manage
    for infield variability and incorporate that variability into management decisions
    (Howell et al. 2012). According to a 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    Census of Agriculture report, Nebraska ranks first nationally in irrigated area
    approximately 3.4 million irrigated hectares, and about 70% of that area has center
    pivot irrigation (USDA 2012). Conventional center pivot systems manage a field
    as a uniform unit, thus ignoring the heterogeneity across the field, and often
    management decisions are based on average field conditions (i.e. average soil
    hydraulic properties, average soil water content (SWC); McCarthy et al. 2014).
    Consequently, expected crop yield may differ in sub-regions of a field due to
    variations in SWC and physical properties. Variable-rate irrigation (VRI) and
    variable-speed irrigation (VSI) systems can vary application depth in relation
    to the spatial variability of soil properties (Hezarjaribi and Sourell 2007).
    VSI varies the speed of the pivot to adjust application depth in sectors and VRI
    uses nozzle control to vary application depth in irregularly shaped management
    zones. Additionally, fertigation inputs can be managed for site-specific field
    conditions and soil properties to ensure minimal chemical loss in the runoff (Hedley
    2015). Due to the high temporal variability in SWC, the incorporation of VRI has
    the potential to increase crop water use efficiency and yield (Haghverdi et al.
    2015b). The major limitation to implementing this technology often lies in the
    management of spatial datasets and the writing of irrigation prescription maps
    that address variables impacting yield and SWC (Evans et al. 1996; Howell et al.
    2012). This requires efficient and accurate methods for measuring the subfield
    scale spatial variability of soil properties including porosity, saturated hydraulic
    conductivity, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, available water, texture and
    depth (Hezarjaribi and Sourell 2007; Pan et al. 2013; Ranney et al. 2015). Managing
    irrigation rates and times based on hydraulic properties allows for irrigators
    to prescribe application depths based on the SWC below field capacity and above
    maximum allowable depletion. Land managers use several methods to address and
    manage for in-field variability and to delineate irrigation management zones (IMZs)
    including available soil spatial datasets, yield maps, electrical resistivity/conductivity
    (EC) surveys, and commercially available instruments. Unfortunately, soil spatial
    datasets are often not at resolutions appropriate for field-scale management (Bobryk
    et al. 2016). One strategy land managers use is the delineation of IMZs within
    a field based on EC surveys. High resolution spatiotemporal modeling using EC
    surveys has been used to characterize dynamic SWC patterns in relation to crop
    needs (Hedley et al. 2013). Unfortunately, EC is sensitive to temperature, SWC,
    texture, clay content and salinity (Haghverdi et al. 2015a; Rodriguez-Perez et
    al. 2011), thus making exact boundary determination challenging. Most EC systems
    are used to delineate management zones only after harvest and before planting
    in nonfrozen soils, thus limiting mapping opportunities in cold climates. While
    changes in SWC do account for over 50% of variability in soil EC readings (Brevik
    et al. 2006), the dynamic nature of SWC causes EC and clay measurements to vary
    temporally (McCutcheon et al. 2006) making the use of a single EC survey problematic.
    Martini et al. (2016) investigated this temporal variability and emphasized the
    importance of multiple surveys to capture the dynamic SWC patterns represented
    by EC surveys. Other impacting factors, beyond SWC, include groundwater levels
    and the concentration of the pore water solution, which influence the electrical
    conductance pathway (Martini et al. 2016). Additional commercially available methodologies
    are available for measuring soil physical variability, however they were not explored
    in this study [e.g. Trimble Soil Information System (SIS) (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale,
    CA)]. Beyond EC surveys, other hydrogeophysical instruments (see e.g. Binley et
    al. 2015; Coopersmith et al. 2014; Franz et al. 2016; Villarreyes et al. 2011)
    offer promising opportunities in precision agriculture. One such instrument to
    be explored in this work is the cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP), which has been
    used within agricultural systems to approximate SWC at the field- to small-watershed-scale
    (Franz et al. 2015). The CRNP detects epithermal neutron energies reflected from
    the soil, which are inversely related to SWC (Zreda et al. 2012). For this study,
    the CRNP was used to measure SWC at high spatial and temporal resolutions to characterize
    its dynamic nature over the growing season. One key advantage to using the passive,
    non-invasive, and soil-temperature-invariant CRNP method is that SWC data can
    be collected using a wide variety of commercially available vehicles from harvest
    until the following season when the crop is too tall for the vehicle (~ 0.20 m
    for this work). While not performed here, CRNP surveys, mobile CRNP measurements,
    with taller crop heights can easily be collected from taller-bodied farm equipment
    (e.g. tractor, sprayer, etc.). For this work, a standard multivariate analysis,
    Empirical Orthogonal Functions [EOF, (Perry and Niemann 2006)], was used to characterize
    the spatial variability of SWC across the study site using CRNP surveys collected
    between 2015 and 2016. EOF analyses have been proven to be an accurate method
    for large sample sizes or more than 5 days of SWC monitoring (Werbylo and Niemann
    2014). Within intensely monitored agricultural systems, EOF analysis has also
    been used to identify dominant parameters controlling spatial and temporal patterns
    of surface SWC without being affected by a single random process (Korres et al.
    2010). Furthermore, EOF analysis provides a framework to estimate underlying SWC
    variations constructed using historical SWC observations to forecast SWC patterns
    for unobserved times. The objectives of this study were to: (1) improve the delineation
    of management zones within a field and (2) estimate the relevant spatially-distributed
    soil hydraulic properties (i.e. field capacity and wilting point) to inform irrigation
    prescriptions. Laboratory measured hydraulic parameters were compared to values
    from the USDA soil survey dataset, then correlated with an EC map, and then to
    the CRNP-derived EOF surface. Lastly, a cross validation bootstrapping analysis
    was performed to compare and contrast the various candidate environmental covariates.
    The CRNP surveys, when combined with the EOF analysis, were hypothesized to be
    the best predictor of soil hydraulic property spatial variability compared to
    traditional and widely-used methods. It was also hypothesized that the EOF surface
    would be a good candidate for more accurately delineating IMZs. To illustrate
    the potential increase in water use efficiency versus effort (i.e. time, energy,
    and cost) of the various strategies discussed, Fig. 1 presents a conceptual diagram
    with a set of existing technologies/methodologies. The figure serves as a guide
    to the reader and will be further discussed later in this paper with respect to
    the specific findings from this field site. Fig. 1 Conceptual diagram of potential

    Full size image Materials and methods Study site The selected study site is a
    53-ha field (circle with ~ 400 m radius) irrigated with a variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) pivot near Sutherland, NE (41.065393°, − 101.102663°) (Fig. 2). The field
    contains significant topo-edaphic gradients, i.e. soil and topographic properties,
    making it an ideal candidate for VRI. Figure 2 illustrates the elevation (provided
    by a local crop consultant using a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning
    System (GPS)) and topographic wetness index (TWI) of the study site. The TWI calculates
    SWC spatial patterns based on the up-slope contribution area and slope (Sorensen
    et al. 2006). The field was planted with soybean (Glycine max L.) in 2014 and
    popcorn maize (Zea Mays var. everta) from 2015 to 2016. The soybean yield averaged ~ 3.8
    Mg/ha and the popcorn yields averaged ~ 5.3 Mg/ha. Using data from an Automated
    Weather Data Network (AWDN) site located near North Platte, NE (~ 40 km from study
    site), the authors estimated annual temperature highs to be around 18 °C and lows
    to be about 2 °C (http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/awdn.php, Accessed 25 January 2017).
    The authors used the AWDN dataset to estimate decadal annual average precipitation
    at 445 mm year−1 with 325 mm falling between May and September. Additionally,
    the authors estimated potential annual evapotranspiration to be at 1475 mm year−1
    with 925 mm occurring between May and September. According to the local producer,
    applied irrigation varies between 150 and 300 mm year−1 depending on the year.
    Soil classifications from the available USDA SSURGO (Soil Survey Staff 2016) spatial
    and tabular dataset were used to estimate texture and soil hydraulic properties
    at the study site. SWC at field capacity (cm3 cm−3), correlating to a soil water
    pressure of − 33 kPa, and wilting point (cm3 cm−3), correlating to a soil water
    pressure of − 1500 kPa, were averaged for each of the map units from 0 to 0.3
    m (Fig. 3). The USDA SSURGO database delineated contiguous areas with similar
    soils as a single map unit. In general, the eastern region of the field has sandier
    soils and the western region is a mixture of sandy and silt loams. The field has
    a wide gradient in field capacity (0.090–0.307 cm3 cm−3) and wilting point (0.027–0.164
    cm3 cm−3) values depending on soil classification. The TWI product (Fig. 2) correlates
    well with the classifications from the SSURGO dataset with wetter regions of the
    field relating to finer soil textures. Fig. 2 Field site located near Sutherland,

    electrical conductivity (EC) survey measuring bulk apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa, mS m−1) was collected on 24 February 2016 using a DUALEM-21S sensor (DUALEM,
    Milton, Canada). The DUALEM sensor has dual-geometry receivers at separations
    of 1 and 2.1 m from the transmitter, which provided four simultaneous depth estimates
    of ECa every second (Dualem Inc. 2013). The ~ 2.1 m horizontal co-planar sensor
    estimated ECa values for this study (see DUALEM manual for approximate depth of
    exploration curves for each sensor configuration). The DUALEM was towed behind
    an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) on a plastic sled at speeds of 8–15 km h−1 with ~ 7–9
    m spacing, taking about 75 min to complete the survey. A Hemisphere GPS XF101
    DGPS (Juniper Systems, Inc., Logan, UT) unit recorded the location of each measurement.
    Following basic quality assurance and quality control of the raw ECa data (Franz
    et al. 2011), a spatial map with 5 by 5 m resolution was created using an inverse-distance
    weighting procedure. Ten mobile cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) surveys to estimate
    soil water content (SWC) were completed at the site from March 2015–June 2016
    using an ATV driven in a similar pattern and rate as the previously described
    EC survey. The mobile CRNP records epithermal neutron intensity integrated over
    one-minute counting intervals. The change in epithermal neutron intensity is inversely
    correlated to the mass of hydrogen in the measurement volume (Zreda et al. 2012).
    A main advantage of the CRNP survey, when compared to the EC survey, is the temperature-invariance.
    The CRNP method has no interaction with the electromagnetic atom shells and the
    neutrons interact with the atomic nuclei instead. The soil’s atomic energy variation
    due to ambient temperature changes is negligible compared to the epithermal neutron
    intensities (see Glasstone and Edlund 1952 for a description of neutron scattering
    cross section temperature dependence and Campbell et al. 1948 for a description
    of electrical conductivity temperature dependence). Depending on local conditions
    (i.e. elevation, water vapor, AWC, etc.), the CRNP measurement volume is roughly
    a disk, with a 130–250 m radius circle and penetration depth of 0.15–0.40 m (Köhli
    et al. 2015). For simplicity, a constant penetration depth of 0.3 m was assumed
    for all surveys. Atmospheric hydrogen pools within the CRNP footprint were accounted
    for by a relative humidity and temperature sensor mounted on the ATV. Lattice
    water, soil organic carbon equivalent and bulk density were measured at 0.015,
    0.0083, and 1.62 g cm−3, respectively. Interference of the biomass in the total
    CRNP measurement volume was considered negligible because the surveys were collected
    over bare soil or when the crop height was less than 0.20 m. The authors note
    that SWC changes are by far the largest change in hydrogen mass within the measurement
    footprint (McJannet et al. 2014). Numerous validation studies across the globe
    (see e.g. Bogena et al. 2013; Hawdon et al. 2014; Franz et al. 2015, 2016; Iwema
    et al. 2017, among others) have shown the CRNP to have area-average measurement
    accuracies of less than 0.03 cm3 cm−3 against a variety of industry standard SWC
    point scale probes. The calculated SWC within the measurement volume in a non-linearly
    weighed average with increased sensitivity near the CRNP (Schrön et al. 2017).
    In order to provide a SWC map, first a spatial map of neutron intensity was estimated,
    then a calibration function was applied following details in Franz et al. (2015)
    for agricultural fields. The neutron intensity map is created in two steps. First,
    a drop-in-the-bucket preprocessing step is applied, where a dense grid is generated
    (here 20 by 20 m) and all raw data points are found within a certain radius (here
    50 m). The size of the processing grid and average radius where varied in order
    to minimize any spatial interpolation artifacts (i.e. bulls eyes around observations
    points). Note, that future work should investigate how the size of the CRNP measurement
    disk, non-linear weighting of neutron intensity, and underlying length scale of
    soil heterogeneity affect the spatial interpolation algorithm. However, this was
    beyond the scope of the current study. Following the selection of grid size and
    search radius, the average of all raw data found within the search radius is assigned
    to the grid center. This oversampling approach is necessary for sharpening the
    image quality and is a common strategy used in remote sensing analyses (see Chan
    and Njoku 2014) when overlapping area average observations are collected, like
    the CRNP in this study. Next, an inverse-distance-weighted approach is used on
    the resampled 20 m grid to provide the 5-m neutron intensity estimate. Finally,
    the neutron intensity gridded estimate is converted to SWC following Franz et
    al. (2015). The authors refer the reader to the rapidly growing CRNP literature
    (see Zreda et al. 2012) instead of providing full details of the methodology here.
    Soil sampling and laboratory analysis Thirty-one sample locations (Fig. 2) were
    chosen based on the SSURGO database soil classifications, EC map and EOF analysis
    in a stratified random sampling scheme. Undisturbed soil cores (250 cm3) were
    collected inside stainless steel cylinders at ~ 0.2 m depth at each sample location.
    The soil cores were placed in a cooler and transported back to the laboratory
    where they were stored in a 4 °C refrigerator for later analysis. Soil water retention
    curves were estimated for each of the soil cores using a Decagon HYPROP (Decagon
    Devices, Pullman, WA, USA). Saturated soil samples were exposed to evaporation
    in the laboratory and weighed throughout the experiment. Evaporation methods are
    proven to be a fast and reliable method for determining soil hydraulic properties
    within the saturated to moderate SWC range (Peters and Durner 2008; Schindler
    et al. 2010). The matric potential was continuously monitored by two tensiometers
    inserted at the base of the soil cores at two different lengths within the core.
    The tensiometers and instrument bases were degassed using a vacuum pump. The HYPROP
    software (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) calculated data points along the
    retention curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve. An average measured
    bulk density of 1.62 g cm−3 and porosity of 38.9% were assigned for each of the
    undisturbed samples to generate soil water retention curves. Following the HYPROP
    analysis, a WP4C Dewpoint PotentiaMeter (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) was
    used to approximate tension for the moderate to dry SWC ranges. The soil cores
    were dried at 105 °C for 24 h before collecting 1–9 sub-samples per sample. Varying
    volumes of water were added to the sub-samples to obtain SWC near wilting point
    and to further characterize the soil water retention curves. The sub-samples were
    sealed for 24 h after water was added to allow for the water to disperse evenly
    throughout the sub-sample. Inside the measurement chamber of the WP4C, the dew
    point temperature of the moist air was measured by a chilled mirror and the sample
    temperature was measured by an infrared thermometer. Those two values were then
    used to calculate relative humidity and thus, potential of the soil water. The
    WP4C has an accuracy of ± 0.05 MPa from 0 to − 5 MPa and 1% from − 5 to − 300
    MPa (Decagon Devices, Inc. 2015). Statistical analysis In order to illuminate
    the underlying spatial variability of the SWC maps, an empirical orthogonal function
    (EOF) analysis was used on the ten CRNP SWC maps. Full details on the multivariate
    statistical EOF analysis are provided elsewhere (Korres et al. 2010; Perry and
    Niemann 2006) and only a brief summary is provided here. The EOF analysis decomposes
    the observed SWC variability measured by the CRNP surveys into a set of orthogonal
    spatial patterns (EOFs), which are invariant in time, and a set of time series
    called expansion coefficients, which are invariant in space (Perry and Niemann
    2006). Multiplication of the EOFs and expansion coefficients will exactly reconstruct
    the original pattern. Often the number of needed coefficients (i.e. eigenvectors)
    to reconstruct most of the data is less than the original dataset (i.e. determined
    by the ranked eigenvalues), thus the procedure can be used as a way to reduce
    the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the key information. The authors
    note that EOF is nearly identical to Principal Component Analysis save the splitting
    of axis of variation into spatial and temporal coefficients instead of arbitrary
    linear combinations. A bootstrap validation analysis was used to: (1) determine
    the accuracy of the regressed hydraulic parameter to the measured hydraulic parameter
    and (2) determine how many soil samples and their corresponding hydraulic parameters
    were required for the root mean square error (RMSE) to converge. The hydrogeophysical
    datasets explored for this analysis were the CRNP EOF surface derived from the
    SWC surveys, the CRNP EOF surface derived from the corrected neutron counts (i.e.
    pressure, intensity, and water vapor corrections), ECa survey and elevation. Each
    hydrogeophysical dataset was randomly divided into a training set, ranging in
    size from 3 to 30, and a testing set for 1000 random iterations. The training
    sets and their corresponding laboratory measured soil hydraulic properties (i.e.
    field capacity, wilting point, available water content (AWC)) were used to build
    a simple linear model to predict the remaining laboratory measured soil hydraulic
    property values. The mean RMSE and standard deviation of the RMSE for the 1000
    simulations were calculated for the predicted hydraulic property values and the
    laboratory measured soil hydraulic property values. This analysis followed similar
    methods from Gibson and Franz (2018). Results and discussion Hydrogeophysical
    mapping and EOF analysis The apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) map for the
    field is illustrated in Fig. 4 and provides additional spatial information on
    soil texture variability as compared to the USDA SSURGO map (Fig. 3). This type
    of information has been used for the delineation of irrigation management zones
    (IMZs; Pan et al. 2013). As noted previously, the ECa map is subject to field
    conditions at the time of the sampling (Martini et al. 2016). Therefore, areas
    of high EC measurements in the southwest quadrant of the field may be due to increased
    soil cations, soil water content (SWC), and/or temperature anomalies at the time
    of sampling. At a first glance, the delineated soil boundary by the USDA SSURGO
    database displays some spatial correlation to the ECa map. However, there is high
    variability of ECa values within each USDA SSURGO soil classification, which has
    been observed in other research (Brevik et al. 2006). Thus, the soil classification
    from the SSURGO dataset may or may not be the appropriate boundaries for irrigation
    management zones (IMZs) within the field. This uncertainty of exact IMZ boundaries
    and questionable repeatability of ECa makes this method problematic, particularly
    given the high initial capital for precision agricultural equipment. The result
    here suggests the use of soil survey datasets and ECa be used in tandem to delineate
    IMZs for precision agriculture, which is supported by the results of Brevik et
    al. (2006). Fig. 4 Apparent bulk electrical conductivity map (ECa) collected on
    24 February 2016 using a Dualem-21S sensor Full size image Figure 5 illustrates
    the large spatiotemporal variation in SWC over the ten dates observed using the
    CRNP rover. Despite regions of the field with finer soil textures and higher ECa
    generally having a higher SWC in each of the soil moisture maps, there is inconsistency
    in the spatial distribution of the SWC. For example, compare the SWC spatial distribution
    for the survey dates of June 10, 2015 and May 11, 2016. Table 1 summarizes the
    SWC minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation for each CRNP survey date in
    Fig. 5. The ten CRNP rover surveys were used to perform Empirical Orthogonal Function
    (EOF) analysis. Figure 6 illustrates the first and second EOF coefficients at
    the study site. The EOF analysis contextualizes the behavior of the SWC (and thus
    underlying soil hydraulic properties) at any given point in the field relative
    to the mean SWC as a whole. Therefore, points in the field that are relatively
    wet persistently will have positive coefficients and points in the field that
    are relatively dry will have negative coefficients. Here the first EOF coefficients
    explained 79.6% of the spatial SWC variability followed by 5.6% explained by the
    second EOF. Therefore, only the first EOF was considered in the subsequent analyses.
    Statistical bootstrapping of the SWC indicated that five CRNP surveys at different
    SWC conditions were sufficient to estimate the first EOF coefficients to within
    5% of the values using data from all ten surveys. This reduction in required number
    of CRNP surveys is critical for economic considerations beyond a research study
    (see “Recommendations for future soil hydraulic property sampling”). The first
    EOF map provides detailed information for the delineation of IMZs. Given the removal
    of the time-varying component of the signal the authors argue that the map is
    a superior method to delineate IMZs as compared to the USDA SSURGO dataset and
    ECa mapping. The first EOF map is a continuous surface; thus, it can be applied
    at a variety of spatial scales and used within existing agricultural management
    software (such as a shapefile input). The remaining questions are: (1) is the
    EOF map a better predictor of soil hydraulic property spatial variation compared
    to the SSURGO database and ECa maps and (2) is the information provided by an
    EOF map economical for a producer to implement into current agricultural practices?

    Soil hydraulic properties from sampling analysis Using each of the thirty-one
    undisturbed soil cores, soil hydraulic properties were estimated from soil water
    retention curves generated using the Hyprop software. To illustrate the type of
    data generated, three of the soil cores from different soil textures and their
    respective field capacity and wilting point values are shown in Fig. 7. Table
    2 summarizes the SWC at field capacity (− 33 kPa), SWC at wilting point (− 1500
    kPa) and calculated available water content (AWC, cm3 cm−3) for each of the thirty-one
    soil cores. AWC was calculated by subtracting the SWC at − 1500 kPa from the SWC
    at − 33 kPa. In general, areas of the field with lower EOF values also have lower
    SWC at field capacity and wilting point. The EOF values are representative of
    the orthogonality of the SWC spatial patterns, therefore assumptions regarding
    in-field heterogeneity can be based off of the new EOF surfaces. Additionally,
    SWC at field capacity and wilting point is higher for finer soils and lower in
    coarser texture classes. AWC is higher for areas of the field with finer textured
    soils. Fig. 7 Soil water retention functions from three undisturbed soil cores.

    field capacity and wilting point values from the soil water retention curves generated
    using the Hyprop and WP4C instruments. Table 3 summarizes the linear correlation
    coefficient (r2) and root mean square error (RMSE) for the graphs illustrated
    in Fig. 8. The first EOF coefficients have the largest linear correlation coefficient
    (r2) with calculated AWC, laboratory measured SWC at field capacity and laboratory
    measured SWC at wilting point (Table 3). Compared to ECa, the CRNP and EOF analysis
    increased the linear correlation r2 by 0.218 and reduced the RMSE by 0.012 cm3
    cm−3 for measured SWC at field capacity. Table 3 exemplifies the weak relationship
    between laboratory measured SWC at field capacity and elevation, laboratory measured
    SWC at wilting point and elevation, calculated AWC and elevation, laboratory measured
    SWC at field capacity and TWI, laboratory measured SWC at wilting point and TWI,
    and calculated AWC and TWI. Therefore, the hypothesis that the first EOF provides
    superior spatial information correlating to the accurate prediction of three key
    soil hydraulic parameters (i.e. field capacity, wilting point, available water
    content) is justified for this field. Fig. 8 Laboratory measured SWC at field

    hydraulic property spatial datasets, EOFs can be used to generate new data products
    for use with variable-rate irrigation (VRI), variable-speed irrigation (VSI),
    and other commercial field equipment. As an illustration here, new field capacity,
    wilting point and AWC products were generated for this field using the relationships
    between the first EOF surface, elevation, and the laboratory measured hydraulic
    parameters (Fig. 9, Table 3). The authors note that additional single or multivariate
    linear/nonlinear functions could be explored to better characterize the observed
    trends in the data. Fig. 9 Resulting spatial estimates of a SWC at field capacity

    statistical fit and number of training and validation samples Full size image
    In the interest of exploring the feasibility of implementing CRNP and EOF analysis
    for the delineation of IMZs, a statistical bootstrapping analysis was performed
    (Table 4) to predict the number of soil samples needed to accurately estimate
    field capacity, wilting point and AWC following a similar analysis by Gibson and
    Franz (2018). Each of the hydrogeophyscial datasets (elevation, ECa survey, CRNP
    neutron count EOF, CRNP SWC EOF) was randomly divided into training and testing
    sets, with training set sizes ranging from 3 to 30, for 1000 iterations. The results
    from Table 4 suggest with fewer soil samples the neutron and SWC EOF surfaces
    are a more accurate predictor of soil hydraulic properties. When linearly correlating
    the CRNP SWC EOF to estimates of SWC at field capacity and AWC, RMSE is reduced
    approximately 20–25% compared to evaluations with ECa and elevation datasets.
    Wilting point estimates saw reductions in RMSE of 5–9% when comparing the CRNP
    SWC EOF to ECa and elevation datasets. Here, 6–8 sample locations for laboratory
    analysis were sufficient to describe the spatial distribution of soil hydraulic
    properties for this field. After eight soil samples, relatively small reductions
    in RMSE and standard deviation occurred for this particular field. Similar soil
    sampling sizes and results were found by Gibson and Franz (2018). Table 4 Results
    from the bootstrapping analysis Full size table Recommendations for future soil
    hydraulic property sampling Given the results of this work the authors propose
    a sampling strategy for better quantifying soil hydraulic properties that can
    be implemented in practice. (1) Complete a minimum of five CRNP rover surveys
    for the area of interest, with survey datasets selected to capture a range of
    SWC, to accurately estimate spatial SWC using the first one or two sets of EOF
    coefficients. As previously stated, the presented work used a bootstrapping analysis
    to indicate five CRNP surveys at different SWC conditions were sufficient to estimate
    the first EOF coefficients to within 5% of the values using data from all ten
    surveys. The five CRNP surveys and EOF correlations from this work are further
    supported by Gibson and Franz (2018). EOF coefficients could be calculated based
    on the neutron intensity measurements (Table 4), saving processing time and eliminating
    the need for terrestrial hydrogen pool datasets. However, the authors suggest
    using the CRNP SWC product as it has a greater physical meaning to soil hydraulic
    properties. Based on additional data (Gibson and Franz 2018) from fields across
    the Midwest, the authors found similar relationships and recommendations for the
    required minimal number of CRNP surveys. An example of real-world implementation
    might involve a service provider investing in CRNP technology and cooperating
    with multiple producers to perform the CRNP rover surveys. Additionally, the CRNP
    surveys could be completed simultaneously with other field operations (i.e. ATV,
    tractor, sprayer) and over several growing seasons. (2) Using the EOF coefficients
    from the CRNP SWC maps, 6–8 soil sample locations (Table 4) should be selected
    across a range of EOF values. The collection and analysis of soil cores to determine
    their soil retention curves and hydraulic parameters can be time consuming, laborious
    and expensive. Therefore, using the EOF surface to minimize the number of and
    placement of extracted soil cores is critical. The bootstrap analyses indicated
    a diminishing return of information beyond 6–8 samples for this 53 ha field. Similar
    sample sizes were reported in Gibson and Franz (2018). (3) Next, measure the soil
    hydraulic properties of interest (e.g. field capacity, wilting point, AWC) for
    the collected soil samples. Soil samples can be sent to a soil laboratory or analyzed
    in one’s lab using the Hyprop/WP4C combination for this work. (4) New data products
    can be generated using the relationship between EOF and the observed hydraulic
    parameters from the soil cores. These new data products can be produced at a variety
    of scales and different file types to operate within existing agricultural software
    and machinery. (5) In addition, the EOF surface can be used to delineate management
    zones. Here the authors suggest using a 1st order polynomial relationship describing
    the relationship between the first SWC EOF surface, elevation, and the laboratory
    measured SWC at field capacity (r2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.05 cm3 cm−3) and wilting point
    (r2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.02 cm3 cm−3) to delineate IMZs (Table 3). This should be
    done in conjunction with the USDA SSURGO data to better refine key boundaries.
    IMZs can be based on the EOF surface, the field capacity surface or the AWC surface.
    This research is of increasing importance for agricultural regions with ever-increasing
    water restrictions where small changes in water allocation rates and times may
    greatly impact crop yields. For example, at the current depletion rate, 35% of
    the Southern High Plains Aquifer is expected to be unable to support irrigation
    in the next 30 years (Scanlon et al. 2012). Consequently, there will be an increased
    effort to accurately map soil hydraulic properties and delineate high spatial
    and temporal irrigation prescription maps. Referring to Fig. 1, the feasibility
    of the CRNP and EOF analyses for management practice may soon be economically
    viable for many regions where maximizing water use for obtaining higher yields
    is paramount. The authors have shown here that the strong correlation with observed
    soil hydraulic parameters to the first EOF surface provides additional spatial
    variability information compared to EC mapping alone. If a land manager only used
    an EC map for estimating soil hydraulic properties, areas of a field may be biased
    depending on conditions at the time of sampling. In order to minimize error and
    improve IMZs, CRNP and EOF analysis should be used to increase the correlation
    between soil hydraulic properties and irrigation application rates (Fig. 8, Table
    3), which will subsequently improve irrigation prescription maps. CRNP and EOF
    analysis also provides irrigators with datasets they can use to generate dynamic
    prescription irrigation maps. Future research could investigate how increases
    in r2 and reductions is RMSE using the CRNP and EOF analysis could translate into
    increased water use efficiency with precision agricultural technologies. Additionally,
    studies could investigate whether high spatial resolution datasets of soil hydraulic
    properties increase water use efficiency while maintaining or increasing crop
    yields. Summary and conclusions Irrigation constitutes the largest component in
    global water use, yet within agricultural systems there is low water use efficiency.
    Therefore, improvements can be made in how irrigation application rates and times
    are managed. Traditional methods include the use of available soil property datasets,
    EC mapping, or commercially available instruments to delineate irrigation and
    land management zones. This research explored the utility of a hydrogeophysical
    sensor, called the CRNP, which measures near-surface soil water content (SWC)
    (top ~ 30 cm). In addition, when combining the CRNP SWC maps with the multivariate
    EOF analysis the authors found a better covariate for laboratory measured soil
    hydraulic properties for a field in west-central Nebraska, USA. The measured soil
    hydraulic properties were also compared to other readily available landscape and
    geophysical datasets including elevation, TWI and ECa maps. Based on this work
    the authors present a future sampling strategy to better understand spatially
    varying hydraulic properties within a field, as well as the delineation of IMZs.
    The new data products could be used within current irrigation management practice
    to improve water use efficiency by providing soil spatial datasets for the management
    of irrigation rates and times in relation to depletion below field capacity and
    above wilting point. Having an accurate quantification of field capacity and wilting
    point is especially important when volumetric SWC sensors are used for irrigation
    management. The authors do note that the strategy presented here constitutes a
    significant increase in effort as compared to more traditional and widely used
    techniques. However, as irrigation allocations become more stringent, there will
    likely be an increased rate of adoption of precision techniques that require more
    accurate mapping of soil hydraulic properties. The technology and framework presented
    here provides one potential strategy to better utilize precision agricultural
    technologies to increase water use efficiency while maintaining crop yields in
    varying topo-edaphic landscapes. Data availability The datasets and data products

  description: A recurrent issue in irrigation management refers to the number and
    optimal positioning of water content sensors in the root zone of a crop. In the
    field, the definition of the number and location of sensor installation is still
    arbitrary. How many sensors and where to install them has been studied using the
    Time Stable Representative Positions (TSRP) concept introduced by Soulis and Elmaloglou
    (2016). However, the effect of the period of the soil water content data used
    for the determination of the TSRP is not usually considered. The main objectives
    of this work are to analyze how the soil water content data collection period
    within an irrigation cycle affects the determined optimal sensor positioning based
    on TSRP; and, to evaluate if the sensors positioning affects the prediction of
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by numerical modeling. Over 60,000 soil water content
    data were obtained during 36 days from 12 TDR probes installed at different monitoring
    positions in the root zone of an irrigated banana plant. The optimal position
    of sensors was determined based on the concept of TSRP, considering soil water
    content data obtained during the entire and during the second part of the irrigation
    cycles. The SWAP hydrological model was also used to investigate the effect of
    sensors positioning in prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. It was verified
    that the use of soil water content data obtained at the beginning of an irrigation
    cycle - at times when infiltration occurs and there is a high intensity of redistribution
    of water in the soil - increases the uncertainties regarding the estimation of
    temporal stability for purposes of irrigation management. The result of the determination
    of the optimal positioning for sensors installation varies according to the part
    of the irrigation cycle from which water content measurements are considered.
    This variation affects the prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. As values
    of soil water content obtained at the beginning of the irrigation cycle increase
    the uncertainty of the statistical indicators and are not of practical interest
    for irrigation management, it is recommended that in the determination of optimal
    positioning of sensors, only soil water content values obtained after the infiltration
    and cessation of high rates of irrigation water redistribution are considered.

    and content Highlights • Redistribution during and after irrigation rises uncertainty
    in defining temporal stability. • Data obtained during and shortly after irrigation
    should not be used to detect temporal stability. • The measurements period used
    to evaluate temporal stability affects optimum sensor positioning. • Evapotranspiration
    prediction depends on the positioning of sensors for data collection. Abstract
    A recurrent issue in irrigation management refers to the number and optimal positioning
    of water content sensors in the root zone of a crop. In the field, the definition
    of the number and location of sensor installation is still arbitrary. How many
    sensors and where to install them has been studied using the Time Stable Representative
    Positions (TSRP) concept introduced by Soulis and Elmaloglou (2016). However,
    the effect of the period of the soil water content data used for the determination
    of the TSRP is not usually considered. The main objectives of this work are to
    analyze how the soil water content data collection period within an irrigation
    cycle affects the determined optimal sensor positioning based on TSRP; and, to
    evaluate if the sensors positioning affects the prediction of crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) by numerical modeling. Over 60,000 soil water content data were obtained
    during 36 days from 12 TDR probes installed at different monitoring positions
    in the root zone of an irrigated banana plant. The optimal position of sensors
    was determined based on the concept of TSRP, considering soil water content data
    obtained during the entire and during the second part of the irrigation cycles.
    The SWAP hydrological model was also used to investigate the effect of sensors
    positioning in prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. It was verified that the
    use of soil water content data obtained at the beginning of an irrigation cycle
    - at times when infiltration occurs and there is a high intensity of redistribution
    of water in the soil - increases the uncertainties regarding the estimation of
    temporal stability for purposes of irrigation management. The result of the determination
    of the optimal positioning for sensors installation varies according to the part
    of the irrigation cycle from which water content measurements are considered.
    This variation affects the prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. As values
    of soil water content obtained at the beginning of the irrigation cycle increase
    the uncertainty of the statistical indicators and are not of practical interest
    for irrigation management, it is recommended that in the determination of optimal
    positioning of sensors, only soil water content values obtained after the infiltration
    and cessation of high rates of irrigation water redistribution are considered.

    zoneSoil moisture sensors 1. Introduction An important issue in irrigation management
    based on soil water content (SWC) measurement is the positioning of sensors in
    the root zone of the crop. Although recent studies have developed sensors capable
    of providing real-time SWC at a low cost (Ramadan et al., 2018, Gao et al., 2018,
    Xu et al., 2018), in the field, the definition of the number and location of sensor
    installation is still arbitrary. Without criteria to define the optimal positioning
    of sensors, studies based on numerical modeling are developed based on SWC data
    obtained in various positions (Rallo et al., 2012, Van Vosselen et al., 2005,
    Li et al., 2014, Phogat et al., 2018, Abaker et al., 2018). Knowing the optimal
    sensor positioning minimizes costs, simplifies irrigation depth determination,
    and increases irrigation system efficiency. In fact, using numerical simulation,
    Soulis et al. (2015) verified that the variation in the efficiency of an irrigation
    system may be greater in function of the positioning of the sensor than the configuration
    of the system itself. In a field experiment, Silva et al. (2015) observed that
    evapotranspiration values determined by water balance computations may vary by
    up to 297% due to the sensor position. The problem in defining where and how many
    sensors to install for irrigation management has been studied based on the temporal
    stability of SWC obtained at several irrigated sites (Zhao et al., 2018, Barker
    et al., 2017) or in the root zone of the irrigated crop (Silva et al., 2018, Soulis
    and Elmaloglou, 2016). It is assumed that some specific locations may represent
    the mean values of SWC obtained (θm) over a period. The values of the SWC at a
    specific position (θi) are compared to the value of average water content θm using
    statistical indicators, such as the Root Mean Square Error - RMSE, the Nash-Sutcliffe
    Efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) and the Mean Relative Difference (Vachaud
    et al., 1984). However, the reliability of the obtained θm may vary according
    to the time scale of observation of θi (Entin et al., 2000, Brocca et al., 2010,
    Lai et al., 2017, Liao et al., 2017, Hupet and Vanclooster, 2002). The concept
    of temporal stability of spatially obtained SWC was first proposed by Vachaud
    et al. (1984). Recently, Soulis and Elmaloglou (2016) introduced the concept of
    Time Stable Representative Positions (TSRP) applied to the root zone of an irrigated
    crop. Based on the concept of TSRP, Soulis and Elmaloglou, 2018, Silva et al.,
    2018 proposed optimal sensor positions for the management of localized irrigation.
    The former is based on the simulation of SWC values, the latter based on observed
    field data. In these works, θm is obtained using observed values throughout an
    irrigation cycle (a period between two subsequent irrigations). However, since
    values of θm obtained during or closely after irrigation events can be associated
    with variations that are not of practical interest for the irrigation management,
    the estimation of temporal stability patterns for optimum sensor positioning may
    be accompanied by high uncertainties. Aiming to improve the positioning of sensors
    used for irrigation management based on the TSRP concept, we investigate if the
    period of SWC data collection within an irrigation cycle in a banana rooting zone
    alters the decision for the optimal positioning of sensors. We also investigate
    if a variation in the SWC measuring position in the root system affects the results
    of crop evapotranspiration predictions based on numerical modeling. 2. Material
    and methods A complete data set allowing temporal stability analysis and SWAP
    model use coming from a field experiment carried out at the Brazilian Agricultural
    Research Corporation EMBRAPA, located in the city of Cruz das Almas, state of
    Bahia, Brazil, was used. A complete specification of soil, crop, climate and methods
    of data collection is available in Silva et al. (2015). Following the most important
    information is provided. 2.1. SWC data Soil water content (SWC) data were obtained
    at 10-minute intervals over a period of 36 days using twelve TDR probes installed
    in the root zone of a lysimeter-grown banana tree according to the grid of Fig.
    1, resulting in 62,208 water content data. Download : Download high-res image

    of the 12 TDR sensors in the root system of the banana tree. TDR probes (three
    0.1 m rods, spaced 0.017 m), integrated with multiplexers (Campbell SDMX50) and
    a data acquisition system (CR1000) were used. The TDR probes were calibrated for
    a wide range of soil water contents (23 data pairs between 0.048 m3 m−3 to 0.38 m3 m−3)
    to obtain a 3rd-degree polynomial relation with an R2 of 0.981. Data were obtained
    between October and November 2012, when the plant was in the fruiting phase. At
    the center of a 320 m2 banana orchard, one plant was grown on a 5 m3 (2 m × 2.5 m × 1 m)
    rectangular drainage lysimeter. The lysimeter drainage system was composed of
    perforated PVC pipes located within a 0.1 m gravel layer. A layer of 0.1 m of
    washed sand was accommodated on top of the gravel layer. In the field experiment
    from which data used in this study were taken, irrigations were calculated based
    on the readings of the 72 TDR probes installed at different positions within the
    lysimeter. For a detailed illustration of the arrangement of these probes within
    the lysimeter and additional information about the irrigation management we refer
    to Silva et al., (2015). The irrigation system consisted of micro-sprinklers with
    a flow rate of 60 L h−1, distributed to irrigate the entire lysimeter surface
    with an average uniformity of 91% (as determined by field uniformity tests). 2.2.
    Time Stable Representative Positions (TSRP) analysis The temporal variation of
    SWC for the 12 probes was analyzed to detect a Time Stable Representative Position
    (TSRP), i.e., a position where the water content was representative for the other
    positions during the 36 days of monitoring. The verification was done using standard
    Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) statistics (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) and root
    mean square error (RMSE), as used by Soulis and Elmaloglou (2018): (1) (2) where
    θm,t is the average water content in the root zone at time t; θs,t is the sensor
    reading at time t; θm is the average water content in the root zone for the whole
    experimental period; n is the number of data points; and t corresponds to the
    time interval within the experimental period during which data were obtained.
    Two situations were considered to calculate NSE and RMSE: i. θm,t, θs,t and θm
    calculated using data points obtained during the entire irrigation cycle; and
    ii. θm,t, θs,t and θm calculated using data points obtained after cessation of
    the infiltration and rapid water redistribution process (partial irrigation cycle).
    Sensors were ranked according to the NSE and RMSE values calculated for both situations.
    The sensor with the highest NSE and lowest RMSE was considered to be at the most
    representative position in the root zone. Rankings using entire and partial irrigation
    cycles were compared. 2.3 Variations in TSRP and its effect on ET prediction Predictions
    of evapotranspiration (ET) of the banana tree were made using the SWAP hydrological
    model (Kroes et al., 2017) based on each of the twelve sensor positions. SWAP
    (Soil, Water, Atmosphere and Plant) is a 1D Richards equation based agrohydrological
    model simulating water, solute and heat flows in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.
    To numerically solve the Richards equation, SWAP uses the Mualem - Van Genuchten
    equations and respective parameters (Mualem, 1981, Van Genuchten, 1980). Potential
    evapotranspiration is predicted using the Penman-Monteith equation. In the simulations,
    the crop coefficient (Kc) was taken from Coelho et al. (2006), who found Kc = 1.1
    for a similar banana plant. The root uptake sink term is predicted using the Feddes
    et al. (1978) reduction function. More details about the banana plant are available
    in Silva et al. (2015). The irrigation depths provided to the model varied for
    each simulation condition, i.e., before each of the eight growing cycles, and
    for each of the twelve positions shown in Fig. 1, the amount of irrigation needed
    to bring the soil back to a pressure head of –1 m was determined, considering
    the measured rooting depth of 0.6 m. The Van Genuchten (1980) equation was fitted
    to water retention data from Silva et al. (2015) and used to convert between water
    contents and pressure head. Data of solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperature,
    air humidity, wind speed and rain were taken from a meteorological station of
    the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) at about 200 m from the experimental
    site. Root system data were provided to the model based on the result of root
    sampling after harvesting the fruits. Root length density was determined in soil
    cores with dimensions 0.10 m × 0.10 m × 0.10 m, sampled at several distances and
    depths. The roots were separated from the soil by washing and digitally scanned
    and total root length at each position was obtained from the scanned images using
    Rootedge software (Kaspar and Ewing, 1997). The obtained two-dimensional root
    length density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Root length density (cm cm−3) measured
    at several positions in the banana root zone. Depth (m) Distance from stem center
    (m) 0.2–0.3 0.4–0.5 0.6–0.7 0.8–0.9 0–0.1 1.4 0.6 0.3 0.1 0.1–0.2 2.1 1.0 0.5

    0.3 0.5 0.3 0.2 The SWAP hydrological model was evaluated regarding its predicting
    capacity for soil water content values observed at the respective TDR probe by
    the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured
    data (RSR, Moriasi et al. 2007) and Spearman correlation (rs). RSR is calculated
    as the ratio of RMSE and standard deviation of measured data, according to (3)
    where θi,obs is the ith soil water content observation from TDR readings; θi,pred
    is the ith predicted soil water content value by the SWAP model; θmean is the
    mean of observed soil water content data; and n is the total number of soil water
    content observations and predictions. The Spearman correlation coefficient rs
    is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ranked variables allowing a
    non-parametric test that replaces each θi,obs data point by its rank among all
    other θi,pred data points. rs was calculated using the Model Evaluation Software
    (MES), version 3.1.17 (Tedeschi, 2006). At the beginning of each irrigation cycle,
    initial SWC data were obtained at the twelve monitoring positions, making up twelve
    initial ET simulation conditions. To verify if the ET simulation varies according
    to the position of obtaining SWC, the simulated ET series for the twelve monitoring
    positions were compared by linear regression analysis, testing the joint null
    hypothesis for the parameters of the equations obtained: y = a + bx, H0: a = 0
    and b = 1 (Mayer et al., 1994). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Temporal variation
    of soil water and determination of TSRP The bias of the water content observed
    at a specific probe when compared to the mean water content was higher during
    and shortly after the irrigation event (Fig. 2). During the first hours, rapid
    infiltration and redistribution processes occur causing high temporal and spatial
    variability, especially at 0.1 m depth. This explains the observed reduction of
    the average error with increase of depth. Download : Download high-res image (332KB)

    content and deviations obtained with probes located at depths 0.1 m, 0.3 m and
    0.5 m at 0.3 m horizontal distance from the stem and (Bottom) Temporal variation
    of the mean deviation of the soil water content calculated based on data obtained
    from the twelve sensors installed in the root zone. If the mean soil water content
    is determined based on values obtained during the entire irrigation cycle, the
    larger bias at the beginning of the cycle obviously affects the determination
    of the best sensor placement based on TSRP. For example, the difference between
    the mean values of soil water content provided by the probes located at 0.3 and
    0.5 m depth (both at 0.3 m horizontal distance from the stem) during the entire
    irrigation cycle (Fig. 2) was 0.003 m3 m−3. At the same time, the difference between
    the standard deviations associated with the mean values of these probes in the
    same period was 0.01 m3 m−3. When the same comparison is made using only data
    obtained after cessation of the infiltration and rapid water redistribution process
    the difference between the mean values increases to 0.005 m3 m−3, whereas the
    difference between standard deviations decreases to 0.001 m3 m−3. During an irrigation
    cycle, the temporal variation of the standard deviation of the average water content
    obtained with data from the twelve TDR probes installed in the root zone θm,t
    Eq. (1) can be divided in two stages: (i) stage 1, when there is a predominance
    of infiltration and redistribution and when θm,t presents high deviations; (ii)
    stage 2, when the infiltration ceased and redistribution intensity decreased,
    and the predominating process is root water extraction or transpiration, with
    a lower standard deviation of θm,t (Fig. 2). A number of previous studies that
    apply the concept of temporal stability to values of soil water content observed
    at various points in large areas (such as river basins) point to a common evidence
    that soil water content variation increases for the wetter conditions (Zhou et
    al., 2007). These studies also stress the fact that the estimation of a soil moisture
    temporal pattern during the dry-wet transition period may be accompanied by high
    uncertainties (Brocca et al., 2012), not allowing the determination of a time-stable
    soil water content pattern. During stage 1, the standard deviations of the mean
    soil water content calculated with data obtained from the twelve probes installed
    in the root zone are higher than in stage 2 and influenced the determination of
    the optimal positioning of sensors for irrigation management purposes based on
    the NSE and RMSE indicators. Using data from eight continuous irrigation cycles,
    this analysis showed that the selection of the best TSRP is influenced by the
    part of the irrigation cycle used as a criterion (i.e. entire irrigation cycle
    or partial irrigation cycle), see Table 2. Specifically, calculating the NSE and
    RMSE based on soil water content data obtained during the whole irrigation cycle
    (stage 1 + stage 2) yielded a different final rank than when using only data obtained
    in stage 2 (partial irrigation cycle). It is observed that those probes considered
    to be time stable; i.e. presenting NSE > 0.5 (Moriasi et al., 2007, Soulis and
    Elmaloglou, 2018), have lower RMSE values in case that the data obtained at the
    beginning of the irrigation cycle are not considered, increasing therefore the
    reliability of the corresponding probe readings. The highest reliability is associated
    with the fact that values of soil water content measured during irrigation/infiltration
    events and the subsequent hours of intense redistribution are not of practical
    interest for calculations of irrigation depths. In the occasional cases when the
    sensors are also used to define the end of the irrigation, the water content measured
    during the irrigation may also be useful. The soil water contents obtained after
    cessation of the infiltration and rapid water redistribution process, resulting
    from the loss of water from the root zone by evaporation, root water extraction
    and slow drainage, are much more important for common practices in irrigation
    management. Table 2. Rank of the statistical indicators used to determine the
    optimal position of sensors calculated based on soil water contents obtained during

    0.055 Fig. 3 shows the soil water content obtained at probes 3 and 5 (those considered
    representative of the root zone when considering complete and partial irrigation
    cycles, respectively). From the figure it is clear how the inclusion of the first
    hours of the irrigation cycle affects the value of the SSE - numerator of Eq.
    (1) - obtained for a probe during the entire cycle. For the example of Fig. 3,
    when the NSE was calculated using the entire cycle, probe 3 had the best performance
    (lowest SSE and highest NSE). However, when not considering data from the first
    6 h, probe 5 shows the best performance. Obviously, the duration of stage 1 will
    vary according to boundary conditions like emitter flow rate, irrigation management,
    soil and crop types, and atmospheric demand. Therefore, errors obtained at the
    beginning of an irrigation cycle are propagated in a way that affects the distinction
    between two probes at the end. The observation of this fact is particularly useful
    for studies aimed at determining the optimum positioning of sensors for the management
    of localized irrigation. Soulis and Elmaloglou, 2016, Silva et al., 2018, for
    example, defined the optimal position of sensors based on the average values of
    soil water content obtained during the entire irrigation cycle. Download : Download

    and sum of square errors (SSE) for the probes considered representative of the
    profile when using entire cycle data (probe 3) and partial cycle data (probe 5).
    Since the values of soil water content obtained at the beginning of an irrigation
    cycle are not of interest for the calculation of the subsequent irrigation depth
    and raise the uncertainty of the estimation of stability patterns, it is recommended
    that the determination of optimal positioning of sensors for irrigation management
    purposes is performed with data obtained after cessation of the infiltration and
    rapid water redistribution process. 3.2. The effect of sensor positioning on ET
    predictions by a hydrological model The statistical coefficients RSR- Eq. (3)
    - and Spearman''s rank correlation coefficient rs show that the SWAP model was
    well calibrated to predict water contents during the eight cycles of irrigation
    (Table 3). The non-parametric (rs) evaluation indicated a better performance of
    the model in simulating the values and variations of soil water content obtained
    at the 12 monitoring positions than the parametric RSR test. This is because soil
    water content values obtained during infiltration of irrigation water may be considered
    outliers but cannot be disregarded in the numerical simulation. According to Tedeschi
    (2006) the non-parametric evaluation of a model is less sensitive to the presence
    of outliers, and in the case of rs the model is evaluated by the difference of
    rank of the set of values observed by TDR measurements and predicted by the SWAP
    model. Table 3. Indicators of goodness-of-fit of SWAP model predictions and TDR
    observations during the eight irrigation cycles. Probe RSR Spearman’s rs(p-value)

    shows the observed and predicted water content representative for the entire and
    partial cycle (Table 2, positions 3 and 5, respectively). At position 3, immediately
    before the irrigation when an irrigation depth would be calculated, observed average
    water content was 0.264 ± 0.02 m3 m−3, while the predicted values were 0.255 ± 0.02 m3 m−3.
    Based on probe 5, these values were 0.271 ± 0.01 m3 m−3 and 0.261 ± 0.02 m3 m−3.
    The difference between both probes indicate that for irrigation management, uncertainties
    in the values of soil water content from the model prediction errors may be lower
    than those from sensor positioning. This becomes more evident when comparing to
    position 12, with respective values of measurement and prediction of 0.318 ± 0.01 m3 m−3
    and 0.315 ± 0.01 m3 m−3. Download : Download high-res image (239KB) Download :

    water content and (Bottom) Relation between predicted ET values when using data
    from the entire cycle (probe 3) and from the partial cycle (probe 5). During the
    irrigation cycles, water contents observed at positions 3 and 5 at the time of
    calculation of the irrigation depth varied up to 0.03 m3 m−3. The maximum difference
    among all sensors was 0.08 m3 m−3. These differences in water content obtained
    at the monitoring positions at the time of the irrigation depth calculation were
    considered in the SWAP simulation of ET. The obtained values of ET were compared
    by the null hypothesis test, which evaluates whether the intercept and the angular
    coefficient do not differ from 0 and 1, respectively (Mayer et al., 1994). The
    resulting test matrix (Table 4) shows that simulated ET values over eight irrigation
    cycles are distinct in 68% of comparisons. In other words, the position from which
    initial SWC data are retrieved affect the results of ETc prediction by a numerical
    1-D model. The predicted ET value may vary by up to 3.6 mm d–1 depending on the
    positioning of the sensor used to obtain the initial SWC. On average, the standard
    deviation between the simulated values at the twelve positions was 0.6 mm d–1.

    in ET determination as a function of sensor positioning show that irrigation management,
    although theoretically well defined, is subject to significant errors. The spatial
    variability of water content and water extraction in the root zone decreases the
    confidence of irrigation amount calculation when based on sensors positioned without
    criteria. However, addressing this variability, using the TSRP concept allows
    the supply of water via irrigation based on the average water content in the soil
    region explored by the rooting system. Recent studies (Ramadan et al., 2018, Gao
    et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2018) show that the cost of soil moisture sensors has
    decreased, allowing irrigation management based on the TSRP concept. Using TSRP
    is therefore an achievement that can close a gap in the determination of irrigation
    water supply based on pressure head or water content measurement, namely the arbitrariness
    in the positioning of soil water sensors. 4. Conclusions It was found that the
    period of observation of soil water content during an irrigation cycle affects
    the determination of optimal sensor positioning for irrigation management purposes
    based on the concept of Time Stable Representative Positions. This is caused by
    the higher spatial instability at the onset of an irrigation cycle, when infiltration
    is still occurring, and water redistribution takes place at elevated rates, causing
    high variations of the water content in the root zone. These values, if included
    in the determination of optimal sensor positioning, propagate throughout the irrigation
    cycle, giving imprecise distinctions between the probes at the time of irrigation
    depth calculation at the end of an irrigation cycle. Defining the optimal positioning
    of sensors based on soil water content data from an entire irrigation cycle may
    result in an inefficient irrigation management. This study indicates as well that
    crop evapotranspiration values determined from numerical modeling may vary depending
    on the positioning of the sensor providing the initial water content data. Since,
    in fact, values of water content in the soil obtained at the beginning of an irrigation
    cycle increase the uncertainty of the statistical indicators and are not of practical
    interest for irrigation management, we recommend that in studies investigating
    the optimal positioning of soil water content sensors, only soil water content
    values obtained after the infiltration and cessation of high rates of redistribution
    irrigation water are considered, except in those rare cases when the sensors are
    also used to define the end of the irrigation. Acknowledgements The authors wish

    due to large variations in the wetting pattern [25]. Likewise, [46] found that
    the determination of best sensor placement based on TSRPs concept is highly dependent
    on when the SWC samples were taken. SWC data at the beginning of irrigation cycle
    could significantly increase the uncertainty caused by infiltration and intensive

  description: An adequate irrigation schedule is necessary to optimize water-use
    efficiency, prevent nutrient leaching and maintain optimal growing conditions
    in soil-bound lettuce production. As Flemish growers base their strategy mainly
    on experience and basic soil sampling, the implementation of a decision support
    system (DSS) could improve their irrigation management. We simplified an already
    adapted Penman-Monteith model for calculation of actual water demand of lettuce
    crops, by reducing the amount of essential input variables from five to three
    namely irradiation (Rs), ambient temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH).
    Data collection was facilitated using the climate computer or a custom developed
    sensor module. To promote implementation in practice, a user-friendly web application
    was developed. The irrigation management decision support tool (IMDST), referring
    to the combination of sensor module and web-application, was introduced in 12
    Flemish greenhouses. Four growers validated the tool in 16 plantings, comparing
    model irrigation (MI) with their personal irrigation (PI) strategy. In half of
    them, no differences in irrigation amount nor crop yield were observed. In four,
    heavier crops were obtained following MI and in two lighter crops. In only one
    planting, MI yielded water savings of more than 10%, without adverse effects on
    yield. In two other plantings, MI required at least 10% more water compared to
    PI, without providing any gain in yield or quality. The remaining eight growers
    applied the tool as DSS in over 30 plantings divided over different seasons. The
    use of the IMDST in those plantings revealed that for light soil textures, like
    sand, the model generally advised less water than growers normally would apply.
    On loamy soils, growers rapidly gained confidence in the tool, as calculations
    closely resembled their own strategy. By deploying the IMDST on professional horticultural
    production sites, growers acquired hands-on experience and learned how the tool
    contributes to a smarter, more sustainable, irrigation management. Growers confirmed
    usefulness of the IMDST, providing that recommendations should be interpreted
    according to PI strategies.

    is the highest sub-vertical (28.08%) followed by crop management (14.60%) then
    smart farming (10.11%). From the data collection, livestock management and irrigation
    management resulted in the same percentage (5.61%). In regard to sensor data collection,
    the highest result was for the measurement of environmental temperature (24.87%)
    and environmental humidity (19.79%). There are also some other sensor data regarding
    soil moisture (15.73%) and soil pH (7.61%). Research indicates that of the technologies

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Water is an important
    resource and must be used efficiently. The agriculture sector is the main water
    consumer; it uses approximately 70% of all available water resources worldwide
    [1]. This sector’s consumption will be controlled if modern technology is adopted
    with traditional irrigation procedures, particularly flooding. However, in this
    sector, modern technologies are accepted only if they exhibit a sufficient potential
    to increase crop yield while preserving as many resources as possible [2]. At
    present, different activities, particularly irrigation, in agriculture are performed
    with traditional procedures that are time consuming, labor intensive, and wasteful
    [3]. The traditional agricultural paradigm was geared toward modern technology
    utilization in the last decade, and its acceptance ratio at the commercial level
    increased. Technology adaptation has led to the automation of different agriculture-related
    activities, and this automation is known as precision farming or precision agriculture
    in literature [4]. The main motivation is that crop quality and production rates
    will improve if the right resources are applied at the right time under suitable
    environmental conditions. Such mechanisms improve crop yield and conserve considerable
    resources, such as water, pesticide spray, and potassium. Different mechanisms
    are utilized to collect environmental parameters and soil features, such as moisture,
    salinity, pH, temperature, air humidity, and wind direction [5], [6]. Scientific
    and research organizations are eager to apply the potential of micro-electro-mechanical
    system (MEMS) technology and the overwhelming characteristics of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) in different application areas, including the military, intelligent
    buildings and bridges, medical field, industries, and precision agriculture [7]–[9].
    In precision agriculture, WSNs are deployed in fields to sense and report various
    parameters that are vital to plant growth. Initial experiments with WSNs in the
    agriculture sector have been conducted in controlled environments, such as greenhouses,
    in which sensors/actuators are deployed to control the indoor environment automatically
    [10], [11]. WSNs have also been utilized in different projects, such as automating
    greenhouses, efficient water utilization, and identification of crop diseases.
    Most of these studies used WSNs as data collection tools, and decision support
    systems (DSS) were responsible for actual decisions. After the successful deployment
    of WSNs in controlled environments, researchers and scientists explored their
    applications in open field environments, but such an exploration was challenging.
    As part of a LOFAR project, Baggio [12] deployed a small network of wireless nodes
    in potato fields to detect a fungal disease known as Phytophthora. A similar experimental
    study was performed as a joint project of Switzerland and India in [13]. Mancuso
    and Bustaffa [14] explored the potential of WSNs to control various tomato diseases
    and described how this technology helps in controlling such diseases. Burrell
    et al. [15] deployed sensor nodes in a vineyard to assist managers in handling
    different scenarios, frost risk, and specific location by providing valuable information
    continuously. The FLOW-AID project used WSN to identify water deficit situations,
    scenarios where plants are in desperate need of water [16]. In 2011, Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Information and Communication
    Technology utilized WSNs to help recover the ecological integrity of Queensland’s
    Spring Brook National Park and regenerate the rain forest from agricultural grassland
    [17]. Other experimental studies have been conducted recently, but their description
    is beyond the scope of this work. The literature on WSNs in the agriculture sector
    is robust, but most of the studies neglected an important issue associated with
    data generated by sensor nodes, namely, outliers. Outliers are noisy data generated
    by sensor nodes when a sensor is malfunctioning or generated because of interference
    or colliding packets. These data must be detected and corrected prior to examination
    by DSS. Existing noise detection algorithms are highly complex, and their implementation
    in real-time DSS, a system that operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, is
    difficult. Therefore, a simple mechanism that does not degrade the overall performance
    of real-time DSS is needed to detect outliers. Most existing studies are designed
    for sprinkler systems and are inapplicable to real agriculture environments where
    flooding mechanisms are generally used to irrigate crops; such a practice is particularly
    common in Asia. In this work, a WSN-based outlier detection and irrigation management
    system is developed to assist farmers in handling crop irrigation schedules. The
    proposed system collects environmental and soil-related data through sensor nodes
    that are examined by the outlier detection module. The proposed noise detection
    algorithm is implemented to improve the system’s accuracy. Afterward, DSS further
    examines it to identify water deficient sites in agricultural fields. After identification,
    the alarming unit is activated, and text messages are sent over a local area network
    (LAN) to inform farmers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
    Section II, a brief overview of WSNs, particularly in the agriculture sector,
    is presented, followed by the proposed system architecture in Section III. Section
    IV describes the proposed outlier detection algorithm and its working mechanism.
    The different issues identified and solved during this study are presented in
    Section V. In Section VI, the achievements of the proposed approach are described,
    and a comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms is performed
    based on real-time and benchmark datasets. The last section provides the concluding
    remarks. SECTION II. WSN in Agriculture Sector The distinguishing characteristics
    of WSNs make this technology an ideal solution to various real-world problems.
    These problems arise in different domains, such as the military, medicine, telemetric,
    intelligent building, hazard environments, and agriculture [18]. In the agriculture
    sector, WSNs are used to assist farmers in different activities, such as irrigation
    (whether sprinkled or flooding), detection and prevention of crop diseases in
    early stages or preventing favorable occurrence conditions, water-deficient location
    identification, and duration of field monitoring and pesticide spraying [19].
    Various experimental studies on WSNs in the agriculture sector have addressed
    particular problems. The studies that are relevant to our work are presented in
    this part. WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses to control the dew condensation
    problem that arises due to temperature, air humidity, pressure, and other environmental
    factors [20]. Park et al used different sensor nodes to collect data and adjust
    greenhouse environments accordingly. To compute for dew condensation, they utilized
    a well-known Bahrenburg formula. In a joint project to determine the ratio of
    arsenic in underground water, a WSN was deployed in [21] to collect various soil
    parameters of a rice field, such as arsenic, soil moisture, temperature, calcium,
    carbonate, chloride, nitrate, and pH. The collected data were thoroughly examined
    in sophisticated laboratories to determine the required ratio. Similarly, sensor
    nodes were deployed in Malawi to collect pH, reduction/oxidation (redox), and
    turbidity values to determine the quality of water [22]. In Spain, WSN was deployed
    to monitor soil contents, such as moisture, salinity, pH, and temperature [23].
    This system was successfully implemented in a real agriculture environment, but
    the decisions were not automated. To describe how few sensor nodes covered a particular
    area, the authors wrote an expression that describes the relationship between
    shower nozzle capacity and sensor node radius [24]. Konstantinos et al. presented
    a WSN-based architecture to control environmental conditions in a commercial greenhouse.
    The collected data were thoroughly examined to find their correlation with crop
    conditions [25]. Proper seedling of watermelon relies on environmental parameters,
    such as temperature, air humidity, and light values. Sensor nodes were deployed
    in greenhouses to collect and examine desired information and assist farmers in
    proper seedling of watermelon. A process control strategy management system was
    also designed in previous studies to determine proper and automatic seedling of
    watermelon; its various components were WSN, DSS, RFID-based method, and queuing
    theory-based algorithm [26], [27]. Phytophthora is a potato fungal disease that
    occurs due to certain environmental conditions, and if these conditions are prevented/avoided,
    then the possibility of the disease’s existence will become negligible. Baggio
    [12] utilized a WSN to collect desired data and attempted to avoid conditions
    that are favorable for the disease. Similarly, WSNs were deployed in potato fields
    by Shinghal et al. [3] to improve productivity. Favorable conditions for tomato
    diseases were avoided by using WSNs inside greenhouses [14]. In vineyards, sensor
    nodes were deployed in different locations to collect valuable data that were
    used for predicting various diseases, pest control, and facilitating the handling
    of different activities [15]. Kotamäki et al. [28] deployed a WSN near a river
    basin to determine the quality of water and described its effects on soil content
    and crop yield. The Common Sense Net Project was designed for marginal farming
    in India, in which different sensor nodes were used to identify areas whose water,
    rain, reservation capacities were high. Additionally, the project can identify
    various crop diseases [13]. The Flow AID Project was designed to utilize the WSN’s
    potentials in determining water-deficient sites in agriculture fields [16]. Dursun
    and Ozden [29] presented an automatic drip irrigation management system for cherry
    trees. Pardossi et al. [30] described a mechanism to integrate rote zone sensors
    with WSN and used it in the identification of water deficit situations. Various
    investigations on automatic control of greenhouses were reported in [4], [31],
    and [32]. Different site-specific automatic irrigation management systems were
    presented in [33]–[36]. SECTION III. Proposed System Architecture and Deployment
    A. Architecture Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed DSS. In the proposed
    architecture, an application layer is designed to provide services to farmers
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). These services include
    interaction with the real-time system, identification of water-deficient locations,
    vulnerable situation alarms, and environmental monitoring. The middle layer describes
    how various components of the proposed system interact with one another, physically
    or logically, to provide the desired services precisely. The sensor manager unit
    collects data from sensors and forwards these to a microprocessor that conducts
    aggregation for further processing. The gateway module receives packets from sensor
    nodes, and is attached to a computer that runs the proposed DSS. DSS collects
    the newly arrived packets from the gateway module, checks their accuracy through
    a noise detection module, decides the current situation, and stores it. The physical
    layer directly interacts with the environment. Sensor nodes that use various sensing
    capabilities collect soil moisture, air humidity, temperature, and leaf wetness
    data and send the data to the sensor manager. These parameters are vital in the
    development of a precise DSS for irrigation. FIGURE 1. Architecture of the proposed
    DSS. Show All Real-time systems need to be continuously operational to assist
    farmers, but at the same time, the sensor node sampling rate must be adjusted
    accordingly to prolong the WSN’s lifetime. In our testbed, wasp-mote agriculture
    sensor boards with desired functionality were programmed and deployed in a real
    agriculture environment, namely, an orange orchard. During the first phase of
    the experimental setup, the boards were placed in close proximity to reduce packet
    losses, thereby improving communication reliability. In the second phase, the
    boards were placed to cover as much area as possible, and each node can communicate
    with the gateway either directly or through multi-hop communication. Their transceivers
    use the Xbee protocol and can communicate within a 500 m range. Nod e 3 was deployed
    within the direct communication range of the gateway (460 m), and Nod e 1 and
    Nod e 2 were placed at a distance of 460 m from Node3. The distance between the
    nodes and gateway was kept small to maximize their throughput. The proposed DSS
    performance is not affected by increasing or decreasing scalability of sensor
    nodes because these nodes act as data collection points. Dense deployment increases
    data packets, but this situation is not an issue, particularly in the agriculture
    sector, in which the sampling rate of the deployed sensor nodes must be very low,
    namely, two or three packets per 24 hours. B. Wasp-Mote Boards Deployment The
    implementation of a precise real-time DSS in any application depends on the selection
    of appropriate technology, sensors, and parameters to be monitored. Sensor board
    selection is based on coverage area, battery lifetime, processing capability,
    transceiver, and integration of sensors. Parameter selection is application-specific.
    In our study, we considered soil and environmental parameters. Soil moisture is
    vital in the development of a precise irrigation schedule; that is, if the sensed
    value is below a threshold value, then this area needs water and must be irrigated.
    For this purpose, soil moisture sensors were deployed at three different levels
    in the agricultural field, as shown in Figs. 2 and Fig. 3. In addition to the
    soil moisture parameter, an atmospheric moister exerts drastic effects on the
    watering schedules of various crops and must be monitored regularly. These sensors
    are deployed in close proximity to plant leaves, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally,
    temperature and humidity parameters are significant in the design of a precise
    DSS because the soil moisture threshold value is directly proportional to the
    environmental temperature. Therefore, these sensors are integrated with wasp-mote
    boards to collect their full potential, as shown in Fig. 5. The gateway module
    is connected to a computer to receive data and process them. FIGURE 2. Deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in orange orchard. Show All FIGURE 3. Deployment soil
    moisture sensor in real agricultural environment. Show All FIGURE 4. Leaf wetness
    sensor deployment near plant leaves. Show All FIGURE 5. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors deployment. Show All SECTION IV. Proposed Decision Support System The
    proposed system collects soil and environmental parameters through its deployed
    WSN in the orange orchard. Initially, the collected data are examined by the concerned
    board to minimize redundant packets via aggregation, and the data are transferred
    to the destination via a gateway. The data sensed by four different sensors are
    merged into one packet to increase the efficiency of the proposed system in terms
    of energy consumption. These packets are forwarded to the outlier detection module
    where their accuracy is checked and sent to DSS for onward processing if found
    correct. DSS thoroughly examines these packets by comparing different parameters
    with their defined threshold values, particularly soil moisture (250 Hz).The threshold
    values such as soil moisture (250Hz), are determined through deploying the sensors
    (3) in dry soil; and collecting their readings over a period of three days. If
    the data are in the defined range, then they are stored in a database; otherwise,
    the alarm unit is activated, and alert messages are forwarded to the LAN or mobile
    phone. The GUI of the proposed system shows collected data in graphical and textual
    formats. The operation of the proposed system is summarized in Fig. 6. FIGURE
    6. Working of the proposed system. Show All A. Proposed Outliers Detection Algorithm
    Outliers are data packets generated by a malfunctioning sensor or via interference
    and collision. WSNs are highly susceptible to outliers due to various restrictions
    on their size, processing, and transceivers. The literature on outlier/noise detection
    is bulky, but most of the approaches were presented and validated based on static
    datasets, and their implementation in a real-time system is difficult or impractical.
    These algorithms improve dataset accuracy but equally degrade the overall performance
    of a real-time system because for every packet, the mechanism repeatedly searches
    the entire dataset [37], [38]. Moreover, the accuracy of these algorithms is directly
    proportional to dataset size and computation time. Their accuracy for large datasets
    is extremely high, but the computation time is also high and results in low performance
    of DSS, particularly in a real-time system. Therefore, a simplified outlier detection
    algorithm was developed to overcome these issues and improve the performance of
    real-time DSS and dataset accuracy. The performance of a real-time system based
    on the proposed outlier detection algorithm is unaffected by dataset size because
    the algorithm does not scan the overall dataset and considers the most recent
    packets only. Its computation time and performance are exceptionally good in real-time
    datasets, and it is equally applicable to static datasets. Algorithm 1 starts
    by matching the currently received packet with the previously stored one, which
    is the last accurate packet, that is, the packet received at time T i and T i−1
    . If their difference is less than the defined threshold value (10 Hz for the
    soil moisture sensor), then it is forwarded to the DSS for further analysis. However,
    if their difference crosses the defined limit, then it is either an outlier or
    an abrupt change scenario that occurs because of direct connection of water with
    soil moisture sensors. In this case, data are stored temporarily, and further
    processing is delayed until the next packet from that particular node arrives.
    Then, the recently received packet is compared with two packets, namely, the one
    that is temporarily stored and the last packet stored in the database. For example,
    data collected at time T 3 are matched with data received at time T 2 and stored
    temporarily, and data gathered at time T 1 is successfully stored. If the difference
    between packets received at T 3 and T 1 is less than the defined threshold value,
    then the data packet received at T 2 is an outlier and replaced with the average
    value of data packets T 1 and T 3 . However, if the difference between data packets
    T 2 and T 3 is less than the threshold value, then it is an abrupt change scenario,
    and both values are stored in the database. Algorithm 1 Proposed Outliers Detection

    Fig. 7 in which the soil moisture value received at time 13:00 is 0 Hz, representing
    the most recent packet. The packet collected at time 12:30, 850 Hz, is the last
    accurate value stored in the database. These two values are matched, and their
    difference is much larger than the threshold value, which is 10 Hz in our case.
    Therefore, this packet is temporarily stored, and the decision is delayed until
    the next packet from the same node, Nod e 1 , arrives. When the next packet at
    time 13:30 is received, it is matched with the packet collected at time 12:30
    or with most recently stored packet. The difference between these packets is below
    the threshold value, 1 Hz, indicating that the temporarily stored packet is an
    outlier and must be replaced with the average value of data packets that arrived
    at times 12:30 and 13:30 (840 Hz). Then, both values are stored in the database,
    and the data are as shown in Fig. 8. In this scenario, a real-time DSS that does
    not use the outlier detection mechanism activates the alarm unit for the water
    deficit condition and sends a text message over LAN because the soil moisture
    value is less than the threshold value. However, smart DSS, which possesses outlier
    detection facility, easily handles this situation. Another debatable scenario
    for real-time DSS in the agricultural environment is the separation of the abrupt
    change that occurs because of the direct connection of water with a soil moisture
    sensor, as shown in Fig. 8 at time 15:30. The proposed algorithm handles this
    situation through a similar mechanism described for the detection of outliers.
    However, in this case, the temporarily stored value and the currently received
    value are identical or approximate each other. Both values are stored in the database
    without modification. FIGURE 7. A scenario of both outliers and abrupt change.
    Show All FIGURE 8. Outliers free scenario. Show All SECTION V. Issues Resolved
    During Proposed Experimental Setup During the deployment phase of the proposed
    testbed, various issues were identified and resolved. A. Packets Collision and
    Nodes Overhearing A sensor node uses a broadcasting mechanism to communicate with
    the gateway and other nodes in the network, thereby resulting in the collision
    of packets or reduction of throughput. Collision usually occurs due to the concurrent
    communication of sensor nodes deployed in close proximity or within the communication
    range of one another. In the proposed testbed, a simplified mechanism, namely,
    delay timers in wasp-mote boards, is used to avoid concurrent communication of
    sensor nodes and collision. Every experimental setup uses a sampling rate or a
    sensor node rate of transmission, which is 30 minutes in our case. The criteria
    for packet transmission of every node are adjusted according to the neighbor node
    communication schedules. For example, if nod e 1 begins communication with other
    nodes or the gateway at time 10:00:00, then its neighbor nodes must wait for the
    maximum propagation delay; that is, the time required for successful communication
    between the most widely separated nodes (approximately 5 seconds in the proposed
    experimental setup). Therefore, nod e 2 , a neighboring node of nod e 1 , must
    delay its communication for 3 seconds and start around 10:00:04 if its neighbors
    are not interested in transmission. However, this mechanism works only for a testbed
    in which a limited number of sensor nodes are used. For dense WSNs, other mechanisms,
    such as channelization, are utilized. Overhearing of a sensor node in WSNs exerts
    drastic effects on node lifetime and needs to be handled efficiently, particularly
    in highly dense networks. To avoid this problem, sensor nodes are placed in such
    a manner that each node has at most one path for communication with the gateway
    and does not hear other neighboring nodes where feasible. In our case, the problem
    was successfully solved through manual adjustment of the distance between sensor
    nodes. However, this method is useful only in the engineered setup of WSN only
    and is not feasible for random deployment. This technique introduces the path
    loss problem in large networks, but it is efficient for small networks. B. Crops
    Canopy Crop canopy is another important problem associated with the deployment
    of WSNs in agricultural fields, particularly orchards. Crop canopy affects the
    communication range of sensor nodes in a network and environmental parameters.
    During the initial phase of our project, the problem was not considered, and nodes
    were deployed randomly at different locations but within the direct communication
    range of the gateway module. However, only nod e 3 packets were received successfully,
    and the remaining node packets were lost due to crop canopy. Further analysis
    of the experimental setup and field was performed, and different alternatives
    were applied to resolve this issue. This thorough investigation led us to the
    problem of crop canopy and its effects on the communication range of sensor nodes
    because nod e 1 was in the direct line of sight with the sink node, whereas the
    other nodes were not. Obstacles or orange trees were also present. Therefore,
    nodes were deployed in the orange orchard in such a manner that each node was
    in the direct line of sight with its intended receiver node. Node deployment in
    direct line of sight does not necessarily mean that nodes are unable to communicate
    when obstacles exist between transmitting and receiving nodes. Nodes placed in
    the crop canopy can communicate, but their coverage area and transmission range
    are much smaller than those in the direct line of sight communication. Another
    issue caused by crop canopy was the effects on sensor node readings, particularly
    sensors that collect environmental data (e.g., temperature and humidity). In summer,
    nodes deployed in a shady region generate temperature readings of 40 °C– 44 °C,
    whereas sensors exposed to sunlight sense temperatures in a range of 44 °C– 49
    °C. To overcome this problem, 50% of the sensor nodes were deployed in direct
    sunlight, and the remaining nodes were placed in shady areas. C. Effects of Heavy
    Rain Heavy rain is vital to plant growth rate, particularly in summer when watering
    requirements are high. In traditional approaches, flooding/watering schedules
    are postponed due to heavy rain and particularly based on farmers’ experience.
    Therefore, the proposed DSS must handle this scenario in a manner similar to traditional
    approaches but without requiring an experienced farmer to monitor the system and
    judge its decisions. In the proposed DSS, the decision whether to irrigate or
    not is primarily based on soil moisture content and other supplementary parameters.
    In the case of heavy rain, soil moisture sensor readings exceed the threshold
    value, clearly indicating that the irrigation schedule must be deferred. Similarly,
    conducting specific case studies for every season is not needed because if soil
    moisture content values are above the threshold value, then irrigation is unnecessary.
    Additionally, the proposed system possesses the flexibility to adjust threshold
    values whenever required and can be used in different agricultural scenarios.
    D. WSNs Lifetime An important aspect of the applicability of WSNs in different
    application areas is their lifetime, which mostly relies on the onboard batteries
    of sensor nodes. Efficient utilization of available power resources increases
    WSN lifetime. In the proposed testbed, sensor nodes actively probe the environment
    for the shortest duration of 1 minute and then switch to sleep mode for approximately
    29 minutes. Every board conducts aggregation of the data collected by its sensors
    and merges the data into a single packet. The aggregation approach combines the
    data gathered through temperature, air humidity, soil moisture and leaf wetness
    sensors into a single data packet. The aggregation mechanism reduces the number
    of transmitted packets from 4 to 1, and individual packets for every sensor are
    attached to a wasp-mote board, thereby improving the lifetime of WSNs. Additionally,
    in the agriculture sector, particularly in the watering schedules of open field
    crops, collection of data once or even twice a day is appropriate or needed. Therefore,
    the sampling rate of deployed nodes must be decreased to 12 hours or more to further
    increase WSN lifetime. SECTION VI. Results and Discussion In the case of real-time
    data, the worst case complexity of the proposed outlier detection algorithm is
    O(1), whereas pattern anomaly value (PAV), MPAV, and rare pattern drift detector
    (RPDD) algorithms [37], [38] have complexities of O( n 2 ) , O(n) and O( n 2 +n)
    respectively. Hence, the proposed algorithm is the best solution among these algorithms
    for real-time DSS because it does not affect the functionality of DSS. Similarly,
    the proposed algorithm’s worst case complexity for a static dataset is O(n) ,
    where n represents size of the dataset. These algorithms were tested on real-time
    data obtained via our testbed deployed in an orange orchard. The performance of
    the algorithms in terms of computational time is presented in Fig. 9, which shows
    that the proposed algorithm outperformed contemporary schemes. Moreover, the performance
    of these algorithms was examined thoroughly by continuously increasing the dataset
    size. Unlike the proposed algorithm, the other schemes were inconsistent with
    the dynamically changing dataset. In the case of the real-time dataset, the computational
    time of the other algorithms was directly proportional to the size of the dataset,
    whereas the proposed algorithm was not affected. Moreover, the proposed algorithm’s
    memory requirements were fewer than those of the other algorithms. The implementation
    of these complex algorithms in real-time DSS required highly sophisticated and
    demanding technology, which is expensive, whereas the proposed algorithm worked
    well with existing technology. The algorithms were also tested on a static dataset,
    and their computation time is depicted in Fig. 10. Our algorithm’s performance
    was better than that of the other algorithms, particularly in terms of execution
    time. FIGURE 9. Computational time comparison on real time data set. Show All
    FIGURE 10. Computational time comparison on static data set. Show All The complexity
    of an algorithm is vital to its development, implementation, and execution in
    real-time systems. Complexity is directly proportional to algorithm accuracy and
    computation time. In real-time DSS specifically for the agriculture sector, an
    algorithm must be as accurate and simple as possible so the overall performance
    of DSS is unaffected. If the algorithm is accurate and precise but degrades the
    overall performance of the system, then it is useless. An accuracy comparison
    is presented in Fig. 11. Although the proposed algorithm’s accuracy is lower than
    that of the other algorithms, its effect on the overall performance of real-time
    DSS was smaller, and the algorithm works on a personal computer. Improving the
    accuracy and precision of an algorithm results in increased complexity, degradation
    of the overall performance of the real-time system, and inability to run efficiently
    on personal computers. FIGURE 11. DSS’s accuracy. Show All In addition to the
    real-time dataset, the algorithms were examined thoroughly by using benchmark
    datasets, as shown in Table 1. The execution time of the proposed algorithm was
    less than that of the other algorithms specifically for dynamic datasets. The
    proposed algorithm is an ideal candidate for an efficient real-time DSS. The precision
    and accuracy of these algorithms on the benchmark datasets are presented in Table
    2. Accuracy is described in terms of accurate decisions taken by DSS when these
    algorithms were implemented as a separate module to fine tune data before processing.
    The proposed algorithm is not precise for datasets that possess multi-valued noise,
    such as the FacesUCR dataset. However, when datasets have single-valued outliers
    only, the proposed algorithm is ideal. TABLE 1 Comparative Computation Time of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets TABLE 2 Comparative Accuracy of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets A real-time decision support system
    was designed in this study to facilitate farmers in various agriculture-related
    activities. Farmers will adopt a technology-assisted system if it has a simplified
    interaction paradigm, possesses a simple GUI, and provides the desired services.
    The proposed DSS possesses a user-friendly interface that is can be easily understood
    by inexperienced users and provides different services simultaneously, as shown
    in Fig. 12. FIGURE 12. A sample screen shot of the proposed system showing data
    of soil moisture sensor. Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The
    demand for efficient utilization of available water resources, specifically in
    the agriculture sector, is increasing daily due to water scarcity and global climate
    change. Therefore, technology-assisted irrigation mechanisms, sensors, and actuators
    must be realized in real agriculture environments. These approaches provide water
    upon demand and control water wastage. They are helpful in controlling water resources
    but exert drastic effects on plant growth rate and yield. In this work, we developed
    a technology-assisted outlier detection and decision support system (DSS) to facilitate
    irrigation, particularly flooding. The proposed system is highly precise because
    it uses an embedded outlier detection module that thoroughly examines the correctness
    of the collected data and forwards the data to DSS for further processing. DSS
    analyzes different parameters to identify water-deficient sites and reports them
    to farmers or generates an alarm. This system possesses a user-friendly interaction
    environment that makes it easy to use. In the future, we will further improve
    the accuracy of the proposed DSS by examining additional parameters and will enhance
    it to assist farmers in other agriculture-related activities, such as pesticide
    and fertilizer use and determination of soil properties. Furthermore, due to nodes
    un-availability and their security issues, the proposed scheme was evaluated only
    on three sensor nodes. As a future work, we will investigate the proposed algorithm
    on a large-scale. ACKNOWLEDGMENT All authors declare that they have no conflict

    of variance (ANOVA) identified water stressed and non-stressed plants from data
    of each study sensor, although spectral separation was higher when information
    from the sensors was combined. Our results revealed the potential of the sUAS
    to monitor water status in container-grown ornamental plants, although further
    analysis is needed to explore vegetation indices and data analysis algorithms.

  description: The messages of crop water deficit, soil moisture and field meteorology
    are the fundamental data to meet the needs of water saving, good quality and high
    yield in modern field irrigation management. Above all, it is very important to
    obtain these data at the same step in real time. A field monitoring system in
    real-time was presented which could support the data of crop canopy temperature,
    environment message and soil moisture at 1 h interval. It was powered by solar
    panel and controlled with a microprocessor to manage the data collection and storage.The
    configured sensors included infrared temperature, air temperature and humidity,
    soil water content, soil water potential and temperature. The infrared temperature
    sensor was installed at the end of the cantilever arm fitted on the upright stainless
    steel rod. It had a 45° inclination angle of the cantilever arm to scan the temperature
    of underlying surface. Each time, it collected multiple spot at 36° interval above
    the crop canopy and went back to the original location. Therefore, the average
    value of the canopy temperature would be more precise than that of the single
    detection. The rapid locking device could adjust the cantilever arm and sensors
    to the suitable position following the stainless steel rod, according to the need
    in different crop growth seasons. After the analysis of the monitoring data, all
    of these could describe the refined crop actual circumstance in the field and
    they can be used in irrigation decision-making and irrigation management. Moreover,
    how to separate reasonably the surface temperature occurred from infrared data
    scanned and determine the dependable threshold values of irrigation decision-making
    indexes, are the key points in the next step.

  description: Many agricultural activities can be highly enhanced by using digital

    Efficiency 1. Introduction Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy and,
    in many cases, in the survival of nations, since it provides the basic subsistence
    for the entire population of a country while at the same time it interacts with
    several other industries. Especially in rural areas, inhabitants depend on agriculture
    as it is critical not only for their nutrition but it also constitutes the base
    of all trade. Moreover, the ever increasing world population demands larger amounts
    of food which subsequently presupposes a well-managed and cost-effective agriculture.
    Throughout the world, irrigation is one of the main water consumers. Almost 60
    percent of all the world water, taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and wells,
    is used for the irrigation of. Without irrigation, crops would never have been
    grown in the deserts of California and Israel. Irrigation has been around for
    as long as humans have been cultivating plants. Even though the traditional way
    of pouring water on fields is still a common irrigation method, other more efficient
    and mechanized, methods are also used. One of the more popular mechanized methods
    is the centre-pivot irrigation system, which uses moving spray guns or dripping
    faucet heads on wheeled tubes that pivot around a central source of water. There
    are many irrigation techniques farmers use today, since there is always a need
    to find more efficient ways to use water for irrigation. Producers need to find
    more effective and efficient use of water resources while maintaining high crop
    yields. Some efforts to more efficiently utilize water for crop production are
    examined, Producers has to find more effective and efficient use of water resources
    while maintaining high crop yields. While the producers have to apply water to
    meet the needs of the crop, they must realize that with traditional management
    practices, yields and returns from the irrigated crop will be reduced as compared
    to a fully irrigated crop. Moreover, to properly manage the water for the greatest
    return, producers must have an understanding of how crops respond to water, how
    crop rotations can enhance irrigation management, and how changes in agronomic
    practices can influence the water needs. Water stress during critical times may
    result in low yields. Crops, such as corn, respond with more yields for every
    inch of water that the crop consumes as compared to other crops such as winter
    wheat or soybeans. However, crops, such as corn require more water for development
    or maintenance before any yield is produced. Corn requires approximately 10 in.
    of water to produce the first increment of yield as compared to 4.5 and 7.5 in.
    for wheat and soybeans respectively. The integration of automated procedures in
    agriculture increases the productivity as well as the quality of the products,
    thus fulfilling the ever increasing demand for healthy and inexpensive food around
    the world. However, an efficient automated system has to describe all the main
    processes that are involved in the agriculture chain. Plant cultivation, which
    can be considered as the most critical process, is affected by many factors such
    as the temperature, the humidity and the topography of the surrounding environment.
    Achieving ideal values for these factors and optimizing their consequences depend
    on the type of the crops cultivated. Thus, the design of an efficient irrigation
    system should consider these factors to achieve a successful and high quality
    harvest. For example, the process of grape maturation is affected by the photo-synthesis
    that produces the sugar that is stored in the grapes. In grapes, the balance among
    sugar, acid, pH and potassium is fundamental in determining the quality of the
    produced wine. This balance depends to a large extent on the frequency of the
    irrigation of the cultivated fields. The scientific discipline of Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSNs) has reached a point of maturity that it can provide accurate and
    highly effective services to farmers. Thus, WSNs should monitor the above described
    factors to achieve an improved harvest (Shu-ming et al., 2009). WSNs are able
    to rapidly capture process and transmit critical data in real time. The real-time
    data collected by sensors located in the cultivated fields may be used by experts
    or by automated systems to make decisions, such as which irrigation policy should
    be applied. Additionally, since a WSN does not require the deployment of wires,
    the need for human intervention is minimized. For these reasons, it is expected
    that WSNs will become a low cost yet effective approach for the monitoring of
    fields in the near future. Additionally, WSNs can be combined with a system that
    manages the water applied to each field based on the environmental conditions
    and on the feedback sent by the individual sensors. There are several advantages
    in using WSNs and automated decision systems in agriculture: • Improved estimation
    and planning of field irrigation based on the available water supply. • Minimization
    of the required human resources, time, and effort in the agricultural production.
    • Early detection of possible floods in the field that could be destructive for
    the crops and proper pumping of the water to mitigate such cases. • Better coordination
    between different working groups, i.e. farmers and technical assistants thanks
    to a clear division of responsibilities. • Creation of knowledge gathered from
    the deployed sensor networks for future applications in the agriculture domain.
    All the irrigation models that have been proposed so far do not use an agriculture
    model to calculate the quantity of water for irrigation. Moreover, they use WSNs
    to collect data from the area without considering the routing of data from the
    sensors to the base station, a technique that could provide improved energy efficiency.
    In this paper, we propose a system that takes into consideration the historical
    data and the change of the climate values to calculate the quantity of water that
    is needed for irrigation. In case that the change of the collected values is above
    a threshold more frequent data collection is proposed to be performed to minimize
    the necessary quantity of water. On the other hand, in case that the change of
    the values is below a preset threshold then the time interval to collect the data
    can increase to save sensor energy, leading to a prolonged sensor lifetime. In
    this paper an integrated architecture, based on the use of WSNs, for automated
    irrigation management is proposed that aims to achieve effective and prompt irrigation
    of parcels with great energy efficiency due to the utilization of a novel routing
    protocol. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work is
    presented. Section 3, describes the structure of the proposed system. Section
    4, presents the performance evaluation. In Section 5, the paper is concluded and
    areas of future work are presented. 2. Related work The work in the area of WSNs
    in agriculture is composed of two parts. The first part deals with the routing
    protocol used to minimize the energy consumption in WSNs, while the second part
    addresses the development of irrigation systems in agriculture that manage the
    water used for irrigation. 2.1. Energy efficient routing algorithms in WSNs There
    exist several proposals to develop protocols that consider the energy efficiency
    of sensors in their routing activities. In hierarchical networks, nodes are organized
    in clusters in which a node plays the role of a cluster head. The cluster head
    is responsible for coordinating activities within the cluster and for forwarding
    information between clusters. Clustering has the potential to reduce energy consumption
    and to extend the lifetime of the network, by achieving a high delivery ratio
    in a scalable manner. In agriculture, the network used may be rather large since
    it needs to cover the entire cultivated fields. Therefore, the hierarchical protocols
    may be suitable and beneficial for precision agriculture. In (Heinzelman et al.,
    2000) LEACH, a hierarchical protocol in which most nodes transmit to cluster heads,
    is presented. The operation of LEACH consists of two phases: • The Setup Phase.
    In the setup phase, the clusters are organized and the cluster heads are selected.
    Each node determines whether it will become a cluster head in this round by using
    a stochastic algorithm at each round. If a node becomes a cluster head once, it
    cannot become cluster head again after P rounds, where P is the desired percentage
    of cluster heads. • The Steady State Phase. In the steady state phase, the data
    is sent to the base station. The duration of the steady state phase is longer
    than the duration of the setup phase in order to minimize overhead. LEACH is a
    wireless distributed protocol that helps WSNs to use less energy. However, LEACH
    uses single-hop routing where each node can transmit directly to the cluster-head
    and the sink. Therefore, it is not recommended for networks that are deployed
    in large regions. PEGASIS is an energy efficient protocol (Lindsey and Raghavendra,
    2002) using a chain-based protocol and providing an improvement over LEACH. In
    PEGASIS each node communicates only with a nearby neighbour in order to send and
    receive data. It also takes turns (cluster head transmit after collecting data
    from all the nodes) transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount
    of energy spent per round. The nodes are organized in such a way as to form a
    chain, which can either be accomplished by the sensor nodes themselves, using
    a greedy algorithm starting from a certain node, or the Base Station (BS) can
    compute this chain and broadcast it to all the sensor nodes. TEEN is a hierarchical
    protocol designed for sudden changes in the sensed attributes, such as sudden
    drops in temperature due to frost (Manjeshwar and Agrawal, 2009). Responsiveness
    is an important attribute of time-critical applications, in which the network
    is operated in a reactive mode. The sensor network architecture in TEEN is based
    on a hierarchical grouping where closer nodes form clusters and this process goes
    to a higher level until the sink is reached. Even though TEEN works well in conditions
    like sudden changes in the sensed attributes, in large area networks and when
    the number of layers in the hierarchy is small, TEEN tends to consume a lot of
    energy, because of long distance transmissions. Moreover, when the number of layers
    increases, the transmissions become shorter and the overhead in the setup phase
    as well as in the operation becomes dominant. In (Lotf et al., 2008), a routing
    protocol for self-configuration and hierarchal routing, named ELCH, is presented.
    In this protocol, the sensors vote for their neighbours to elect suitable cluster
    heads. It combines the cluster architecture with multi-hop routing for the reduction
    of the total transmission energy. The above approaches take into consideration
    the energy consumption of the sensors in order to extend the lifetime of the network.
    However, since they are general purpose networks they do not take into account
    the principles, characteristics and requirements of the specific application that
    sensor networks are used for. All the aforementioned protocols try to minimize
    the energy consumption. However, they differ on the algorithm used. Most of these
    algorithms are based on the selection of the node having the higher residual energy
    in every cluster as the cluster head for the next round. Although, this consideration
    seems to be quite rational, there are many cases where its effectiveness is limited.
    For instance, in the cases where the node having the higher energy residues is
    positioned close to the border line of its cluster, significant amounts of energy
    are spent by the cluster nodes in order to transmit to their cluster head. 2.2.
    Automated irrigation in agriculture WSNs have been used for the automated irrigation
    of parcels (Rehman et al., 2011). These applications address the scarcity of water
    problem and the need of proper water management. This is achieved by providing
    water only to places where it is needed, while at the same time controlling the
    quantity of the consumed water. Various models, systems and methodologies for
    the irrigation of parcels have been developed. In (Diaz et al., 2011) a methodology
    to guide the development of applications for the agricultural domain based on
    WSNs is presented. This methodology divides the development of applications in
    agriculture in steps that gets an input, produces an output, and describes the
    procedures to be undertaken by a specific group of users. Specifically, the purpose
    of this methodology is to describe the life cycle of applications by identifying
    the responsibilities of the individual users. In (Stone et al., 1985), a computer-based
    monitoring system for continuous measurements of soil water potential is proposed
    and analyzed. This model measures the quantity of water during a period. The results
    are used to decide the quantity of water to be used for irrigation. Indirect estimates
    using direct measurements of the soil moisture are discussed in Zazueta and Smajstrla
    (1992). In this model the measurements of time in samples are used to estimate
    the quantity of water that is required for irrigation. Moreover, in Meron et al.
    (1995) a control system for apple tree irrigation management using densitometers
    is presented. In this model the water required for irrigation is measured using
    a soil sensor-actuated automatic irrigation system. Sensor actuation thresholds
    are optimized for high fruit yield and quality. In (Testezlaf et al., 1997) an
    automated irrigation control system for the management of greenhouse container
    plants is evaluated. The system consisted of soil moisture sensors, a hardware
    input/output interface, a computer with the relevant software and actuators. An
    evaluation of the control system is performed considering a greenhouse. The results
    show that the control system is reliable in applying water responding to the plant
    demands. Reliable measurements of the substrate water tension using sensors presented
    a major difficulty. In (Kim and Evans, 2009) the design of decision support software
    and its integration with an in-field WSN to implement site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation control via Bluetooth wireless communications is described. This model
    consists of machine conversion, localization, and mission planning. The first
    requirement is to convert a self-propelled irrigation machine from a conventional
    mechanical and hydraulic system to an electronically controllable system for individual
    sprinkler head control. Then, the geographic location of the irrigation machine
    is continuously monitored by a self-positioning system. Once the machine is controllable
    and accessible, mission planning decide the time to irrigate that each sprinkler
    head should apply at each location. In (Sudha et al., 2011), a TDMA-based medium
    access control (MAC) protocol is used to collect environmental data such as soil
    moisture and temperature of an irrigation system. The sensors are in the idle
    state and change to the active state to measure the temperature and the moisture
    level of the soil. The base station sends requests to nodes to collect the temperature
    and the moisture level of a particular area. A node responds to this request by
    sending back the present value of the moisture and the temperature of that region.
    The other nodes remain in the idle state. After sending the required data the
    node goes back to the idle state. This process is repeated for all the nodes.
    In using a direct communication method each sensor node sends its data directly
    to the base station. In addition to the above, there also exist some recent attempts
    to develop remote sensing and control systems for irrigation management using
    WSNs. In (Kim et al., 2008), a remote sensing and control of an irrigation system
    using a distributed WSN is described. The field conditions are monitored by sensor
    stations distributed across the field based on a soil property map, and they are
    periodically sampled and wirelessly transmitted to a base station. In (Xiaohong
    et al., 2009), a water-saving irrigation system based on fuzzy control technology
    and WSN is described. The node takes the soil moisture error and error change
    rate as its input and obtains the water demand amount of the crops under certain
    soil moisture conditions. In (Dubey et al.., 2011), a WSN based remote irrigation
    control system and automation using dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) code is described.
    The system uses signalling to control the water flow for sectored, sprinkler or
    drip section irrigation. In (Zhang et al., 2011), a calibration method for detecting
    soil water content based on information sharing is described. The system is an
    efficacious approach to determine the balance between the calibration accuracy
    of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production. All these attempts
    propose systems that are able to provide irrigation services to parcels without
    considering in depth the efficient management of the water used. 3. Overview of
    the proposed system The proposed system considers climate values, such as humidity,
    temperature and wind to calculate the quantity of water that is needed for proper
    irrigation. Also, when evaluating the climate parameters it considers past states
    and compares them to the current states to make efficient decisions. For example,
    if the value of the temperature in the previous day has decreased then less water
    is required. Based on the collected historical values the quantity required might
    be larger. Thus, water can be conserved in case of a high rate of change of these
    environmental values. The total complexity of the model is 2n + n, where n is
    the number of nodes in the cluster. The proposed automated irrigation management
    system, as mentioned above, aims at the automatic irrigation of parcels with possibly
    non-uniform composition like the one shown in Fig. 1, which comprises of five
    neighbouring parcels having different crops. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Neighbouring parcels hosting different kinds of crops. The proposed automated
    irrigation management system comprises of two subsystems. The first subsystem
    concerns the WSN which collects the data from the cultivated fields, as shown
    in Fig. 2a. The second subsystem involves the decision making system, the flow
    chart of which is depicted in Fig. 2b. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    2. (a) The proposed WSN architecture, (b) the flow chart of the proposed decision
    making system. The proposed WSN structure includes a set of sensors that monitor
    the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the temperature and the
    speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day. The individual sensors
    are placed at appropriate locations in the parcels. The collected information
    is transmitted to a base station. More specifically, the sensors at the field
    scan the weather conditions periodically (for example every 10 s). The collected
    data are sent via wireless (for example, a ZigBee radio transmitter) to the base
    computer at the receiver. The sensors are self-powered by a battery. A set of
    sensors is used to measure air humidity and temperature. Also humidity sensors
    are used to measure soil moisture content and wind speed. Moreover, specialized
    sensors are used to measure the flooding water levels. The main application is
    based on the collected inputs it receives from the sensors. It then, acts based
    on the configuration that is applied to the system. This configuration is based
    on the requirements for the place that needs to be monitored. This is related
    to the type of crops that are planted in the field (corn, potatoes, etc.), the
    chemical soil components (i.e. sodium content) and the season of the year (i.e.
    winter, summer etc). This system can be used by growers, who want to monitor the
    status of soil moisture content and watch on their computer monitor the conditions
    at various locations, follow the weather information and monitor in detail the
    irrigation operation. During the irrigation, they may also want to see the current
    location of irrigation. For example, if a rain shower passes over the field, the
    software should be able to automatically adjust the amount of water being applied.
    In the proposed system, the routing protocol that is used to send traffic from
    the information sources to the destination assumes the coexistence of a base station
    and, without loss of generality, of a set of homogeneous sensor nodes. These nodes
    are randomly distributed within a delimited area of interest. The base station
    is located at a long distance away from the sensor field. Both the base station
    and the set of sensor nodes are considered stationary. The base station is able
    to transmit with high enough power to all the network nodes, due to its unlimited
    power supply. Moreover, the sensors are hierarchically organized into clusters.
    3.1. The irrigation and decision making system In agriculture, the efficient management
    of water should be considered. Therefore, the water required for irrigation has
    to be minimized. The proposed system based on the information sent from the sensors
    estimate the quantity of water needed. The sensors are used to send to the base
    station the humidity and the temperature of the soil, the humidity, the temperature
    and the speed of the air, and the duration of sunshine per day. The proposed system
    based on these values calculates the water quantity for irrigation. Moreover,
    to develop a more accurate system the historical data regarding the quantity of
    irrigation used in previous period are considered to adjust the quantity of water
    that is needed for irrigation. A comparison between current and past states is
    necessary to arrive at optimum decisions. The main parameters that affect the
    surface runoff are the following: the climate (rainfall intensity, moisture content,
    wind, evaporation) and the type of vegetation. An important factor for the implementation
    of an irrigation system is the knowledge of the soil moisture at the beginning
    of the growing season, which depends mainly on the weather conditions during the
    preceding winter. Additionally, the knowledge of the water quantity stored in
    underground aquifers, which is available for plants through the capillary rise,
    is critical. In order to reach a decision for the irrigation needs of a particular
    parcel, it is necessary to add up the useful water from the rain (Pe), the change
    in the stored moisture (SM) in the soil root zone at the beginning of the germination
    period, the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the water that by capillary elevation
    reaches the crop rooting zone from the ground (GW) – all these are measured in
    kg/m2 day. If the soil is cohesive, the water can easily rise above the ground
    level, but the rate of capillary rise is slow. On the contrary, if the soil is
    light, then the height of the capillary rise is limited, but the pace of growth
    is fast. If these rates are sufficient to meet the water needs of the plant there
    is a steady development of the crop and the following holds: (1) If these water
    sources cannot meet the water needs of the crops for normal growth, the water
    balance is in deficit. To achieve a smooth development and a normal yield, the
    crops should be provided with a quantity of water (IRn) equal to this deficit:
    (2) where ETc is expressed as follows: (3) kc is the crop coefficient and ETo
    is the reference evapotranspiration in kg/m2 day that is expressed as follows:
    (4) where Ra is the theoretical solar radiation expressed as equivalent depth
    of evaporated water in mm d−1, Tmean is the mean air temperature in °C and TD
    is the difference between maximum and minimum air temperature in °C. Pe is presented
    as follows: (5) where Pt is the total precipitation in kg/m2 day and D is the
    decline allowed in the soil moisture content until the next irrigation dose is
    applied. The function f(D) is an adaptation factor that equals 1 when D = 75 kg/m2
    day, whilst for every other value of D f(D) is expressed as follows: (6) The SM
    contribution is significant in a water balance model for net crop requirements.
    The soil moisture is controlled by a combination of climate properties, land surface
    model characteristics and land–atmosphere interaction. GW contributes to the partial
    coverage of net the crop water requirements, through capillary elevation. The
    extent of the capillary elevation depends on the soil characteristics and the
    distance to the water table. In this paper, the main focus is on the use of a
    WSN to collect data using sensors and to send the data to a database. Then the
    sensed data can be used by a system for the automated irrigation of the fields.
    Therefore, in this paper Pe, SM, GW are not further analyzed. It is assumed that
    their values are provided by appropriate tensiometer sensors. Therefore, Pe, SM,
    GW are considered to sum up to a value k as presented in the following: (7) In
    this framework we consider k to be equal to the total amount of rain in this area
    expressed in kg/m2 day. Nevertheless, the value of the evapotranspiration (ETc)
    that is used to describe the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the
    land surface to the atmosphere is calculated based on information provided by
    sensors located in the fields. Evaporation is related to the amount of water that
    is sent to the air from sources such as soil, canopy interception and waterbodies.
    Transpiration is the amount of water in a plant and the subsequent loss of water
    as vapor through the stomata in its leaves. The rate of evapotranspiration depends
    on climatic factors (i.e. on temperature, sunlight, wind speed, and humidity).
    Therefore, an increase in the temperature in the wind speed or in the amount of
    sunlight results to a corresponding increase of evapotranspiration. On the other
    hand, humidity has the opposite effect. The models used in the literature to estimate
    the water quantity are categorized in empirical, computational and combinational.
    The empirical relationships are based on air temperature (Hargreaves, 1974, Thornthwaite
    and Hare, 1965). They only require as input the value of the air temperature and
    calculate the water without using other parameters, such as moisture or wind speed.
    Moreover, they are based on the mean values of temperature and may provide limited
    results if the period of use is less than a month. The computational models are
    based on the solar radiation (Caprio, 1974, Idso et al., 1977). They use the value
    of the radiation during the day to estimate the water without considering other
    parameters as moisture or temperature. They may have limited performance if the
    parcels are on a hill. The computational models may provide more accurate results
    as they consider all the environmental parameters to estimate the water for irrigation.
    In (Monteith, 1965), a combination model for the water based on parameters as
    temperature, moisture and wind speed is proposed. This model is general and does
    not consider the kind of crops in the estimation process of the required water.
    In (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977), a model that is an improvement of the model in
    Monteith (1965) and it is based on the kind of crops is proposed. However, both
    models offer high complexity and are difficult to use in case of frequent changes
    on the parameters. Therefore, in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) a model that is based
    on the previously proposed models but is more flexible due to its low complexity
    is proposed. This model does not use the resistance of the surface to estimate
    the water. In this paper, the model proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) for
    the calculation of evapotranspiration is used. The evapotranspiration according
    to this model is calculated as follows: (8) where αe is a fixed value and is considered
    to be equal to 1.3. Δ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is
    calculated based on the information from sensors on the air temperature and the
    saturation pressure of water as follows: (9) where T is the air temperature and
    es is the soil temperature expressed as follows: (10) γ represents the air cool
    factor that depends on the air speed at 2 m height and it is calculated by the
    sensor as follows: (11) where u2 is the air speed at 2 m height. Rn expresses
    the total net radiation energy that depends on microwave radiation that is sent
    from the sensor. (12) where Sn is the algebraic sum of the incoming minus the
    reflected microwave radiation and Ln is the net microware radiation. Both these
    values are based on the soil and air humidity values reported by the sensors.
    The parcels are categorized based on the geographical, topological and climate
    information as well as on the type of crops cultivated in them. In Fig. 1, we
    see an example where five different parcels with different crops are monitored.
    The parcels are then divided into clusters and the sensors are allocated in each
    cluster. For example, parcel A can be divided into two clusters. Then, based on
    the above mentioned characteristics of each cluster and on the real time data
    collected by the sensors the quantity of the water needed (QWi) at cluster i is
    calculated using the following equations: (13) (14) The values of the above equations
    are collected by the sensors that are located in the parcels. The proposed system
    to save water for irrigation makes an adjustment on the quantity of water as calculated
    in (14) based on the information reported by the sensors. The system considers
    the mean value of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the
    temperature and the speed of air, as well as the duration of the sunshine hours
    per day for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, the
    mean value of the water quantity used in previous periods is calculated as follows:
    (15) where Δ′ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is calculated
    based on the information in previous periods of the air temperature and the saturation
    pressure of the water. γ′ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind
    speed at 2 m height that is collected in the previous period. Rn′ expresses the
    total net radiation energy that depends on the microwave radiation that is sent
    from previous period. Moreover, the ratio of change on the values during the last
    days is calculated as follows: (16) where Δ″ symbolizes the curve slope of the
    vapor saturation and is calculated based on the information collected during the
    last days regarding the air temperature and the saturation pressure of the water.
    γ″ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind speed at 2 m height
    during the previous days. Rn″ expresses the total net radiation energy that depends
    on microwave radiation during the previous days. Therefore, the quantity of water
    needed for irrigation (QWrequired) is calculated as follows: (17) If no historical
    values are available, the proposed system can be adjusted to use only the information
    provided by the real time values from sensors. 3.2. Case study It is important
    to consider the mean values of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity,
    the temperature and the speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day
    for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, their mean
    values for a specific area during the same month in previous years could provide
    indication on the environmental conditions. These mean values combined with the
    real time values collected by the sensors could provide better results for the
    water quantity required for irrigation. The proposed model is considered as an
    improvement to the one proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) as it estimates
    the water for irrigation based on the previous values collected by sensors. An
    example that proves the efficient management of water by the system is the case
    that for a specific field the mean water required for irrigation based on (14)
    is 10 kg/m2 per day. This quantity of water can be minimized if historical data
    are considered. If historical data are used, then the mean value for irrigation
    could be less than the current measurements. If the value is 5 kg/m2 the water
    that will be used for irrigation will be less than the current amount (using (14))
    and it can be calculated as follows: (18) Therefore, there is no need for irrigation
    when historical data are used but there is a need to pump out water. Thus, water
    can be managed more efficiently. Moreover, in case that the mean ratio of change
    of the water required for irrigation the previous month is −1 and the current
    water required for irrigation is 10 kg/m2 then less water is required for irrigation
    (see Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. The detailed values of the quantity of water

    the proposed model is evaluated using ECHERP, a protocol that pursues energy conservation
    (Nikolidakis et al., 2013). ECHERP is a scheme that is based on the appropriate
    selection of nodes as cluster heads. It models the network and the energy spent
    to transmit data from sensors to base station, as a linear system. Then, using
    the Gaussian elimination algorithm it selects the cluster heads of the network.
    Its main characteristic is that it elects as cluster head the node that minimizes
    the total energy consumption on the cluster. Based on the energy level and location
    information that the nodes send, each node sets up a neighbour information table
    and sends this table along with its corresponding information to its neighbours.
    This information is sent to the BS that runs a Gaussian elimination algorithm
    to compute the number of rounds at which every node can be a cluster head, trying
    to maximize the network lifetime. The BS broadcasts the unique IDs of the newly
    selected cluster heads and their cluster members and the nodes use this information
    to enter a cluster. The lower level cluster head aggregates the data and then
    transmits the compressed data to the upper lever cluster heads until the data
    reaches the base station. The sensor nodes placed in a WSN have the responsibility
    of the event detection, data processing and transmission of data. The energy spent
    on these actions has to be minimized as the nodes are battery equipped and thus
    have limited energy. The notation of rounds is used to describe the successful
    send of data from sensors to the BS. Therefore, one round is the one-time data
    send from all sensors to the BS. The energy ETx(k,d) that a node dissipates for
    the radio transmission of a message of k bits over a distance d is due to running
    both the transmitter circuitry ETx-elec(k) and the transmitter amplifier ETx-amp(k,d)
    and is given by the following: (21) where Eelec is the transmitter circuitry dissipation
    per bit, which is supposed to be equal to the corresponding receiver circuitry
    dissipation per bit and εamp is the transmit amplifier dissipation per bit per
    square meter. Moreover, in case that the node distance from the base station is
    d, it is more efficient to split this distance including a few nodes in the middle.
    In case that d = d1 + d2 + d3, then . Thus the ETx(k,d) reaches its minimum value.
    Similarly, the energy ERx(k) dissipated by a node for the reception of a k bit
    message is due to running the receiver circuitry ERx-elec(k) and is given by:
    (22) In order to evaluate the performance of ECHERP, simulations over 50 different
    100 m × 100 m network topologies were performed. The general network architecture
    considered is the following: • A fixed base station is located away from the sensor
    nodes. • The sensor nodes are energy constrained with a uniform initial energy
    allocation. • Each node senses the environment at a fixed rate and always has
    data to send to the base station. • The sensor nodes are immobile. • The network
    is homogeneous and all nodes are equivalent, i.e. they have the same computing
    and communication capacity. • The network is location unaware, i.e. the physical
    location of the nodes is not known in advance. • The transmitter can adjust its
    amplifier power based on the transmission distance. In all the simulation scenarios
    we examined 100 homogeneous nodes with an initial energy of 3 J, randomly scattered
    within a 100 × 100 m2 sensor field. The BS was positioned at point (0,150), so
    it is at least 100 m away from the centre of the field and the packets sent are
    36 bytes. The energy consumption due to communication is calculated using the
    first order energy model (Heinzelman et al., 2000). We assume that each sensor
    node generates one data packet per round to be transmitted to the BS. The sensor
    nodes were grouped into clusters consisting of cluster heads that send data to
    upper level cluster heads to finally reach the BS. Fig. 7 shows the number of
    nodes that remain alive when LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP are applied. More precisely,
    the depletion of all the network nodes in LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP takes place during
    the 800th, 980th and 995th rounds respectively. Download : Download full-size

    to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a number of simulations using
    different values of time required for a round have been considered. In the simulation
    tests the trade-off between the time of a round and the water required is defined.
    The main objective of this model is to keep the energy consumption of the nodes
    in low level while having more accurate measurements from sensors on the water
    required. The total water required for irrigation is expressed as follows: (23)
    where Total Water represents the quantity of water required based on the irrigation
    model presented in (17). Mean Water represents the average value of the water
    required when different values of time for a round are considered. Moreover, the
    round represents the number of times that the exchange of data from sensors to
    base station is performed. The quantity of water required for irrigation is calculated
    as follows: (24) Based on the above formulas simulation tests were performed to
    calculate the quantity of water required and the lifetime of the network for various
    values of round time ranging from 10 to 230 s. In all the tests it was assumed
    that the duration of the network lifetime was equal to 995 rounds. The simulation
    results are summarized in Table 6. Therefore if a round in ECHERP is equal to
    110 s energy efficiency is provided while smaller quantities of water are consumed.
    5. Conclusions This paper focused on the issue of automated irrigation in agriculture
    and proposed a novel system for efficient irrigation using WSNs. The proposed
    system is based on a model which performs efficient irrigation management by finding
    the appropriate schemes for the rational utilization of water for irrigation.
    The automated irrigation system proposed is based on the use of a novel routing
    protocol named ECHERP. The utilization of this protocol offers remarkable energy
    efficiency. The development of novel systems, like the one proposed in this paper,
    which combines efficient irrigation models along with energy efficient utilization
    of WSNs shows to be a very promising and effective application of automation in
    agriculture. The proposed model can be further extended to consider the effect
    of the field characteristics on the quantity of water required for irrigation.
